1623730,Palworld,"In short, it's very addictive and overall fun game. Also I will preface that you should not expect to in the game guns blazing - you will need to advance your levels till you can craft a gun and not all Pals can use a gun, actually most can't.
It's a great mix between a survival game and a monster collector game. While it obviously has same elements as most other P named monster collector games, I would say Palworld has it's own identity and gameplay and it's own legs to stand on.

I definitely thought it's a meme game before I got to test it during network test access and I was completely blown away with how it beat all my expectations to the point it's instant buy for me.

There is some lore, but it's mostly hidden and scattered throughout the game in text form. Don't expect much story from it or some quests, treat this as a survival game.

UI is a bit lacking, but you get used to it.

Pal models are great to the point that I can't choose what to have in my limited main team because of how cool all the later level pals look.

1623730,Palworld,"What a banger of a surprise drop this is, but I'm sure you've already heard something about this game - hell its even already made it to the top of the steam charts and its been out for less than a week, so let me throw out some opinions and read on and see if this game suits you;

If you're a Pokemon fan, you may or may not have been disappointed with the franchise's latest releases, and while this may not have the evolutions and trainer battles you crave, it certainly scratched that cool and cute animal collector itch for me.

If you're a fan of Ark, this game has a very similar gameplay loop - harvest mats, fight beasties(Pals), level up to increase your stats and unlock new technology, repeat. I believe the devs are also working towards implementing PVP, which will increase the ""Arkness"" tenfold.

If you're a gamer whose been burned year after year buying $40, $50, $60, and now even $70 games, rest assured in knowing that this game, despite being in early access, shows a considerable amount of polish and has quite a bit of content, for the low low price of $30. If you follow the dollar-per-hour guideline, you can easily hit and surpass that ratio with this game. Whats more worth it, 1 copy of Starfield, or 3 copies of Palworld? They have about the same amount of content, but one is still being developed AND has multiplayer.

You may have also heard some of the grumblings on the internet that inevitably follow when anything in this cut-throat industry gains success, there's plenty of developers out there shilling their dogshit opinions mirroring the events that followed Baldur's Gate 3's release - Ignore them, they are pissed that such a simple yet lovable game has gained so much traction, and heres hoping it'll spur them (I'm imaging game-freak and Nintendo, but you can imagine whichever company you deem fit) into action again. Some people are even so salty they are trying to claim the game outright steals Pokemon designs and used AI to produce the pals, Afaik, this game has been in development for like 3-4 years or so, which makes it older than the current AI craze we've seen over the last year. As for Pokemon designs being stolen, sure there's some resemblance, but that's because just like Pokemon, it uses real animals for inspiration for the most part. Believe it or not, this world is large enough for there to be multiple fantasy games with weird penguin things and it not be considered ""ripping off Pokemon"".

1623730,Palworld,"Most of my game time is on Gamepass since i have friends in both places but mostly play on there.

I wonder what Game Freak and the Poke'mon Company must be thinking right about now. About how this game just took the world by storm as something with clear and present MAJOR parallels to their work. About how something new and refreshing has been desperately needed from the franchise for years now and this game just came and ate their lunch. it's too soon to tell if Palworld will be able to rise to the challenge of being as great as it has the potential to be, but it couldn't have asked for a better foundation. The following will be more of a first impressions and a wishlist for what should come in the future. Palworld is VERY Early Access, especially on GamePass where it's a few versions behind Steam, and writing a formal review for such a game is silly.

At it's core, Palworld is no different than the likes of Ark. You level up and gain points you can put into new recipes and skill points to increase health, carry weight, damage dealt and so on. You start with nothing and collect rocks and twigs off the ground to build your first bit of gear and then set off to build a base. You even beat creatures near to death and then tame them. All the familiar trappings are here, and the execution is solid but could use some polish. 

The difference, of course, is in the aforementioned clear and present parallels to everyone's favorite children's JRPG starring adorable anime creatures. Pals are, without question, the best thing about Palworld for a myriad of reasons. Just like in Poke'mon you can make apparatuses to catch Pals, and a Paldex to keep track of the ones you've seen and caught, and the addictive ""gotta catch 'em all!"" feeling is here in full force and it feels great to do it in a game that feels decidedly different from what is essentially the same game we've been getting for years. But another one of those reasons is the acknowledgement that the initial Poke'mon audience in the days of Blue/Red/Yellow Version are grown adults. Palworld isn't afraid to tackle some of the more grim and darker topics surrounding our cute and cuddly friends that Poke'mon halfheartedly tried to do with Black & White but ultimately, in my opinion, failed to really do anything with. 

The game also does suffer a bit from tonal issues that can hopefully be cleaned up. I get the feeling the idea is that you as the player are meant to make the choice for yourself, will you abuse your Pals for your own selfish ends, or will you find a better way that doesn't involve you being a piece of human trash. But this doesn't come through clearly, and it's hard to tell if Pocketpair are making fun of Poke'mon for not doing this, are memeing in their own game about these more grim topics, or are genuinely trying to tell a darker story than Poke'mon is willing to and just aren't there yet. I hope it's the latter most option and we see development occur that pushes this idea further. The game also seems to suffer from a lack of identity. Beyond the designs of the Pals, you can see a lot of influence in other games taken and placed here. This ranges from the aesthetics of the HUD (The Breath of the Wild temperature meter) to things that exist in the game world. One of the game's field bosses (a Penking) is trapped in a straight up Evergaol from Elden Ring. There's also a church that bares a striking resemblance to a location in Limgrave, and the gigantic tree that can be seen in the north gives me Erdtree vibes. The mining animation is straight from Fortnite, the list goes on and you get the idea. I'd like to see Palworld move towards it's own unique style. It's ok to make references and easter eggs and homages and I actually love the idea that the Evergaol boss is a thing. But there's a difference in making an homage and ripping off of another work, and right now Palworld does feel somewhat like it's leaning to the latter, especially with Elden Ring (I don't care that some of the Pals look all too similar to actual Poke'mon, when Game Freak and The Poke'mon company develop some respect for their aging IP and actually do something interesting then we'll talk, for now they're just sitting on what are essentially unused assets and wasted potential).

A lot of what I think would be good additions have already been mentioned by the devs; arena fights, bosses that require Guilds to take down together, and updates to existing systems all sound good. Beyond that, seeing more of this world wouldn't go amiss, new maps like Ark that become available once you've beaten the bosses and more civilization wouldn't hurt either (there's at least one small village in the game you can visit).

I'm recommending Palworld because that's the best chance it has for success, for everyone to jump in and give voice to what they want to help make this game realize it's potential. And it's success would be important not only to it, but also to Poke'mon. Game Freak and The Poke'mon company have no incentive to take any kind of risk, to do really anything other than continue to pump out the same tired JRPG every two years like they've been doing since I was roughly 7 years old, with very little in the way of meaningful change. That CAN change, but only if they're given a reason to do so.

1623730,Palworld,"Grab this game! Let me put it this way, if Nintendo knew what they were doing and listened to people other than themselves, they'd be releasing the 5th version of this game by now, and they still wouldn't come close to something so full featured.

This is a survival craft, automation, monster hunting, creature taming, 3rd person shooter, RPG. It can be played single player, which is a very relaxing to fairly challenging and tense experience depending on how you set up your world. It can also be played in teams of up to 4 on a server of up to 32, though these numbers will be bumper in the future.
With the amount of content this game has right now, January 21st, in an early access release, I can comfortably say most triple a studios should be at the top of your ""ignore and only purchase on sale"" list.

Plus some day this game will allow the steam workshop. You cannot imagine how amazing that will be until you've sunk a dozen or so hours into even it's current state.

Just go buy it. You absolutely won't regret it.

General impressions and information regarding the content for Early Access:
-Level cap at level 25. After reaching level 25, you receive 0 XP, which can demotivate further grinding, but it takes time to reach it.
-Altar cap at level 6. The last Altar unlocks a very small section of the desert biome where enemies can be level 30.
-The winter biome is unavailable in early access.
-The surrounding fauna changes depending on the biome, but enemies or mini-bosses not (I'm talking about bandit camps. It would be nice to see diversity in this aspect in the future).
-Temples of the Sun, etc., add a very interesting puzzle aspect to the game, giving depth and a pleasant feeling of exploration.
-Waiting for some resources to craft can take 10 minutes, which I believe artificially extends the game time.
-Boss fights are often engaging and give off a very Soulslike atmosphere due to the difficulty level and combat system.
-The building system is enjoyable, although initially it may seem clunky.
-Lack of ability to change enchants or enchant armor. Considering how rarely we are able to find new equipment (not talking about crafting), such a feature should be available, and I also hope this will change in the future.
-Exploring the map is fun. Finding villages, resources, interesting locations creates the impression that behind every hill, we can discover some interesting point. The world definitely gives the impression of authenticity.
-The lack of physics when cutting down trees or destroying surfaces can detract from immersion.
-Skill tree could offer better and more useful skills.

Despite numerous flaws or unmet expectations in several areas, for an early access game and at a reasonable price, I consider it worth recommending for those who enjoy games like Valheim. There are clear inspirations from Dark Souls, Zelda, and Valheim, but this does not hinder the game from delivering fun.

1203620,Enshrouded,"A friend of mine gifted me a copy of this game. 

At the time of writing of this review, I've put about 50 hours into this game. 

Here are the Pros: 
The game is beautiful. The building, is simple, but very fun. Homes can be as complex or as basic as you want. While I believe that Valheims building was vastly more complex, not every game needs to have building like Valheims. I can still make my grandiose homes with ease in Enshrouded. 

I enjoy the Souls-Like stamina based combat. As well as the perk/skill tree. And the lore is fantastic. I'm a lore junkie and I LOVE archaeological storytelling which this game has in spades. 

The map is massive, and filled with so much to do. It's rare to find dead zones on the map. I'm always stumbling across enemies to fight, mats to farm, and ruins to explore. 

The Shroud mechanic is great. 

The performance of the game is excellent too. I have had zero crashes, lag, screen tearing, none of it. 

I've discovered less than a handful of bugs, which is unheard of for an Early Access game. 

Oh, and finally, the Glider is a BLAST to use. I get massive amounts of enjoyment out of flying all across the map with the glider. 

The Cons: 

Magic and Ranged are so overpowered it's not even funny. I'm a Tank main, so I was very excited to see that there were perks/skills for Tanking. Except that Melee players get completely shit on the farther you go into the game. Despite massive levels of Con, and Armor, I don't feel any Tankier than I did when I started the game in rags. So the classes need more balancing, badly. 

The AI is very stupid, and extremely easy to cheese. Just get a little bit of elevation and you are untouchable. 

The difficulty spikes are quite unbalanced. You go from feeling insanely overpowered, to hitting like a wet noodle and getting deleted when an enemy looks at you. *Glares are the poison coated dual-wielding enemies* 

There's punishing difficulty, and then there is unbalanced difficulty. I want the former, but currently it's the latter. 

The parry timing is inconsistent. I parried the world in Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring. I Mikiri Countered my way through Sekiro. I think I'm qualified to judge the timing on this games parries. Lol

Conclusion: 

The game is one of the best Early Access games I have ever had the privilege to play. The devs know what they're doing and are consistently pushing out hotfixes and updates. 

Enshrouded is vastly more polished than most AAA games that release these days, it's massive, filled with content, and very fun to play. 

For the asking price, you will definitely get your monies worth and hours upon hours of content.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Let me gain xp from building.

I am the Base mommy, my friends go out and I stay behind and build mighty castles from which we operate. I don't know if it's a terrible idea, I want to be able to keep up somewhat with them whilst building! Please tell me if this is a dumb idea!

Edit: This is a list of the suggestions of all the smart sausages and base mommy's in the comment section! (the biggest issue they adress is people abusing base building to boost xp)

1. [u] Stanleys [/u] and [u] Arch-_-Angelos [/u] were the first people to mention true XP sharing. Where everyone gets 1:1 xp conversion. Like Baldurs Gate 3! 

2. [u] GrimTactics [/u] suggested a daily xp cap for building. Meaning builders can still get some juicy xp, whilst stopping exploiters from going hog-wild.

3. [u] Rhys [/u] takes it a step further! He had the idea of introducing an item set that disables the wearers personal xp gain, but whilst home, they gain xp at the same rate as the adventurer who has the other item.

4. [u] Lord Vorian [/u] as the most thought out method I reckon. They suggest an xp reward for every amount of material spend building. Meaning destroying and replacing something still nets the same amount of total material spend, therefor not rewarding any additional xp.

[i] This one is interesting, it is still subject to some cheekiness, but anyone would still need to farm the resources, no matter if they just make a solid cube base somewhere purely for the xp it's their choice if they desire to spend resources in that manner. It also encourages serious players to build bigger, more grandiose bases, which I personally see as a huge win! [/i]

5. [u] Pepito [/u] had the idea of an xp collecting scroll, or perhaps gem, which explorers could ferry around, having it accumulate experience, so they may give it to builders so they can absorb the collected xp.

6. [u] Faris [/u] mentions reducing material returns from deconstructing and the server settings argument. Player freedom or the game dev's vision? Which is more important? He's also made my aware my head is, in fact, a Tomato. I am profoundly discombobulated.

7. And finally [u] mont3000 [/u], claims a slow xp trickle, which initiates after spending 15/30 minutes building would do the trick.

Awesome suggestions everyone! I am already starting to like the character of the community.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Valheim comparisons, in general, aren't doing anyone any favors. I purchased V Rising because of all the reviewers calling it ""Valheim with vampires"". V Rising isn't remotely like Valheim, and I couldn't squeeze even 2 hours out of it. Valheim has good game mechanics, but a significant reason for its mesmerizing immersion is its art style. The musical score could inspire Dvorak or Mendelssohn, the subtle pixelation combined with masterful lighting makes it less like computer animation than impressionistic painting, and the creature design looks like it was taken from a 9th century tome. Only a shameless copy could hope to re-evoke the same feelings.

Enshrouded is instead its own game. The graphics are appealing, reminiscent of Immortals Fenix Rising. The voxel building & landscaping is innovative and fun. The map is interesting and large (although EA boundaries are discovered pretty quickly). If you want to explore a new world, or if you want to engage in veratile base building, Enshrouded may be for you. It is quite good. And the shroud mechainc I find quite compelling.

There are some immersion breakers, which hopefully will get addressed during EA. First, resource respawning is way too quick and without variation, much like Conan Exiles. Your character in the early game (which is all I know) seems overpowered. Mobile assets like animals and bosses frequently get stuck quivering in complex landscapes. You can't drop inventory items, but istead must delete them. The day-night transitions are beautiful, but seem too rapid. 

I find many of the criticisms less than generous, considering this is early access and not intended to be a Valheim clone. Even with its problems I find it more compelling than most AAA titles that debut at 2x the price.

[u][b]1/26/2024 Edits Below[/b][/u]
--------------------------------------

After 20+ hours of play I've included some observations below.  It's quite clear as originally indicated the game has a lot in common with Valheim.  While there are some differences, overall if you liked Valheim you'll probably enjoy playing Enshrouded.  In addition, if there were things you didn't like about Valheim, there are also things you won't like about Enshrouded.

[b][i]Some Noteable Similarities:[/i][/b]
[list]
[*]Some recipes get discovered by acquiring a material or crafting item for the first time.
[*]A significant portion of gear/technology progression is tied to the elimination and looting of bosses.
[*]In combat, generally speaking the player wants to avoid facetanking enemies.  Blocking/parrying/dodging are a good idea even in 1 vs 1 engagements due to the relatively high damage of some enemies.
[*]Consuming food is for buffs and health/stamina regeneration.  The player won't die standing still and not eating (i.e. no hunger/thirst mechanic).
[*]Getting the rested buff by being in the presence of fire and comfort items in a sheltered area.
[/list]

[b][i]Some Noteable Differences:[/i][/b]
[list]
[*]The player can build with very small blocks of all building type materials, allowing for a much more refined final creation.  Building has no structure integrity in Enshrouded.
[*]Enemy difficulty is based on levels and there aren't champion/elite variants in Enshrouded.
[*]Enemies don't respawn in the presence of the player in Enshrouded.
[*]Progression in Enshrouded is tied to both boss killing and NPC crafter acquisition and subsequent quests (to collect crafting related items so you can make additional workstations).
[*]Player growth in Valheim is largely influenced by skill-ups but in Enshrouded it's from leveling, ability points and upgrading the Flame Altar.
[*]Valheim is significantly more visually atmospheric when compared to the non-shrouded areas in Enshrouded.  The weather effects and biome specific lighting are top notch in Valheim.  Outside of the shroud in Enshrouded there aren't weather effects like rain and storms, it's either light during day or dark during night with a small sunrise/sunset transition in between as appropriate.
[*]There's a significant amount of lore notes and quests in Enshrouded as opposed to the handful of objectives you get in Valheim.
[*]Enshrouded's map isn't procedurally generated.  I've noticed the design of the POIs is a bit more involved and the traversal/exploration based puzzles associated with them are pretty satisfying to solve.
[*]There are no PvE raids in Enshrouded like there are in Valheim.
[*]Don't appear to be set-bonuses for armor in Enshrouded.
[*]Seems more convenient to get gear upgrades by finding high rarity drops in the world and upgrading them with runes rather than crafting in Enshrouded.  Perhaps this changes later in the game.
[*]Health potions aren't on timers in Enshrouded.
[*]There aren't elemental effects to worry about in Enshrouded that requires specific gear (such as extreme cold).

1203620,Enshrouded,"Been waiting for this game for a while and it hasn’t let me down.. 
The combat feels great no matter if your using a wand kitting mobs or your up in the mobs face dodging attacks. The building seems very straight forward and if I can do it anyone can.  The crafting is endless, the world is pretty as …

Do I recommend buying it….
Yes I do! If you enjoy getting lost in a game for hours exploring, crafting, base building and killing challenging mobs, solving puzzles this game is 100% for you. It’s a cross between Valheim, Zelda with quiet difficult mobs abit like a souls game and it’s coop! 

Enjoy!

1203620,Enshrouded,"10hrs in and I must say, this has the potential to be one of the best survival games of all time. In its current state, I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys single player adventure survival games. The multiplayer aspect is mid, at best.

 The game uses a shared progression system which means if you are playing with friends, you’ll have to all play at the exact same time or risk missing out on quests, XP and skill points. Unfortunately for me, my friends who are interested in this game won’t play it because we have mostly different schedules. Which sucks, because I love playing these games with friends.

The game, overall, is incredibly fun. The combat is well thought out, and it doesn’t have an overly complicated stats system. The food/water buffs are easy to understand. The building is what sets this game apart, however. There seems to be plenty of materials to build with, and the voxel based building is insane. A highlight is the fact you can build onto existing structures found in the world with ease. Renovations galore.

There are a few things I wish this game would change.

1. Let us build on diagonals. Everything is set to 90° angles which limits creative expression. Probably the biggest let down for me.
2. Get rid of shared progression.
3. Let us have pets, mounts and farm animals rather than going into the wilds to find food. I want to build a homestead.
4. Give us difficulty settings, and ways to tailor the gameplay to our own liking.

1203620,Enshrouded,"This game is amazing. Basically Valheim but IMO better than valheim was when it first released and honestly can hold its own against present valheim. Mostly all positives but there are a couple things i would like to see changed. For one, setting options like palworlds has would be nice, being able to switch loot dropping on death to it not dropping on death. I honestly hate that in survival games considering its not a difficulty thing per say, its just a time consuming thing which imo is a waste of time. I wanna be exploring and doing productive things not going back to my dead body cuz i accidentally slipped off a ledge into fire. Again imo thats not difficulty its literally just wasting the gamers time.
I also came across a little issue with roots, playing coop in my cousins hosted game, i destroyed a root when he wasnt there and he didnt get the skill point for it and when he went to the spot the root was still gone. we thought he might be screwed out of the point but we just had to restart the server. but what if your playing on a server you pay for thats always online, then what? Another little nit pick, the hit boxes sometimes seem a little wonky, example ill be standing completely behind an enemy and theyll swing, the axe makes no contact with me yet i take damage.. 
Again tho those are little nit picks cuz overall without question i recommend buying this game. Shit I wouldve paid 59.99 for this game, its far better than some triple A titles! I love the variety in skill tree, might of put double jump inside the circle  with skills like the wood cutting and mining skills, rather than on one of the class part of the tree but again this is an opinion based nit pick. The building in the game is SOOO good. The fact you can place square by square for roof and wall pieces, most games just have full walls and limited roof pieces.. Im excited to see 6 months from now some of the insane builds people come up with. 
THE MAP IS INSANELY LARGE.. i was shocked at how big this map is. I would say this game is basically Valheim had a baby with Breath of the wild with a dash of minecraft. if you enjoy any of those games, BUY THIS GAME",amazing basically valheim imo valheim released honestly hold present valheim mostly positive couple thing changed option palworlds nice able switch loot dropping death dropping death honestly hate survival game considering difficulty per consuming imo waste wan na exploring productive thing dead body cuz accidentally slipped ledge fire imo thats difficulty literally wasting gamers across issue root coop cousin hosted destroyed root wasnt didnt skill spot root thought screwed restart pay thats online nit pick box wonky example ill standing completely enemy theyll swing axe make contact damage tho nit pick cuz question recommend buying shit wouldve paid 59 99 far triple title love variety skill tree double inside circle skill wood cutting mining skill rather class tree opinion based nit pick building sooo good square square roof wall piece game wall limited roof piece im excited 6 month insane build map insanely large shocked big map basically valheim breath wild dash minecraft enjoy game,1,-0.9788
1203620,Enshrouded,"After 22 hours, I don't recommend playing Enshrouded [i]yet[/i]. The game has lots of potential, but several kinks and growing pains to work out. Here are some of my thoughts divided into specific categories: 

--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Exploration: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]The world feels a little hollow and empty. Too many open and winding roads with no POIs, enemy NPCs, or interesting ""hey what's that?"" The world needs more density.

[*]Many building types are copy-pasted and have the same layout. I'm surprised many people aren't mentioning this because New World got obliterated for this same thing. Once you've seen a tomb/basement/decrepit house/campsite, you've seen them all.

[*]The ancient spires, which have a 'Legend of Zelda dungeon crawler with puzzles"" feel to them, are very simple and lack challenge. Hopefully they'll add more difficult puzzles in later spires.

[*]You can simply break down doors that require switches, thus bypassing the puzzle altogether.

[*]While a neat concept, clearing a shrouded area and chopping the giant red shroud root becomes tedious after the 2nd time. They are not unique enough at this stage in the game, containing all the same enemies, aesthetics, and gameplay. Again, once you've seen one, you've seen them all and unfortunately Enshrouded currently locks skill points behind clearing them, making them more or less mandatory. I'd like to see this system improved upon by adding in some of the puzzle systems from the ancient spires.

[*]The large overworld map lacks essential details like bridge locations/decals once discovered. This should be painted into the base artwork of the map. The map also doesn't differentiate between biomes. The map only shows verticality and important POIs like shrines and quest areas.

[h2][u] Combat and Enemies: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]Though simple, the combat feels responsive and fluid. All weapon types appear viable based on damage numbers.

[*]The skill tree is fun and offers unique gameplay experiences, but leaves me wanting more. I look forward to seeing this expanded.

[*]PvE and AI are incredibly underwhelming and simple. They often cycle between one or two attack animations, including special boss enemies.

[*]There aren't enough mob types currently. After exploring the playable areas in EA, you'll find the same enemy types scattered throughout. The ones that currently exist, look nice and polished.

[*]What enemy NPCs lack in mechanical depth, they grossly overcompensate in numbers and are overtuned. Even with food buffs and a tankier build, some enemies will still 1HKO, even if they are couple levels below. 

[*]While I'm sure a bug, enemies will often get stuck underground or on terrain. 

[*]There is no CC or stagger protection after a certain point. Meaning if you get swarmed or cornered, you can easily be chain staggered to death.

[*]Dodge rolling doesn't roll through enemies due to collision, meaning if you're cornered you'll likely be staggered to death.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Loot: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]Enshrouded commits the greatest cardinal sin when it comes to loot: You can find epic and legendary quality items early on, only to replace them with an uncommon green a couple of levels later. Often the raw damage upgrade is far better than the minor perks from upgrading a lower-level legendary weapon. It NEVER feels good to move from a unique legendary with a cool model to a common green because of numbers. Epic and legendary weapons should be saved for end-game PvE and crafting.

[*]Looting items can add them to your hotbar with no option to toggle this off.

[*]Loot often feels underwhelming. I feel like after 22 hours, I've seen 95% of the possible loot drops. At this stage, it feels like Diablo where I'm waiting for a specific weapon to drop at higher quality for the extra upgrade slot.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Crafting: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]Crafting is fine. What you'd expect from a crafting survival RPG, is not bad, but nothing inventive either. 

[*]Crafted gear options look nice and function well.

[*]The game offers a ""craft from chests"" system by requiring items be placed in specific ""magical chests"", making other chest types completely obsolete. This feels redundant and should be the baseline for any chest.

[*]You can't salvage gear you've outgrown. Giving back at least a small amount of materials like cloth or metal scraps would feel better than simply being forced to delete the item.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Other: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]I experienced very few technical issues.

[*]UI can be confusing and tedious with so many windows to cycle through trying to figure out what you're looking for.
 
[*]Gliding is quite fun and needed for a map with so much verticality.

[*]Fall damage is VERY unforgiving, sliding down a slope means taking massive damage once you finish sliding.

[*]The friendly crafting NPCs are slightly annoying, especially the blacksmith who is constantly berating you.

[*]Sound design is excellent.

[*]You can roll up a steep hill, while helpful, looks very unintended and goofy.

[*]Mining sulfur yields WAY too much EXP. Sulfur instantly breaks and yields 10EXP per swing. Within minutes ~level 10, mining sulfur leveled me up. I did this for several levels, as the EXP rate from mining sulfur felt more efficient than exploring and killing NPCs at my appropriate level.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[b] TLDR; [/b] The game lacks density, difficulty, and depth. It needs more time to cook in the oven and needs to greatly improve upon it's selection of enemies and their combat. I don't feel incentivized to explore, as even the later areas in EA share many of the same loot tables and gear drops from early areas.

This game isn't bad, but I wouldn't say it's great either. Right now I'd rate it a 5/10. I'd say wait at least 6-12 months before investing time and money into Enshrouded. I will revisit my review as the game updates.

--------------------------------------------

Edit: Grammar

Edit #2: In response to some comments, these are my observations and primarily a list of things that came to mind as I was playing over the 22 hours. You're welcome to like the game in it's current state, and I certainly don't [i]dislike[/i] the game, however that doesn't mean I feel its recommendable as is. I love this style of game and would love for it to succeed. I have no problem supporting the game in EA and expect some hiccups, bumps, and incomplete gameplay. That doesn't excuse it from criticism as it's still a product that I paid for. Nothing I saw in Enshrouded seemed particularly unique to make it stand out from other competitors in the market. This is primarily the reason I rated it a 5/10, as it feels middle-of-the-road in it's current state. I have played many games in EA, and most get better over time as development continues. As stated in my OG review, I will revisit upon subsequent game updates.",22 hour recommend enshrouded lot potential kink growing pain thought divided specific category h2 exploration h2 world feel hollow empty open winding road poi enemy npc interesting hey world need density building type copy pasted layout surprised mentioning new world obliterated tomb basement decrepit house campsite ancient spire legend zelda dungeon crawler puzzle simple lack challenge hopefully add difficult puzzle spire simply break door require switch bypassing puzzle altogether neat concept clearing shrouded chopping giant red shroud root tedious 2nd unique stage containing enemy aesthetic unfortunately enshrouded currently lock skill point clearing mandatory improved adding puzzle system ancient spire large overworld map lack essential detail bridge location decal discovered painted base artwork map map differentiate biome map show verticality important poi shrine area h2 combat enemy h2 simple combat feel responsive fluid weapon type appear viable based damage number skill tree fun offer unique experience leaf wanting look forward seeing expanded pve ai incredibly underwhelming simple cycle attack animation including special bos enemy mob type currently exploring playable area ea enemy type scattered throughout one currently exist look nice polished enemy npc lack mechanical depth grossly overcompensate number overtuned food buff tankier build enemy 1hko couple level bug enemy stuck underground terrain cc stagger protection certain meaning swarmed cornered easily chain staggered death dodge rolling roll enemy due collision meaning cornered staggered death h2 loot h2 enshrouded commits greatest cardinal sin come loot epic legendary quality item early replace uncommon green couple level raw damage upgrade far minor perk upgrading lower legendary weapon feel good move unique legendary cool model common green number epic legendary weapon saved pve crafting looting item add hotbar option toggle loot feel underwhelming 22 hour 95 possible loot drop stage feel diablo waiting specific weapon drop higher quality extra upgrade slot h2 crafting h2 crafting fine expect crafting survival bad inventive crafted gear option look nice function offer craft chest requiring item placed specific magical chest chest type completely obsolete feel redundant baseline chest salvage gear outgrown giving small material cloth metal scrap simply forced delete h2 h2 experienced technical issue ui confusing tedious window cycle trying figure gliding fun needed map verticality fall damage unforgiving sliding slope mean taking massive damage finish sliding friendly crafting npc slightly annoying especially blacksmith constantly berating sound design excellent roll steep hill helpful look unintended goofy mining sulfur yield exp sulfur instantly break yield 10exp per swing minute 10 mining sulfur leveled level exp rate mining sulfur efficient exploring killing npc appropriate lack density difficulty depth need cook oven need greatly improve selection enemy combat incentivized explore area ea share loot table gear drop early area bad great rate 5 10 wait 6 12 month investing enshrouded revisit update grammar 2 response comment observation primarily thing mind 22 hour welcome state certainly dislike recommendable love style love succeed problem supporting ea expect hiccup bump incomplete excuse criticism product paid saw enshrouded particularly unique stand competitor market primarily rated 5 10 feel middle road state game ea development continues stated og revisit subsequent update,2,-0.9918
1203620,Enshrouded,"Please note that this is a review after only 10 hours play time, after playing for longer now, there have been some changes to how mechanics work due to my progress, so please take this review as a sub 10 hour experience and nothing more.

[h1] This game ticks so many boxes for me. [/h1]

[h2] The good stuff [/h2]

[h3] Great game feel [/h3]

Walking, running, jumping, gliding, swinging, gathering, terraforming and fluidity of combat all feel really solid and play major roles in the world in their own unique way

[h3] Fun Exploration [/h3]

it has enough different meaningful encounters that you want to see what's upstairs in that derelict building, or cave that seemingly goes on forever. Usually when you go out of your way to explore, you are rewarded.

[h3] Seamless and interesting Questing system [/h3]

Quests aren't slow or meaningless. You're trying to find your next follower who have their own back stories to follow, or you can just happen to stumble upon a letter left by a [spoiler] mysterious princess in some shabby abandoned camp [/spoiler] which lead to scandals and secrets later on in your play through.

[h3] Less frustrating food and drink system [/h3]

You don't get hungry or thirsty, yet you can eat and drink. Why? Because they act as buffs! It's the best of both worlds because it's not a system you have to micro manage, yet if you use it, similar to potions, you will have an easier time, and it's totally your choice!

[h3] Clear map [/h3]

It's so easy to know what you need to do, and where you need to do it. You can place custom way points and uncover the fog of war system as you explore, it's so easy and intuitive. There are also teleport systems you can find (and ones you can build too) to make traversing the world much easier.

[h3] Upgrading weapons [/h3]

Really fun and easy upgrade system that lets you sacrifice weapons you find in the world for tokens which can be used to upgrade your favourite weapons to make them even more powerful. There are also other ways to get these tokens too.

[h2] The things i didn't like so much [/h2]

[h3] Building [/h3]

The game doesn't require you to build crazy things if you don't want too (I'm thinking like a big fortress to keep out waves of enemies like in Valheim or The Forest) Which is a good thing in my opinion. Building is fairly solid and easy to grasp, and someone with an imaginative brain could certainly create some wonders, however i found the UI for it a bit finicky. It stood out because it didn't feel as smooth as the rest of the game does.

[h3] Crafting [/h3]

I like the items you can craft, and the fact that it's pretty easy to craft stuff in general, but i HATE the fact you need to jump around from the work bench to one of the followers, or tab across to the basic stuff. I would like to see this reworked in a way that all the craftable items you have unlocked are available from the workbench. Do this and you have streamlined this process for us!

[h3] The red stuff [/h3]

Oh my god what a horrible awful frustrating mechanic!!!! GET RID OF THIS OR NERF IT PLEASE! you'll be walking jump and hopping over terrain to get somewhere and there is just this pit of death you couldn't see that kills you within 2 seconds. and most of the time you can't scamper up the edges to save yourself. You lose some of your items (Which is ok), however when you go to retrieve them, they have spawned on the side of the slippery terrain you can't properly scamper across to collect it! My suggestion with this, is make sure all the banks surrounding the red stuff are climbable, and increase the time you can be in there to give the player a fighting chance to recover from their mistake.,and also make the items that drop from you reachable 100% of the time.

[b] As an early access game this is a solid 9/10! There are some bits i would like to see changed in full release for it to keep this rating, but i have a lot of faith in the devs from what I've seen so far. I'm going to continue playing and unlock everything i can. I'm very excited to see where this title goes.

1203620,Enshrouded,"so an overview of what it is like relative to other survival games (its not particularly survival):

No rotting/expiration of food
you don't drop Tools on death, just materials
no carry weight, just slots
building system is extremely generous, you get a lot of pieces for pretty low initial resources
no hunger/thirst, just valheim type benefits for foods (game is basically valheim, in many ways, and then changed in others)
can fast travel between Flame Altars, their equivalent of the workbench in valheim or the C.A.M.P from fallout, its the building zone and you start being able to have two, and that is upgradeable
terrain/resources respawn outside of player claimed zones
character creator is extremely simple, very much like valheim's so not a lot there (although for whatever reason they literally have a bunch of BG3 hairs, i don't think its like ripped models, its just the same hairstyles lol)
a single world, not procedurally generated, it is like Ark in that it is a story map, so there are old structures from the kingdom that used to be there
their roads and paths in this kingdom reduce the amount of stamina consumed by sprinting, so you are encouraged to use their roads. (i do not know at this time whether the player can eventually make roads or not, haven't gotten far)

overall it is an extremely casual game, seems mostly like a exploration/story/building rpg, more than a survival game. there are areas of 'shroud' that are like blue caelid xD and thats the main story thing, is that you are trying to fight back against the shroud, you can only stay in these zones for a limited amount of time before you presumably die, idk i haven't tried that yet lol

there is fall damage
fall damage becomes less relevant once you have a glider, as long as you use it before falling too far
you can dig really, really, really, really, really, really far down
especially in the areas that are raised up, it seems the raised up portion is itself all diggable terrain
because unclaimed terrain regenerates, you would need to make sure your claimed area was not in such a way that you get trapped, although if that was truly what could happen, that would actually be kinda cool

i don't think there is any friendly fire with non-explosives or pvp elements at all

2 hotbars, you switch with alt, although i switched it to control because alt feels better as dodge
dodge roll mechanics
rpg passive skill tree type thing
relatively simple gear and weapon system
magic weapons, wand is infinite ammo, doesn't use stamina, fires short range tracking bolts
staff is a ranged weapon that uses 'ammo' and the spells ive found so far are just frost bolts, they are limited because they are ammo, but since everything respawns you could theoretically just go loot more of them from the chest that has them.

But yeah it's a decent game, pretty simple, I can see it getting boring for people who aren't creative and don't care as much about building to just build. I hope they add a little more danger to it, but I actually really like how overall chill it is, a lot of survival games go too far into the hardcore experience for me, which i totally get is some people's thing, but i prefer things to be a little more relaxed until you want challenge. (Conan's new purges are opt-in, which i think would be great for this game, if enemies would attack but on an opt-in basis)

I would love to see more variety in enemies, more animals and plants (make the world more alive), and more weapon types (dual wielding? lol)

Definitely not a AAA game, (Would a AAA game be this fair with the price?? lol) but pretty fun to explore and I hope they continue to add to it.",overview relative survival game particularly survival rotting expiration food drop tool death material carry weight slot building extremely generous piece pretty low initial resource hunger thirst valheim type benefit food basically valheim way changed others fast travel flame altar equivalent workbench valheim c p fallout building zone able upgradeable terrain resource respawn outside claimed zone creator extremely simple valheim whatever literally bunch bg3 hair ripped model hairstyle lol single world procedurally generated ark map old structure kingdom road path kingdom reduce stamen consumed sprinting encouraged road eventually road gotten far extremely casual mostly exploration building survival area shroud blue caelid xd thats trying fight shroud stay zone limited presumably die idk tried lol fall damage fall damage relevant glider long falling far dig far especially area raised raised portion diggable terrain unclaimed terrain regenerates claimed trapped truly happen kinda cool friendly fire non explosive pvp element 2 hotbars switch alt switched control alt feel dodge dodge roll mechanic passive skill tree type relatively simple gear weapon magic weapon wand infinite ammo stamen fire short range tracking bolt staff ranged weapon us ammo spell ive found far frost bolt limited ammo respawns theoretically loot chest yeah decent pretty simple boring creative care building build hope add danger chill survival game far hardcore totally prefer thing relaxed challenge conan new purge opt great enemy attack opt basis love variety enemy animal plant world alive weapon type dual wielding lol definitely aaa aaa fair price lol pretty fun explore hope continue add,1,0.9785
1203620,Enshrouded,"Valheim but from Germany. 

It's a nice looking open world and doesn't take you by the hand too much. Crafting is straightforward and the battles are simple. Easily playable with controller or mouse and keyboard. I preferred the controller. Weapon balance still needs some tweaking. Ranged and magic is easier and more powerful than melee, but all options are viable.",valheim germany nice open world hand crafting straightforward battle simple easily playable controller mouse keyboard preferred controller weapon balance need tweaking ranged magic easier powerful melee option viable,1,0.8481
1203620,Enshrouded,"This is a fun, Valheim like survival/adventure game (no eating/drinking to stay alive, you just get buffs) with a whole lot of potential. Personally if you are not to sure about this game just wait for the purchase, but I have been waiting for a game just like this one for a while and I have certainly been enjoying it. 
The multiplayer gets too much hate, this is not a game meant for random people and I don't know why people are pretending it is. With 1-2 friends that are coordinated and don't rush quests there is not issue. If you want to play with more than a few people then issues might arise, but once again just don't rush quests alone. 
The combat is fun, much more fun than Valhiem's, but still needs a bit more variety. I have by no means fought every enemy but most are pretty similar and not too difficult. The skill tree is fine, not to complicated (maybe a bit basic). 
The building is more enjoyable than Valhiem's with much more customizability and depth. The only issues with space (you have a limited area to build than can be moved around) I could think of, is once again when you have too many people playing. The world reverting is a bit odd, but it keep the resources from being a super long grind (like Valhiem's). I think that chests shouldn't respawn, instead everyone on the server should have personal chests but it's not too much of an issue. I see people complaining about cheesing runes with grinding chests and salvaging the loot but it's YOUR choice. If you want to cheese, go for it but don't complain about it. The puzzles are the same for me, yes you can technically break all the doors down and avoid the puzzles but that's not a fun way of playing the game. Don't complain about cheeses when you don't have to do them yourself.

All in all the game is fun, it certainly feels like an upgrade to Valhiem. More depth is needed with characters and biomes and the server-tied quests probably need changing. I would recommend playing it but its not a game you should feel to bad about not getting (yet).",fun valheim survival adventure eating drinking stay alive buff potential personally wait purchase waiting certainly enjoying multiplayer get hate meant random pretending 1 2 friend coordinated rush quest issue issue arise rush quest alone combat fun fun valhiem need bit variety mean fought enemy pretty similar difficult skill tree fine complicated maybe bit basic building enjoyable valhiem customizability depth issue space limited build moved world reverting bit odd resource super long grind valhiem chest respawn personal chest issue complaining cheesing rune grinding chest salvaging loot choice cheese complain puzzle yes technically break door avoid puzzle fun complain cheese fun certainly feel upgrade valhiem depth needed character biome tied quest probably changing recommend bad,0,0.959

The game itself is fantastic, the world feels amazing and full of things to do but that is also a problem, if you play on a server with more than a few of you, the world will not regen its monsters, loot, resources or anything for that matter as its on a 2 hour refresh rate that can also have that timer reset if someone enters that area, this paired with the fact quests are not shared nor the progress and can cause issues for others to not allow them to finish them is a huge flaw in the co-op aspect, and well also this game was marketed heavy towards co-op and multiplayer even the launch trailer was co-op heavy.

I saw a review stating the game seemed more catered to the single player survival game, and i cant help but shake that feeling that this game is more appealing if played as single player as opposed to playing with friends.

1203620,Enshrouded,"I would wait until there's more content and combat is improved. The foundation is good but by the time I reached late game I wasn't having fun anymore. This game is a material gathering simulator atm with very simple hack & slash combat. Melee and ranged are terrible compared to magic. There's 4 ""boss"" enemies which all just feel like mini-bosses. There are no true bosses like Valheim. The best gear is found in chests which can be exploited by placing a base right next to one and logging out and back in over and over to refresh the loot. The world feels like it was purposely designed to make navigation a pain. Everything is always up on a cliff you can't reach from where you are and you can't see anything in the distance when you're in the shroud, which is close to half of the world. 

There is currently no culmination of anything. You just run out of quests and realize there's no more content. The map appears to be gigantic at first but then you realize you can only access about a third of it until they add more content. If you like getting all achievements then you're gonna have a rough time too because there are 4 achievements for finding all these shrines in each of the 4 regions, and there are tons of them and the game doesn't track which ones you've visited. So now you're looking at a map with probably 20+ shrines for each region and you have no idea which ones are the ones you still need. 

One last really annoying thing is having to spam jump to move faster. When you jump, you don't lose stamina but you keep your momentum, so the best way to move is to hold sprint and spam jump everywhere. Combine that with having to hit E to loot literally everything (there's no auto-pickup like Valheim) and you're on your way to carpal tunnel in your left hand.",wait content combat improved foundation good reached late fun anymore material gathering simulator atm simple hack slash combat melee ranged terrible compared magic 4 bos enemy mini boss true boss valheim best gear found chest exploited placing base next logging refresh loot world feel purposely designed navigation pain cliff reach distance shroud close half world currently culmination quest realize content map appears gigantic realize access third add content achievement gon na rough 4 achievement finding shrine 4 region ton track one visited map probably 20 shrine region idea one one last annoying spam move faster lose stamen momentum best move hold sprint spam everywhere combine e loot literally auto pickup valheim carpal tunnel left hand,2,-0.4588
1203620,Enshrouded,"My Short EA Release Review
Overall Grade: 55/100

Gameplay Mechanics: 4/10
- The game's controls feel a bit off at times, parrying can be very finicky, and often while jumping in combat, the jump won't happen
- Survival mechanics are bare bones, bordering on non existent
- The game does not balance challenge and accessibility, the game is so incredibly easy that it actually makes me dread fulfilling multiple gameplay systems due to boredom

World Design: 8/10
- The world is extremely immersive, and looks amazing, with some exceptions such as the voxel terrain often displaying extremely flat or cubed surfaces, such as a lava pool I discovered that was literally a cube the size of a building
- There is a nice variety of environments, each feeling unique, with the shroud (obviously) being the most noticeably eye catching
- The world encourages exploration well through many locations and landmarks to visit, along with many quest markers, unfortunately the rewards for visiting these locations is often a large let down

Resource Management: 5/10
- Resource management is not particularly difficult, compounded by the ease of many fast travel points
- Resource gathering can be very fun or very tedious, depending on location and source
- There is not much sense of pride I get in managing my resources in this game, which I usually get in other survival games, not sure what the cause is

Enemy AI and Threats: 2/10
- The enemies are so incredibly easy, that if they were changed into passive mobs, it would genuinely be difficult to notice
- There is absolutely zero sense of danger or urgency (outside of fall damage, I have died so many times to broken legs)
- There is no balance between passive and aggressive threats, as aggressive threats border on non existent

Graphics and Atmosphere: 8/10
- The game looks great, not hyper realistic, but what it is going for works
- The atmosphere of the game world really makes you feel like the world is yours to conquer, if only there was anything challenging inside it to conquer
- Day/night cycles are average, nothing to write home about, doesn't increase difficulty in terms of threats, but night is so dark it can get kinda spooky

Story and Lore: 5/10
- The narrative and backstory is average, nothing groundbreaking or particularly unique
- The story doesn't really mix with the survival aspects at all, feels quite disjointed, if the story was removed, the game would feel exactly the same
- Some bits of lore are intriguing, but the vast majority is easily skippable

Multiplayer and Social Interaction: 7/10
- Honestly it is a pretty bad coop game, largely due to the fact that combat, the main driving force of coop in survival games, is boring beyond belief, building is really the only thing worth doing with friends
- Coop with friends adds nothing to gameplay, other than having someone else to mock the game's combat with you
- It is appreciated that characters can be transferred across servers with little penalty, as it allows you to play solo when your friends are away, and coop when they're back, all on one character file

Technical Performance: 8/10
- Haven't run into any performance issues as of yet, but it must be noted I am playing on a powerful rig
- I have only come across a few bugs, one of which requiring a manual restart
- Game seems well optimized, but again, hard to tell on a powerful rig

Longevity and Replayability: 4/10
- There is a vast world to explore, but given that it is not procedurely generated, and instead handcrafted, while uniquely beautiful because of this, you will be discovering the same things on a replay
- There is no system in place to encourage any sense of replay value
- Combat is currently the driving force in any lack of motivation to replay this game once I complete it

Innovation and Uniqueness: 4/10
- The shroud is a somewhat unique concept in it's implementation, but aside from that, not much else stands out
- This game is quite strikingly just BotW but with voxel
- This game seems to lack innovation outside of it's great building mechanics, and unfortunately I do not see a way to course correct in this area as any change required would fundamentally change what the game has set itself as",short ea release grade 55 100 mechanic 4 10 control bit time parrying finicky jumping combat happen survival mechanic bare bone bordering non existent balance challenge accessibility incredibly easy make dread fulfilling multiple system due boredom world design 8 10 world extremely immersive look amazing exception voxel terrain displaying extremely flat cubed surface lava pool discovered literally cube size building nice variety environment feeling unique shroud obviously noticeably eye catching world encourages exploration location landmark visit along marker unfortunately reward visiting location large resource management 5 10 resource management particularly difficult compounded ease fast travel point resource gathering fun tedious depending location source sense pride managing resource usually survival game cause enemy ai threat 2 10 enemy incredibly easy changed passive mob genuinely difficult notice zero sense danger urgency outside fall damage died time broken leg balance passive aggressive threat aggressive threat border non existent graphic atmosphere 8 10 look great hyper realistic work atmosphere world make world conquer challenging inside conquer night cycle average write home increase difficulty term threat night dark kinda spooky lore 5 10 narrative backstory average groundbreaking particularly unique mix survival aspect feel disjointed removed exactly bit lore intriguing vast majority easily skippable multiplayer social interaction 7 10 honestly pretty bad coop largely due combat driving force coop survival game boring belief building worth friend coop friend add someone else mock combat appreciated character transferred across server penalty allows solo friend coop file technical performance 8 10 performance issue noted powerful rig across bug requiring manual restart optimized hard tell powerful rig longevity replayability 4 10 vast world explore given procedurely generated handcrafted uniquely beautiful discovering thing replay encourage sense replay value combat currently driving force lack motivation replay complete innovation uniqueness 4 10 shroud somewhat unique concept implementation aside else stand strikingly botw voxel lack innovation outside great building mechanic unfortunately course correct required fundamentally set,3,0.9151
1203620,Enshrouded,"Enshrouded is a survival action role-playing game set in the realm of Embervale where due to your ancestor’s lust for great magical power they unleashed a pestilence that consumed the world. It is in this world you awake and start your journey to ignite the ancient power of the flame and piece together the fragments of a story that unfolds beneath the surface.

Like most survival games Enshrouded starts off with a tutorial teaching you the basic mechanics of fighting and base building by setting you tasks to collect various resources to create workbenches which will enable you to create tools and weapons that will help make your heroic journey of cleansing Embervale of the deadly shroud that envelops it. Enshrouded has a unique hook though, in order to expand your collection of crafting recipes you will need to head out far from home and travel the map so you can rescue and recruit various NPCs such as the hunter and alchemist who will then reward you with the ability to make new crafting stations and more powerful weapons, tools and potions. You will also need to build them dwellings to live in and areas for the various tools they require such as kilns, drying racks and furnaces. If you decide to move and build in a different part of the map, then you can simply summon them to your new location with your handy summoning staff. It’s a unique touch that really helps to make you feel like you are building a village rather than just a place for yourself to live. Speaking of crafting, you can also craft a grappling hook and a glider to help you explore the map, it is even more fun than it sounds, jumping off a massive cliff and gliding across the landscape to your destination really opens your eyes to just how massive the world of Enshrouded is. Food and drink also play a massive part in Enshrouded but not in the usual way you would expect in a survival game, instead of having a hunger and thirst meter that you must constantly replenish you instead use food and drinks for buffs to strength, stamina and dexterity amongst other things which makes it vital to ensure you have the correct buffs applied before you set out on an adventure to the more dangerous parts of the map. 
There are enemies littered all over Embervale and you will have all manner of tools at your disposal to dispose of them, from swords and maces all the way through to bows, wands and staffs, both ranged and melee combat are simple in essence but also feel great to take part in, you also have a rather large skill tree that you can use to customise your character to the type of playstyle you prefer, you can be anything from a pure archer through to a sword wielding magic user depending on which skills you choose. Enemies aren’t the only thing actively trying to kill you in Enshrouded though, parts of the map are covered in ‘the shroud’ a toxic fog-like substance that harms anybody that wanders into it, when you enter the shroud a timer will start counting down at the top of the screen that warns you how much time you have left before you must get out of the shroud, once that counts down to zero then you cease to exist, you can extend your time in the shroud by reaching certain landmarks which will reset your timer or by using potions. The whole shroud mechanic is a work of genius that adds tension to exploring the map, I had several instances where I chose to stay and explore longer than I should and breathed a massive sigh of relief as I sprinted out of the deadly shroud into the sunshine with only seconds to spare, it’s these type of moments that keep you engaged in the world of Embervale and the game as a whole.

Embervale is a master class in world design, standing on the edge of a cliff and surveying the landscape through the holes in the shroud then seeing a point of interest miles into the distance and saying to yourself “I can actually go there” as you start off on another journey of exploration is an incredible feeling, as is exploring all the abandoned ruins and towers that litter the landscape. The map is absolutely massive and not only encourages exploration, but it also rewards you for it, if you put in the time to investigate every nook and cranny then you will find chests that can contain anything from much needed resources through to epic weapons that will help you go stronger. The game is quite beautiful for the most part, with gigantic towers, old ruins, sweeping plains and valleys full of the fog-like shroud making up most of the world, Embervale is mysterious, beautiful and dangerous all at the same time. Unlike most games with survival aspects, Enshrouded does have a story, it is told mostly through text at the beginning and conclusion of quests and through various notes and books you will come across in your travels that help you get a better understanding of the lore behind the game and also mark key locations on the map for you to visit, if you are expecting flashy cut scenes then you will most likely end up disappointed, in my opinion though, the low key and unobtrusive story telling works perfectly for this type of game.

It is not all sunshine and rainbows where Enshrouded is concerned though, there are some nasty bugs and optimisation issues that pop up during gameplay, there are lots of frame rate issues during gameplay with some of the worst being during the transition from day to night time which brings the frame rate down into single digits, thankfully the transition only last for a minute or two so it is more annoying than game breaking. I also had a nasty bug that only seemed to affect me and not the friends I was playing with where it was impossible for me to exit out of the game even after trying to kill the process via task manager, this happened every time I try to exit the game and the only solution was to reboot my system on each occasion, I did report this bug to the devs but didn’t get a reply. People I were playing with also experienced a lot of random crashes during gameplay whereas I didn’t experience a single one so there is obviously an issue where certain types of hardware don’t play nice with the game, the game is Early Access though so some of these things can be forgiven and the devs were being really proactive with patching the game heading up to the launch, there wasn’t a day that went by during the week I have been playing that went by without a patch which is a really encouraging sign for the future stability and optimisation of the game.

Enshrouded is a game for people who like to immerse themselves into the world of a game and explore, not only will you be rewarded for your exploration with new items, new crafting recipes and weapons you will also be rewarded with snippets of lore that help you further understand the history of Embervale. I have been absolutely fiending to play this game ever since the playtest during Next Fest and I am happy to say that even though it can be a little rough around the edges Enshrouded is an absolute joy to play whether you are going at it solo or with a bunch of friends. The size of the map, the vast array of crafting recipes and the games building system, that even allows you to dig and build underground, are all top notch, the only thing  that really needs work apart from optimisation is the combat system, while it is far from terrible it does feel quite floaty and lacks feedback and oomph on successful hits, I found the ranged combat to be far more satisfying than melee, hopefully the combat can be improved over time. I highly recommend Enshrouded to anybody that likes survival or RPG games, the map is massive, there is so much to explore and so much to build that I can ensure that you will spend a great number of hours playing this game. I am really looking forward to seeing how the game develops during the early access period, Enshrouded is an example of early access done right and I hope it receives the support it deserves.

1203620,Enshrouded,"I don't usually write a review so soon after the release of a game (especially early access titles). But since there are so many bad reviews here because one or two things don't (yet) work immediately after release - what a surprise for an Early Access title - I felt it was necessary to counteract this. I mean - come on people, give the developers a chance to address the problems.

1203620,Enshrouded,"I really wanted to love this game. The single-player experience is pretty solid. the building and combat are great, and the world is compelling. It's a ton of fun to explore and discover new recipes. But at present, it's only really playable single-player. There are only 2 flame altars per server, which means that either a 4 or 16 player server must share 2 bases between them. There is no way to make your own base, or chests, they're available to all. There are no admin tools to deal with griefers either.

In addition progression is server wide, AND character dependent. This means if a character is not present when a quest is completed, they lose out on the rewards for the quest, but also can't receive the quests themselves, effectively gating their progression. Only one person gets boss and quest rewards, so on a 4-16 person server, good luck sharing loot.

Even in two player co-op, both players always present, quest progression is broken. you can only have one major quest at a time, and I had a quest to make a weapon, which I didn't complete, as I didn't realize it was gating my progression. In that time, I helped my co-op partner complete several quests, including a major boss kill, and I don't have the quest completion reflected in my journal, but the area is permanently altered and I can't receive or complete those quests, so my progression is bricked.

Given the way multiplayer is implemented, it's clear it started as a single-player game with a changing world that tacked on multiplayer to appeal to the survival craft genre.

If you want a single player survival game with a compelling world and decent combat, go for it. But if you want to play multiplayer in any capacity I would look elsewhere.",wanted love single pretty solid building combat great world compelling ton fun explore discover new recipe present playable single 2 flame altar per mean 4 16 share 2 base base chest available admin tool deal griefers addition progression wide dependent mean present completed lose reward receive quest effectively gating progression get bos reward 4 16 good luck sharing loot co op player present progression broken major weapon complete realize gating progression helped co op partner complete quest including major bos kill completion reflected journal permanently altered receive complete quest progression bricked given multiplayer implemented clear started single changing world tacked multiplayer appeal survival craft genre single survival compelling world decent combat multiplayer capacity look elsewhere,1,0.9764
1203620,Enshrouded,"Enshrouded is a very pretty base-builder and role-playing game.  The base building is easy and flexible with good tools and deformable voxel-based landscapes.  The RPG progression involves fighting enemies and some light puzzle solving.  The overall purpose and character of this is a bit thin, but it will no doubt get filled out over time. 

The one thing it is not is a survival game, which is what I was hoping for.  Hardcore survival games like like Project Zomboid or The Long Dark require maintaining food, warmth, shelter and surviving against permadeath.  Softcore survival games like Valheim don't have those challenges, but they still generate tension by having enemies invade your base and the need to recover your gear if you get killed.  Enshrouded has none of that.  Eating and drinking are optional, enemies never invade your base, if you get killed you respawn with all your equipment.  So there is no survival challenge at all.  
If you want a pretty base builder and currently average open-world RPG, then by all means buy this.  But the launch version of this doesnt scratch my survival itch.",enshrouded pretty base builder role base building easy flexible good tool deformable voxel based landscape progression involves fighting enemy light puzzle solving purpose bit thin doubt filled survival hoping hardcore survival game project zomboid long dark require maintaining food warmth shelter surviving permadeath softcore survival game valheim challenge generate tension enemy invade base recover gear killed enshrouded eating drinking optional enemy invade base killed respawn equipment survival challenge pretty base builder currently average open world mean launch version doesnt scratch survival itch,1,-0.5719
1203620,Enshrouded,"I don't know... my experience so far hasn't been all that fun. There are lots of quests, but they all feel similar and even though I'm almost 40 hours in I couldn't tell you why I'm doing any of these quests other than to get stronger... but why?  Why do I need to get stronger? Am I saving this (mostly dead) world somehow? Is there some sort of sinister force behind all of this? Is there anything left worth saving? 

The giant fungal spore things that create the shroud are easily dispatched with a basic ax. How did it get so out of control? Could no one use an ax?

I built a house to keep NPCs and equipment in, but I haven't upgraded the bed or the lights or anything really... I don't see the point since I'll likely have another option to upgrade to by the time I collect all the materials to do an upgrade. Just seems like a lot of work for such little payoff.

There's very little survival in this game. I rarely feel in danger.

I guess what I'm saying is this game is a bit boring right now. It's not all that fun. Lots to do and lots of flexibility with what you can build, but I don't know if that's really enough.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Bought it right away for my steamdeck. It work well right out of the box. Standard is the default settings and RECOMMENDED for now. It run stable at 30fps for me. I tried 60 fps but it not stable and fluctuate between 40-55 fps. If you want to play higher than 30FPS, change the Max FPS in game to 60. After that set frame limit to 40 in the Steam Quick Access Menu ( depend if you want or not). Moreover, the only time i see performance drop is while being at the area of Village/Town. The scenes happening there also may cause a bit of performance drop. The minimum i ever get is 27 FPS. There is no significant drop while in-battle,other area outside village,multiplayer. Those work without an issue and pretty stable for me.

Edit 1: After few configurations, i find out Proton Experimental give a little bit of boost to fps but not necessarily needed. You may stick to default if it work fine for you. I also use cryoutilities recommended settings and set UMA Buffer to 4 in Steamdeck BIOS. It does make the performance bit better than default. Do this at your own risk and if you know what you doing. If no, just stick to default setting as long it work fine on 30 FPS. Changing in-game setting from Standard to Higher will impact the performance, so just stick to Standard. Additional notes, doing these not even make the area around Village/Town stable at 30FPS. It still can go below 30FPS. The area is not properly optimised. Also, turn vsync off in game settings.

 Combat:
The combat is surprisingly smooth and really make me giggle. Pretty impressive gameplay and the AI is smart by default on using skills especially support skill (heal). Not only that, you can customize the skill for the character as you level up the mastery. Having the need to do combo and stop to dodge/guard is also very fun as the boss is pretty challenging. 

Steam Deck Control Layout:
The default control on Steam Deck already good enough, but may adjust it to suit your need. As example, i set L4 for sprint as clicking the Left Stick to sprint everytime is quite annoying for me. However, there is in-game setting for auto sprint if you want. 

Multiplayer :
It works well for me and there does not seem like there is a much drop when I play. It can run pretty stable without lagging. Take note, you can repeat the quest with the party if you want.

Overall, i think this is a pretty good game to pickup for Steam Deck as not only it can run by default. You dont need much tinkering to play it and just stick to default. The story is quite enjoyable for me, but the cream of the cake in this game is the gameplay. Doing the Full Burst and Link attack is pretty satisfying. However, there is still room for improvement especially around the area of village/town. If you looking to grab a game where the gameplay is very fun and good story, you can add this to your library.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Like 15 years on Steam and maybe a thousand games, and I don't think I've ever, ever left a review for a game. I'm not a GBF fan at all, and was a bit down on the reviews before launch. But the art/animation and what I thought was another entry in my favorite genre (JRPG) motivated me to buy anyway... and this game is simply fun. Fun. Remember fun?

Look, the story is as barebones as it gets. Which is a shame, because it's clear there's a lot of quality lore and franchise history to pull from. The sidekick character is utterly awful to listen to. And the game lacks a good amount of PC settings, has limited frame rate support, and zero ultra wide support (though, it is relatively well optimized, I'll give it that).

But everything else? It's great. It's got high quality character action and stands toe to toe with Platinum's best. It's got more JRPG elements (gear, leveling, systems, parties, etc.) than the newest Final Fantasy. Its world is beautiful. The music is exceptional. The art and graphics are S-Tier.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"I've only put in 7 hours so far (with plans to put in many many more), but the game has been a really enjoyable experience for me so far! I have personally had 0 crashes, 0 framerate issues, and the game runs a flawless 60 or 120fps for me. 

The story has been nicely paced, keeping you in the action for a majority of its duration, which I appreciate since I think the main appeal of this game is its fun action combat and character progression systems. It is not a long story, which I think is a good decision for a game like this. The main meat of the game are the epic boss fights, grinding your characters up to absurd strengths, and having a blast with the combat while doing so. This formula extends well past the story, where the meat of the game is with its many quests sending you to fight, most of which you can play online in co-op with up to 3 others for a full party of 4. There are more than a dozen characters, and let me tell you - they all play very differently and you are sure to find a playstyle you really enjoy and vibe with to have a lot of fun!

If you like action combat, the art style, and seeing your character get absurdly strong over a long period of time, questing up solo or with a bunch of friends to beat the crap out of enemies to get even stronger to fight even stronger enemies, rinse and repeat, this game is going to be fantastic for you!

It sucks to see so many people having crashing issues during this launch period, and I hope the developers stay on top of things to patch things up soon. Keep an eye on reviews to see if this is the case. With that said, here are my personal issues/things I would like to see in the future:

As of 2/1/2024:
- The game supports dualsense controllers, but no button prompts for PS4/PS5. Come on, guys. It's 2024. Button prompts for playstation controllers, please.
- The game does not support ultrawide, but it does support up to 4K resolution and 120FPS. I understand ultrawide users are a minority, sitting under 1% of users on steam, but it is always very appreciated when I see the implementation. It's totally understandable it does not support this, however.
- This game makes my 4070 TI run 80-100% GPU load at 120fps in 1440p resolution, which is kind of wild. The game runs great, but it is very demanding. The game is very pretty, but it's making our GPU's work hard. Maybe some more optimizations or implementation of DLSS/FSR could really help with this, especially for weaker hardware to increase accessibility for players.

With all of that said, this is a really fun game, and I think if the developers take good care of it, it's going to be a joy to play for a long time coming. Here's hoping they show it strong support after their long 7+ years of development! 

And no, the translation is fine despite the few complaining about it, and the censorship is seriously not significant at all. Please don't listen to the hardcore jrpg fans getting upset over these really minor things, or at least do some research to see how negatively those changes may affect your enjoyment of the game. (For me, it ruined my enjoyment by 0%.)

8 Years in the making and some how BETTER than expectations? ✔
The best ARPG combat we've gotten with 20 something somehow unique characters? ✔
Incredible Music that is somehow enhanced from it's source material? ✔
A team of vets who made the greatest era of Final Fantasy Games (IV-IX)? ✔
A PC port of a heavily marketed playstation game that runs at a locked in 120fps at 1440p with literally no drops? ✔
Loading Screens that literally barely exist as soon as they appear the game tells me it's ready? ✔
MMO Boss Raid Mechanics without the inane spamming 1 2 3 combos? ✔
Incredibly gorgeous stylized environments and characters? ✔
One of the most streamlined Co-Op menus and experiences ever? ✔

TL:DR: You like ARPG's about killing big bosses or hordes of grunts and pushing yourself and your friends to get the highest scores/lowest times possible on these kills? Do you like MMO raid bosses but wish the combat was more engaging? Sick of FOMO, MTX, Live Service, Time Gating, DRM, bullshit in your co-op games? Buy this game.

This game has it all for ARPG fans. My only cons are no ultrawide support but hell maybe I'll get that in a patch and solo only main story but it seems fast paced so we don't really care. Me and my friends played 3 hours on release just trying to S++ the first three side quests together and it was the most satisfying action RPG gameplay I've ever experienced.

It's beautiful, it's satisfying, the music is gorgeous, and it's not a live service bull shit fuck fest of battle passes, weeklies, dailies, limited time quests, time gates, or artificial bloat. You get to play the game, A FULL GAME, with multiplayer side content on top at your own pace, and grind your rewards without a time gate or some arbitrary clock ticking down in the top left telling you those rewards will disappear forever by the next month. No DRM, solo works offline, no kernal level anticheat for a co-op game, no bloat launcher, no bull shit. Support more devs like this that just make full experiences without all the heaped on crap.

Also finally an ARPG port that doesn't run like complete garbage on PC. Could use some more settings for changing controller bindings but the default bindings are really solid and reWASD exists for a reason. The game has such a deep and well crafted stylization to it's assets I'm not sure how much more graphical settings could even be included. But the game doesn't rely on upscalers to get you this quality and no smudgy TAA it's nonexistant thanks to the stylization efforts. It's not photo real but it's art, the hand painted backgrounds, sky boxes, and foliage are drop dead gorgeous.

I feel like a kid playing FFIX for the first time again. This game is pure magic. If you like JRPG styles and themes and deep ARPG systems, it's heaven. If you told me this was made by the company that made one of Japan's most successful Gacha games ever I would've expected more scummy gacha practices but they're somehow one of the only studios making complete experiences these days it seems. Seriously the game is just killer.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"[h1] Edit For Steam Deck users [/h1]
Having now played it on the Deck it runs suprisingly well for how much is happening on screen
what i will say is on the OLED i will drop to 22ish-25 sometimes BUT it is only for millisecond, long enough to register the drop but you dont really feel it ever if that makes sense. i think one benefit of it coming out on the Ps4 is that the 30 lock feels incredibly smooth closer to like 45 or so feels like on there. the menus are also very very snappy and the loading is like instant so that too does not feel like its taxing the system the way it is. also locked at 30 your looking at around 3-5 hours give or take with the time in cut scenes and menus probably 2 and half to 3 if you are just straight running missions non stop. 

i bought this on a whim, i liked how it looked and what i thought it was. im not familiar with granblue other than the hour i played of the most recent fighting game but ill tell ya a purchase of that is now in the future. 

this is a weird blend of Wayfinder, Xenblade chronicles and monster hunter and pretty much in that order. 

runs well for me at locked 120 fps full tilt. i dont think i ever saw a frame drop no matter how frantic it got. 
though im on a 13700k with a 4080. im curious to try it on steam deck here shortly. 

i cant say much about the story other than its totally serviceable. and overall im enjoying it even though im not totally locked into it. What i will say is this game does something ive never seen but if you skip a cutscene it gives you a summer of what your skipping and what plot is happening before you accept making it possible to fully understand it without needing to see it. that said the voice work and scenes themselves are super well animated and framed. if i was more into this style of story telling i think id like it quite a bit i just fine the Characters a bit too silly and some way to serious. i cant really find a middle ground. 

Combats great as youd expect, i could take more from the open areas because i just generally like them and the look of the game itself. but whats offered is fine so far. 

No real microtransactions, no store, no battle pass, You have a full 3d model viewer of every character, enemy and weapon in the game and one for a good chunk of the 2d art which you would see sold separate in a lot of other games now a days

i havent made it to the endgame but im incredibly curious as to what it looks like and or what a roadmap or continuation will look like going forward because i do see myself spending a good bit of time with this and i almost wish it was a live service so that i knew more was coming. 

honestly my only real gripe is that when you pick a character that is what theyre going to look like the entire time, i know people in this niche like this but i could take more outfits or look changes or something to represent my grow in power as it is a power fantasy at the end of the day. 

my only other gripe is no ultrawide support which is a bummer, weirdly the game doesnt have ps4 or 5 button layouts even though it only launched on there and pc as a port so its an odd ommission since the work was already done, but to that end the games ui and layout is exactly the same as a controller as in right hand side has a 4 button diamond for abilities and a bumper and trigger listed same as the left hand side so just looking at the screen youll know exactly where everything is when it matters. though most of us who have used a ps controller on pc for a while will be accustomed to missing button art. 

i dunno i think its good, im really surprised by it, i got tails of arise recently and i now feel like i probably wont be touching that for quite a while.",deck user deck run suprisingly happening screen oled drop 22ish 25 millisecond long register drop dont make sense benefit coming ps4 30 lock feel incredibly smooth closer 45 feel menu snappy loading instant taxing locked 30 3 5 hour cut scene menu probably 2 half 3 straight running mission non bought whim liked looked thought im familiar granblue recent fighting ill tell ya purchase future weird blend wayfinder xenblade chronicle monster hunter pretty order run locked 120 fps tilt dont saw frame drop matter frantic im 13700k 4080 im curious deck shortly cant totally serviceable im enjoying im totally locked ive skip cutscene give summer skipping plot happening accept possible fully understand needing voice scene super animated framed style telling id bit fine character bit silly serious cant middle ground combat great youd expect open area generally look whats offered fine far real microtransactions store battle pas 3d model viewer enemy weapon good chunk 2d art sold separate game day havent endgame im incredibly curious look roadmap continuation look forward spending good bit wish live service knew coming honestly real gripe pick theyre look entire niche outfit look change represent grow power power fantasy gripe ultrawide support bummer weirdly doesnt ps4 5 button layout launched pc port odd ommission already game ui layout exactly controller hand side 4 button diamond ability bumper trigger listed left hand side screen youll exactly matter p controller pc accustomed missing button art dunno good im surprised tail arise recently probably wont touching,3,0.9767

I played the Division 1 and 2, did the grind on Destiny, and grind for god rolls on Destiny 2 on the Season of Wish. 3,000+ Hours for both. I can give the beans and how the content is.


[ PROS ] 
- Decent story it's not the best, not the worse. Better than Days Gone, It's quite fast actually. 10+ Hours it took me, might vary if you are a 100%-er.

- Pretty Graphics, it's no Red Dead Redemption 2, but it's more on the side of Dragon Dogma/Breath Of The Wild. It's nice, and easy.

- The Combat, is hands down is my number 1. From Perfect Parrying/Guard to Perfect Dodges, abilities that give you rewards for doing so. Teamwork is HUGE, and it's pretty. Link-Bursts, Bad-ass Super Moves, it makes you feel like your own anime moment. If you chain your supers with your teams? You get huge bad-ass explosions. 'Nuff said  

- Casual or Min-Maxing, The sigil system which to put it easily, it's Monster Hunter's Perks/Charm system. You can crunch your numbers to the point you have to include raising your Damage Cap.

- The Roster, not to shabby to be honest. You like the heavy hitters? Got them, Fast slashing type of folk? Got it, You like trading blow for blow on the enemy? Got that too, and support. Which by the way, you can use the sigils to make almost all of the roster support, dps, tank, healer.

- Music, well. I made it to end game, and I'll tell you. Those bosses have some real DBZ vocal energy. It's goooooood.

- You can play solo and still have the same fun as with a group. The AI are pretty smart.

- Endgame has some bad-ass bosses, and also pretty challenging. Ranks for difficulty: Easy/Normal/Hard/Very Hard/Maniac/Proud and to get to Proud Rank? It makes you work for it but man is it good.

[ CONS ]

- Matchmaking is..50//50. Looking at like 1-4 minute wait times.

- Semi-Live Service game, not much is known about the future after the content drops. (Three to be exact) After that? It's clouded.

- Grind, if you want to survive in Maniac + Proud. If you are planning to go that high be ready. The grind isn't bad, honestly. Way better than Destiny 2.

- Stupid freaking parrot saying sugoi or very good for the 8395287359827th time after transmuting a sigil.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                 I give it a  8.9/10. A fun game, keeps ya busy good to keep you playing for a time to come. Worth it in my opinion and it leads me

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"TLDR: Has bad translation if you play with JP voice using EN sub. But luckily the game is so good you can probably forgive the bad translation. 

Easily recommended

======================================================================
The Bad:

1. Pretty Horrible English Translation
It's really horrible, if you understand even a bit of Japanese, you will easily get confused because the localizer really like to tell their own story with their own wording instead of just translate it as it is. 
If you understand Japanese a little, often what you heard and what you read will be so different.
It's not just complex sentences, even basic ones got butchered. 

They also like to use unconventional English, modern gen-z English, and pretty out of date slang, which really out of place and ruin immersion.
This is important because some characters portrayed differently from the original because of localizer can't help to keep adding/changing stuff in translation.

Example of the worst yet so far:
(JP): Hmm
(EN): A wishful thinking
Somehow they managed to translated ""Hmm"" into a sentence...

Another examples:
(JP): Exactly
(EN): Exactamundo

(JP): Still talking about that?
(EN): You guys are such a dork

(JP): (dodged thrown spear) That is absurd!!
(EN): (dodged thrown spear) Well that is just happened...

(EN) Often Vryn talks in blabbering childish manner unrecognizable English, can't even understand most part. 

Even sometimes when characters speak formal and common Japanese, they altered it with some slang and impression which made the characters really looks out of place and time.

2. Censored
Yes, they censored/altered several characters outfit by giving them ugly short pants.

3. Some technical issues
People reporting crashing and black screen. I haven't experience any myself.

4. Possible cheaters in co-op mode because there is no anti cheat present at the moment.


The Good:

- The game itself run pretty good on RTX 2060, it's not a resource intensive game
- The graphic is beautiful
- Movement and combat almost feel fluid, but not the level of DMC or Bayoneta
- Good amount of playable characters and every one of them is unique
- Satisfying combat
- Good amount of side content
- Combat is still fun even in higher difficulty
- Co-op

It's just so sad the translation is so bad and has unnecessary censorship ruining the original visual artistic otherwise a good game.
Japanese game companies really need to wake up fast, listen and make games for your the gamer not the localizer.
Such a good game, ruined by horrible localization and censorship.

[list]
[*] Strange localization decisons regarding adding slang and whedonesque writing where there were previously none in the Japanese script, and some character costume changes that were obviously done thanks to Sony's horseshit. Why they felt like they needed to add the whedonesque quips, a reference to Smokey Bear's slogan in one of the quest names, and a Donald Trump MAGA reference in another is beyond me, but literally nobody finds it charming.

[*] Mouse emulating an analog stick, apparently doesn't play nice on non-US layout keyboards. No way to turn off the obnoxious mouse smoothing.

[*] No mouse input in menus. You have to mess around with WASD, Enter, and the left mouse button to navigate anywhere.

[*] No ultrawide or 16:10 support, hardcoded resolution options. You only have the choice of 720p, 900p, 1080p, 1440p, or 2160p, and the game doesn't take whatever display resolution you have. There's more people using ultrawide and 16:10 displays than there are 2160p display users, so the ""muh market share"" argument makes zero sense when you consider that most of these 3D games can support arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios very easily (or at least with some oversight).

[*] Limited graphics options, no DLSS3/XeSS/FSR3, performance could be better. 

At 1080p and max settings, performance isn't bad, but could definitely be better. Performance is about the same on my desktop with a RX 6900XT and i5-13600K, but at 1440p instead of 1080p. I will at least say that GPU Sync (as shown in Intel PresentMon is close to the amount of time it takes to draw a frame (Which is a good thing), and from my time looking at a few frame captures in RenderDoc, nothing egregious shows up at first glance. It does not hold a rock solid 120FPS on my gaming laptop at 1080p at least, but it’s still better than the PS5 version performance wise. The game barely even hits a rock solid 30FPS during gameplay with the lowest possible graphics settings at 720p on the Steam Deck, at least without mods.

[*] Only goes up to 120FPS (although I will commend the developers on using doubles for their framelimiter instead of floats or integers, so it's really precise and doesn't have nearly as many rounding errors), and the physics become more stiff the higher you go from 30FPS (Y'know despite the developers shipping the game with a 60FPS performance target in mind lol).

[*] No PlayStation prompts despite claiming the game has native support on the Steam page (apparently you have to disable SteamInput for this, but from my testing, it doesn't work with my DualSense). People claim it has SteamInput support, but no, it’s just using XInput emulation that comes with SteamInput already. The game technically only supports Xbox controllers out of the box.

[*] Cutscenes constantly freezing and softlocking the game. I have personally stumbled across this issue once so far.

[*] It's crashing for a bunch of people and refusing to start up for others. A couple patches have released to help this, but startup times are still abnormally long.

[*] Region locking for matchmaking based on the current region that is selected for downloading games on Steam (WTF). As a result, matchmaking takes forever.
[/list]
Either this game was stuck in development hell and it shows, the PC port wasn't ready and CyGames did not release a demo on PC for that reason (something to hide), or from their past record with mediocre PC releases on Steam they don't give a single shit about UX on PC. There's no reason the game should be in the state it's in for $60-80, even if the game underneath was absolutely worth the 6 year wait. These things absolutely mar an otherwise great game in the year of 2024.

Now with the current issues out of the way, the game looks nice, has fast loading times (outside of when the game starts up where it takes it’s sweet time), and has spatial audio at least. The gameplay is great, and the story is alright for what's essentially a tie-in game that compliments the mobile game, finished it and it took around 15 hours or so to finish the main story. Rolan is a badass.

And on the topic of mods to help mitigate some of the current issues, for those wanting an ultrawide fix, the FPS to have it's cap moved up to 240FPS, 16:10 support on the Steam Deck, and support for resolutions higher than 4K (on PC) or lower than 720p (on the Steam Deck), check out Lyall's mod for this game. With it and with a 960x600 custom resolution, you can actually lock to 40FPS on the Steam Deck without many dips. It also expands the top and bottom with aspect ratios narrower than 16:9, so you can have a proper experience on the Deck without black bars:

Very well,
I won't look a gift horse in the mouth.

Please explain to me, in which way this is not changing what the real phrase should be? And also, the ""raw"" translation makes more sense then adding this ""context"".

And this is one example. The game pretty much changes everything. And if you still don't believe me, go looking for other reviews, even positive ones, people give more examples than this...

Again, for someone who knows a Japanese, this is making wonder if I'm mistranslating it in my head or they are butchering the real japanese dub.

The game is [b]GORGEOUS[/b]. Absolutely amazing. I've been waiting for it for about 6 years since I saw the trailer, and was not disappointed, it looks fantastic.

[h3]Performance[/h3]
While I feel the pain in some reviews, I am yet to experience any problems at all. The game runs smooth, 120fps, not dips, no lag, no issues. I run also with v-sync 60, smooth.
No crashes, no problems. But this is me, does not mean the game doesn't need fixing. Please keep an eye for the patch and bug fixes if you have this problems, I hope your pain goes away when they fix it fellow PC Master Racers.

The translation sucks, it must have been done before the whole debacle...
For someone who knows Japanese, but still needs subtitles for fast or difficult phrases it's very cringe.

They change EVERYTHING, not a single phrase is what it should be.

I would NOT recommend it just for this, and CyGames needs to fix this as soon as possible. Not everyone lives or is from english speaking countries, and the cringe is hard.

Gameplays are fun and need lots of farming. which is fine in mine opinion.
it's like a mix of Monster Hunter style. where you gather materials to upgrade your gears and such. 
the Combat are very flashy and quite (anime-ish) spectacular. 

I don't care much on the Story side. The main campaign story is just very anime trope also Each character comes with a set of their own story called ""fate"" which was read aloud by voice actors plus some individual quests to progress the character.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Previously having issues, I found out that there was a problem with my PC, and somehow was sussed out by GranBlue Relink.

Playing the game, Graphics are crisp and effects are stylish. My experience so fat (up to the first boss) has been quite enjoyable, though I fear from the initial impression that monsters may be a bit of a damage sponge moving forward.

Gameplay is reminiscent of GodEater and Metal Gear Solid: Revengence ( the MemEs jAck!), fights consists of exchanges between blocks and dodges while getting in their safe zones and attacking them where the sun doesn't shine. GBF players would be familiar with many of the Mobs/ Bosses, their fights reimagined in a 3D space where they can finally not blame their weapon grid for when they fail a boss. Oh yeah, it also incorporates GBF's Burst system as well, and it is satisfying to see each time it is executed ( exhaustion pending).

All in all, GBF: Relink is a great fix for those waiting for MH:Worlds, those itching to see how Gran's battles feel like as he adventures across the realms. 

My only gripe is that I wished they allowed gamepad button binding - but I believe developers are aware of this and am working on it.",previously issue found problem pc somehow sussed granblue relink graphic crisp effect stylish fat bos enjoyable fear initial impression monster bit damage sponge moving forward reminiscent godeater metal gear solid revengence meme jack fight consists exchange block dodge safe zone attacking sun shine gbf player familiar mob boss fight reimagined 3d space finally blame weapon grid fail bos oh yeah incorporates gbf burst satisfying executed exhaustion pending gbf relink great fix waiting mh world itching gran battle adventure across realm gripe wished allowed gamepad button binding believe developer aware working,1,-0.91
881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"In the sea of mediocre dogwater games that have been releasing back to back for the last couple years I finally found a game that leaves me with my jaw dropped from the start. Holy moly.

The art direction, the graphics and visual style, the atmosphere and world design, the visual & combat FX... phenomenal.
I feel like I'm really in a fantasy picture book. This feels like when you watch anime and the characters are playing a video game and you're like wow I wish video games were really like that. This one is really like that.

Not only that, the story chapters are so immersive from the cutscenes, to the boss fights and world exploration, to the scripted panning of the camera and event sequences. I don't know how to explain the feeling I have playing through the story but the best I can describe it is that it feels like I'm playing a game in 4D. If you've played so much as the prologue then you know what I'm talking about. 

I'm so tired of playing these story games where you just walk through a soulless generic world doing random tasks that a plumber could do, let alone a hero, and there has really not been one moment where I'm not fully hooked playing this game. I'm not finished with the campaign yet but I'm looking forward to finishing it this weekend and start gearing up my characters to tackle boss fights together with friends and fellow GBF enjoyers online.

P.S.: Yes, I am aware some people are experiencing bugs at the moment. If this concerns you then wait for the first patch / hotfix cause this game is worth it.

P.S.S.: Tbh there is literally no reason to buy the special edition as it gives you no type of unique special edition cosmetics or profile showcases. I'd argue that the special edition actually hurts your overall experience since it gives you a bunch of money, skill points, and upgrade materials that you'd have way more fun coming by naturally. If you want to buy it for the color packs then just buy the base game + color pack 1-3 which will be the same price as the special edition which funny enough comes with color packs 2-3 but not color pack 1.",sea mediocre dogwater game releasing last couple year finally found leaf jaw dropped holy moly art direction graphic visual style atmosphere world design visual combat fx phenomenal fantasy picture book feel watch anime character video wow wish video game chapter immersive cutscenes bos fight world exploration scripted panning camera event sequence explain feeling best describe feel 4d prologue talking tired game walk soulless generic world random task plumber alone hero moment fully hooked finished campaign forward finishing weekend gearing character tackle bos fight friend fellow gbf enjoyer online p yes aware experiencing bug moment concern wait patch hotfix cause worth p tbh literally special edition give type unique special edition cosmetic profile showcase argue special edition hurt give bunch skill point upgrade material fun coming naturally color pack base color pack 1 3 price special edition funny come color pack 2 3 color pack 1,3,0.9786
881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Have not had a JRPG in a long time, was looking to play together with a friend from far away.
Action combat feels nice, art style is good. Sound mediocre at best.

- from the 2nd start of the game, i had 5 crashes to blacksreen
- i had to switch to window mode and since you can only set preset resolutions i play now in small full HD window on my ultra wide 2.5k
- you have to play a bit to get to coop mode, which is not story 
- no matter how we invite each other we can not play, session not there, network error whatever
- looking a bit, seems we suffer from region lock

I personally think it should not be possible to label a game coop such as this on steam this is basic multiplayer for side quests, and region locked should be a must to flag.

As a single player game (thats waht it is) this should be bought on a PS5, even though the graphics are PS4 at max.

Of course you now have more than 2 hours of gameplay after you looked up everything and played the ""intro"" so far, you can not refund it now.
Very clever.

I am absolutely pi$$ed, this is like 120€ down the drain. Of course i can play this solo but sure not in this shitty window.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Early review for people that are interested in an early buy:
My RIG
Ryzen 7 5800X
RTX 3080 10GB VRAM
16GB RAM (running multiple apps in bg)
Ultra settings 2k res
Game is running fairly well, I see a lot of people complaining about game not even launching, IMO skill issue.
There are frame drops in some areas like in the forest it dropped to 90 or in town it dropped 80 from 120.
I feel hardly pressed to complain about it, because it's still smooth, unlike some other releases from last year that would be hiccuping hard even with DLSS turned on and whatnot (like for example Remnant 2).
This could still be improved but is not a major problem since the game is still playing smoothly.

IMPORTANT: Does not feature Ultrawide Support and max refresh rate is 120Hz

Done with performance talk.

I'll combine my demo experience from PS5 with what I played here.
The combat is very satisfying it's kinda of a meld of Platinum Games' and recent aRPG style Final Fantasy games.
Like Platinum games it has very fast paced and fluid combat with cancellable at any time attacks with big dodges (features the limit to the 3rd dodge being slower like in Darksiders for example, you can continue combo after dodging like in PlatGames' tho!).
The animations and character presentation is top notch also not unlike something you would find in a Platinum Games' title.
All characters feel very distinct and have their own quirks and gimmicks, some of them might feel familiar if you played Granblue Versus, like for example Gran/Djeeta feature a chargeable heavy while Narmaya also features a stance.
These gimmicks are at core of each characters gameplay and it is key to utilize them to maximize each characters' potential.
Where the game is similar to Final Fantasy is it features a similar skill wheel, when you hold R1/RB your X/Y/A/B buttons change functionality to allow for ""Skills"" which are self explanatory, starting from a basic fireball, heal or a big sword swing to something like a parry or a team wide buff.
Speaking of teams, game heavily leans on teamwork and has a lot of very interesting features that will be key to playing in coop.
Enemies have a Stun Gauge that when fills up you can activate a Link Attack simultaneously with another character (or in COOP with a player) and will fill a Link gauge that when full will buff the entire party.
This gauge is filled through other different means, one of them is Skybound Arts.
This is essentially a Super meter not unlike in a fighting game, once you're at 100% you can activate a Skybound Art which will deal significant damage HOWEVER
The more interesting part is that using Skybound Arts will fill other characters/PLAYERS Skybound Arts gauges that can be further combo'd and if all 4 characters use their Skybound Art they will activate Chain Burst.
This Chain Burst will not only damage but also stun the enemy for inexplicably long time and is key for getting higher ranks on your quests.
Mastering all these mechanics is the meat of this game and provides the depth and satisfaction to an otherwise already very competent aRPG.

Story? No comment, I have only 40 minutes so far but it seems at the very least interesting and the characters are very vibrant and likeable.
Even if the story turns out to not be great, the mechanics and presentation is already great enough to be at least a satisfying game,",early interested early rig ryzen 7 5800x rtx 3080 10gb vram 16gb ram running multiple apps bg ultra setting 2k re running fairly complaining launching imo skill issue frame drop area forest dropped 90 town dropped 80 120 hardly pressed complain smooth unlike release last hiccuping hard dl turned whatnot example remnant 2 improved major problem smoothly important ultrawide support max refresh rate 120hz performance talk combine demo ps5 combat satisfying kinda meld platinum game recent arpg style final fantasy game platinum game fast paced fluid combat cancellable attack big dodge feature limit 3rd dodge slower darksiders example continue combo dodging platgames tho animation presentation top notch unlike platinum game title character distinct quirk gimmick familiar granblue versus example gran djeeta chargeable heavy narmaya feature stance gimmick core character key utilize maximize character potential similar final fantasy feature similar skill wheel hold r1 rb x button functionality allow skill self explanatory starting basic fireball heal big sword swing parry wide buff speaking team heavily lean teamwork interesting feature key coop enemy stun gauge fill activate link attack simultaneously coop fill link gauge buff entire party gauge filled different mean skybound art essentially super meter unlike fighting 100 activate skybound art deal significant damage interesting skybound art fill character player skybound art gauge combo 4 character skybound art activate chain burst chain burst damage stun enemy inexplicably long key higher rank quest mastering mechanic meat provides depth satisfaction otherwise already competent arpg comment 40 minute far interesting character vibrant likeable turn great mechanic presentation already great satisfying,3,0.9537

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"This game has one of the best battle ever created in action JRPG.

You dont need to babysit the AI, the AI has been built very-very good. They always cast spell, attack the boss, or tanking them. But it's better if you play co-op.

The boss fight though, so MMORPG like FF14's boss fight. They have ability that can sweep maps, etc. Super fun and challenging.

The best content in this game is 'end-game content', it's very good, play it co-op dont play alone.

No, it's not open world, it's like 'dungeon crawling' but not much dungeon crawling, especially if you like Monster Hunter. The exploration in this game is a 'standard', not much exciting, just normal.

Sadly, for those who dont play Granblue Fantasy (the mobile game) you will confused about the story if you only want enjoy the story from cinematic and dont want to read it. They've already gave it to Fate Episodes. At least, watch the S1 anime to know Gran and the protagonists better.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"TL;DR: Worth full price if you love Action based JRPG games with character interactions. Absolutely a must-buy if you were also waiting for this game since 2016 or later. A flawed masterpiece. Lived up to my personal high expectations so I highly recommend this game.

As someone who has waited for this game since 2016 when it was first announced, this game is an absolutely flawed [b]masterpiece[/b] that lived up to my 8 years of high expectations. If you are on the same boat as me or if you're a big JRPG fan like me who loves character interactions and flashy combat with substance, this is an absolute must-buy. You dont even need to have played any of the Granblue games as the game comes equipped with a glossary that you can open mid-conversation to read to know the lore if you want to. It even comes with 'Fate Episodes' that tells you the detailed backstory of each of the characters as well as a journal that gives you a synopsis of each character too. So dont worry about being out of the loop!

Some notable day 1 flaws (which hopefully will be patched down the line) are stuff like not being able to rebind controller buttons, no option to swap button prompts to the PlayStation prompts despite the game being able to support DS4/5 controllers out of the box without Steam input and the audio being strangely low volumed for whatever reason. Cmon guys, its 2024. Some of your fellow Japanese competing companies have already implemented either auto-detection or an option to swap to PlayStation prompts. Get with the program already, sheesh. Not everyone plays with an Xbox controller.

Story:
We're tossed into non-stop action back to back with some gaps in between. So far the game has been very well paced in terms of story, and its quite an action packed narrative.

Combat:
Absolutely smooth and damn near perfect. Its responsive and snappy, its got all the flashy fireworks and teamwork/team interactions you can expect from an anime styled Action JRPG game. 

Its almost on the same level as Bayonetta series. Almost. Common things that this game shares with Bayonetta series are being able to smoothly dodge cancel any attacks while still being able to continue your combo/charged attack the same way the Bayonetta series allows you to. Every single character has their own unique playstyle and while some may share the same archetype like caster or combo attacker or the combo into charged attacker, all the characters vary different enough from each other that you will find yourself enthralled in the combat system. 

Performance: 
Its perfect for me, though depending on your rig, your mileage may vary as this is the huge bottleneck as to why most reviews day 1 are negative leading to a mixed score. Besides that, the game ran absolutely smoothly with no stutters or crashes and with a constant stable 120 FPS (you can toggle between 30, 60 or 120 only). Such a feat is worth mentioning as most modern games so far have released with hilarious amounts of performance issues.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"The localization in this game is an absolute travesty.

They changed ""races"" to ""peoples"". Can anyone explain to me how the hell does ""種族"" (shuzoku) translates as ""people"" when it can only be read as race, tribe, species, and family??? 

Here's an example of how it's being used:

Glossary of Skydwellers: ""The denizens of the sky. They are broadly divided into four ""peoples"", each with distinct physical characteristics: Humans, Draphs, Erunes, and Harvins. After overthrowing the Astrals in the great War, skydwellers adapted the technology of their former oppressors to build their own complex civilizations"".

It is also being used as the Glossary tab, for the four races. The problem here, is that Humans, Erunes, Harvins, and Draphs are explicitly mentioned as ""races"" in the JP script and the source material.

""Zinkenstill Island is but one of many numerous islands that dot the Phantagrande Skydom. These islands are home to four races who were once bitter rivals but then unified as one against the aggression of the Astrals."" -Granblue Fantasy Official Website.

So in the world of Granblue Fantasy, they're the equivalent of Caucasian, Asian, etc in our world. They share the same language, and pretty much the same history, with the differing factor being the islands/archipelagos may have their own specific locale or culture. Can someone explain to me what's wrong with the word ""race"", or why the localizers seems so keen to avoid it?

Do mind that this is just one of the most blatant one that I found so far after finishing the prologue. There are DOZENS of lines being deliberately mistranslated and/or omitted from the localization. One example that stuck in my head is that in one of the dialogues, Gran explicitly describes Rosetta as a mature, beautiful woman, but guess what? It was somehow conveniently being completely left out from the English ""translation"".

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Feb 3 - 12:15 am - patch dropped and immediately had no logo loading issue / cutscene i was stuck at loaded perfectly fine. recommendation moved to yes for the below mentioned good points. will potentially expand further on the review as i play further into the game.

this review is posted on Feb 1, 2024; at the time of writing i only give this game a thumbs down due to technical issues and would otherwise recommend it given future patches fixing current issues.

I can not in good faith recommend this game at the moment, not because i don't like it.

when the game runs, it's an extremely good time, with a lot of care put into the audio-visuals and general gamefeel. Progression seems like it will feel nice, gameplay is intuitive and feels good all around, with elements of the phone game it originates from being plentiful in ways that are well implemented.

however, at the time of writing, the game took roughly 30 minutes of effort to get to even boot past logos and even then it's a coin toss on whether or not it loads properly after that. Even still, after you get into the game you are at unknown risk to crashes that [seemingly] originate from cutscenes. all of the community ''fixes'' are  grasping at straws at best, some working for some others not. 

i'd say approximately an hour of my ''playtime'' is likely just wading through the game being unresponsive. That, on top of multiplayer region lock on *specifically* the steam port of the game is more than enough to hold off on buying.

the only other con i have at this time is a mild gripe with localization. I personally don't care if localizers take creative liberty on phrasing given that the original intent / 'vibe' of a line or character writing is retained or elevated in some way, it's innocuous most of the time. In this game it feels like localization occasionally loses the original 'tone' conveyed, but it's not a make or break thing.

tldr; if you wanna spin the wheel on whether or not you will have playability issues, it's a real good time. Otherwise don't risk it until Cygames puts out a patch that demonstrably fixes the above.

730,Counter-Strike 2,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.

I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.

2161700,Persona 3 Reload,"Persona 3 is a very special game to me. Back in 2008, I randomly was looking for things to play during the summer break and decided to play Persona 3 FES which also introduced me to the overall Shin Megami Tensei franchise. As a teen who usually played puzzle, FPS and platformers during that time, the game was unique to me as it delves into complex themes such as death, identity, and the meaning of life which was something a high schooler would never usually give a second thought. It also paved way for me to look at and start reading visual novels which is one of my favorite consumable medias.

I know this isn't a review of the game specifically but this game is one of the few games that shaped me as a person today and I am glad to experience it again with QoL improvements, better graphics and improved gameplay because let's be honest, Persona 3, P3 FES and P3 Portable isn't a fun game to play anymore with everything that Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal had to offer gameplay wise. This version of the game at least makes the overall dungeon crawling aspect of the game bearable. 

There's a few things I don't like about how Sega bundled the Soundtrack and Digital Artbook as a Program and not their usual respectable file types but this game is an absolute gem.",persona 3 special 2008 randomly thing summer break decided persona 3 fe introduced shin megami tensei franchise teen usually puzzle fps platformers unique delf complex theme death identity meaning life high schooler usually thought paved look reading visual novel favorite consumable medias specifically game shaped today glad qol improvement graphic improved honest persona 3 p3 fe p3 portable fun anymore persona 4 golden persona 5 royal offer wise version make dungeon crawling aspect bearable thing sega bundled soundtrack digital artbook program usual respectable file type absolute gem,2,0.9744

So far it's faithful remake to original P3, faithfulnes comes with a cost of welcomed features from later entires. 

It adds completly new ideas and at the same time regressing few steps back in terms of features introduced in later games. One of new features is:
Theurgy, powerful skill specific to character with character specifc conditions to use it,while removing much welcome features like benched party members earning exp or switch party members mid combat
Features like skill inheritance or ability to see fusion forecast are present tho

[b]I'll update this review with complete verdict once I finish the game.[/b]


Game has some issues noticeable in the beginning hour.
There's a word some ppl crashed on sneak attack tutorial but I'm still before 1st combat atm of this review.
Update #1: I didn't crash, more details below

There're some changes in beginning 1h:
- free roam sections in place of/before cutscenes in original e.g you can free roam a bit before entering the dorm (and chosing a name) for first time,
- ingame cutscences like P5,
- dialog changes,
- new intro alongside with it's theme song,
- certain tracks are rearranged e.g Iwatodai Dorm theme
Personaly I think it's on par if not [i]a little[/i] better than original

Worth noting that certain scences or events have been changed e.g ""that"" beach scene. 
There are rainbows in certain places in case you're bothered by it - pins on students bags or painted on monorails.

Update #1: Just reached combat section in Tartarus
There has been certrain very drastic framrate drops in certain places:
- first combat on the roof game stutters slightly when enemies get hit
this doesn't happen later on, only in this place so far,
- upon entering Paulownia Mall for first time framerate drops very drasticly to ~20fps or below 15 fps even to almost unplayable degree
[b]the fix seems to be turning off the reflections[/b],
- Entrance section of Tartarus (the place when you choose part members before going into dungeon crawling etc.) drops to ~30 fps,
-lack subtitles in some places - idle chatter during cutscenes and flashbacks aren't subbed
flashback lack subs due to dialog format (no dialog bubbles like in P5),
- attacking enemies (notably performing sneak attack) during dungeon crawling casues multiple light stutters as game transitions to combat. This might be the cause of crashes for some ppl

Despite those performance drops game is stable for ~90% of the time I would say. 
Your mileage may vary depending on your tolerance for stutters and occasional framerate drops.
Positive review still stands

Update #2: After playing for a while with [b]reflections turned off[/b] many performance issues like stutters disappeared. Even areas with fps drops like entrance area of Tartarus started keeping stable 60 fps.",2023 pc port disaster stable 60 fps high setting intel 5 10400f gtx super 1660 16 gb ram occasional shader compilation stutter far faithful remake original p3 faithfulnes come cost welcomed feature entire add completly new idea regressing step term feature introduced game new feature theurgy powerful skill specific specifc condition removing welcome feature benched party member earning exp switch party member mid combat feature skill inheritance fusion forecast present tho complete verdict finish issue noticeable beginning word ppl crashed sneak attack tutorial 1st combat atm 1 crash detail change beginning 1h roam section cutscenes original e g roam bit entering dorm chosing name ingame cutscences p5 dialog change new intro alongside theme song certain track rearranged e g iwatodai dorm theme personaly par original worth noting certain scences event changed e g beach scene rainbow certain place case bothered pin student bag painted monorail 1 reached combat section tartarus certrain drastic framrate drop certain place combat roof stutter slightly enemy happen far entering paulownia mall framerate drop drasticly 20fps 15 fps unplayable degree fix turning reflection entrance section tartarus choose member dungeon crawling drop 30 fps lack subtitle place idle chatter cutscenes flashback subbed flashback lack sub due dialog format dialog bubble p5 attacking enemy notably performing sneak attack dungeon crawling casues multiple light stutter transition combat cause crash ppl despite performance drop stable 90 mileage vary depending tolerance stutter occasional framerate drop positive stand 2 reflection turned performance issue stutter disappeared area fps drop entrance tartarus started keeping stable 60 fps,0,-0.9262

2161700,Persona 3 Reload,"If you're going to ask for full game price for a remake, I expect quality and effort. So far, I've been disappointed. I'm fine with some things not being animated cutscenes that were in the original, but in key moments, like Orpheus awakening, not having the hand drawn animated cutscene feels awful. Sure, they had a rendered cutscene, but it just isn't the same. The remixed songs have mostly been not great, which is a shame because I really enjoyed the original's soundtrack. I'm mostly fine with the art direction, however, not drawing the protagonist's clothes feels lazy. There's just a shadow over the clothes. Also, there still isn't a definitive way to play this game, which a remake should have fixed. There's no female protagonist option, no The Answer, and no Desert of Doors. Junpei doesn't sound as good or as young as he did in the original game. The recommended specs are from 10 years ago and yet, I get framerate dips on my hardware that's 5 years old in the dorm room or when literally any combat effect happens. I'm going to continue to play the game because the frustrating thing about FES and the original was not being able to control your party members and this game gives you that, but so does Portable.

[h1]The Guide[/h1]
Soo, due to the steam restriction on the character limit for reviews, I will be putting the following points into a Guide:
[list]
[*] Free to play - why this game has a great monetization model and you don't have to worry about being ripped off.
[*]The Story - yes this game has a story, one which will entertain you for quite some time, combined with all the 'character quests'
[*]The Star Chart - or The World of this game and what to expect of it
[*]The Factions - and the characters which inhibit this galaxy
[*]The Gameplay - which is obviously the most important part here and reasons you will sink hours on hours of your life into this game
[*]The Visuals - the beauty this work of art is
[*]The Sound - and how far you can take it
[/list]
If that is too much reading for you, go ahead and finish this off with my personal verdict and then form your own opinion.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1409926603

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
If you get through the harsh beginning, where you will lack a guiding hand this game will suck you in.
Once the game catches you into its flow of daily activities like the login reward and the sorties - 3 mission endgame action - and keeps you there with hourly temptations like alerts and new void rifts, you will become lost in space and time will just fly by.
Warframe is not without flaws, but it is steadily being worked on and being improved, the devs neither lack creativity nor daring, to try new things.
Although it's easy to forget - this game doesn't cost you any cash, so just give it some time and see what it can give you back.

230410,Warframe,"If you're here at the crossroads asking yourself ""Destiny 2 or Warframe?"" - then perhaps this review might clear a few things up for you!

To start with I have around 190 hours at the time of writing review and I approximately started playing Warframe around 3 weeks ago. I initially was looking for a game to keep me occupied whilst waiting for the Destiny 2 PC release.

Now I played Destiny 1 non-stop, I mean I grinded that game so hard for 4 months, achieved absolutely everything possible, obtained everything and then never touched it again. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED those 4 months. But this isn't a review about Destiny, but rather about Warframe... And man is it a good game!

Warframe at times can feel a bit overwhelming, there certainly isn't  the type of hand-holding that Bungie provide you with in Destiny. Whilst this hand holding can seem helpful at the start, it soon turns into a glass ceiling. Forcing you to go in a particular direction or playstyle - there is non of this in Warframe. 

In Warframe the universe is an open book and you approach it however you would like. There is a general linear progression to the missions, you unlock one planet move onto a next and so on, but warframe really lets you choose how you tackle this. The weapon system in Warframe is a prime example of how open it is: You can pick a starter gun, and because of 100's of mods available, this starter weapon can still kick a** in mid to end game! Every Primary, secondary and melee weapon feels unique and there are so many ways to alter these weapons: Want a machine gun that sets enemies alight? No problem, just add a Fire Mod! Want a bow that fires 2 arrows instead of 1? No problem, add a multi-shot mod! Want both of those? No problem, add both mods!

That's just the weapons, wait till you try the warframes! There are about 30 or so different warframes (basically characters) and each has 4 unique abilities. Each warframe is suited to a particular purpose: You like to control the sea and summon a Kraken to throw enemies about? Hydroid's your guy! You like to set every enemy on fire and watch the world burn? Ember's who you're after! Want to heal the rest of your teammates and be the lifeline of the team? Trinity is here! And guess what? Yepp, you can mod these just like you mod the weapons: Want more shield on your tanky Rhino warframe? No problem, we got that! Want more energy to keep using your abilities? Eyyy yepp that too! And that's just 2 examples out of hundreds!

Companions I heard you say? Oh yeah well in Destiny you have a futuristic rubix cube who attempts to make jokes. Whilst in Warframe you have about 6 different companions, 4 war wolves, some cat/fox breed and an epic looking alien bull! All of which have their unique abilities and purpose... And yes you guessed it: You can also mod them!

Next is customisation... Now wow oh wow is this impressive. Warframe lets you customise pretty much about everything. On a warframe you can add skins, you can add armor pieces, you can add sigils (tattoo type things), you can add capes, you can change helmet style and you can change the colour of every single one of these pieces and aspects. The same goes for your companions and weapons. Also you can customise the colour and skin of your ship, you can even change the colour of the walls inside your ship! There's ALOT to customise in this game, it's quite impressive.

Now at this stage you're probably saying: ""Yeah well I heard you gotta buy in-game currency to get access to this awesome stuff."" Incorrect! Warframe has a whole in-game market/trading system that often fuels the crafting system. Meaning that you can sell the drops you get from certain missions to other players for the in-game currency. Or you can keep it for yourself and once you've got all the bits you can craft it! Either way you will eventually earn platinum and be able to buy the epic stuff you wanted.

Lastly, the community. This is perhaps one of the nicest and most pleasant social aspects of Warframe. The community is so close, kind and caring. People have always helped me and some even gave me free stuff! This really is unique in an online game and boy is it nice to see.

All in all, I came to Warframe to keep me occupied and now I'm hooked. I STRONGLY recommend you try Warframe, you will not be disappointed. Great work DE!


* EDIT 1: Thank you all for your thumbs up, feedback and comments! I'll do my best to answer a few valid points that I've seen come up in the past week or in the comments.

1) ""Certain Warframes are OP"" - Well Yes and No, I don't think the term over-powered can be used here. I think certain Warframes are more USEFUL than others, but then again that will entirely depend on what mission or purpose you are doing. For example: Sure I can run through a difficult Spy mission with Ember (an incredibly offensive fire based Warframe) but I will have an easier and smoother time tackling it with Ash (a stealthy, silent, single target based Warframe).

It's also important to remember that a Warframe, weapon or even companion is only as powerful as the mods you put on it. Meaning that you can completely transform a warframe from something ""meh"" to something godly just by using the right mods, and good ones too! But remember, the better the mods, the harder they are to find / more expensive they are to buy with plat!

2) ""The graphics are horrible"" - I'm going to use World of Warcraft to demonstrate my point here (I'm sure there are many other examples, but WoW is the one I can think of right now!): - World of Warcraft is a long-running game and like in Warframe, the often beginner areas (which were created right at the start of the game) look barren and terrible. This is somewhat true about the first few planets in Warframe, certain areas at the start look lifeless and without depth BUT as you progress, the planets become more detailed and graphically nicer.

Furthermore, recently DE just remastered Earth (the first planet) and it looks MUCH nicer! So be patient, DE definitely know that certain areas look crud and they are working on it I'm sure! I expect more planets will get a make-over just like Earth in the near future.

3) ""Plains of Eidolon is boring and filled with bugs "" - Okay sure, Plains of Eidolon (the newest, semi-open world area) is not entirely what we expected but think of this: This is the first time DE have attempted anything like it, they clearly said prior to the release that they were expecting feedback and will continue to add more content to PoE. They are a small studio and don't necessarily have the resources that large studios like Blizzard or Activision might have. Give them time, give them feedback and be patient. I am almost certain that in the coming weeks DE will be adding more content and tweaking the existing stuff to make it smooth and enjoyable.

Also, Plains of Eidolon is not meant to be the bulk of the game, there are still many other planets and things to do! It's just a new area in an existing planet. Everyone chill and give DE some room to breathe and work things out, they have in the past and they will do so now too.

230410,Warframe,"This story requires a bit of setup.

Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a ""Grandmaster"" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.

Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.

On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now.

We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.

I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for).

Thanks, Digital Extremes.

230410,Warframe,"First, good things about Warframe:

This game has spoiled me. I will no longer accept anything less than this from any game developer. Be it AAA or indie.

This game is free. Get it? Free. You are not required to spend a single penny in order to experience the full content of the game. All characters, quests and environments are fully disclosed to you on their due time. That being said, I HAVE spent money on this. Why? Cosmetics of course. Fashion is endgame you know?

Now, just what is Warframe? Warframe is a mostly PVE third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay. You have seen games do parkour before of course, but these are space ninjas we're talking about, which means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bullets, rockets and/or high-energy plasma, or just take out your trusty sword/hammer/fists and cripple anything in your path.

What will you face? Humanoids, robots, aliens, you name it. Yes, there are bosses, and they can and will kick your butt.
What will you face them with? Hundreds, and I mean HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from. Each of them unique in its own way, and deeply customizable to suit your needs and/or taste. You can carry three of them at a time. A primary weapon (bow, rifle, etc), a secondary weapon (pistol, throwing knives, and... other things), and of course a melee weapon.

Now, you can always tear through the game solo, but, for the best experience, the game pairs you with up to three other players in missions ranging from a stealthy rescue in the overgrown jungles of Earth, to an all-out extermination in the frozen wastelands of Pluto.
But doing missions is just one part of it, you also have a widely explorable open-world area, with its own assortment of missions waiting for you. And this open-world thing is only going get bigger in future updates. Oh and the updates, they are a regular thing. Like, every other day.

Now what's the story? Can't tell you. Its a secret. No, really, the game community is super protective of the game lore. There is a certain point in the game where you will KNOW, and then we can talk about it, but until then, you gotta find out for yourself. For now just consider yourself a space ninja.

How about difficulty? Scales up with your level, just like most modern mmos. The game will be just as hard as you want to handle. If you want to go at it casually, there's content for you. If you're looking for a challenge, good news, the enemy level can scale up almost infinitely.

------------------------------------
Now, bad things about warframe:

-PVP sucks
-Grinding, lots of grinding.
-There are some cool aspects of the game that are seemingly abandoned and/or have been in development hell for ages.
-Your inventory slots are limited, and you can buy more by using the premium currency. While technically you do not need to buy more slots, since you can simply sell what you don't need or want, it is a huge temptation and it is the most likely reason why you will buy platinum, if you ever do.

------------------------------------
About grinding. This is both a good and bad thing about the game. Most will consider grinding a bad thing but here it's a little diferent. In Warframe, the grind is integratd into the core objective of the game. Grinding is what you do to pass the time. It is so integrated into the game world that you don't really notice it. So yeah, there is a lot of grinding, but you have fun while doing it.
------------------------------------

Final thoughts.

Now, I'm not saying warframe should be game of the year or anything (more like game of the decade), but the level of attention and communication that Digital Extremes (the game devs) has with the warframe community and the display of love for their own game is absolutely marvelous. These people are setting a new standard for the gaming industry, and I can only see good things in the future for them.

In conclusion, we don't deserve Warframe.

Also, you can have a space dog/cat, and PET THEM. 10/10

230410,Warframe,"I've been playing Warframe for a very long time since 2013, been hating it, fanboying over it then hating again. Despite all the negative aspects of this game I still recommend trying it out. 

 I'll leave it recommended to play, but let me tell you... 

- Don't bother understanding this game if you've never played looter in your life, the amount of grind this game requires is humongous especially in ""open world"" areas. 
- The game is not newbie friendly and it won't hold your hand explaining every aspects, you'll have to manually find answers in codex and wiki, and there's way too much to learn as most of Warframe aspects are quite unique and can't be learned through playing other games alike. 
- Warframe as looters tend to be, is a very repetitive game, you'll often find yourself doing same thing over and over again be it farming resources, warframes, mods etc.
- Over last 2-3 years developers seems to be running out of ideas and creativity, with copypasta open world content, to very buggy and plain boring new mechanics and bosses releases. Development of the game nearly stopped and the focus of the game is now to monetize skins, before we hit 1 decent update around 70 new skins are released.
- Game doesn't have any dungeons, raids , good crafting systems (altho it has crafting in OW areas I wouldn't call it anything good or even close to be crafting) 


The prime time in WF development was around 2015-2016 when they kept pushing the story and new content with it. I would highly recommend you to play thru the Quest system in Warframe, it's locked inside of progression system but quick google/youtube search could guide you how to start playing thru Quests within 10-15 hours of gameplay. 

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

- So graphics, this game doesn't have ""real cool shit"" to blow your mind, the graphics are not the prime of this game, however, what compliments it is - unique play models (warframes) and solid optimization, this game can run on potato, beleive me, I've tried. 

Overall 7/10 

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

- Monetization is alright, I would say revolutionary, compared to EA, Activision etc.
I'ts pretty fair, you can even get yourself 50/75% off deals from time to time when you log-in 
Game is not greedy and doesn't force you to spend money to progress or lock you behind paywalls. It's truly a free-to-play experience if you want it to be. 
Altho you can instantly buy Warframes, Weapons and skins/costumizations the core game is 100% playable and you can get all of it's content for free, except skins, but... 
Warframe has trading and you can trade the stuff you farmed for premium currency. 

So the monetization balance is fair for everyone, if you can spend alot of time playing it you'll get rich, or if you can't spend time playing the game but still want to progress faster you can dump few bucks and speed it up. 

Overall 9/10 

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

- Gameplay is quite interesting which blures it's repetitiveness, you have bunch of unique Warframes, weapons, powers and this game is really trying to make you as powerful as possible, like clearing your screen with one button tap - that's Warframe. 

In time this degrades and new Warframes look just like another one but either weaker or overpowered. Game doesn't really improve in mission types, we still have the same stuff as we had before with minor additions and I just can't find a random lobby for archwing/railjack missions as no one plays them. 

Overall 7/10 

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

- Game lore, this game has pretty massive one I'll give it that, for a looter-shooter game it has pretty nice and unique story which you'll find in Quest cinematics and codex.
I've really enjoyed playing thru all of them and even if you don't like grind you can set it aside and play this game solely for it's quests. 

The devs however got pretty lazy with updating their story as it doesn't monetize their game enough so updates on it take years, while other games with less staff giving bigger and passionate updates. 

For what we have 8/10

230410,Warframe,"I'm bored of this game. I can barely play it. A lot of the new content is more of the same. This is a common theme between veterans, as you can see from several negative reviews from people with 1k+ hours into the game.

HOWEVER...

If someone played a game for this many hours and stopped because of the lack of content, it's not due to the game being unfun. The average player will find the game quite entertaining for the most part. There's just too high of an expectation of being able to play a game 10 hours a day and not get burnt out.

It's an amazing game. By the time you are bored, you'll have spent more time in this game than you'd ever have on several ""AAA"" titles combined. And it's free. The monetization is absolutely fair (and extremely cheap).

230410,Warframe,"Seeing as Tennocon just happened a few days ago, and has been gathering a lot interests since then, i think it would be a good idea to finally make a review on this thing. I mean i have like, what, [b]1500 hours[/b] on this game, so i think i qualified to talk about this game.

[h1]What is this game even[/h1]
Warframe is a third person PvE loot shooter, where its about collecting resources and items to craft new guns and armor so you can kill things in more ways. You play as a ""Warframe"", which are basically space ninjas. Each Warframe comes with a set of abilities to make them all special, and their mobility allows them to get across the stages with ease, and will become second nature before you know it.

[h1]Whats the bloody goal of the game[/h1]
Unlike most games, Warframe doesn't have a traditional progression system. All weapons and Warframes can only reach level 30, which you can easily get in a hour or two. However, your total rank (known as mastery rank) only ranks up when you level up new gear, and some items are locked behind a mastery rank. This means that it doesn't take long for new players to reach the highest level with their gear, with encouraging them to try new things as they play the game.

[h1]So hows the customization[/h1]
This is one of warframes strongest points. Pretty much all weapons and Warframe can be modded in any way you like. Wanna make your Warframe super tanky? Or maybe give his abilities alot of power for better damage? Thats all up to you. This makes the game extremely replayable, as you can experiment with different builds for your gear.
You can also change the look of your items for [b]maximum fashion,[/b] even as a new people.

[h1]It's free to play, meaning it has microtransactions...[/h1]
Lucky, warframe is one of the very best when it comes to this, Almost all items can be bought from the games shop, but they cost alot compared to how easy some of them are. Its as if the game says: ""Look, i get it, you dont wanna work to get that shotgun, but its gonna cost you quite a bit to buy it.."" The main you will be buying is instead things like weapon slots, warframe slots, boosters, accessories and so on. Theres also a trading system in the game, and it allows you to trade using the game's premium currency, giving the game its own economy.


[h1]Alright, that's good and all, but what are the cons[/h1]
Even tho i just said the game is ""extremely replayable"", this is still a loot shooter, meaning there will be grinding at times. Sometimes its not so bad, other times it goes a [b]bit[/b] beyone extreme. If games with grinding doesn't suit you at all, maybe you wanna skip this one. But hey, i've over 1000 hours on the game, and im still able to enjoy the game most of the time.

[h1]Ze End[/h1]
So thats my short review of the game.

Before I can get into the nitty-gritty and answer the question of ""Should I play Warframe?"" let it be known that it's impossible to review the entirety of this game with the restriction imposed by Steam's review format. There are too many systems within it to cover them all. We can talk about what works and what doesn’t as a whole, but to truly dissect them we’d need one of those 6-hour-long YouTube videos that are all the rage these days.

The short answer: Yes, you should play it. It’s free, a lot of fun and doesn’t make you feel terrible if you never spend money on it. The long answer; here we go!

[h1]The good[/h1]
[h2] Audio, Visuals, Gameplay, Variety[/h2]

Warframe is an MMO, co-op, third-person shooter, taking place in our very own solar system, at an unimaginably distant point in time, where two major factions vie for control in the aftermath of a great war. Players take on the role of the Tenno – ancient warriors now needed more than ever to keep balance within the universe and protect innocents from the new war they find themselves in. The Tenno operate the titular Warframes, battlesuits with exceptional combat prowess, agility, and space magic.

After choosing your Warframe, you’re dropped into a tutorial where you learn the basics of Warframe’s excellent combat and movement systems. You get a primary, secondary, and melee weapon, and can switch between them on the fly. Each Warframe also has four unique abilities, ie. space magic. Although the game doesn’t have a combo meter, it is very evocative of Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, and similar hack-n-slash games. The movement is cathartic, as you can glide through the air, run on walls, slide, twirl, and generally parkour all over the place. It’s a lot of fun.

After the tutorial, you get your very own spaceship, from which you’ll be able to fly across the galaxy and participate in the abundant content Warframe offers. You can visit all of the planets in the Solar system, and then some. While some of them have open-world areas, the majority of Warframe’s game modes you’ll get to play will be standalone missions, such as Survival, Defense, Assassination, Excavation, etc. As you do so, you will be awarded crafting resources and blueprints on which to use them, usually for crafting new weapons and Warframes. You’ll also be awarded Mods, which you can equip on your equipment to modify its various stats.

You’ll also notice just how beautiful of a game Warframe is, with visuals that make me wonder just how in the world they keep the system requirements as low as they are. There are issues with how lighting works, as certain surfaces can be blindingly bright, but turn off Bloom and you should be good. The audio production is similarly brilliant, with excellent sound design that makes the combat punchy and satisfying, regardless of which weapon you’re using. It’s amazing how every single weapon, no matter if it’s a primary, secondary, or melee, can be auditorily distinct from another, and still sound amazing. The soundtrack has a fitting track for every situation, ranging from ethereal chants when the game is being mysterious, to faster-paced, drum-driven ones that compliment the combat. There’s a bit of inconsistency to it, as some are memorable enough to become known even outside of the game, while others are just something you probably won't think about outside of the moment it's playing.

[h1]The bad[/h1]
[h2]Progression, Difficulty, Story Quests, Design Philosophy[/h2]

So, after you’ve gotten acquainted with your ship and everything you can do around it, maybe progressed through a couple of planets, and tried doing a quest or two, the game opens up and provides very little information on what you’re supposed to do next. Don’t bother with figuring it out on your own, as that’ll only put you off. Look to the wiki and save yourself unnecessary frustration. After the first…40 hours, the game will click. You’ll find a weapon that works for you and continue progressing through the Star map, acquiring more gear and knowledge on the game as you go along, and getting to complete more and more story quests.

If you’re smart, unlike I was, you should probably stop around 400-500 hours, as Warframe’s problems become more apparent as progression continues. I believe that, first and foremost, Warframe was designed to keep player base retention. You may think that every game is, but no. As a free-to-play title, Warframe most likely relies on players to keep coming back; as they invest more and more time into it, the more likely they are to invest money as well. Other, paid titles, won’t mind how many hours you put in since you pay up-front. Warframe isn’t bad in this regard, as pretty much anything that can be bought with Platinum (the game's premium currency) can be grinded for, as you can trade Platinum with other players, so there’s a strong trading economy at play here - but you wouldn't know it from the in-game market. 

The very progression is stop-and-go, as each piece of gear has its own level. As you level them up, so does your overall account level, called Mastery, increase – granting you access to more content and weapons. You’re encouraged to keep swapping between them, instead of getting more powerful with one – which you will have to do as well, at some point. Once this stops at Mastery level 16, you’ve pretty much encountered the hardest Warframe has to throw at you, and you still have another 24 levels to go, with new ones being added as the number of equipment in the game grows. Past that point, all you’re doing is increasing numbers and figuring out the most efficient way of farming for new stuff. You might not mind it as much, but know that the game wasn’t designed with a point of finality in mind, but for you to keep coming back, again and again, to keep grinding and completing content, without much substance to it. Enemies become trivial, as a single press of a button can wipe out entire rooms. Level-design becomes non-existent, as you spam the bullet jump maneuver to blaze through levels as fast as possible, so you can try again if that piece of loot you need didn’t drop.

As such, the developers prioritize new, replayable content to get older players into the grind again. At the same time, it has to be accessible to newer players, so it can’t be made too difficult. Story quests suffer especially, as they’re not designed with replayability in mind. The main plot of Warframe still isn’t finished, and it’s been three years since the previous major quest had been added. There’s a lot of wasted potential here, especially with some of the characters, as such a game can’t really have character development. There's simply no room for it as things need to stay static—characters are bereft of their arcs and remain the same for the sake of replayable missions and grind. 

It might keep all those boxes in your mind ticked so you feel accomplished. I know I did way past a point I should have, but looking back at a good part of those 995 hours, and it feels like time wasted.

230410,Warframe,"Warframe is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I've had moments were I really loved it and there have been numerous moments where I've wanted to smash my desk with a sledgehammer. 
I'll just write a short and simple review.

Combat - 8/10
Really satisfying and fast. But the late game can get stressful and too hectic.

Movement - 7/10
Mostly same as above, but what brings it down a bit is the numerous enemies that kill your momentum and the Co-op elements.

Multiplayer - 5/10
Great in the beginning but it really gets dragged down in the higher levels where all players just speed around the map to the objectives and it starts to feel more like a speedrun. I always found it annoying when people would just race past enemies and do all these exploits just to get through the level faster and I would struggle to keep up.

Story - ?/10
I don't have much to say since the story is unfinished, but the little that I've seen thus far is pretty interesting.

Visuals - 8,5/10
Absolutely stunning. The lighting really makes the game. It's so bright and vivid, and it runs great I might add. And I really like the designs for all the different warframes and cosmetics.

Missions and objectives- 5/10
This is sadly the weakest point of the game. The missions and levels get really repetetive and grindy. And trying to get new gear can sometimes take weeks. (Including build times) This is the part where you're really reminded that this is a F2P game. I would've prefered to pay for a full game with less of a grind since I've already spent way more than 60$ on rushing items and buying cosmetics. I'll add that I'm not a fan of grinding (which is why I've spent so much money on the game.), I know some people are and kudos to you if you're into that stuff but I'm not.


Keep in mind that these are my personal opinions and experiences. Correct me on anything that's wrong and feel free to share your thoughts with me.

Most missions can be played with up to 3 other players online. There are singleplayer sections as well as some open world areas, but most of the game is for 1-4 players.

[  ] has no story
[  ] not interesting/important
[  ] decent story
[X] good story
[  ] emotional rollercoaster

The game starts out with hardly any story, but gets better the more you get into it and the more you read item descriptions and little details. After that you have a pretty good story in many aspects.

[  ] decent length (10-20h)

So many different things to do and farm, you can spend thousands of hours if you want to

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]

Not that challenging, you just need to dedicate time

[h1]Controls[/h1]
[  ] few buttons
[X] average amount of buttons
[  ] might need some time to get used to

Besides your movement keys you just have to shoot and use 4 abilities. You need to memorize everything to be fast, but it's nothing particularly difficult.

You have a lot of different planets and random generated maps for every mission, but the basic gameplay stays the same.

[h1]Characters customization[/h1]
[  ] none

[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]
[  ] shitey
[  ] yeah, looks good
[X] stunning

The game creates a very good atmosphere especially due to its variety of planets and locations. You really feel like you are part of that universe (well you actually are) and many places like the moon (called Lua in game) or the Void look just super gorgeous.

[h1]In game purchases[/h1]
[  ] pay 2 win
[X] pay 2 skip (everything can be acquired by just playing the game)
[  ] no real money can be spend

You can spend soooo much money, but at the same time everything can be completed by playing the game. As I said before, this game has a lot of grinding, which can be skipped by paying, but it's not p2w.

[h1]Personal thoughts:[/h1]
This game is definitely not for everybody, if you don't like spending a lot of time, grinding and doing some things multiple times, this game is nothing for you. But if you do like those things, this game is excellent. Especially the movement is just so addicting and you have so many different weapons/warframes/companions/planets/gamemodes.
If you're not sure whether to get it or not, just try it out, especially since it's free. Have fun!

230410,Warframe,"[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
2020 RE-review... My thoughts have not changed, this game remains top of the looter shooter genre, with beautiful graphics (finally got a good PC lmao), lots of customization and lots of characters. You'll probably find the frame for you very quickly! I have never played a game that was so perfect in regards to how it treats the customer. I have more below, but just know in recent years so much story, game and UI improvements have been dealt!

[h1] Intro [/h1]
Warframe, a universe thriving with lush, hidden lore. The place where a species of technologically crude, and industrious Grineer have made home. The place where a plutocratic, advanced, and money greedy Corpus have made home. The place where a technocyte plague known as the Infestation has made home. Ah, and of course.. the place where you, the noble, honorable, Tenno; have made home. 

[h1] Warframe Pros [/h1]

Warframe is a free to play done right, everything in this game can be earned for completely free. You know how I know? Well, I've been getting EVERYTHING for free, and have spent a fair amount of hours to get this info!

This game has thousands of mods. Unlike its 'comparable' Destiny, this game has more than a dumbed down skill tree. This game has a modding system. One which lets your power have billions of stat combos.Even the placement of mods will determine their effectiveness!

This game allows for player to player trading. Whether you're looking for 'prime' gear, or platinum (premium currency), trading has you covered. There are people willing to trade you for mods, gear, and platinum.

The UPDATES, now this is a big one. This game Warframe has had so many updates, nearly on a monthly basis that it could EASILY have had a Warframe 2 by now. For a game being completely free, these updates are WELL worth your time. I mean hell, we've recently gotten our third open world. Completely. Free.

The memorable moments. One, undeniable fact, is that this game gets sweeter as time goes on. With monumental quests such as The Second Dream and The War Within, this game will blow you out of your socks. Though, for some, this can take up to 100-200 hours to get to. It's crazy, but gives you the best feeling and memory afterwards. Specifically the Second Dream touched my soul. I have played for 6 years or so and after all that time, to see the truth... I can't explain the feeling. I saved up and purchased the pre-order for the Second Dream's statue bundle to commemorate!

Your Space Mom. Every Tenno needs to feel like they have someone.. SOMEONE! For the longest time, in the game, I was closest to my dear space mom. The Lotus!

The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous, I know this is a random one but it can really hit you in the feels later on. Try looking up ""This is What You Are - Keith"" <- It'll bring you to a Warframe song that is too good..

[h1] Warframe Cons [/h1]

The grind can be unrelenting for some. For people like me, the grind was never bad because of my constant progression, but for people who aren't patient or want things quickly (in a progression system) this might be a bit too much.

The lore is very hidden. There is a story, but for some major lore, and theories on it, you'll have to look it up on YouTube. If you'd like a good series I recommend StallorD

The enemy scaling. For some people who love a hard challenge, the enemy scaling might be too much. Not exactly the ENEMY itself, but more specifically the ARMOUR on an enemy. It can be insane to even damage an enemy after level 100.  

[h1] Improvements? [/h1]
[i] These are simply opinions on minor things... [/i]

Dojo improvements. I think Tennogen should be introduced for the Dojo, more decorations should be added, AND massive group builds. I'm talking about decorations that require a load of resources. That way if you have a large and active clan, you'll have special things that show your true power, and riches!

On 'Finisher' animations for the Nikana backslash, a mark/bodysplit hould happen. What I mean is that you do a diagonal slash across the enemies back, yet no deep cut appears, or body splitting? I dunno, just a request!

Please add a flashlight we can toggle. Especially with the release of PoE, seeing in the dark is crucial. Either an option to turn on and off the flashlight manually or nightvision would be greatly appreciated. I don't know about anyone else but seeing in the dark hurts my eyes sometimes, oopsie!

[h1] Final Words [/h1]

Now please, note that this is all speculation and pure opinions! I love Warframe! If you have any questions, need help in game, a clan to join, or notice anything spelled wrong, or anything I should add.. please feel free to drop a comment in the space below!

230410,Warframe,"[h1] Not pay to win [/h1]
Before I start my review, I want to dispell this notion. Anyone who tells you this game is pay to win is wrong, or lying to you. Most of the good weapons are mastery rank locked and even if you buy things to bypass the grind, you still have to level those Warframes and weapons, you still have to play the game to grind and get mods for your weapons and Warframes to make them actually perform well in end-game content. You're blindsiding yourself if you're going to make the argument that this game is pay to win. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's get to the actual review.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
I had to start off by reviewing the graphical quality of this game, because it's [i] so beautiful. [/i] Everything is well polished and good-looking, the appearance of Warframe will not hesitate to immerse you into the environment. On top of that, graphically the game is extremely well optimized compared to other games, and can run on many older computers without an issue. There is no section of the game that is forgotten about in regards to visuals. Clearly, a lot of love has been put into this game and you can tell that immediately just by looking at how beautiful and immersive the game is.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Warframe's content and gameplay are some of the best for any free-to-play game out there. Everything in Warframe is available without paying if you are willing to grind for it. One of the best freemium models out there, seriously. You can earn Platinum, the premium currency, in-game without ever spending a cent on it. As for the Warframes themselves, each one is unique, and there are over 35 of them. 35! That's a lot of different characters to choose from. Each of them has 4 unique abilities that do different things, and you can typically mod a Warframe 3 different ways or more to focus on a specific part of their ability kit. That is a fantastic amount of customization and one of the things I love most about the game. I will say that the star chart content can get a bit repetitive at times, but if you stick it out, fill out your star chart, and get into high level content, it'll feel less repetitive in due time. At higher levels the combat gets much more complex. Try staying for at least an hour in a survival mission if you decide to play, and you'll see what I mean.

[h1] Cosmetics [/h1]
I had to talk about the cosmetics in Warframe because let's face it- fashion, looking good and uniqueness are important aspects of any videogame. Warframe has a ton of cosmetics, and they're all extremely beautiful and wonderful. Once you get through all the star chart content, you may find yourself grinding for Platinum to purchase a new set of clothes- or outright buying it with real money, I won't judge you for it. In fact, some of the best cosmetics in the game can only be purchased with real money- the TennoGen cosmetics are handsomely crafted with love by individual creators, and your money goes back to those creators, supporting them and allowing them to make more wonderful content for the game.

[h1] Grinding [/h1]
I'll flesh out my review by saying this. If you don't like grinding or MMO-type games, Warframe probably isn't for you. I would still give it a go even if you don't like those types of games, but you're probably not going to enjoy it if you aren't a patient person. Grinding is the name of the game in Warframe, and RNG affects many activities in the game. If you don't like the fact that you aren't guaranteed certain things and have to wait for warframes and weapons to finish building before you can use them, or that you have to farm resources to build them, then you probably won't enjoy the game. Still, if you invest your time into the grind, you can acquire nearly anything you want for no cost at all.

[h1] Updates [/h1]
One great thing about Warframe is that they are constantly updating the game and delivering new content to us. Year round, we get new Warframes, quests, and content, albeit they can be buggy at the start. We received Sanctuary Onslaught, a new gamemode, and The Sacrifice, a new quest, earlier this year, and we're getting Fortuna, an open-world area on Venus later this year. That's a lot of content for one year! While it's not always the best and most optimized content, I see more love poured into Warframe content than that of any other game at the current time. The devs maintain a strong relationship with the community and actively ask questions to the players about what they want to see and what they want changed, and do frequent livestreams for fun and for discussing where they are in terms of development with the game. Their strong community commitment is one of the great things that many people love about Warframe- DE's transparency and willingness to maintain a strong bond with us is something that not many other game companies can brag about.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
So, if you read my entire thing and some of my points sparked your interest, I would definitely reccommend giving the game a go. I have loved every second I've played of Warframe and I can honestly say it's one of the only games whose future updates I'm currently excited for. There are no downsides to trying the game out- after all, it's free to play and if you don't like the grind then you can stop at any time and uninstall the game. There's no paywalls or money barriers to any of the content in the game. It takes time to grind for resources and build things, but if you can develop patience, that grinding pays off, and the game will only get deeper and more complex as a result.",pay win dispell notion tell pay win wrong lying good weapon mastery rank locked thing bypass grind warframes weapon grind mod weapon warframes perform content blindsiding argument pay win gotten actual graphic reviewing graphical quality beautiful polished good appearance warframe hesitate immerse environment top graphically extremely optimized compared game older computer issue section forgotten regard visuals clearly love tell immediately beautiful immersive warframe content best warframe available paying willing grind best freemium model seriously earn platinum premium currency spending cent warframes unique 35 35 different character choose 4 unique ability different thing typically warframe 3 different way focus specific kit fantastic customization thing love star chart content bit repetitive time stick fill star chart high content repetitive due higher level combat get complex staying survival mission decide cosmetic talk cosmetic warframe face fashion good uniqueness important aspect videogame warframe ton cosmetic extremely beautiful wonderful star chart content grinding platinum purchase new set clothes outright buying real judge best cosmetic purchased real tennogen cosmetic handsomely crafted love individual creator go creator supporting allowing wonderful content grinding flesh saying grinding type game warframe probably type game probably enjoy patient grinding name warframe rng affect activity guaranteed certain thing wait warframes weapon finish building farm resource build probably enjoy invest grind acquire nearly cost update great warframe constantly updating delivering new content round new warframes quest content albeit buggy received sanctuary onslaught new gamemode sacrifice new earlier fortuna open world venus content best optimized content love poured warframe content maintain strong relationship community actively ask question player changed frequent livestreams fun discussing term development strong community commitment great thing love warframe de transparency willingness maintain strong bond company brag conclusion read entire point sparked interest definitely reccommend giving loved warframe honestly game future update currently excited downside trying grind uninstall paywalls barrier content take grind resource build thing develop patience grinding pay deeper complex result,2,0.9991

My time with Warframe spanned about 7 or 8 years. I am unfortunately at the point where I can't quite get into it anymore, which is sad but the memories I have from Warframe are super happy, to say the least.

Making the choice to try Warframe is one of the best decisions I've ever made. I made life-long friends while playing this game. 

Thanks to DE for everything they've done, I always felt supported as a player here. Absolutely legendary game, so much fun to be had.

If you somehow have not tried this game yet, please give it a go.

230410,Warframe,"PROS
+ Movement is something else! It may begin to do a number on your pinky finger but once you get a hang of the moment controls, this is possibly the best platforming I've seen in a third-person shooter. High octane, to the point where sometimes I feel I'm getting motion sickness.
+ You can farm Prime parts to sell for Platinum, the ""premium"" currency, which means that, with some patience, you can actually get by in this game without spending a single penny of real-world money.
+ Most items have a ton of customization options ASIDE from the ability to recolor which you get from the very start without having a spend anything. Warframes? Recolorable! Weapons? Recolorable! Your own SPACESHIP?! YES! Recolor away! Pets, sadly, are a biiiiit harder to recolor, I think.
+ Very, VERY well-optimized. I play this game butter-smooth on my ages-old PC and wouldn't be surprised if it worked on my aging laptop.

CONS
- Very, very grindy. If you just craft a Warframe, it literally takes days (72 hours) before your frame is finished being made.
- You can... actually kinda follow the development as you progress through the game. Production value shoots up as you progress, showing that later content.Earth through Uranus feels very... ""samey"", where you're just progressing from node to node, junction to junction, and it will test your patience. Uranus/Neptune and above, though? You begin to actually get PROPER quests. With cinematics and everything. However, the game takes too long getting here... I feel that's why they plopped Cetus and Fortuna where they are now, to give new players a break from the node-to-node slog and overall content drought.
- Terrible customer support.
- There is very little info on how to progress past Uranus. So heed my words, when you hear odd sounds in Uranus sealab words... GET YOUR SCANNER OUT AND SCAN THE NOODLE MONSTERS!

At first, you will be astonished by the super cool graphics and character/weapon designs. You will say to yourself ""How can this be free?""

And in this hour of darkness, where all your mental defenses have been stripped away from the countless hours of relic farming, you will succumb to the dark lords.

230410,Warframe,"Warframe is a hard game to put into words for anyone who hasn't played it. For as many good things there are about it, there are bad things that make the game somewhat tedious. Despite this, I have a hard time not recommending the game. Almost nothing in out of the reach of Free-to-play players, which is something that a lot of other games can't say for themselves.

Lets start with the good: 

Premium Currency & Trading: This might feel ""weird"" to be put in the good category, but it has a lot to do with the above comment. The premium currency is a tradable currency in-game; this means that you, as a player, can grind items and then sell them for the premium currency to other players. On top of this, Warframe is [i]incredibly[/i] lenient with how much it gives out discounts for its premium currency. I'm not at all ashamed to admit that I've gotten a fair share of 50% off coupons in-game and immediately used it to get $100 of the currency for $50. This combined with the fact that a lot of players are willing to trade tit-for-tat means that trading in this game is fairly robust. Heck, I've even had some interactions where people would throw something in extra for free.

Grinding: Grinding in this game feels extremely rewarding, and once you learn how, when, and where to do it becomes exceedingly fun to do. Most grinds to craft things will only take you a few hours at most, and the fact that you get to choose items from any relic during relic missions means that most of the time you come out of missions feeling like you accomplished something.

Community: This is a bit of a weirder one. Although the community is incredibly nice and willing to help, the main incentives to do so are related to grinding. As such, a lot of times it feels a lot more fun to just go into missions with a group of friends rather than do things publicly because its easier to plan out.

Variety: The game has a STUPID amount of variety in the amount of playstyles that you can choose, further augmented by things called ""Mods"" that can increase various attributes. This game is incredibly flexible and freeform in terms of how you can choose to play, and its a part that I greatly enjoy.

Alright, so that was most of the good things, so now I'll hit you with the bad:

Time Gating: Although grinding is fairly quick in most cases, crafting in this game takes a set amount of time, ranging from 1 minute all the way to a few days for Warframes. This causes you to be incredibly bored early in the game, because you want to try other things but just can't because you need to wait on things to complete before getting to the meat and bones of the variety I talked about above. You can rush the crafting with the premium currency if you so choose, however.

Mastery Gating: With the above comes Mastery gating. Basically, Mastery is your characters level, so to speak. To increase Mastery, you need to level your equipment, whether its warframes, weapons, or even pets. This combined with time gating means that the pace of the game starts off INCREDIBLY slow, because not only does getting Mastery up take awhile, you can also only ""level up"" your mastery once per day. Mastery dictates what missions you can do, what weapons you can use, and what Warframes you have access to, so its a fairly high minus for me. On top of this, if you have any weapons or warframes that you really enjoy, it gets to a point where you're never able to play them because you need to level other things to progress your mastery.

Lack of Direction: Warframe is confusing. Incredibly confusing. The tutorial teaches you very little about the game and then  just throws you off a cliff and tells you to have fun exploring the game. There's no goals for you to immediatly work towards, nor does it explain how you get new Warframes, how open world areas like Cetus, Fortuna, and Deimos work, nor does it really try to explain how to get some of the best mods in the game. This is all left to the player to figure out on their own, and often times means you're spending an exceedingly large amount of time on the Warframe Wiki figuring things out (though, at least the wiki is exceedingly intricate and well made).

Content Lockout: A LOT of the content in the game is locked behind the Main Questline that it never tells you about. The specific quest that needs completed is ""The War Within"", which is locked behind a whole other series of quests and Mastery Level 5, which will take a casual player probably a little over a couple weeks to get to. 

Trading: Although I praised the trading above, there is two caveats to it that requires an addendum, which is that the only way to effectively market items in this game is via using Warframe Market, which is an online third party website. You [i]can[/i] go to a relay and market items there, but even though I've spent a few hours attempting to sell items that way it almost never gets any bites unless its Rivens. Speaking of which....

Rivens: Rivens are like capstone mods for weapons in this game. They're purposely random and incredibly OP. Although I have nothing against them existing, there's a few things that I absolutely despise about them. The first part is pricing. Riven pricing is STUPIDLY complex, and it takes A LOT of learning to understand how to do it yourself. Because of this, there is Riven Appraisal Discords, Websites, and public chats for specifically this one thing. Rivens are also the devs way of influencing the meta through the disposition system; basically, the worse a weapon is, the higher the maximum stats on the Riven are allowed to be. This means that if you like a popular weapon, that the chances are that A: Rivens for that weapons are proportionately increased because of the supply/demand, and B: That the cost of God-Tier Rivens for that weapon is well above anyones pay grade. A good Riven depending on the Weapon can range anywhere from 50 of the premium currency (about $5 USD) to around 2000 ($100 USD) or even more. And even on top of [i]that,[/i] Rivens are also Mastery locked, ranging from Mastery 8 all the way up to 16. To give you an idea of how annoying Mastery is to level, with the amount of time as of writing this post, I'm currently only Mastery 12. Yikes. Admittedly, I could be quite a bit higher, but I like to enjoy the games I play and so liked to stick to a few specific Warframes and Weapons.


Overall, I still recommend Warframe, with a couple caveats: You have to be willing to grind, and you have to be patient. If you can do both of these things, the game becomes very fun and has something to offer for almost everyone. Also, you should probably find a friend to taxi you around to make your early game bearable.",warframe hard word good thing bad thing somewhat tedious despite hard recommending reach player game let good premium currency trading weird good category comment premium currency tradable currency mean grind item premium currency player top warframe incredibly lenient give discount premium currency ashamed admit gotten fair share 50 coupon immediately 100 currency 50 combined player willing trade tit tat mean trading fairly robust heck interaction throw extra grinding grinding feel extremely rewarding learn exceedingly fun grind craft thing hour choose item relic relic mission mean mission feeling accomplished community bit weirder community incredibly nice willing help incentive related grinding time feel fun mission group friend rather thing publicly easier plan variety stupid variety playstyles choose augmented thing called mod increase various attribute incredibly flexible freeform term choose greatly enjoy alright good thing bad gating grinding fairly quick case crafting take set ranging 1 minute day warframes cause incredibly bored early thing wait thing complete meat bone variety talked rush crafting premium currency choose mastery gating come mastery gating basically mastery character speak increase mastery equipment warframes weapon pet combined gating mean pace start incredibly slow mastery awhile mastery per mastery dictate mission weapon warframes access fairly high minus top weapon warframes enjoy get able thing progress mastery lack direction warframe confusing incredibly confusing tutorial teach throw cliff tell fun exploring goal immediatly towards explain new warframes open world area cetus fortuna deimos explain best mod left figure time mean spending exceedingly large warframe wiki figuring thing wiki exceedingly intricate content lockout content locked questline tell specific need completed war locked series quest mastery 5 casual probably couple week trading praised trading caveat requires addendum effectively market item via warframe market online third party website relay market item spent hour attempting item get bite unless rivens speaking rivens rivens capstone mod weapon purposely random incredibly op existing thing despise pricing riven pricing stupidly complex take learning understand riven appraisal discord website public chat specifically rivens influencing meta disposition basically worse weapon higher maximum stats riven allowed mean popular weapon chance rivens weapon proportionately increased supply demand cost god tier rivens weapon anyones pay grade good riven depending weapon range anywhere 50 premium currency 5 usd 2000 100 usd top rivens mastery locked ranging mastery 8 16 idea annoying mastery writing post currently mastery 12 yikes admittedly bit higher enjoy game liked stick specific warframes weapon recommend warframe couple caveat willing grind patient thing fun offer probably friend taxi early bearable,2,0.9947

230410,Warframe,"upd8: please look at the first two comments for more things I reviewed! comments contain spoilers!

this game tends to be one of two things for most people: either you love it & sink countless hours (and maybe dollars) into it, or you pick it up for a couple hours & put it back down.

this doesn't need saying, but I fall into the former category.

Warframe is a masterfully done game that offers its players a lot of choices not just for what they want to do, but also how they want to do it. you can spend your days designing rooms and outfits. you can sneak through puzzles trying not to get caught, or slash through wave after wave of enemies where your only objective is don't die. you can play as a swordsman, or a magnet, or a golem, or a dj, or something else out of the 30+ warframes they have available (each with their own unique kit of abilities).

pve has never felt this satisfying and engaging. the game has a good balance of quick ""get in get out"" missions, as well as endless missions with rotating rewards (this way you get incentive to stay, but also you don't feel bad for leaving). the sound design team deserves a medal, because this game is the only fps I've played that makes me feel satisfied through sound, not just rewards.

speaking of design, the world is incredibly interesting, & so are all the factions living in it. each has its own unique visual style & moral code, we're not seeing reskinned enemies going ""I wanna destroy the tenno cause reasons!"" or reskinned npcs going ""help me obi-wan kenobi, you're my only hope!"" over and over again. but that doesn't mean they're disconnected; we're constantly seeing people from different factions talking to each other & mentioning each other in passing. the connectedness of the people living in this world is a level of realism I'm not accustomed to in games that aren't 100% story driven, & it makes me appreciate the level of detail the devs use for this game.

that's not to say Warframe doesn't have a story. it's not always easy to find, & at times very frustrating to work through, but it's there and it's interesting and strange. (fwiw, a LOT of the story is told/enhanced through environmental storytelling. you're going to want to hunt for kurias, cephalon fragments, & synthesis targets. or consult the wiki!) the most I can say without spoiling things: you're caught in the middle of factions trying to fight each other, & they either want you with them or they want you dead.

Warframe is optimized to hell and back, to the point where I suspect it could run (poorly) on an apple watch. this optimization HAS gone down in recent months (they recently said that they're no longer supporting 32 bit machines and OS's before Windows 7), but that's still a lot of ground they cover. I was able to play Warframe with little to no issues on a laptop with a terrible graphics card (seriously it couldn't handle Skyrim with the lowest settings). this is an incredible achievement, especially when you consider the details and particle effects the game contains.

also you can get dogs, cats, & pet robots. petting your animals is a game mechanic that gives them buffs. you can fly around in space. you have dance emotes. you can get capes & jet packs & bobbleheads & action figures. you're a robot ninja in space! and all of this is free!

now I've spent a lot of this waxing poetic about how great Warframe is, but this game isn't without its faults. you should know what you're getting into if/when you get this game.

if you're strictly free-to-play, this game is a huge grind. gaining platinum (the paid currency that allows you to get cosmetics, progress boosters, weapon/warframe slots, and weapons/warframes if you don't feel like building them) is best done by getting things called prime parts, which are random drops from relics. you can trade these prime parts to other players for platinum (there are other things you can trade, but prime parts are basically the only things that'll get you any platinum). I wouldn't go so far as to say that rewards in this game resemble a loot box system (the devs have removed systems in the game that act as slot machines), but that doesn't mean it's without frustrations. basically, if you don't want to give Digital Extremes your money for platinum: you have to grind a lot of missions to get prime parts, which you can trade for platinum, which then makes grinding less frustrating. life's rough if you don't have money to spare.

it's also frustrating when you want to get That One Thing you need, but it's the rarest thing on a drop table. again, I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate the devs going out of their way to eliminate loot box/slot machine systems from this game! but often you're stuck with either 1) deciding if you want to take a shortcut by spending platinum, or 2) not having any shortcuts to take so you just keep grinding and grinding. (one time I asked someone if they played Warframe, & they said ""if I wanted to grind I'd go to a club."")

the story doesn't get engaging until Natah. Natah is a quest which you can't access until you can do missions on Uranus, which is also the planet where enemies suddenly get a LOT harder. this point is basically where the game is like ""we're not holding your hand anymore, you need to start upgrading your weapons/warframes."" (funny enough, upgrading your stuff ALSO involves unskippable grinding, but this time it's less rewarding!) Natah has been out since 2015, and by now it's what brings new players into the game (along with the quests that come after it). trouble is, new players are going to want to rush to get to these quests. and by rushing, without taking the time to upgrade their stuff by painstakingly grinding it to rank 30 over and over again, they're going to suffer and get frustrated. this game needs to do more story-wise to not just capture new players' attentions, but to also keep them. (seriously, when I played The Second Dream for the first time, I had to take a long break from Warframe. I was rank 6-7, I was constantly overwhelmed, & I was too busy trying to stay alive to actually pay attention to the story. it sucked.)

DE enables this by making Natah available to people who are as low as rank 3. that's not to say I have a problem with newbies playing the main story! my problem is with DE making it available, but also making the level scaling completely inaccessable. if you're going to make this quest available to people as low as rank 3, you need to make it so that they can actually succeed at it. otherwise what's the point?

not all the quests in your codex are repeatable. so far only the ones that are directly tied to the main storyline can be repeated, & even then it feels really random. I can replay the quest that introduces me to the infested faction way at the beginning of the game... but I can't replay Natah? the quest that basically starts the whole mess of events that we're going through? come on!

now this IS a free to play game, more often than not. so maybe these things won't bother you. that's totally fine, it's just something you should keep in mind if you ever feel like spending money on this game. (which isn't something I'm against, ftr; Digital Extremes is one of the few dev teams out there which I can safely say respects their players and makes sure their game is fun and not just a way to make money.)

ultimately, I recommend trying it, especially if you can get some other friends to join you. you're gonna have a good time! and if you ever get stuck, there's a lot of people who can show you the ropes!",upd8 please look comment thing reviewed comment contain spoiler tends thing love sink countless hour maybe dollar pick couple hour saying fall former category warframe masterfully offer player choice spend day designing room outfit sneak puzzle trying caught slash wave wave enemy objective die swordsman magnet golem dj else 30 warframes available unique kit ability pve satisfying engaging good balance quick mission endless mission rotating reward incentive stay bad leaving sound design deserves medal fps make satisfied sound reward speaking design world incredibly interesting faction living unique visual style moral code seeing reskinned enemy wan na destroy tenno cause reason reskinned npc help obi wan kenobi hope disconnected constantly seeing different faction talking mentioning passing connectedness living world realism accustomed game 100 driven make appreciate detail warframe easy time frustrating interesting strange fwiw told enhanced environmental storytelling hunt kurias cephalon fragment synthesis target consult wiki spoiling thing caught middle faction trying fight dead warframe optimized hell suspect poorly apple watch optimization recent month recently longer supporting 32 bit machine o window 7 ground cover able warframe issue laptop terrible graphic card seriously handle skyrim lowest setting incredible achievement especially consider detail particle effect contains dog cat pet robot petting animal mechanic give buff fly space dance emotes cape jet pack bobbleheads action figure robot ninja space spent waxing poetic great warframe fault strictly huge grind gaining platinum paid currency allows cosmetic progress booster weapon warframe slot weapon warframes building best thing called prime part random drop relic trade prime part player platinum thing trade prime part basically thing platinum far reward resemble loot box removed system act slot machine frustration basically digital extreme platinum grind mission prime part trade platinum make grinding frustrating life rough spare frustrating rarest drop table stress appreciate eliminate loot box slot machine system stuck 1 deciding shortcut spending platinum 2 shortcut grinding grinding asked someone warframe wanted grind club engaging natah natah access mission uranus planet enemy suddenly harder basically holding hand anymore upgrading weapon warframes funny upgrading stuff involves unskippable grinding rewarding natah 2015 brings new player along quest trouble new player rush quest rushing taking upgrade stuff painstakingly grinding rank 30 suffer frustrated need wise capture new player attention seriously dream long break warframe rank 6 7 constantly overwhelmed busy trying stay alive pay attention sucked de enables natah available low rank 3 problem newbie problem de available scaling completely inaccessable available low rank 3 succeed otherwise quest codex repeatable far one directly tied storyline repeated feel random replay introduces infested faction beginning replay natah basically start mess event maybe thing bother totally fine mind spending ftr digital extreme team safely respect player make fun ultimately recommend trying especially friend join gon na good stuck rope,2,0.9704
230410,Warframe,"[h1]Update (24/4/14):[/h1] It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had. 

The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind.

Multiple new game modes exist, including ""Invasion"", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission.

The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat.

The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy.

In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new ""EVE Online""-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard.

<hr>

[h1]Original Review (25/11/13)[/h1]

A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole.

Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. 

Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. 

Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character.

So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a ""community effort"" in which everyone can participate.

The only ""issue"" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games ""premium"" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. 

The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its ""free to play"" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds.

Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe.

230410,Warframe,"Don't know how the hell i managed to rack up 3000 hours... I keep coming back when there are new updates, and have not uninstalled this game ever.

Some advice for new players:
1. DON'T overexert yourselves by grinding. E.g. if you've only been playing for a month or so, you shouldn't be grinding endo for rank 10 mods, nor kuva for RNG riven rolls. Gear progression isn't everything, and there is plenty of game content to be explored. I sometimes run level100 missions using excalibur and mk-1 starting equipment for the kicks, and its works fine because of my knowledge on mod combinations and how to deal with enemies. If you are a completionist, bad news... [spoiler]prepare for the worst ;)[/spoiler]
2. What to spend platinum on: Prioritize using plat on increasing warframe / weapon slots. If you have extra, spend them on orokin reactors and catalysts for your favourite frames and weapons.
3. Trading exists, and can save you many hours of grinding. You can sell things you think are junk (duplicate relics, prime parts, mods and whatnot), but are worth much more for others, and buy what you need within minutes. You might need some time learning how to, but there are free tools like the warframe market website to help with trading.
4. ""Press 4 to win"" used to be a thing. Meaning, current metas will be nerfed to oblivion, and so will the next many. You do not have to follow min/max builds. Instead, try new weapons and frames to learn them, while making do with your current mods. That's what the mastery system is imo, learning which weapons and frames are better suited for different situations. If you leveling your weapons by afking in grineer defense missions, you're essentially throwing that piece of knowledge away.
5. How to get plat? : Sell your soul by grinding and/or trading.

230410,Warframe,"A lot of Warframe reviews bank on the point that it's free, and so what's the harm with trying? The answer to that is, potentially a lot. Dispense with the idea that Warframe is free - that aspect is entirely irrelevant, free or not a bad game is still bad and certainly not worth a damn.

I recommend Warframe solely because it is a [i]good[/i] game.

Daunting, yes, Warframe is huge - as it well should be after almost six continuous years of post-release development, but that quantity upholds a consistent level of quality rivalling any other well received, well reviewed title. This game certainly demands time investment, and that aspect can put off new players that are expecting to progress at a rapid pace. You can reach a decent point in the game after some investment, but it will take thousands of hours to truly complete everything it has to offer.

As an online, instance-based, multiplayer, sci-fi action game Warframe belongs to a fairly niche market - it's most prominent rival being Destiny, and yet these two are so utterly perpendicular in their goals and aspects. Warframe is truly unique, an experience I've never encountered anywhere else, and truthfully not tailored to everyone's particular tastes.

It's big, we've touched upon that, but exactly what is it offering? Quests, progression, customisation, combat, design, music, graphics? How do these all play out in practice? Are they all great?

Short answer, no. It's hard to make a perfect game; impossible in fact, but Warframe certainly pushes some boundaries. Questing has been improving greatly over the years, and the content in the last couple has provided amazing lore and gameplay mechanics with some exceptional writing - and they seem only to be improving.

Progression and customisation tie into one overarching aspect. There's no denying that it starts off slow. Warframe is a grindy game, it makes up a large portion of the time needed to complete it, but it pays off. In a couple weeks you'll have a few frames and a bunch of weapons, in a couple of months you'll have accrued quite the varied arsenal, and within a year you'll likely have almost everything, if not all of it. Warframe doesn't tie you down or make things too hard, it just demands you put in the effort to reap the reward.

The combat of Warframe is simple, and yet incredibly complex. There could be a review on this in and of itself, so I'll make it brief - there is huge variety, and this is no mere point and click to win game (unless you're Saryn).

The design of Warframe is ever undergoing changes, to the current UI overhaul in progress, to the constant graphical improvements, to the general improvements and overhauls of map tiles and geographical spaces. The latest of which, the massive open world of Fortuna, has turned out to be and incredible display of amazing and well detailed level design.

Now, it is not without its downsides. Bugs are frequent, though ultimately the vast majority are very minor and inconsequential. It is rare to face a bug that truly causes major problems. Graphical optimisation isn't great, especially with the open world maps. 

I think there must be mention of how the Market can seem unfair to new players, as it implies weapons must be bought with Platinum, but this is not the case - everything can be crafted.

Now, I will touch on the free to play aspect lastly - I've covered that this is a game and is worth your time, but I dissuade the notion one might have that it is dangerous simply because it IS free to play. Warframe Bears perhaps the most forgiving free to play scheme ever - and that is because you can obtain everything without ever paying a penny. Platinum, the premium currency, can be obtained by simply trading in-game items to players - one can accrue thousands upon thousands without ever putting money into this, and that is what is recommended.

Don't shy away because you think you'll be bottle necked into buying your way to progress, it is never the case.

Bottom line - Warframe is a great game, free or not. You should give it a go - and make friends, it's the best way to play.",warframe review bank harm trying answer potentially dispense idea warframe aspect entirely irrelevant bad bad certainly worth damn recommend warframe solely good daunting yes warframe huge six continuous year post release development quantity upholds consistent quality rivalling received reviewed title certainly demand investment aspect new player expecting progress rapid pace reach decent investment thousand hour truly complete offer online instance based multiplayer sci fi action warframe belongs fairly niche market prominent rival destiny utterly perpendicular goal aspect warframe truly unique encountered anywhere else truthfully tailored particular taste big touched exactly offering quest progression customisation combat design music graphic practice great short answer hard perfect impossible warframe certainly push boundary questing improving greatly year content last couple provided amazing lore mechanic exceptional writing improving progression customisation tie overarching aspect denying start slow warframe grindy make large portion needed complete pay couple week frame bunch weapon couple month accrued varied arsenal warframe tie thing hard demand effort reap reward combat warframe simple incredibly complex brief huge variety mere click win unless saryn design warframe undergoing change ui overhaul progress constant graphical improvement general improvement overhaul map tile geographical space latest massive open world fortuna turned incredible display amazing detailed design downside bug frequent ultimately vast majority minor inconsequential rare face bug truly cause major problem graphical optimisation great especially open world map mention market unfair new player implies weapon bought platinum case crafted touch aspect lastly covered worth dissuade notion dangerous simply warframe bear perhaps forgiving scheme obtain paying penny platinum premium currency obtained simply trading item player accrue thousand thousand putting recommended shy bottle necked buying progress case bottom line warframe great friend best,2,0.9958

reading through the comments and you can see the majority rules. when i speak of DLC's i'm referring to things that should already of been included in the base game for example, Total War Warhammer (great game btw) should, in my opinion, already include the chaos race in the base game. i shouldn't have to pay an extra $30 for this particular race, (once again just my opinion). now id happily pay for an ""expensive"" DLC/add-on whatever you want to call it for BG3, especially if its the same quality as Blood and Wine.

Then I read the Tweet.  You know the one: the prominent game developer who said that we cannot allow Larian to define our expectations of RPGs.  Oh, really?  I immediately bought the game and spent hours downloading it out of pure, unadulterated spite.

I am 3 hours in.  Three.  I am blown away.  I spent the first hour creating my character.  I pulled out my Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Player's Handbook and marveled at what BG3 had enabled me to do - this is the full blown 5E character creation.  The maniacs at Larian  took Divinity: Original Sin and made it into D&D 5E, full stop.  Amazing.

And then I played for a couple of hours.

I haven't fallen in love with a game like this since Dragon Age: Origins and there is so much more depth to BG3 in the short time I've played.  Case in point: I found a lockpick, broke into a crypt, looted a burial site and was promptly incinerated by a flame trap over a greased floor.  Thank you, Larian, for reminding me of the F5 key.

The graphics are amazing.  The voice work is the best.  The cut scenes are riveting and that's usually when I go make another whisky!  The sound design is unbelievable.  Why am I noticing sound design?  I don't care about sound design!

I've misclicked so many times.  There's so much to click!  I've died in so many ways.  There are so many ways to die!  There are so many bugs, but I don't even care because in a game as complex and deep as this, you're going to experience lots and lots of FUN. 

Larian, you've done it.  You've made a game so incredible that other developers are banding together to warn us not to play your magnum opus or we won't enjoy the next Stranger Things Click Quest game or whatever garbage they're shoveling out.  

I cannot wait to spend days in Baldur's Gate 3.


* Edit 8/1/2023 after ~60 hours *

Since this review got some attention, let me give you an update after about 60 hours of Early Access.  My initial review is, obviously, hyperbolic, but that was my real-time reaction to finding a truly great game in a genre and style that I thought had been abandoned by game producers who are more interested in games as service, micro-transactions and shooters.

The best review of BG3 I could give is that this is the game I've been hoping for since Dragon Age: Origins.  I play games for systems, not so much story, and I really like both the systems and the story of this game.  If I really like a game, I look forward to starting over and trying something new (I play XCOM 2 and Dwarf Fortress a little bit.)  This game also scratches that itch, which seems strange to say about a story-driven RPG, but it really is a game that encourages you to experiment.

As it stands, on the verge of release, this game is a 10/10 for me and in my pantheon of favorites.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"After ~210 hours and almost three months, I've finally completed the game (I'm a completionist and a slow player who likes to absorb the world carefully and slowly, explore everything, read everything a couple of times, etc).

The sheer level of complexity of interconnected stories, dialogues, outcomes, various characters, and factions is simply unbelievable. Hats off to Larian for managing to create such a rich, complex and meaningful world with hundreds of characters, dozens of factions and interesting groups, vast maps with an abundance of interesting locations to explore and secrets to uncover... While being almost completely nonlinear and giving players the opportunity to do everything in the way they want to do it.

Pros:

- Character models and animations (especially facial animations) are some of the best I've ever seen. It adds so much to the immersion. No matter how important or unimportant an NPC is.

- Superb voice acting, done with so much love, passion and care. And most importantly, with an understanding of the characters they give voices to.

- Generally, the writing is great. It successfully balances Larian's signature humour and silliness with a more macabre and serious tone of the world and the game's story.

- A diverse cast of memorable companions with their own agendas, personalities, personal stories and major questlines. I will miss every single one of them.

- Combat is mostly fun and rewarding. It rewards a tactical approach, experimenting and thinking out of the box.

- Every encounter is a meaningful experience, every combat is hand-crafted, every questline a story on its own, and every location is a unique place. There are no fillers or padding.

- Dozens upon dozens of interesting side stories and quests of various scales and importance.

- Great level design with attention to detail. It’s a pure joy to explore various locations and just look around.
 
- Memorable and multilayered villains with distinctive personalities and agendas.

- Amazing music by Borislav Slavov. Kirill Pokrovsky would be proud.

- Excellent implementation of D&D rules into a video game.

Cons:

- The game's tempo varies. In the early game, it seems that some relationships with companions are developing extremely fast. On the other hand, in Act 3, there is a dichotomy between the urgency of the main quest and the amount of quests, side stories and general stuff you can do and explore in the city of Baludr's Gate.

- Bugs and some general unpolishness become much more obvious in Act 3. Luckily, Larian is actively working on ironing out everything and making the experience truly complete.

- There are some balance issues when it comes to combat, gear, and classes. But that’s also something that will be fixed over time.

- Inventory and companion managing is absolutely horrendous, by far the weakest spot of the game. It’s a nightmare when you try to juggle between characters, find and store items, etc. Recommend using modes for this.

- I personally don't like that almost every companion is player-sexual. It kinda kills their uniqueness and takes away from the immersion when they can all fall in love with you.

- The game should have some kind of a codex where it will store all books and notes that you find, info about characters you’ve met, info about the types of enemies you have encountered, etc.",210 hour three month finally completed completionist slow like absorb world carefully slowly explore read couple time sheer complexity interconnected story dialogue outcome various character faction simply unbelievable hat larian managing create rich complex meaningful world hundred character dozen faction interesting group vast map abundance interesting location explore secret uncover completely nonlinear giving player opportunity pro model animation especially facial animation best add immersion matter important unimportant superb voice acting love passion care importantly understanding character voice generally writing great successfully balance larian signature humour silliness macabre serious tone world diverse cast memorable companion agenda personality personal story major questlines miss single combat mostly fun rewarding reward tactical approach experimenting box encounter meaningful combat hand crafted questline location unique filler padding dozen dozen interesting side story quest various scale importance great design attention detail pure joy explore various location look memorable multilayered villain distinctive personality agenda amazing music borislav slavov kirill pokrovsky proud excellent implementation rule video con tempo varies early relationship companion developing extremely fast hand act 3 dichotomy urgency quest side story general stuff explore city baludr gate bug general unpolishness obvious act 3 luckily larian actively working ironing truly complete balance issue come combat gear class fixed inventory companion managing horrendous far weakest spot nightmare juggle character store item recommend mode personally companion sexual kinda kill uniqueness take immersion fall love kind codex store book note info character met info type enemy encountered,3,0.9979

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"Believe the hype.

I've always been a staunch believer that Larian were a poor choice to continue this franchise. Not because they have ever been incompetent but because in my opinion there have always been better storytellers and Baldur's Gate was always more about story and character than it was about gameplay. No one can argue that Larian's approach to the mechanics of their games have been anything less than groundbreaking. Divinity Original Sin 1+2 set a new bar for different ways to do things both in combat and in terms of choice and consequence; and yet I've never been fully drawn in to either game because I just didn't care enough about the narrative. I always thought that despite being good games they were overrated and overly gushed about by a horde of fanboys - and this was my mindset going into BG3.

Then you have the first area which finds you in a MIND FLAYER SPACESHIP and my first thoughts in early access were ""ok Larian have done Larian, I'm sure it'll be good but in the end this will be another game I'm not keen on. It's not a Baldur's Gate game"". After just a couple of hours I was experiencing the first hints of how wrong I was - about everything.

Let's start with the basics of the overall technical value. In true Larian form there are multiple ways to do things but they have taken what they were known to be good at and improved every aspect tenfold. Every large quest and even most ""side"" quests have so many different possible approaches that it would take thousands of hours to find every secret the game can present but this alone wouldn't normally do anything to change your general experience of playing a game. It NEVER feels like a slog, never feels like you are doing anything just for the sake of it. Every NPC is fully 3D rendered and voiced. There is no ""filling"", no crowds where people are just wandering about to illustrate a mass. No one you can't talk to. No one that has nothing to say. The fact that this extends to wildlife and even dead bodies makes it all the more incredible of an achievement. The graphics and the voice acting are of a standard beyond any other party based RPG ever. I'm aware this sounds like exaggeration but trust me it isn't.

So, Narrative and characterisation? I'm going to be quick about this because there's no way for me to give any examples without spoilers. Any detail you hear about this game, any stream, any walkthrough, perhaps even any screenshot, is a spoiler. Things fit so perfectly from a tale telling perspective that there ARE no side quests - just shorter stories within stories. There are many characters that you will love and more that will annoy you. What's important is that the main ones are fluid. Dialogue will change your opinion of someone who was previously annoying you so much that all you wanted to do was take their head off. These are not cardboard cutouts. They barely feel designed/scripted at all. Sure the game is full of set pieces and boy are they a treat almost every time.

The game world is huge and PACKED. You can barely take a few steps without running into something unexpected or another quest. And it's all entertaining and thoroughly engrossing.

Here's the bombshell; and it's something I never thought I'd say about any game, after a little over 20 hours played it's already looking to be better than anything Bioware (or Obsidian) has ever done. If you ever thought imagine you could have an RPG with Bioware level storytelling and Larian mechanics then this is it - but better than anyone has any right to expect. They took years longer than they said they would to finally get this out and it doesn't take long to see why.

I can't wait to get to the end (which doesn't mean I want to rush to do that), to play it all over again, and to try it in co-op.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"EDIT: 

I created a video review for Patch #8. If you want to check it out I put a link at the end of this review. I know a lot of people found this initial review helpful and I hope my most recent one can help people decide whether or not they want to buy the game! 

So should you get Baldur's Gate 3? If you really like Larian RPG games then probably yeah, it's a lot like their other games with a few major differences that might make you not enjoy the game: 

1) The skills don't have CDs like in other games, they're based on 5E D&D so they're based on your class, so your class selection is very important and you'll need a balanced party.

2) If you're big into D&D games like me you might be frustrated at some of the Larian game mechanics, like Ray of Frost leaving ice beneath the feet of enemies and similar spells leaving fields on the ground that debuff or damage targets. Ray of Frost is the biggest offender since slipping on ice ends your turn, or your opponents turn making it the best mage cantrip for its RNG value. 

Is this game a sequel to Baldur's Gate 1 and 2? 

No, so far it seems like it has nothing to do with the other Baldur's Gates game besides the fact you're trying to get to Baldur's Gate to some degree but can't because monsters are fucking around in the countryside, as per usual. Your character is also not a Bhaalspawn so I'm not sure why they called it Baldur's Gate 3 when more accurately it should be like: Baldur's Gate: The Mind Flayering or something similar. 

Does the game run well? 

Depends on your machine, mine is fairly powerful and with the game ready Nvidia Driver the game runs smooth, however textures kinda pop in weirdly, the game is in Early Access so it's expected that the graphics aren't full up to snuff yet. 

Does the combat feel good? 

Yeah, it feels pretty good they got the 5E stuff in game to work really well and they added in special weapon attacks that make a big difference. The Combat is deadly, but fair and you have loads of options to subvert encounters and crush your enemies. Beyond that it's not a big murder hobo affair either you do murder many things but I was surprised when I actually found some friendly monsters who'd normally be murder hobo fodder. Larian also wisely shot the alignment system of D&D in the head behind a shed which was a good move since 5E doesn't really use that system very much anyways. I find the AI however has a hard time handling stealth attacks, where I can sometimes get three free stealth attacks against monsters if I have my rogue hidden well, perhaps that's a bug or a reward for good positioning I can't say. 

How is the Story? (Don't worry, no spoilers)

Story is pretty fine and the characters you meet along the way are interesting. Some are a bit hostile towards you but due to the situation you find yourself in I think it's 100% natural that your party will be distrustful towards each other and your character. However I found that even the more nasty characters do warm up to you quickly, or at the very least treat you as a decent person. I read some reviews after playing where reviewers complained that the party ALWAYS hated you. But I only ever felt that one NPC hated me, and now after a few hours into the game they talk to me as an ally and have even confided into me about some of their own secrets making me feel like it's something that could easily become a true friendship. One praise I'll give it that others will call negative is that some persuasion options might not be good ideas. Please use your common sense, you might not want to tell sensitive things about your situation to certain people or even if you pass your check it might have a negative outcome, in this case passing the check makes a really bad situation a bit less bad. You also get special dialogue options due to some special magical powers you get rather early on in the game though I'll avoid calling them by name because that could be a spoiler which give you OP persuasion options that you cannot fail, however I like that the game implies that by using these powers you can get some negative backlash, these options even let you learn extra details about certain characters that share your condition though I have opted not to use them since I assume it will worsen my relationship with the character. The only downside of conversations is that in single player you can't change who is talking to perform skill checks. I had a Dex check in a conversation to pick a lock but couldn't let the rogue do his job to pick the lock. There was also lacking a dialogue option of me just using the key I had on me to unlock the shackles the guy was trapped in. The animations in conversation are also fairly stiff looking and your character only has a few stances they take, they're kinda annoying and I hope they add more variety to them. 

So how good is the game in Early Access? 

I'd say pretty good, you get a large area to explore and the characters are varied and the story interesting if a bit high fantasy, though I feel Baldur's Gate was also High Fantasy, I will say I'm not a fan of certain named characters existing in the world like Volo who I found, but I was happy to learn you can also mindlessly murder such refferences and rob their dead caracasses with only minimal consequences (I bribed a guard like 200 gold after I killed Volo and stole all of his swag, it was super worth I'd recommend murdering Volo in every game he's in.)  Beyond that I'd say the game is on the right track to be a cool RPG, though the game requires patience if you want to avoid murder hoboing, the game gives most characters even goblins actual names which makes talking to them and learning their secrets worthwhile, I'd recommend talking to as many people as your patience can handle to solve problems non-violently since some fights are nearly unwinnable. Also don't forget to scout around with your rogue to find shenanigans to cheese encounters and make sure you're not about to walk into a hornets nest.

Game of the Year.

100 hours in.
Still creating my character.

I genuinely don't know how human beings made this game. It's like the video game version of the pyramids. It’s better than the hype. It's the best money you will spend this year.

As someone who played Dragon Age Origins so many times as a teen, playing this game felt like meeting a long lost friend and it made me so happy. To me Baldur's Gate 3 felt like a fully realized version of DAO.

After the first 20 hours, I was simply stunned. They managed to take everything that I've loved about D&D, and distilled it into a video game. To say it’s been worth my time is an understatement. This is like showing up to play D&D and your DM has every battle map, mini, a binder of world lore ready to tie into your own backstory, voices every character perfectly, lets you pickpocket the boss because it’s fun, and tells you they got nowhere to be so you can play for the next four days.

I literally cannot get the game out of my head. The combat. The lore. The story. The sheer audacity they thought they could this and they did. I love it very, very much - pretty much everything is of such an outstanding quality. The voice-acting, the plot, the visuals, the cinematic qualities, the soundtrack (ohh, the soundtrack) It's intense and beautiful, hauntingly sad. It's about deeply flawed people, about redemption and love and forgiveness. There is a vast amount of quests, often compellingly written. You get attached to characters, you take your time reading notes because not only do they tell you more about the lore, they help you understand what is happening and make decisions upon it. This game is 123GB and they're all used for something that matters.

I think the complexity of the game is its selling point.  The world is so dense with content, filled with characters who directly influence the story and are directly influenced by it.  Even a random NPC that you chat with in Act 1 could end up playing a major role in the story by Act 3... or no role at all if they die instead.  You can see the layers within the decision making, which gives weight to everything you do.  Who you save, kill, team up with, etc. all end up telling a different story, making the game really feel like it's YOUR story being told. Then they did that thing that separates good writers from average: make absolutely memorable characters, make you invest yourself emotionally in them and then put them into impossible situations where they can’t possibly win.

The fact you can play 100+ hours on your first playthrough and come back for round 2 to have a literal UNRECOGNIZABLY DIFFERENT STORY play out is part of the magic. There will be ""did you know in Baldur s Gate 3"" videos for years to come as people find more and more. It’s actually so amazing, my wife’s boyfriend is doing his own play through and then doing one with me and he's getting a completely different experience and dialogue. 

I have three saves right now & each one feels so dramatically different from the others. From timing changing world events, to origin companion dialogue, to choices you make as you're playing - there're so many aspects that change completely. It’s so interesting and shows your actions really do change the story. This game rewards creativity in an almost infinite number of ways. The choices presented to the player during the course of the story are staggering in number and a lot of them are impactful. Few games will reach this level of excellence. Well done Larian.

I also really can't get over how every little piece of extra attention you give to an item or an area is rewarding. You can go from stumbling onto a regular book or chest in a random area to having a 3 hour quest you'd otherwise have totally missed. There's probably 50+ hours of content minimum that the game doesn't steer you towards at all. Like there's entire areas you can only find by hovering your cursor over a small hitbox that some players may never discover. All my friends who played had vastly different playthroughs from one another.

The voice acting alone makes this game perfect. It just feels like you are part of a big adventure and there is so many things to do and so many ways to do it that it begs playing it over and over again. Even letting the dice fall as they do vs save scumming is a strategy. The characters take me back to caring like I did back in Mass Effect. And it's true turn-based which I have grown to love as I've fallen out of FPS's and moved to a primarily single player game player.

The rule set, which is the hardest thing to comprehend for non D&D people, is pretty accessible and the tutorials work well.  It does require some planning, but you can watch a video or two and get a gist. There's also no Ironman mode or anything, so you can literally mess up an infinite amount of times with no repercussions. If you get it, make sure to save frequently! The game saves at odd times and isn't very consistent. There's no rolling ""save every 15 mins"" or anything.

On top of that, the tactics of the combat is immensely satisfying.  It can be obtuse at times because there are LOADS of status effects, environment effects, spells, items, and conditions that can overwhelm you if you're not paying attention.  But to those who WANT to pay attention, there is nothing more fun than examining an enemy, determining their weaknesses, seeing they have a weak WIS and using a spell with a WIS save to completely neuter them. In that way, fights have a way to be incredibly difficult if you're not paying attention to the details or an absolute breeze if you know how to use every tool at your disposal.

Yes, this really is a once in a decade kind of game. Crazy it is also a $60 no strings attached no shops, no passes, no DLC, just one huge and complete game. Truly has permanently raised Larian into RPG developer godhood among the likes of those like Square and Bioware. I'm convinced this masterpiece will be studied by many game developers for years to come. It’s a game that will be referenced for decades. As far is the specific genre goes and arguably gaming in general it just set a high bar. Much to the displeasure of dogsh*t publishers and devs everywhere.

BG3 is not a perfect game but man the experience, replay value, freedom is unparalel to anything I have ever seen. You can just feel that every person involved with this game has put all their efforts and devotion to this. It's made with so much love. It's a game that stays with you.

If you like Dragon Age Origins, I guarantee you'll like the game. It's a CRPG but also a successor to BioWare games like DA, Kotor, and Mass Effect (and obviously the original Baldurs Gate games if you're old like me). I highly recommend it.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"This is absolutely my GOTY. One of the best CRPGs of all time, perhaps the best mainstream CRPG ever made. My playtime is real (minus the 12 hours I spent in EA), so you can see the game is HUGE. And all that playtime is filled to the brim with well-executed content.

So if you like RPGs, tactics, huge adventures, and bears, the game is a must-buy. It's not a question. The only real question is: is [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] a 97/100?

Short answer: Act 1 absolutely is. And Act 1 took me 56 hours. If the game [b]only[/b] consisted of Act 1 with some sort of ending, it would already have been brilliant. Think about it: less than one third of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is already a better game than most other CRPGs on the market. How is it even possible?

Later, however, it starts to crumble under its own weight — and I don't just mean the bugs. Those will be fixed; the meaninglessness of many final choices and lack of companion interaction likely won't. 

And it's a damn shame.

[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]
Larian RPGs aren't simply RPGs, they border isometric immersive sims, and it's a great concept, brilliantly executed here. You have your ordinary RPG fare: classes, abilities, XP, lockpicking, traps. And then you have a simulated world that you can interact with in creative and sensible ways. Can't pick a chest? Just take it away to open in camp. A boss is too tough? Surround him with explosive barrels pre-encounter and blow to smithereens. Or befriend him — you can side and kill any faction in the game. Can't reach someplace? Aside from various teleportation spells, you can also just carry a bunch of boxes to build a tower wherever you need.

Traversal is a separate — and unique — feature of the game. Most CRPGs are flat, apart from terrain in some battlefields, sometimes. Larian uses the Z axis to its full extent. [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] has interesting jumping puzzles (what right does a CRPG even have to have those?). Some of its areas, like the Monastery, feel like legacy dungeons from a FromSoft game, and I mean it in the best way possible. They're [b]fun[/b] to explore and find routes through, secrets in. It's a game as much about exploration as it is about story and combat.

(Not to mention that it uses verticality for spectacular visual impressions in some areas.)

Another critical aspect of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]'s exploration is just how dense it is. Even the emptier areas are [i]packed[/i] with content. You find characters, secrets, reactivity, small stories. Figuring out a secret sometimes requires unique interactions, like reading a scroll in a certain location or casting a specific spell. It's brilliant, and fun, and the best aspect of the game by far. 

No other product on the market offers anything remotely comparable.

[b]STORY[/b]
It's hit and miss.

I'd put it this way: in this game, Acting > Characters > Story. [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is incredibly well-acted, I can't remember a single character, even minor, that would be presented as anything less than good, and most main characters are just charisma personified — to the point where I was disappointed I couldn't have more interactions with someone like Ketheric. So whenever a character arc struggles a bit (being too cliche or too melodramatic), the acting makes up for it. And since most characters are interesting enough, their personal stories make up for the less brilliant part of the overall narrative. So in the end, it works. 

Writing has never been Larian's strongest suit. Since you can befriend or kill any character in the game, their writing in Divinity tended to be skin-deep — and it's definitely MUCH better here. So that's progress.

The tone of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] would probably not be for everyone. It rarely takes itself too seriously — and it's at its best when it doesn't. The small comedic storylets (like with the smart orge) and characters (like Minsc) just ooze charm. The erotic scenes are honesly very cool — if, again, you don't take yourself too seriously. With many of them, you're not meant to.

It's also very black-and-white, almost outdated in this regard. You can absolutely have an evil playthrough, but do understand that ""evil"" means ""cackling sadistic evil that enjoys splattering squirrels and forcing people to kill themselves with their own daggers in front of you."" Good and evil are objective qualities here — and there is no grey area, no attempt at deconstruction. It's all fun if you go with it; just keep it in mind.

The game's pacing is also great. You need to rest from time to time, usually after harder fights. And most long rests launch cutscenes that explore one story or another: of your party members, weird urges, or mysterious Guardian. Companions also have a LOT of reactivity and interjections in random events. It's all mixed up to create a very natufal flow. I don't think a lot of players even notice it — rare occasions of unique reactivily (like characters having reactions to having been killed and resurrected by you) are flashier. But don't underrate the importance of overall pacing. Pacing can make or break a game.

[b]SO WHAT IS WRONG HERE?[/b]
Act 1 is absolutely brilliant and one of the best games I've ever played.

Act 2 makes some odd choices, but at least they're clearly artistic. After a dense location filled to the brim with content and reactivity, you find yourself in a huge open area with trash mob ambushes. I appreciate the Bloodborne-esque aesthetics as much as the next gal, but why does the game willingly forefit its best assets: the interesting secret-packed exploration, the reactivity, the interlocking events, the verticality?

Hint for future players: defy your natural instincts and follow the main story in Act 2 instead of exploring everything before getting to it. It'll send you off to explore anyway, but in a more fun way.

Act 3 is... huge. It's probably bigger than Acts 1 and 2 combined — which makes sense, you expect the city to be lively. And the stories are still all right in theory, but — well, half of them just don't deliver. 

The game fails to fulfill its ambitions.

You can side with [spoiler]Gortash[/spoiler] and his sensible evil proposal — except all you get is the inability to finish some companion quests and discover perhaps the biggest twist in the story, you can't get a ""normal evil ruler"" ending. That deal with the devil you made? A short cutscene in the end and nothing more. [spoiler]A non-illithid can't control the Netherbrain[/spoiler], except if you make a treacherous choice in the final cutscene, where you suddenly totally can. It feels good to gather allies for the final battle, but each of them only utters a single phrase — less than random characters in the street!

Generally speaking, siding with evil never feels like an equal choice past Act 1. It feels like a way to skip a boss fight. You're never rewarded by content for it.

You can't even discuss the final events with my whole party — only the three characters you took with you! How does that make any sense! Not to mention that companions have little to say over the course of the whole act, and there are zero to none unique interactions between them (like the conflict between Lae'zel and Shadowheart in Act 1) — and this is in the part of the story where I want their insights the most, to see how they've changed.

Don't get me wrong, the final conflict is still... all right. It offers no surprises and has too many moving parts, and your mysterious Guardian plays a role too technical and not compelling enough. And you're very much railroaded into the good ending. But it's still interesting and epic compared to other games.

It's just that my expectations were set much higher. Because Act 1 was so brilliant.

[b]CONCLUSION[/b]
Still one of the best CRPGs ever. Buy it. Play it.

Just temper the expectations Act 1 sets. The game won't hold to the same insane standard of quality, and honestly, it's okay. Even 50 hours of that quality is a treasure.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"This is the best videogame I have played in decades. I feel like I curled up with a great book for 281 hours while binge-watching an epic series, all while playing a game that felt challenging but also super rewarding. The storytelling is amazing! There is actual character development, and things don't always go the way you expect they will when you start off.

Things you experience in the first act come back around way later (in my case over 100 hours later) and your choices MATTER. Playing this at the same time as a lot of my friends (and activity feed) was especially fun because everyone had a totally different experience, which means that there is solid replay value here. {I am already planning my next-- and the next after that -- playthrough!)

It's not 100% perfect, the UI and particularly inventory and party management systems could be less cumbersome (and if Larian doesn't take care of that, I am sure the modding community will) but it is damn close! With years in early access, the first act has clearly been tested much more than what follows, and there are some buggy experiences. But, wow, what experiences they are! This game is so dense in Act 3 that it almost is a little overwhelming. 

Baldur's Gate 3 IS the most polished game I've played in ages, and for once I don't feel like I bought half a game and will be buying the rest of the game later, one dlc at a time.",best videogame decade curled great book 281 hour binge watching epic series challenging super rewarding storytelling amazing actual development thing expect thing act case 100 hour choice matter friend activity feed especially fun totally different mean solid replay value already planning next next playthrough 100 perfect ui particularly inventory party management system cumbersome larian care modding community damn close year early access act clearly tested follows buggy experience wow experience dense act 3 overwhelming baldur gate 3 polished age bought half buying rest dlc,3,0.9927
1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"This review is going to put aside all the controversy as well as some of the push-back from other studios etc. This is about BG3 itself, not involving politics, social acceptances/unacceptances and social norms, etc. So if you are interested in that type of review that doesn't include all that stuff, keep reading. 

[h1]NEGATIVES[/h1]
If you are looking for instant gratification, you won't get it, actually you may not even want to read the rest of this review because it is long and detailed as this game truly deserves it.

Some bugs exist particularly later in the game, you may notice slower dialogue, or scenes that just appear to stop or have awkward pauses in them. It is not unexpected with a game of this scope. With that being said, do yourself a favor and actually read the patch notes. They are actively being worked on and fixed. I myself came across a few particular bugs on I think it was August 6th or 7th and quite literally in the August 8th Hotfix the bugs I came across were fixed.

There are some quests that appear to be broke or contain some misinformation. They are not [b]MAJOR[/b] quests or won't result in full on blocks to the story but they are noticeable. Most of the time they appear to sort themselves out but can potentially confuse a player. My suggestion is to use the report feature but don't let it stop you from continuing forward.

Dice rolls, honestly there are times where I feel like the Dice are weighted against the players. I mean 95% chance of success on an attack and you get a Critical Miss (which means you rolled a Nat 1) when that single attack would have ended the encounter if it hit. But now the enemy gets one more turn and manages to take out 2 of your best teammates? Huh?

Skill checks, there seem to be a lot of skill checks that you can outright fail and then have no way of knowing what it was you missed and no way to go on and discover it. This may upset some people as they cannot get the satisfaction of knowing what was there, only knowing that something was there since it was clearly a failed check.

No True Guidance - Take this as a negative if you will. I am posting it here because often times people are always looking for guidance for something. This game does not hold your hand. It provides you with objectives and marks spot on the map for you. It is up to you to decide when you will do it, how you will do it or even if you will do it. With that being said it is certainly possible to lock yourself out of other quests and encounters or parts of the game entirely because of decisions you made. (To my fellow Dark Urge players, you understand.)

Clunky - there are parts of the game that seem to be incredibly sluggish at times, especially if playing for long sessions. I imagine this is being actively worked on but really only starts showing itself in like the middle to later part of Act 3. I have made reports about it myself, but for you performance lovers out there, you may see some performance dips especially later in the game or during long play sessions. 

Steam Deck performance - Performance on the Steam Deck is good, however the controls seem to be a little bit clunky. The game runs fine but the controls require some getting used to especially if you are like me and play actively on both the Steam Deck and the PC. 

[h1]POSITIVES[/h1]
BG3 is an excellent game that even with 306 hours I still have so much more to do. This game is a [b]COMPLETE[/b] product. You pay your money and you get a [b][u]COMPLETE & FULL[/u][/b] experience. No battle-pass, season-pass, yearly-pass, whatever-pass. No content locked behind a Pay-Wall. Nothing. Just a genuine full and complete game like back in the old days when I started gaming almost 25+ years ago.

The amount of work that was put into this game is 100% apparent. The sheer amount of details that the Developers took into consideration when making this game is astonishing. I can't begin to say how many times I have done something out of the box and the game ""anticipated"" it. The atmosphere in this game truly exhibits a notion of ""This is your character, you do what it is you want,"" and the game acts accordingly. It is not the reverse where you act according to the game. 

There is something to be said about the attention to detail that the developers put into Baldur's Gate 3. You can tell it was a labor of love and dedication to a project. Not just some new Title that needed to be released to satisfy a deadline and bring income. The Development Team truly loved creating this and loves continuing work on this project. Just look at the Hotfixes. You can see it if you step back and just think about what must have gone into creating this masterpiece. 

The mechanics and gameplay itself are excellent. It isn't ""handed"" to you, especially in the later acts. You need to think, you need to utilize your brain and take into account all that is going on, who you are up against, etc. etc. You need to author your story. The satisfaction one gets from completing a difficult fight is next level. There is one particular battle that involves a particular soundtrack, that I KNOW will stay with me forever, and that says a lot.

Moving to the next point. The Soundtrack of this game. It is another masterpiece within a masterpiece. The atmospheric scenes created with the sound, the battle music. It is all next level and truly is something so underrated. There have been a number of times where I just stopped, just to listen to the music. Even side-missions like with a particular Bard in a particular grove has an entire cinematic scene dedicated to the music and it is just awe-inspiring. Just stop for a moment and think just how much went into making that one scene. That is the type of love and dedication that the studio put into this game and you just don't often see that anymore. 

The World feels alive. You go into a Grove, or you go into a town, and it is bustling with NPCs carrying on their routines, having an argument, fighting, training, [b]commenting on something YOU as a player did because they heard about it but have no idea it was you as it was just a rumor[/b] and are having this conversation [b]with another NPC[/b]. Just step back an appreciate that and think about how much effort was made for the game to adjust itself to one of the tons of different ways you could have done/accomplished/failed something.

Combat - combat also is rewarding. There are so many different options, use your environment, perhaps you picked up some barrels from the tutorial zone and have been holding onto them since the beginning of the game and decide you want to toss them into the battlefield and detonate them, or maybe you been lugging around some barrels of alcohol that you now want to utilize on the field. Go for it. Maybe you bit off more than you can chew and need to make a tactical retreat. Combat is so dynamic, there is no ""set-way"" to do something. Your options are numerous. Maybe you do want to just truck through everyone and don't want to think tactically. Sure go right ahead. The mechanics themselves are intricate, with the different damage types, resistances, buffs, debuffs, etc. All within the nature of Dungeon and Dragons. 

The Story - it is yours to craft and how you get to the end is up to you. It is detailed, it is interesting, it has its twists and turns that will make you say ""no way,"" ""are you serious,"" ""I knew it,"" and the list goes on and on but you are the one who creates the story.

[h1]TLDR[/h1]
If you are looking for a full and complete game with wonderful music, a studio that cares about their community base and product, great mechanics and an outstanding story that you create with your decisions and you can look past some minor over-sights in a game of this magnitude and slight performance issues that are actively being worked on then Baldur's Gate 3 is for you and you will get your money's worth, with or without any DnD experience.

1778820,TEKKEN 8,"Arguably the best Tekken game to ever release.
I felt like with Tekken 7 a lot of the aesthetic and identity was lost. 
Tekken 4, 5, 6 and TT2 had amazing identity, graphics and style that made Tekken what it was.
8 brings back its style, identity and flow that we've all been missing in T7.

The roster consists of 32 characters, each with their own unique fighting style, moves, and combos. It holds a rich story mode, a variety of online and offline modes, and stunning graphics and sound.

Story mode picks up where Tekken 7 left off, with the final showdown between Kazuya Mishima and his father Heihachi Mishima. We explore the origins of the Mishima family feud, the secrets of the Devil Gene and its orgins as well as the fate of Jin Kazama, who is missing after the events of Tekken 7. The story is presented in a cinematic style, with fully voiced cutscenes and dynamic battles. 

Gameplay is fast-paced, fluid, and responsive, with a balance of offense and defense. There are new mechanics, such as the Heat mechanic, which allows the player to unleash powerful attacks as well as recovering health, chip damage and Power Crush, which allows the player to absorb some damage and continue their attack. The game also has a variety of stages, each with their own environmental hazards and transitions.

Online mode is robust and smooth, with a ranking system, a replay, and a spectator mode. We also have cross-play between different platforms, allowing players to challenge each other regardless of their device. Sounds are impressive and immersive, with realistic character models, detailed animations, and expressive facial expressions. There are diverse and dynamic soundtrack, featuring rock, techno, and orchestral music.  The voice cast is of talented actors, who deliver their lines with emotion and personality.


To sum this overall great package:
Positives:
+ Amazing gameplay
+ Phenomenal Design and graphics
+ Stages, characters and moves are perfect
+ Tekken Ball
+ Online Lounge and online modes in general are smooth except Day 1 Release
+ We can use all Tekken soundtracks in the game from T1 all the way to T7 and 8
+ The Story is awesome. Really well done.
+ Easy to get into. Arcade Quest and the tutorial really help out bringing the best in you. It's easy to practice, easy to learn and very hard to master.
+ The Ghosts AI is actually capable and useful. What a great design choice and implementation.

On the negative side:
- Not enough customisation options. T6 is still the GOAT in that regard
- No Tekken Force
- The sound of punches isn't as satisfying as T7 but it's good enough still

Tekken 8 is a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike, as it offers a satisfying and thrilling fighting game experience. The game has a lot of content and replay value, as well as a deep and engaging story.

1778820,TEKKEN 8,"[h1]Preface[/h1]
By no means am I Tekken master nor am I a fighting game maniac. But as a gamer who is familiar with almost every genre, I try to play every fighting game I can get my hands on. It's safe to say that I at least know the basics of fighting game mechanics and what it takes to ""get better."" In the recent years, with the help of my best friend from high school, I've had a chance to learn the ins and outs of games like SF6, Dragon Ball Fighterz, MK, and even some anime fighting games. As a result, the more I invested, the more I learned. The more I learned, the more I enjoyed the games. I grew up with the OG Playstation and Tekken 3. Now, 20+ years later, what a great time it is to be alive: to witness the eighth installment of the Tekken series.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
In the fighting game genre, I think we can all agree that if the game is fun, the game is already great to a certain extent. Back in the day, that's all that mattered. Now, we've got other categories to consider like amount of content, cosmetics, replayability, updates, etc. But let's face it: when it comes to Tekken, no one can deny that it's the legend among legends when it comes to the bare bones. They solidified the game and introduced the new heat drive(?) system. They went the same route as Street Fighter 6 in that they brought the ""special style"" for newcomers - akin to Modern controls in SF6 - to just press buttons and enjoy the game for what it is. Of course, we all know that this will only get you so far; and to really delve deep into Tekken, one needs to get the kids' gloves off and play like the Tekken legends of old (lol) to learn combos w/ manual inputs and understand what you're actually doing. Regardless, there are many ways to enjoy the game by whatever means necessary. The game perfected the Tekken recipe and it is indeed the best Tekken to play in 2024.

[b]Content[/b]
Two things that were noticeable: companies know that a lot of players are not as hardcore and excited to play online/ranked so it feels like they implemented a strong Ghost system for players to enjoy in the long-term, especially those who deem themselves ""less competitive"" like myself. When it comes to replayability, I think this is a good way to enjoy the game further past the story/arcade modes without stressing out about playing online. Second, the special style allows players to ""see"" what certain characters can do without lifting a finger, really. Well, maybe using your thumb to chain simple combos but it definitely makes the character bust out the flashy stuff on the fly.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[b]Story[/b]
Tekken's story is beyond disappointing, and this has been the case since T4. It's your average hero beats villain, angel vs demon routine that every Tekken has brought so far. No real character development, no real stakes. Just a Jin/Kazuya fest as usual. I have this lowkey feeling that the writers have this hard-on for making the Japanese characters look cool and have the characters that represent the rest of the world be their side pieces, but this might be just minor politics at play and wouldn't really bother me.... IF THE WRITING WASN'T SO SUBPAR. $20 says AI technology can do better for Tekken 9. Then again, every anime series post-2010 has had similar subpar storylines all over the place so.. I guess they just lack creativity and prefer to take the ""safe"" way when it comes to stories (just like Ubisoft).

[b]Customization[/b]
This one's a bit disappointing. Do they plan to release more accessories and outfits in the future? If so, are they gonna be paid DLC...? Case in point, the customization options that are available at launch are underwhelming to say the least. I don't know why I was expecting to feel more excited to see the likes of T6 and TTT revived. But I might have gotten my hopes up a bit too high. At least we can make LEON from RE4? Cyberpunk for Jin? A bootleg Kenshi from MK for Victor? GOKU FOR LARS?

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Final Verdict: S[/b]
Arguably the best Tekken game of all time, for veterans and newcomers alike. The biggest compliment I would like to throw is that in a game industry where we're used to companies releasing unfinished games to rake in the $$$, Harada and his team really took their time and sweat blood and tears to bring Tekken 8 to a near-perfect state before unleashing it upon the world. Also really looking forward to how Knee dominates the tournament scene once again.

For the past few years, I've genuinely struggled to get excited to play any game I own or could buy. My passion for gaming reached an all-time low near the end of 2023. And 2024 brought more of the same—[b]a new year, same old burnout plagued me.[/b] Things weren't looking good, bruv.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147207996
I was legit thinking of calling it quits, but only after publishing my cute little flipbook project I worked on for the past 6+ months. Plus, I was once again (still am) tormented by (I assume) RAM issues, despite already getting a brand new kit from G.Skill on the 3rd of January after going through their RMA process.

But that's a story for another day.
Back to [i]Tekken 8.[/i]

On [i](Orthodox)[/i] Christmas Eve, I was scrolling through my YouTube feed, and [i]Tekken 8's[/i] teaser popped up. I already watched it back when it was first shown—[b]I did not care![/b] Yet, now I did!? After that, I watched the story trailer for the first time. My tummy felt weird—[b]'twas butterflies![/b] I was giddy with excitement. I was looking forward to a game for the first time in forever! And it was a game from a franchise I did not care for and from a genre I don't even like. It was an [i](Orthodox)[/i] Christmas miracle! Then and there, I decided—[b]I must play it day 1![/b] As fate would have it, I had just enough TF2 keys sitting in my inventory to fund this desire of mine. So, I did.

To pass the time until it fully came, [b]I played the demo, loving every second of my 23 hours spent with it.[/b] Sure, its content offering was small: only 4 (out of 32) playable characters, the first battle of the story mode, the intro section of the Arcade Quest mode, and a few Super Ghosts fights that let me reach only the [i]Warrior[/i] rank. But it's the motion of the ocean that counts! And, oh boy, [b]did it rock my boat![/b] The 26th just couldn't come soon enough.

The gameplay shocked me by how easily I jelled with it. Fast, flashy, and furious, yet it was welcoming to a complete noob like myself. I was loving the learning process, and it didn't feel overwhelming. I even managed to get gud at doing some simple combos and air juggling, so that's nice. And I love the new gameplay addition—the [b]Heat[/b] system. Being able to stop my opponent's attack flow by using the [b]Heat Burst[/b] attack, which is uninterruptible, is music to my ears. Sure, you can easily block it, but this is where the fun begins—[b]trying to time it, [i]just right![/i][/b] Plus, the [b]Heat Engager[/b] and [b]Heat Smash[/b] [i](I do be engaging in smashing)[/i] attacks can be used to extend combos and deal even more damage in the process. Simply majestic. The trade-off is that [b]Heat[/b] only lasts 15 seconds. But do you really need more than that? Sometimes less is more, you know.

Speaking of cool attacks, [b]Rage Art[/b] is present once again. This is essentially a super funky high-damage special move you can only do when your health is low. I can't count the number of times using it saved my noob behind from dying. And I gotta say, they are always a treat to watch. [b]This superbly animated sequence, combined with the game's insane visuals, sparks joy each and every time I watch one play out.[/b]

And all the fighting is [i]extra[/i] spiced up by the crazy amount of special effects on the screen each punch, kick, grab, or flying leg kick thrown produces. I can't explain why, but I love the sight of them. [b]It makes watching the punch land that much more oh-so-satisfying.[/b] The animations are also fantastic, further adding to the amazing feel of the combat.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260998
The visuals are simply insane. [i][b]Unreal Engine 5[/b][/i] shines, and so do daddy Kazuya's massive [i]pecs[/i]! Everything, from the arenas, some with multiple rooms you can blast your opponent into, to the character design, is superb and extremely rich in detail. Just amazing stuff. But there's one complaint from me—[b]Paul lost his iconic hair and looks like a Karen[/b] (why [i]Bamco?[/i]). 

Also, if you enjoy character customization as much as I do (a lot), then the Arcade Quest mode will be your wet dream. Here, all bets are off, and we'll get free reign over how our fighters look. Will they look wacky? Yes. Creepy? Also yes. Lewd? [b]Hopefully.[/b] Giving players more customization options and freedom is always a plus in my book!

Lastly, the over-the-topness of the story seems to be intact.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260668
I can't wait to see what one of gaming's most dysfunctional families, the Mishimas, is up to. Likely a lot of half-naked men fighting each other, preferably near a cliff, volcano, or maybe a cliff overlooking a volcano. We shall see.

Simply put, [b]it's all (gonna be) perfect![/b]

And after having written 99 reviews, my 100th review will be the first and last [i]improper[/i] one. But [i]Tekken 8[/i] deserved this sacrifice, as it reignited my passion for gaming when no other game could.

So, thank you, [i]Tekken 8.[/i]
Thank you to all the developers who poured their hearts and souls into this game.
Lastly, thanks to all of you, top bananas, for coming to my [b]TEK[/b]talk.
I hope you all enjoy [i]Tekken 8[/i] as much as I am.

love the game, but i sincerely hope this business model dies before it does any more damage. we dont need more games being predatory and shitty.

[h1][b][1] Intro : [/b][/h1]

TEKKEN 8 storms onto the scene, reviving the legendary fighting game series with breathtaking new-generation visuals and an immersive battle atmosphere. The game introduces a roster of 32 fighters, each meticulously designed with elaborate detail, showcasing the power of new hardware capabilities. The environments are vivid and dynamic, with destructible stages adding an exhilarating layer to every match. This installment's standout feature is the Heat battle system, an aggressive and thrilling addition that maintains the unique play feel of the TEKKEN series. It enhances the intensity of fights, making each bout more exciting and visually stunning. Rage Arts return, adding a dramatic flair to battles and appealing to both players and spectators alike.

[h1][b][2] Game Experience : [/b][/h1]

TEKKEN 8 isn't just about fierce battles; it also introduces the Arcade Quest mode, allowing players to create their avatars and embark on a personalized TEKKEN journey. This mode is a refreshing change of pace, providing a more individualized experience in the TEKKEN universe. The game’s storyline continues the tragic saga of the Mishima and Kazama bloodlines, picking up six months after the previous installment. This continuation of the longest-running video game storyline adds depth and context to the battles, making them more than just random matchups. For longtime fans of the series, this narrative progression offers a satisfying dose of nostalgia mixed with new twists.

However, TEKKEN 8 hasn't been without its share of criticism. User reviews reflect a mix of admiration and frustration. The game's online playability, a critical aspect for modern fighting games, has faced scrutiny. Players have reported issues with server stability and online matches, which are crucial elements for a game that relies heavily on its multiplayer experience. Additionally, the trend of offering early access to content for more expensive versions of the game has been a point of contention. This business model raises concerns about fairness and accessibility for all players. While these issues don't detract from the game's core appeal, they are significant enough to warrant attention from the developers.

[h2][b][3] Final Thoughts : [/b][/h2]

In conclusion, TEKKEN 8 is a bold step forward for the franchise, offering stunning visuals, an engaging story, and innovative gameplay mechanics. While it captivates with its high-octane battles and character customization, the game's online issues and business model practices have left some players feeling short-changed. Despite these drawbacks, TEKKEN 8 remains a compelling addition to the fighting game genre, promising hours of exhilarating entertainment for both new and veteran players.

1144200,Ready or Not,"Look, I am not exaggerating here when I say this but, Ready or Not is genuinely one of the most thrilling, nerve-wrecking, exciting and best games I have played so far this year. For someone like me that grew up playing SWAT 4 pretty much every day after school on my dad's old Dell PC this game brings back a lot of nostalgia for me which makes it even better. I think I speak for all of us that played SWAT 4 when I say we have all been waiting and seething for a similar title that can scratch that itch - Ready or Not does just that. The game is fantastic in every single aspect. I also love how punishing and difficult it can be at times. The margin for error is very small, which just adds to the realism. 

The game very much fits the ""Early Access"" model at this current state and content is neither here nor there in my book. At the moment there are currently 6 vastly different maps, a hotel, a gas station, a crack house, a port, a farm and a car dealership. All 6 of aforementioned maps are beautifully crafted with the visuals immediately immersing you in the world you are playing in. The sound design is awesome as well, might I add. The sound of explosions, flashbangs, the guns, they sound and feel impactful, something even AAA studios fail to replicate at times. 

The AI are either good or straight up stupid at times, they are definitely the one thing that needs the most work. But I find that most of the time they do work relatively fine. 

I hope to see the implementation of achievements - which would be cool to grind for/incentivise us to play - and more customisation - that stays true to real life, of course, Jesus forbid we get another RS6 - and potentially more weapons to fool around with.

1144200,Ready or Not,"Just when everyone thought 2021 was over in terms of relevant releases, [i]Ready or Not[/i] appeared out of thin air. Well, not exactly out of thin air. People knew it was coming, and it has been under development for a while now, but [i]Void Interactive[/i] was being rather secretive with the early access release date, throwing people off the scent with a [i]Twitter[/i] post two days before the public EA release with the classic “it just might come out this year”. And it did. 

[i]Ready or Not[/i], or [b]RoN[/b] like people usually refer to it, is a tactical shooter in the making, that promises to eventually become just as good as the legendary [i]SWAT 4[/i] from [i]Irrational Games[/i]. Your character is a [i]SWAT[/i] operator and your job is to arrest or kill bad guys, make sure civilians are safe and apprehend drugs, illegal weapons, destroy human trafficking schemes, and so on. The usual tactical police stuff, done brilliantly. You can either play alone with four AI-controlled teammates or cooperatively with up to four teammates, with the twist that there’s no friendly AI to offer a hand or two, meaning that heading to the mission with just one or two friends will be rather challenging. The enemy count varies per map and it’s often dependent on the environment: some will naturally have a higher civilian to bad guy ratio due to its sheer likeliness while the opposite also occurs. Currently, there are five different maps to choose from, with an extra two [i]WIP[/i] environments, still untextured and ridden with glitches. Granted, it’s still an early access title and more maps are going to be released, along with full modding support so that the community can also help provide extra content to warrant unlimited hours of fun.

As far as content is concerned, there isn’t a lot just yet, but the variety is good enough to allow different approaches to each mission so that the replay factor is nearly endless. From your average M4 rifle to a paintball gun (yup), they got you covered. The gear list is also rather extensive, with different vests, masks, cop paraphernalia like battering rams, breaching shotguns, C2 explosives, flashbangs, even a camera thing that allows you to look under doors. Who’d ever imagine that voyeurism could be used to enforce law and order!

As it couldn’t be any different with an [i]Early Access[/i] title, some things still do not work as expected, an OK thing if it gets fixed, and it probably will. The AI can be rather unpredictable sometimes, with civilians running from you, sometimes locking themselves in rooms with the enemies, or just straight up hiding from you and making your mission take a lot longer because you and your friends end up forced to play tridimensional [i]“Where’s Wally?”[/i].  Something else that might annoy you ever so slightly is the fact that civilians and enemies don’t have a lot of different voice lines, meaning you will hear the same sentences over and over even during the very same mission. Granted, it’s probably a placeholder. On that same note, the cop’s voice is way too calm, which differs a lot from real-life operator footage telling bad guys to drop their weapons. But once again, a placeholder card probably applies. 

The gameplay aspect is where [i]RoN[/i] truly shines, sporting the possible best gunplay on the market, shootouts are dynamic and challenging. The AI can be very accurate at times, making it so you and your friends got to be on the very edge, with eyes wide open. It doesn’t take much to die, just like in real life. You are not a bullet sponge, nor are the enemies or civilians. As a matter of fact, civilians are even more fragile, so be mindful of that and take extra care when breaching into a room with thugs and civvies inside. That’s where the tactical element comes into play and cohesive play rewards you, while recklessness can be punishing. There are multiple ways to approach the different situations that you will be faced with and no right answers. Go with your guts, trial and error, or develop standard operating procedures with your friends so that everyone knows what to do and what not to do to get things done the cleanest way possible. It’s easier said than done, as [i]Ready or Not[/i] is very hard and will give you a tough time if you are not paying enough attention. The sheer unpredictability makes for very fun and engaging gameplay. 

It would be interesting to have a little more dynamism on certain stuff, like objective items that always spawn at a fixed location, making it so you always know where to go and how to get there efficiently without major hiccups, which is good from a speedrunning standpoint but doesn’t help when it comes to longevity, because it will get repetitive quickly. On the other hand, enemy spawn points are always random, with no mission playing the same, even if the items will always spawn at the very same location. Just like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get.

Visually, [i]RoN[/i] is impressive. Powered by [i]Unreal Engine 4[/i], it certainly does not disappoint with textures, lighting, level design, and performance. It doesn’t take much to run, and my old faithful [i]RTX 2070[/i] could easily run it on epic settings in 1080p, well above 100 fps, with eventual drops here and there. As expected from any so-called next-generation title, it supports [i]DLSS[/i], which boosts the overall performance quite significantly, up to 40% even in sub-4K resolutions, without compromising the visual acuity, meaning no ghosting, no artifacts, as clear as it can be. A really solid implementation, even more so considering it’s still a work in progress.

It’s no exaggeration to say that [i]Ready or Not[/i] is perhaps one of the most solid early access releases ever. As much as it still has a lot of things that are not quite up to standard yet, the gameplay mechanics and the challenge are enough to keep you coming back for more. A breath of fresh new air into a genre that we haven’t seen much from, apart from [i]Zero Hour[/i]. It was a long, painful wait, but SWAT 4’s spiritual successor is finally among us and it’s great.

WIP

[h1] Old 'happy' Early Access Review: [/h1]

They wrote ""SWAT 5"" wrong.

Seriously, though; the game is sick!
It is made to be highly replayable and punishing.

It has all the great things late SWAT titles had plus ergonomics simulation.

Pros:
Punishing.
Made to be as realistic as possible.
Weapon sounds are the BEST around, I'd risk saying.
More features coming on top of what we encountered over previous games.
Hostile AI is a challenge. (harder the better, without escaping from realistic)
Maps are well made.
Outstanding lighting techniques on graphics.
AMD FSR to keep your GPU happy and cold.


Downsides:
Graphical glitches.
AI glitches.
Limited content as in early access.
Weapon customization design makes it impossible to have flashlight and laser at the same time. (Escape from Tarkov still is king on weapon attachments).


Notes: RON doesn't compare to Ground Branch. If you have one, the other one will add a lot as they overlap each other very little.

PLEASE, DEVELOPER: Don't make this game focused on PVP. Single player and Co-Op is where the longevity is. Keep it as replayable and creative challenging as possible.

It pains me to say it, but I have a hard time believing this game is made by the same Rocksteady that gave us such incredible and timeless games like Batman Arkham Asylum, City and Knight. I liked the closed alpha this game had back in late November/early December 2023 and wanted this game to succeed, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game, especially given the asking price.

Spoilers may be ahead.

While the story is serviceable, I have issues with this game taking place in the same universe as the Arkham trilogy (or quadrilogy if you count Arkham Origins), it doesn't sit well with me and I think the only logical explanation as to why Rocksteady and WB tried to piggyback off the Arkhamverse would be to improve sales and reception, which based on early reviews and impressions, has backfired spectacularly.

There is also a strong argument to be made that the events of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League diminish and de-value the story of the original Arkham games.

It is for this reason, I will consider the Arkhamverse as ending with Batman: Arkham Knight. I do not care what Rocksteady or WB say, but Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is not worthy of being in the Arkham universe.

The gameplay I'm rather conflicted on, characters control well and the gunplay is better than I expected, and there are some missions that are genuinely fun, but the gameplay, especially towards the end is let down by a boring, repetitive and grindy mission structure that has no respect for the player or their enjoyment. I can only conclude at one point this game was meant to have loot boxes and purchasable weapons and items, that instead got morphed into mission rewards for completing boring and repetitive side-missions, which have minimal, if any relation to the story.

Towards the end of the game, I dropped the difficulty from medium to easy, this was after beating all the Justice League members (which as a side note weren't that hard) and this is a core issue I have with the game. 

You would think the hardest parts of the game would be the Justice League boss fights, requiring you to use the abilities of all four main characters, but they aren't, the Justice League boss fights are rather easy by comparison to some of the side missions and activities, which just throw endless goons at you, some of which have invincibility or can only be taken down by certain modifiers, like grenades or shield harvesting, which don't always work well either and the game doesn't do a great job of explaining what all these combat mechanics do.

The game expects and wants you to grind out side missions and activities before proceeding, rather like a lot of Ubisoft titles, but this isn't fun, and runs contradictory to what Rocksteady themselves said about this game not being grindy and respecting the player's time.

Overall I'm very disappointed, we've waited 8 years and this is what we get...

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"[h3] From the creators of Batman: Arkham, Suicide Squad: Kill the Arkhamverse is a genre-conforming third-person action shooter where the ultimate band of 4 useless douchebags must do the impossible: Kill the beloved franchise. [/h3]

[b] The following story section contains SPOILERS [/b]

Truth be told, the caption was for the purpose of memeifying, IYKYK. It became highly controversial in a short span of time, and perhaps didn't born under a bright star in the first place. In no way would I think the late Kevin Conroy is disrespected. It's a retrospective thinking given his unfortunate passing. He had volition, and he accepted the role, imaginably knowing the script beforehand. I respect his autonomy and his ultimate decision, but I still do think it was a character assassination to Bruce Wayne. Getting killed off by a juggalo groupie before listening to a morale lecture from Harley Quinn, who can never have a moral high ground over the symbol of sheer will. You might want to read that scene about more 'winning' than morals though. Still, there is a clear tonal dissonance between the previous Arkham Trilogy/Franchise and Suicide Squad. Unlike Arkham, there's not much morale or gravitas. It's your typical 'beloved superheroes gone mad/bad' bs which is not something I am fond of. A lot of trouble could have been easily avoided if they switched the roles of WW and Batman. I am pretty sure Rocksteady knew Batman would have fixation set on him after we played almost a decade with him. SS does not only dissapoint Batman but all the members of the JL, perhaps the slight exclusion of Wonder Woman, who was the only one uncorrupt at that time, killing them off in uncreative, anticlimactic ways. In all fairness, I do get SS are a bunch of trash persons, and certainly, the game is self-aware. All the voice actors did an incredible job. They are portrayed faithful to their comic book counterparts (albeit probably a bit closer to DCEU), and they are incredibly self-centered. They even try to run off before inevitably failing to do so. While the game tries to give a backstory to each character, especially by creating a personal beef between them and the members of JL, it ultimately fails. The story is overcooked with bunch of armor plots and plot devices, and winks to the multiverse, another pain in the ass concept. It's a way to reintroduce Joker and the upcoming chars, but don't get surprised if JL is back (ehm datamined voice lines) or the story is changed up to a point where it'd be almost unrecognizable or simply retconned. I don't like the idea of progressing the story with each season. It's a risky decision to take. The game might die as well soon enough therefore the plans get shelved. Btw, the game also disservices its own protagonist; Deadshot. He's still a serviceable character. But introducing him as the 'real' Deadshot not only fucks with all the people who loved the representation of his alleged doppelganger by turning him into a goof but also makes the Clown Prince of Crime look like a dork. Arkhamverse's Joker is extremely intelligent; wouldn't you think under the Black Mask moniker he already ran an extensive background research on the very assassins he hired by himself? The story is often undeniably lame-ass. The humor is sometimes on point and just nails it, and sometimes it's at best on MCU level, coming off as unnecessarily corny. The suspense is usually hard to keep. That is why this should have been completely an Elseworlds story given the fact each season will be adding one after all.

[h3] Gameplay & Traversal [/h3]

For some people, this will be the ultimate factor that truly matters. Traversal is GOATed in this game. It's akin to Sunset Overdrive and allows you to lose yourself in flow. Each character is quite agile and has unique aspects to them. Traversal not only plays a huge factor in exploration but also in moment-to-moment gameplay as it lets you create unique chains of combos and not lose any momentarily heat from action. Solid pacing. You can switch your character at will almost instantly and some characters will be psyched up meaning if you play certain missions with them you'll be granted with bonus exp and loot, a great way to encourage player to test out & play as the other characters. You can pause the game at pretty much any given time. Offline play is desperetely needed sometime soon.

Gunplay is not the absolute beast but is solid and competent enough compared to ones like Borderlands or Outriders. You have traversal attacks that play like your 'ultimate.' These attacks aid you in clearing large groups efficiently and look pretty cool. Some attacks need to be countered, requiring you to time your attack and a shield system precisely aim at certain points (e.g. legs) & melee to break shield and harvest. The game's reliance on shields heavily reminds me of Borderlands, as you are quite fragile without them. There are shield mods, a variety of weapons, etc., to be found, and while it follows the traditional looter-shooter formula, it rewards you legendary stuff rather quickly. Yes, you'll keep grinding for better gear; however, it doesn't make it overly painful, which is a rare sight to behold. At the end of the day, it's still an engagement-based product; however, it is more pro-consumer. Battle passes do not expire, and you can work on whichever you like the best, even after a season's end. Bad marketing caused lots of confusion, I'd suggest to keep up with the Q&A team on Discord for clarity.

[h3] Mission & World Design [/h3]

Missions are apples and oranges. Bunch of them are your generic open-world activities that you must bear through to progress the story, highly repetitive in nature while the others are actual story missions with top notch cinematic story presentation. Open-world activities and side stuff consist of generic tasks like holding off enemies in waves or killing X number of enemies, and so forth. However, since the gameplay loop is often addictive, you are most likely not going to mind doing these. Yet, it still fells flat and leave a lot to be desired.

Metropolis is dead. I mean, how could it not be? Invaded, turned into the goons of Brainiac, if not vaporized. Might not be the most vivid and alive version of Metropolis you could ever have, but Arkham was not too different, being mostly occupied by mobsters and thugs. The map is highly vertical, much like the Arkham games. You'll be running through walls of buildings and jumping off from rooftops for the most of time.

[h3] Performance [/h3]

It ain't without problems. You can't force exclusive full-screen (ik, DX12 and W11 compatibility yada yada). It would heavily utilize your CPU, but ever since the newest generation of consoles stepped up their game, more games capitalized on processors, only more will keep doing so. I wouldn't call it Jedi Survivor/Forspoken level bad, but with a 3080ti+12700kf, I ended up getting 40-50 fps in most of Metropolis. Good ol' bottleneck. Honestly, the tutorial did trick me into thinking it was beautifully optimized, but the reality left a sour taste in my mouth. Indoor areas, as opposed to outdoors, usually achieve your targeted FPS easily. Upscaling does not work as intended. Lots of stuttering. Game is a pleasure to look at; granted. Transitions from cutscenes to gameplay are a bit off at times specifically with the bosses.

[h3] Closure [/h3]

Mixed. SS will be forever haunted by its afterthought writing tho it should not distract you from the fun gameplay, then the lack of content and the repeats of horrific missions... I don't think it's end all be all but buy it on deep sale. I urge people to at least try to be kind against the devs whom I imagine did put their heart into the project. I also do know appreciation often works reversely and that Rocksteady needs to grind and hard-earn their rep back. A harsh and sober criticism might be needed but better poised toward WB first. DOA.

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"UPDATE:

I made 2 new tickets. 1 about the lost account and the other about the lost progress. I also sent a separate email to the privacy center. 2 days before this happened, I got the game and it said something about my data and I'm tired of everything taking our data and selling it for profit. So, it offered to go to a site to request them not to sell it. They also offer to delete it, fix it, and see it. I chose to delete it to protect myself. I usually don't care but I guess I wasn't feeling it that day. And I figured why give it to them to play a game? Anyway, there's like 5 or 6 things to fill out like name and email and simple things. Then you submit it and verify your email from a link. NOWHERE in the process did I sign in my account or see anything about my account information. It just said ""data"". 2 days later, this happened. I'm waiting for a reply, but I think they delete your data as in ALL your data. Your account, saves, email, rewards, etc. So, if that's what happened, I'm going to see if they can recover my data. If not, then I know that I lost my account forever with a couple pieces of information to ""identify"" it's me and a vague website that doesn't explain what you're actually doing or use enough security measure to verify it's you and what you want to do. Which is worse than what happened with ""customer service"". I'll update when I have more information. But, DO NOT DELETE YOUR DATA JUST IN CASE. 

Original Review: 

I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER WB TITLE UNLESS THEY FIX ""CUSTOMER SERVICE OR MY ISSUES. I put in over 14 hours of game time and progressed a lot, unlocked a lot, crafted, grinded, etc. Last night I logged off the game with no issues. Today, I went to play and noticed I was in the tutorial now. If I quit the session, it quits the game. There is NO LOCAL SAVE DATA! It's all saved to the WB servers. I went to sign into my WB Games account so I can potentially fix the issue. I realized that I was not singing in but creating an account with the exact same information! This means that my F$#%ING account is GONE! I created the account about 1 year ago almost to the day. I checked my email from creating the account. I also saw the one where I changed my username to what it is. Then I saw the one email where I set up 2FA. I have NOT deleted my account, but it's just gone like my hopes for WB Games and their awful ""customer service"". I reached out on twitter since it seems to be the way when I tried to find out how to contact them. Their site is horrible and is not helpful for support. They asked me for a ticket number. So, I had to create a ticket and they sent me a link. It was ""successful"". I did not get an email confirmation and there is no place to see tickets. So, I did it again and got an email this time and gave them the code. They told me they will tell them to respond. So, they did NOTHING on twitter. I got a reply and started the conversation. I told them how I had an account already and it is gone. I told them the birthday is wrong on the new account I do not even want. I told them how my progress has vanished. Long story short, they ignored the fact that my account is missing, they said the save is made on a ""temporary account that I made while playing and refused to tell me how to retrieve the save, they told me to link Steam to my new account, then nothing was resolved and they told me they're closing my ticket and said they will tell the devs or whatever but ignored my missing account and wrong birthday and how to get the save. This is the most unacceptable experience I have ever had with ANY form of ""customer experience"" in my entire life. I am out an account, save progress, Steam linked to an account I can't unlink it from, and I'm out time and money. I even tried going through the tutorial until I get to the point where I can use the main menu and all I can do is play the current game. This means I can again lose my account and progress and have no way to get either back. I would NOT recommend purchasing this game unless they fix this, or you enjoy losing your account and progress and being ignored. I mean some people are probably into that.

This is a game I knew fairly decently what the premise was and how the gameplay would flow. I saw a metric fuck load of spoilers online but I was still very much looking forward to the story, even past all of the online hate. Mind you, I loved games like Arkham Knight and No Man's Sky which were bashed by the internet for years but are NOW getting love after nearly a decade. But this game is one of the very few times I'll agree with the internet. 

This game has minimal fun. I'm halfway  through the game and have encountered one boss fight, which was cool, lasted about ten minutes. The core gameplay, however, is unfun. Jump from rooftop to rooftop and shoot purple aliens. There are  a few copy and paste side missions from time to time but even the story missions are copy and paste. I'm just constantly being reminded that there are far better superhero video games out there, as well as better looter shooters.

I'm seeing it through because I'm a DC fan and I want to complete the story, but I'm happy CDKeys had the lay up for not paying full price for this shit.

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"I had overwhelmingly low expectations going in, and i was still somehow disappointed. I've never played the Arkham games, so i'm not biased by what came before, but this game was honestly broken on concept and had no shot at being good.

gameplay wise:
-the loot system is extremely boring and almost pointless. i'm getting showered in legendarily and uniques(hell the first weapon drop i got was a legendary) and my main character(boomerang) had a complete loadout of legendary or better before i even hit level 10.
-the skill trees for each character are similar to the ones in borderlands, but they somehow fucked them up since you have no agency over which skills you take. you get one skill per row per tree, and the game picks for you which tree you get a skill point for so you have to level up all 3 evenly. and even worse, most of the perks are extremely boring. you know in borderlands 2 how your perk loadout could completely change the way you play each character based on just one or two perks? yeah that's gone most of the perks i've seen so far are basic stat buffs. the only interesting one i've seen so far is a perk for captain boomerang that slows down time on an enemy when you melee them
-the traversal mechanics are pretty dull. there's 4, one per character(a jetpack, a teleport, a grapple, and a super jump) and all four are too under baked to be even slightly interesting or fun to use. compare harley's grapple to the swinging in spider-man 2 and it really shows how under-used all of these mechanics are since they needed to make 4 instead of focusing on making 1 good one.
-the difficulty is a joke. i beat green lantern and flash in one try on the hardest difficulty and acording to the game i was under equiped for both. neither fight was difficult, i just had to run around like a headless chicken for 10 minutes taking pot shots with the legendary sniper rifle the game shouldn't have given me yet.
-the modifiers on missions are just flat out irritating rather than interesting. you want to only be able to kill enemies with a limited resource(grenades) that you can run out of and all your other weapons deal 0 damage? you want to only be able to deal damage with crits on enemies that have very unclear crit spots and all other damage heals them? no? too bad.
-the game basically requires a controller since the mouse controls are so bad(good luck sniping)
-the scopes are useless. i hit the button to scope in with a sniper rifle and it feels like the camera barely zoomed in at all, it just goes into first person instead of third person without actually changing the distence.

writing wise: i hate it. i hate all of it. there are 4 characters in this game who come anywhere near close to likable, and they're king shark, boomerang(sometimes), flash(in the 3 cutscenes before he dies), and deadshot(because he hates everyone in this damn game as much as i do). the fact harley is a main character too doesn't do it any favors, because she is at her absolute most annoying that she's been in the past several years and not a single line out of her ear piercingly awful voice was funny. in fact none of the jokes in this game are funny, i laughed literally one time in 10 hours and it was when deadshot tried to snipe flash and then flash was looking over deadshots shoulder and said ""did you get him?"". that's it. that's the one funny joke in the whole game and i just spoiled it for you so if you want to play this game for the humor you don't have to anymore.

and the overall plot is just a flat out bad idea to begin with, even if it were done well which it isn't, because where the hell do you go from here? this is a live service game so what the fuck are you supposed to do now? the game's called ""kill the justice league"" so after you kill the 5(not even 7, 5) members of the league, what next? is a new league gonna form off screen and then get mind controlled by a different bad guy so we can kill them next and literally piss on their corpse again?

if you like DC, don't play this game, because it couldn't be more clear that the writers of this game outright hate this property and only like harley quinn and wonder woman while wanting to disrespect every other aspect of this world that they possibly can.",overwhelmingly low expectation somehow disappointed arkham game biased honestly broken concept shot good wise loot extremely boring pointless showered legendarily uniques hell weapon drop legendary boomerang complete loadout legendary 10 skill tree similar one borderland somehow fucked agency skill skill per row per tree pick tree skill 3 evenly worse perk extremely boring borderland 2 perk loadout completely based perk yeah perk far basic stat buff interesting far perk captain boomerang slows enemy melee traversal mechanic pretty dull 4 per jetpack teleport grapple super four baked slightly interesting fun compare harley grapple swinging spider man 2 show mechanic needed 4 focusing 1 good difficulty joke beat green lantern flash hardest difficulty acording equiped neither fight difficult headless chicken 10 minute taking pot shot legendary sniper rifle given modifier mission flat irritating rather interesting able kill enemy limited resource grenade weapon deal 0 damage able deal damage crits enemy unclear crit spot damage heals bad basically requires controller mouse control bad good luck sniping scope useless button scope sniper rifle feel camera barely zoomed go third changing distence writing wise hate hate 4 character anywhere near close likable king shark boomerang flash 3 cutscenes dy deadshot hate damn harley favor absolute annoying past year single line ear piercingly awful voice funny joke funny laughed literally 10 hour deadshot tried snipe flash flash deadshots shoulder funny joke spoiled humor anymore plot flat bad idea hell live service fuck supposed called kill justice league kill 5 7 5 member league next new league gon na form screen mind controlled different bad guy kill next literally piss corpse dc clear writer outright hate property harley quinn wonder woman wanting disrespect aspect world possibly,0,-0.9973

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"I’m stupefied. I’m finding it hard to assemble my thoughts and express how truly sad and disappointed I am with Rocksteady.

What happened? Rocksteady created 3 absolute bangers; three narrative driven Arkham games that became instant gaming classics. They made us believe that we were the Dark Knight and that we were prowling the darkened alleys and skyline of Gotham City. It was a Batman fan’s dream.

First thing that happens when Suicide Squad boots is a option to decline to have our personal information harvested and sold to third parties. Gross! And the kicker? The opt out doesn’t even work!

And then after you’ve signed an enormous digital contract whereby you agree that the game you just dropped £60 on isn’t actually yours and that you’re only borrowing it from WB until they decide to take it away, the game just… kinda… starts. No real cutscene, no explanation for what is happening; you just run and jump around a bland disjointed environment without rhyme or reason. 

To be fair, the performance is good and the gameplay mechanics are polished, but none of that matters because I didn’t feel invested in what I was doing. It’s a strangely soulless experience. The more I gunned down the endless waves of generic NPC’s the more I felt disconnected from the game. I started thinking about what i was going to have for dinner tonight and when The Batman Part 2 was going to start shooting. I wondered how and why Rocksteady had spent 8 years on this project and who even imagined that it was a good idea to greenlight to begin with. 

I can’t imagine this game doing well, I don’t know who this is for. I hope that  management pays for this disaster and not the grunts that have toiled in the trenches for the best part of a decade. I hope Rocksteady survives this debacle and gets to make another single player narrative driven game; perhaps another Batman game or even a Superman. Imagine how cool that would be!

-Graphics are beautiful and music is solid

-Plans for a battle pass system
-instead of earning skins like in the Arkham games, you purchase them with in game currency.
-Story is all over the place and questionable at best.
-Gameplay gets repetitive and combat isn't as satisfying as it was in the Arkham games.
-Level grinding:You can only level one character at a time, inactive characters won't get any XP, you have to grind everyone separately 
-Traversal: the game has a decent sized map, however it lacks any form of fast travel.  This means you have to go to the mission area on your own.  Because the fast traversal methods have limit use the trip back and forth becomes tedious.

To the Devs:
-I recommend including an offline mode, or at least make the base game non server dependent.
-add more costumes in game for the player to earn.
-Give passive XP gain for non active characters to keep everyone balanced
-Adjust the limits of traversal methods to make them more viable to navigate the map.

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"Rolled credits and completing the endgame loop once (If you've seen or played you know what that means) and the idea that this game will survive a year baffles me. 
Traditionally Looter shooters' stories are extremely weak, especially when they launch. Destiny 1 and 2, Anthem, Division 1 and 2, Avengers, all have very middling launches, and survive based on their audience's ability to tolerate their bullshit. I can look past the story. I'll say I'm definitely not happy about how the entire Justice league is unceremoniously killed, and barely acknowledged for most of the game, but I tried to turn that part of my brain off and just focus on getting to the meat of any looter shooter, the endgame. 

The endgame loop in this game, along with the spam of IPad-kid looking combat with flashy numbers that barely mean anything, is abysmal. Without spoiling too much, they want you to run this endgame 13 TIMES over what seems to be the course of a year if not LONGER, and without any signficant changes other than the elseworlds you'll visit while you do them, this game will die within that year, easily. If you check the steam charts page for this game, it peaked on February 3rd, 2024 at the time of writing with 13,459 players. Right now as I'm typing this, we have 6,877 players on February 5th, 2024. 

It really doesn't matter what my opinions are on the game, I can sit here and type that I like the traversal, or that metropolis looks cool, or that while the Justice league is disrespected by a seemingly absent writers room for its 9 hour runtime of a shitshow story, their designs are great, etc. The proof is in the playercount that this game was an abject failure, and has now wasted Rocksteady's past 8 or so years of development. I never WANT a game to fail, I love videogames, I love this studio, but they're going to have to take a good hard look as that playercount sinks even further as to why they should keep this game running at all. 

Your mileage can vary. Some people really like the combat, some people can look past the shit parts of the game and just enjoy having a DC focused game to play in, that actually has some cool loot when you get to the notorious/infamous stuff. Personally I will be playing the loop at least for the next month or so as Joker gets released, and I'll be closely following to see if WB really wants to sink more money into what looks like an already capsized and sunk ship. I cannot however recommend the game. Rocksteady and WB have some serious work to do that will take time, money, and effort, and if the base game is anything to go by, I don't think they have a snowball's chance of turning this around, and I don't know why they would given the playercount and retention is so abysmal only 3 days  after its actual launch (Not counting early access) 

I won't recommend this. If it's on sale and you want to hop in before the servers are inevitably shut down, go for it. I hope I can be proven wrong in the long run. But to me, this looks like another Avengers or Anthem, and without some serious help in the next 3-6 months, I can already see the tweet rocksteady will send out stating that they're pulling this from sales or delisting it entirely.",rolled credit completing endgame loop mean idea survive baffle traditionally looter shooter story extremely weak especially launch destiny 1 2 anthem division 1 2 avenger middling launch survive based audience tolerate bullshit look past definitely happy entire justice league unceremoniously killed barely acknowledged tried turn brain focus meat looter shooter endgame endgame loop along spam ipad kid combat flashy number barely abysmal spoiling endgame 13 time course longer signficant change elseworlds visit die easily check chart page peaked february 3rd 2024 writing 13 459 player typing 6 877 player february 5th 2024 matter opinion sit type traversal metropolis look cool justice league disrespected seemingly absent writer room 9 runtime shitshow design great proof playercount abject failure wasted rocksteady past 8 year development fail love videogames love studio good hard look playercount sink running mileage vary combat look past shit part enjoy dc focused cool loot notorious infamous stuff personally loop next joker get released closely following wb want sink look already capsized sunk ship recommend rocksteady wb serious effort base snowball chance turning given playercount retention abysmal 3 day actual launch counting early access recommend sale hop server inevitably shut hope proven wrong long look avenger anthem serious help next 3 6 month already tweet rocksteady send stating pulling sale delisting entirely,0,0.8593

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"To start with a disclaimer: I watched my friends stream the game after I got a refund after nearly an hour and a half of playtime. I did not enjoy my experience.

***THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS***

Let me begin this review with what little good this game has to offer since that list is shorter:

- The first encounter with Batman: it's just really cool to be on the other side for once and be the prey to the Batman.

-King Shark: not exactly a ""good"" character per se, but more of all of his dialogue was so bad it's good. Every word out of his mouth was hilarious. For the other members of the team, dialogue was just bad.

- Shark Lantern: even this was a wasted opportunity and clearly only exists for spectacle. I hesitate to even call it something good from the game because of how it's immediately undone and doesn't matter. After defeating the Green Lantern, King Sharks puts on his ring and creates a gigantic, green shark to attack Brainiac's ship. It's a genuinely cool experience until you think about it.
First off, it is immediately undone because King Shark with his new lantern power betrays the others by turning the shark against them, and of course they're saved at the last second by them removing his ring. The ring then falls into the water never to be seen again.
Secondly, this is such a huge missed opportunity. There could've been a much better sense of progression if every character somehow gained a power to compliment the JL in the mid to late game especially since these people are expected to fight Superman. Or just don't tease us with that scene at all.

-Not as buggy as your average modern game upon release. This is not saying much at all, there are still bugs, but there are surprisingly not nearly as many as you would expect seeing as how lazy the entire industry is. Not many game breaking bugs either.

Now that's out of the way let's get into the problems.

-The UI. This game is ADHD incarnate. There is way too much going on at all times to the point where at any given point you will likely not know anything that's going on. Furthermore, the UI isn't even unique. It just looks identical to every single AAA game released since 2020.

-The gameplay. To be fair, this does depend heavily on what character you play as, and it can be subjective. Overall it's fine. That's it. Nothing unique (a common theme with this game) or groundbreaking at all it's just fine. In my experience, King Shark was the best one to play as, but even that was a bland experience. Harley just felt like Batman, Deadshot is literally identical to Fortnite, and Boomerang was really bad.

-The story. Seriously, who wrote this? This might be the worst part of the entire game, I think I would be able to get past everything else if the story was written well but it just isn't. As stated before, dialogue is awful. If you've ever seen a Marvel movie, just imagine that. There is very little character development whatsoever, and while there are real scenes that try to be emotional most of them are either ruined by some Marvel tier joke or don't even work to begin with because of the terrible writing from the rest of the game. The only character who had an iota of an arc was Wonder Woman, and it really felt like this should've been a WW game because of it. Too bad she died before that arc could even finish.

-The boss fights/ending. These are members of the Justice League. The Flash and Green Lantern fights were fine, but it felt weird that Batman and Superman went down just like that. It felt out of character for them, but this could be from years of only knowing these two as being basically invincible.
But then there's the Brainiac fight, which is just a reskin of the Flash fight.

Also there are 13 of them. Only one is needed to beat the game but you don't even get the one from the correct universe. Oh yea the multiverse is here too because of course it is. Of course the only reason for this is to artificially inflate gameplay hours to make the game look good. Have fun spending however long it takes to fight 12 more Brainiacs.

And that's it. The game just ends and leaves you with 12 more Brainiacs including the one who attacked your Earth initially. There is no real conclusion to this. The game is just slop designed to keep you playing with no real artistic value whatsoever.

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"Its a pretty fun Looter Shooter with interesting gimmicks going on for it, but bogged down by repetive missions and endgame.

Gameplay:
Honestly the best part of the game, the moment to moment gunplay in battles feels amazing. Every character handles very differently even though they use mostly the same weapons, because of their travel abilities, the game gets VERY hectic on higher difficulties and you have to constantly on the move. Guns feel good and punchy, abilities feel really cool when they oblitiriate a group of grunts and the overall gameplay feels really unique with all the arcadey effects going on. I can't think of a game that feels quite like this.

Loot:
The loot has some really interestign aspects here, first of all there are no level requirements or gear level, if you find a legendary gun in hour 1, it can still be used pretty much as well in hour 40. Speaking of legendary effects, many of them really feel like you could make a build just around them, the effects are interesting and you unlock more legos when you go up in difficulty tiers.

Story:
The main story was there, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Best part of the writing was all of the banter going on, and multiple long running jokes from the start to the end. I was almost constantly smiling listening to the characters talking, but it also wasn't a story just about jokes, i found them to be mixed in really well.

Endgame: I'm still going through the endgame after leveling all launch classes to max level. The loop seems to be: Do short missions in open world to get currency, and use the currency to open a map into a 5-10 minute missions with loads of enemies and good loot. This is where the repetetion comes in, i have 4 missions unlocked, and they are always same ones, only with some different modifiers depending on RNG and difficulty setting.

Final thoughts:
I like the game, but i understand a lot of the critisism for it too, some of it is really blown out of proportion, but there is really fair critisism going on too. I wouldn't give it a 5/10, maybe 6 or 6.5 currently. Its really fun, but i don't think there is currently enough content to go around. We'll see how the first season does. I hope that the game survives for a long time and becomes better with age, but we will see what the future brings.",pretty fun looter shooter interesting gimmick bogged repetive mission endgame honestly best moment moment gunplay battle feel amazing handle differently mostly weapon travel ability get hectic higher difficulty constantly move gun good punchy ability cool oblitiriate group grunt feel unique arcadey effect feel loot loot interestign aspect requirement gear legendary gun 1 pretty 40 speaking legendary effect build effect interesting unlock lego difficulty tier bad great best writing banter multiple long running joke constantly smiling listening character talking joke found mixed endgame endgame leveling launch class max loop short mission open world currency currency open map 5 10 minute mission load enemy good loot repetetion come 4 mission unlocked one different modifier depending rng difficulty final thought understand critisism blown proportion fair critisism 5 10 maybe 6 6 5 currently fun currently content season hope survives long age future brings,3,0.99

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"I'm seeing a lot of positive reviews and I'm confused as to why. Don't get me wrong this game can be fun to play with friends, but it's a game built around grinding for gear with a ""story"" as an after thought. I've never played any of the Arkham games so I can't speak on that front but from what I've read in the comments and elsewhere, this game does not do those games justice (no pun intended). Combat can be fun but it seems to be geared around multiplayer and, being a live service game, Rocksteady has hedged all of their bets on players sticking around just to grind for gear with no other motive. If you just want to grind gear endlessly and don't want to play Destiny 2, I guess this is a fit, but for myself it's just not fun. I haven't run into any serious bugs or glitches so at least it's stable at launch but the traversal mechanics are...a choice to say the least. That could be a skill issue on my part but I don't think getting from point A to point B should be more challenging than combat. 

TLDR: If you want a story, don't bother. If you want to mindlessly dump hours into a game for the sake of grinding for better gear so that you can then grind for better gear, this is the game for you. I still do not recommend because it's just a cash grab imo.

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"It started off well, but by about half way through you have seen every single mission type they are going to do, the city looks empty, half the character's traversals are fiddly and un fun, and worse is that you get to a point that maybe 1 out of every 10 enemies you can actually kill with your gun.  The amount of constraints constantly put on you (can only be killed with a grenade, can only be killed by a melee attack first, can only be killed after building up a meter) on even the simplest grunt makes every encounter a chore.

The cut scenes are wonderful, funny, well acted, and amazing motion capture, but everything else, including the CONSTANT ""evil batman"" voice in your ear when you are out in the field just slowly sucks the joy out of the game.

I don't mind a live service grind, but this is more of a chore, than a way to relax.

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,runs like complete tits and ass.. I love the combat and the story is entertaining but I have been playing for 8 hours straight and the real challenge is the fps. The optimization on release is SO bad.. the fps is absolutely awful and every single graphics setting will not fix it.. I just wanna enjoy the game without it only being a stable 36 fps! The worst part is there are micro transactions in this 70 DOLLAR game. With the option to spend 100 DOLLARS for some random items that are not even worth it.. Why do I have to continue spending money to get all the content even though I payed full price and extra??! I love rocksteady with my life because the arkham series was absolutely amazing. I love that we get to play as multiple characters in this game that is my favorite and what brought me in. But this is completely different than what everyone was expecting.. This game runs worse that gotham knights and this game works alot like gotham knights! With the elements and upgrades with the weapons and gadgets. Not like the normal upgrading like in the arkham games where it was kept minimal and not the whole entire game. But this game has ALOT of upgrades. I like the skill tree's abilities with the flashy effects and stuff because It adds alot of style to the combat and I enjoy that. This game can definitely better and rocksteady can do better. I love them so much and everyone was right that another arkham game would of been the best choice. But I do love playing as harley so maybe this was good enough?

1938090,Call of Duty®,"We're all aware of [b]Skill-Based Matchmaking[/b] (SBMM). 

...but have you ever heard of [b]Engagement-Optimized Matchmaking[/b] (EOMM)? That's what MW2022 uses.

Ever feel like one day you're on a roll, but the next day you can't win a single game? There's a reason for that.

Here's one quote from Activision's EOMM patent they renewed in 2019 ([url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US10857468B2]source[/url]):

[quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2] 
    ...responsive to a determination that the first player purchased the in-game item, the player profile may be updated to reflect the purchase and [b]the first player may be matched to play a second gameplay session[/b] in which the in-game item is suitable to be used.

    For example, if the in-game item is a weapon (e.g., an accurate and powerful sniper rifle), the second gameplay session may be selected because the weapon is highly effective in the second gameplay session. Doing so [b]may encourage the first player to make subsequent purchases[/b] due to the satisfaction of effectively using the in-game item during the second gameplay session.
[/quote]

TL;DR: Microtransactions directly influence matchmaking, rather than skill. 

Not enough? Here's Activison's argument for why EOMM was necessary over SBMM:

[quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2] 
Conventional systems further fail to leverage matchmaking processes in other contexts, [b]such as influencing game-related purchases[/b], suggesting group formations, training/identifying non-player characters, and/or otherwise extending the use of the matchmaking process. These and other drawbacks exist with current matchmaking processes utilized in multiplayer video games.
[/quote]

1938090,Call of Duty®,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.

People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.

Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE. 

The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions. 

You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.

11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on battle.net which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the battle.net servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download battle.net and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially  cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",pre ordered vault edition downloaded early access campaign 2 1 2 hour crashed rebooted permanently banned excuse contacted blizzard sent activision repealed ban activison denied unauthorized software permanent activision ban cheated access oh gladly took 100 dollar non refundable 2 hour imagine bugged server awful care customer 11 6 2022 thread amazing laughed hard awhile thank taking comment cod community hilarious fill happened discovered originally purchased battle net inital perm ban occured left reached activision numerous time 0 luck information talk work repealed ban instantly revoked received automated response ban enforced permanent requested refund denied battle net server logged 2 hour obviously campaign early access blizzard contacted link ban take blizzard mad wanted campaign purchased created new activision great refund 2 hour hence 1 7 hour logged banned 1 7 hour hardware ban insane requested refund instantly whatever tried 3 week wake decide download battle net check status unbanned happened idea happened saw thread blowing read comment checked program installed pc constantly running background task manager read potentially cause issue corsair icue 4 software literally app make ram stick color red lol uninstalled safe headache happened 3 ish week disappeared dealing issue cheater wrong hope thread help activision responsibility anti cheat software trash tell difference regular software malicious software issue thanks intelligence actual input commented,3,-0.9788

Furthermore, it's been 3 months and they've managed to add 3 new maps, 1 of which is an existing map that was just removed from the game for a while. 

They're primarily supporting Warzone 2.0 and barely devote any resources to the game people paid anywhere from $40 to $70.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.

The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.

If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.

If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.

I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.

I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.

On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.

All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.

Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB.
Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc.
Until Activision fixes their dogshit anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.

Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.

Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started.

Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days.

Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release. Everything just feels recycled and it is like Cod is trying to be something it is not.

236390,War Thunder,"I didn't want to leave a negative review, but Gaijin's blatant contempt for their own players has forced my hand.

War Thunder is a game like no other, with a comprehensive damage system, combined arms, and variety of beautifully modeled tanks, aircraft and ships. 

Unfortunately, this ""uniqueness"" has left Gaijin with little real competition over the years. What started off as a ""free to play"" title has over time become less and less free. Gaijin keeps adding nations and vehicles, while at the same time increasing repair costs and lowering RP/SL gain. A premium account isn't enough to comfortably progress anymore, now you also have to buy premium vehicles in every nation.

For the new players reading this, Gaijin has recently admitted that they balance free vehicles around a negative SL income for average players. That means they WANT you to lose money by playing, so you'll be forced to buy a top tier premium vehicle.

This isn't just greedy, it also destroys the matchmaker and the balance of the game. Since you only profit using premium vehicles they often end up being spammed. In battlerating 8.7, more than half the players on each team are in premium tanks. This results in rampant ""one death leaving"". These players only spawn their premium tank and leave when it's destroyed, leaving their team in a bad position. Sometimes the premium is their only tank for the tier, othertimes it's because ""free"" tanks aren't worth the high cost to repair.

Gaijin and their purposefully frustrating economy is ultimately to blame for this. There's so many other issues and scandals I could bring up, like how you can't repair or extinguish flames on your new tank before unlocking ""parts"" and ""FPE"". Gaijin wants you to pay gold to skip the grind for these essential tools.

In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. That might seem hypocritical considering my hours spent in this game, but believe me. It's new players who suffer the most. Gaijin doesn't care about me, you, or the playerbase. Don't make the same mistake as me. Find another game that values your input, and respects your time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit, July 26: 

Much has happened since May and the publishing of this review.

Most importantly, on 13th of June, Gaijin published a roadmap of planned economy changes. 

Most recent roadmap update as of this edit: https://warthunder.com/en/news/8374-roadmap-following-the-roadmap-battle-pass-available-in-simulator-battles-en

This was an unprecedented event, as we have never seen this much transparency from the Devs before.

Despite tempered expecations and a healthy dose of skepticism on the part of myself and many others, the roadmap is actually progressing according to schedule.

One of the key criticisms in my review, that of SL (Silver Lions) has been (largely) adressed, earnings were increased across the board, and repair costs adjusted.

All ground vehicles now have a basic version of Parts and FPE available from the start without needing to unlock the Parts and FPE modifications: basic parts can repair components to partial functionality, while basic FPE is single-use.

Aircraft with countermeasures now start with a basic flare loadout, while mixed / full countermeasure loadouts require unlocking the flare modification.

You no longer have to pay repair cost when teamkilled (finally), and newly purchased premium vehicles now include 15 free backups (extra spawns). 

Backups are a consumable however, and as such it doesn't fully alleviate the ""one death leaving"" issue, as players will quickly spend their 15 backups and continue this behavior after. Gaijin needs to consider making the backup permament.

I don't mean to diminish these changes, they were sorely needed, but there's still a long way to go.

As of today, no changes have been made to RP (Research Point) gain, which is the main cause for slow progression, especially in Ground Forces Mode.

The matchmaking system desperately needs a major overhaul, and battle ratings need to be decompressed. While matchmaking changes are mentioned in the roadmap, it remains to be seen how Gaijin chooses to handle this issue.

All in all, while the changes are positive so far and show a lot of promise going forward, my review will stay unchanged until the roadmap is concluded, and the full effects can be seen.

Lastly I want to thank you all so much for your attention and gracious awards! Thanks to you I have amassed just over 2.5 Million Steam Points! That's mind-boggling, I could've never anticipated this much engagement writing my little review back in May.

236390,War Thunder,"[h1] As someone with almost 1600 hours on this ""game"", don't waste your time on this game with a ridiculous grind. [/h1]


[h1] Basic explanation of the in game economy [/h1]
This ""game"", like many other free to play titles features an in game economy which includes a non premium ""Silver Lions"" and a premium (bought with real life money) ""Golden Eagles"" currency. These currencies are used to purchase in game vehicles and various other items, with the latter ""Golden Eagles"" currency used to by premium content which lets you speed up the grinding of new vehicles.

[b] While this all looks fine on paper, Gaijin, the creator of this ""game"", have been abusing economy for years now to milk as much money from its playerbase as possible. This is done by making the grind extremely difficult (especially at the stages with more modern vehicles) for players that have not spent any money on the ""game"". This difficulty then puts pressure on the free-to-play player base to spend money. [/b]

[h1] And its only been getting worse. [/h1]

Very recently, Gaijin has released a patch that changed the economy and balancing of the game. These changes have made it even more difficult by forcing players to grind more vehicles (a good portion of which are often not fun to use) to reach the ones they are interested in playing. Another cruel change is the increase of repair costs, which is an amount of ""Silver Lions"" you need to pay in order to repair your vehicles and use them again after dying in them. This increase in cost means players have to earn more ""Silver Lions"" from their battles on average in order to profit, making the grind even less sustainable for free-to-play players.

[h1] In fact, a staff member on the official WarThunder forum even stated that the grind was only designed to be profitable with premium vehicles/content. [/h1]


[h1] TLDR; The devs have, and will continue to ruin the game by being greedy and making as much money as possible off of the player base, do NOT play this garbage, it is NOT worth the time investment.

236390,War Thunder,"First, My playing hours are like x2 because I also played a lot of houres outside steam.
I am a rank 100 and play all the factions.  I also have been a very good customer of gaijin as I have bought a lot in their store over the years. And since I have invested so much time and money in it, I would like to give a positive review. But unfortunately I decided not to do that....  And also have decided to uninstall this game. At a given moment you are just done and all the trust is gone.

It is a beautiful game but Devs are just the big problem. They prefer to make new content instead of fixing old problems.
After so many years I have lost all confidence in them. They almost never listen to criticism from their fans and always think they know better. They forget that the fans want to improve the game with their criticism, but are often treated as Gaijin's enemy.

There are so many problems that it is too long for a review but here is a list with the most important:

1. BR compression. Each vehicle has a battlerating like (1.0 1.3 1.7 2.0 ect). A battlerating is an indication of how good a vehicle is and what it can encounter. The maximum battlerating in a match can be +1 higher to -1 lower than your own vehicle. Which means that you can sit between the highest BR and the lowest BR (uptier and downtier).
Now the vehicles are too close together in terms of BR, so compression. Which means that some vehicles dominate heavily and some do not have a chance at all when they come  against each other in a match. Gaijin does not want to solve this problem because they want everyone to find a match quickly. (this is my biggest problem with this game)

2. Gaijin censorship, Gaijin does not like criticism. Post on their form that are critical and viewed by enough players just disappear. Gaijin denies, for example, that it was possible to cheat in their game. When a youtuber proved that it was possible. Gaijin wanted to copyright strike against this person or put the Realistich game mode to Arcade. As a kind of punishment for the player or something. I have no idea why.... Gaijin behaved rather childish.

3. Reporting a bug. During the years I reported all the bug that I found to gaijin. I have send replays and information. From 1000kg bombs that do no damage, tanks shot that disappeared in the air, to planes that were shot in 1/2 and keeps flying smoothly. I have seen everything over the years. Fortunately, there are never many bugs.... so that is good.
But I have never received any answers from Gaijin. The only thing that is done is that your report gets closed, completely ignored or can no longer be found (disappears). It looks more like Gaijin sees you as a burden instead of help.


There are many other problems in this game such as your tank shots that are absorbed into the Optics of the opponents tanks and do no damage or pay to win tanks like the is-6. 

But i have to stop to keep the review a little short, I close it here. 
Warthunder ""can""  become a much better game than it is now.

236390,War Thunder,"Okay listen.

I've got 2,222 hours in this game while I'm writing this. I get that it's confusing that I'm making a negative review.

Tl;dr: This is a good game, but one of the worst, most scummy products I've ever seen. One that preys on people with addictive personalities in a wide spectrum of ways.

All I really need to do is explain the monetization tbh:

-Silver Lions: Silver lions are the non-premium currency for War Thunder. They are achieved passively just by played, and playing well gives a nice bonus. Winning matches massively multiplies silver lion gains (ie, if you kill 1 person in a match you lose in the planes mode you'll get a small amount of silver lions, but even just one kill in a match you win is worth a fair amount, and to a degree this gets better the better you play). But here's the... well... ""but"". Silver lions are precisely designed so that when you first start playing the game, no matter what (ie, whether you are completely free to play, just have a premium vehicle, or have premium vehicles and a premium account) you will be getting enough silver lions to more than cover the silver lion costs of the vehicles you will have access too. Low tier vehicles cost basically nothing to repair, as do almost all premiums (and premium accounts and vehicles both massively boost silver lion income while using them). You might be seeing the problem already, but if not stick with me here. As you progress through the game, if you're free to play you will at first quickly unlock cheap vehicles before reaching more expensive ones, then things will be slower and slower to unlock and more expensive. To be clear, all of this so far isn't a big deal. The issue comes when you reach about 7.0 (battle rating, which is basically just a ""level"" for matchmaking balance) for ground forces or about 8.0 for air forces, in my experience. At this point vehicles are sluggish to unlock and extremely expensive. Buying them, training a crew slot to play them, and every modification all costs SL, but also repairing and rearming the aircraft after the battle. At the lower tiers you might not even notice this. By about 6.0 you'll almost certainly notice this but unless you play very poorly it won't be a major issue. You might have to take it easy right after buying a newly unlocked vehicle, but other than that you're fine. But beyond that, certain vehicles (seemingly arbitrarily, though there's always a long winded explanation that boils down to ""balance"") cost bafflingly, ridiculously, hilariously high amounts of silver lions. If you have about 2-3 million silver lions at lower tiers, you're golden. You can lose some of it if you have some rough matches, but you'll be fine. At the higher tiers, you could burn through that in a day just by being unlucky. Half the time you unlock a new jet or main battle tank it's so expensive you either can't buy it, or can but then can't play it because if you die before getting a kill you lose massive amounts. 

So the question is... why? Why is there vehicles in the game that you are punished for playing? Why is the game designed in such a way that you can progress by grinding for hundreds of hours only to be rewarded by being literally unable to play if you have some rough matches? Well, it sorta brings us to the next monetization, but basically, you can buy Silver lions for real money. If you run out you can pay for more. Now full transparency, this isn't technically pay-to-play. It's more like ""pay-to-easily-play-high-tier"". You're not locked out of playing the game, but if you really want to play high tier modern stuff and don't have silver lions, you're out of luck unless you have amazing matches. Certain vehicles, like the B-29/Tu-4 long range bomber have such a high repair cost, and such a low survival rate that they are essentially useless. Gaijin balances almost exclusively through SL costs. It's awful.

So, next up is Golden Eagles. This is the premium currency. This is nothing new, every F2P game has them pretty much. It's not something I would review a game as negative for normally but Golden Eagles are a small piece of the puzzle. They can be used to buy the majority of the premium vehicles in the game, as well as silver lions, premium account time, decals, decorations, ect. Premium vehicles are often unbalanced on launch but get balanced overtime. I don't know if this is intentional or not but after the IS-6 dominated for over a year Gaijin has toned this down a lot. Still, some are better than others. They're objectively not pay to win, but they are clearly pay to progress. The biggest issue is that new players can pay about the price of a full AAA game for a high-tier vehicle without learning how to use it. The game is loosely designed in such a way so that as you progress you learn the skills you need to progress. It's not super linear but it naturally happens fairly well. But if you can just buy the highest tier stuff with no limitations then you skip the grind, yes, but you also skip the learning. This leads to a lot of very inexperienced players at high tier, who often teamkill, ram, block, capture-point steal, and otherwise ruin the game for what should be the most dedicated part of the playerbase. To be clear I'm not strictly against this but there's already so little incentive for team-play in this game that new players with high tier premiums are never actually gonna put in the time to learn how to play like experienced players do. Again, fine, but it's two clashing playstyles that shouldn't ever really meet. Jets and main battle tanks should, in theory, have the most depth and highest skill ceiling in the game but through a mix of map design, mechanics and this aforementioned premium issue, they actually have the least depth aside from the very lowest tiers, and devolve into head-on ramming and head on charges.

Premium accounts. Not much to say here. Again, normal for F2P games, but on top of everything above, and everything below, it's a lot. They basically make it so you get more research and silver lions. You progress faster and run out of lions slower. It effects other players in no way, since even if you have a premium account, unless you buy a high tier premium, by the time you get to high tier you'll likely be fairly experienced.

Convertible Research. One of the scummiest. Basically you can pay Golden Eagles (real money) to speed up or skip the research of a vehicle. This one just purely prays on frustrated people not thinking clearly who are fed up with the grind. And this game is full to the brim with grind. It is literally endless grind. You will never achieve everything without paying huge sums of real money, but the game loves to tempt you with the fact it's technically possible (until they add the next thing, and they add new vehicles every update more or less). Never, ever ***EVER*** use convertible research unless you have some golden eagles laying around and a bit of research you don't feel like doing. Even then it makes more economic sense to just get premium (vehicles or account). This is a waste of money. Do not use your eagles on this. 

Gaijincoin and the War Thunder Market. Think of the CS:GO or Dota or TF2 marketplaces. It's just that. Turn your money into even faker money which you can't turn back into ""real"" money. There's skins and non-premium but exclusive vehicles on the marketplace. Almost all are event vehicles that required immense grind to get. A few of them are outright overpowered, like the KV-220, and thus go for hundreds and hundreds of dollars. A lot of the cheap skins on here are great though and a portion of the money goes to the artist so it's not the worst thing ever. You can get some of this stuff for free easily. Again, this isn't on its own that big of a deal, but keep in your mind that all of this is in *one* game.

There's also a battlepass (Like Dota, Overwatch, Smite ect.).

Disclaimer: This is a list compiled by u/agysykedyke on Reddit. It aggregates and summarises the abhorrently antagonistic and hostile behaviour Gaijin has shown their community and players throughout the years. This is but a fraction of the malevolence characteristic of this company.

Addendum: My total hours played on Steam are not representative of how long I've spent in War Thunder. I've been playing this game since the beta and have played it on multiple platforms throughout the last ten years with much of it being played through Gaijin's own launcher. After having been disgusted and physically repulsed by Gaijin's treatment of their community over the last two years, I've decided that enough was enough. I have watched this game deteriorate and it is no longer the game that I once enjoyed and hoped would become a maverick of its genre. It exists only as a tragedy of what could have been.

[quote=agysykedyke] [i] In light of the new awful economy changes, I have compiled a list of all the scummy things Gaijin does which worsen the experience for all players, in the name of profit only. I really hope they change some of these things for the better. [/i]

[olist]
[*]Intentionally releasing new vehicles in an overpowered state in order to make people grind as quickly as they can to abuse them before the nerfs.

[*]Intentionally releasing overpowered premium vehicles and not nerfing them, in order to make people purchase them.

[*]The price of said premiums being equal to triple-A games. I don't know how it's excusable for some premiums to be $70 when they already sell premium accounts for $10 a month.

[*]Intentionally making SL modifiers low and repair costs high, so that the average player cannot break even in SL after a game. This encourages them to purchase a premium account or a premium vehicle. This also encourages players to leave after one death to minimize losses.

[*]Implementing research efficiency and tiers to make players buy more than one premium per nation in order to grind. Keep in mind each premium can cost up to $70.

[*]Forcing players to buy a vehicle previous to the one they want to buy, regardless if they ever want to use it. A lot of vehicles should be in a folder but are not, because Gaijin wants you to spend more SL.

[*]Forcing players to buy X vehicles from the previous tier before they can buy vehicles in the next tier. This increases the grind and forces you to buy vehicles that you might never have any intention of playing.

[*]Still making the SL and RP grind painfully slow even if you are using Premium vehicles and a Premium account, especially at the top tiers. Mind you you are paying $10/month + the price of 2-3 premiums per nation you want to grind and it's still very slow.

[*]Intentionally making stock vehicle performance extremely insufferable by locking away essential needs such as Spare Parts, FPE, NVD, usable ammo, and countermeasures. This is to make players purchase these modifications with GE.

[*]Introducing crew qualifications, which are arguably a pay-to-win feature. Aced crews provide significant advantages over basic. The SL cost for expert crews and the grind for Ace crews are not viable for the average player, people just purchase Ace crews.

[*]Putting players in debt over their own mistake after the January 2022 incident. They could have just let those players keep their 7 days of premium as a New Year's gift and take the good publicity but they doubled down. This was so bad that some players were going to take legal action because they felt as if they got scammed, and Gaijin was forced to remove the debt because of the insane backlash.

[*]Selling pay-to-win bush cosmetics, which otherwise are extremely hard to grind for, are unavailable for half the year, and you only get one random bush.

[*]Implementing an RP soft cap, which punishes skillful players because otherwise they would grind too quickly and won't be compelled to spend money.

[*]Introducing strike drones, to make the game more frustrating and to make people lose SL. If you get 2 kills and then die with your drone it will be less SL earned than the repair costs of what you killed due to the modifiers, a net negative overall.

[*]Intentionally making one nation overpowered, then making a different nation overpowered in order to make players purchase premiums to grind the new overpowered nation.

[*]Intentionally keeping the BR's compressed in order to make the game more random and frustrating, to limit skillful players, and make players more likely to spend GE on mods, crews or premiums.

[*]Intentionally making minor nations have underpowered vehicles with very high repair costs and low modifiers, because they are played by mostly experienced players who would otherwise grind too quickly.

[*]Making Boosters expire for no reason other than to take advantage of FOMO

[*]Slashing the economy time after time but disguising it as a net positive. For example, making the players ""choose"", but nerfing the economy either way and putting the blame on the players.

[*]Introducing extremely grindy events with vehicles that never return, or are sometimes OP, capitalizing on FOMO.

[*]Introducing lootbox-style crates bought for GE, or ridiculous amounts of SL, with very low chances of getting the reward you want. This is effectively gambling at worst and very predatory at best.

236390,War Thunder,"Oh how I wish i could call an arty strike on Gaijin's head office.

Let me list the most frustrating aspects of this game:
A bit of a lengthy review but if you are really interested in this game then you should at least skim this review to get an idea of what you're signing up for. Also the first serious review I've done of a game but I have been playing this for 4 years now and it's about time I told (warned) people about it.

The devs:
Has never listened to it's community's suggestions or bug reports. The closest we ever got was when everyone, including the largest Youtuber Phlydaily was pushing to have parts and fire extinguishers to come for free with every vehicle, instead of making it a module to research (or spend money on). So if you get shot in the transmission, yup you cant move the rest of the match, or get shot in the barrel? Yup, you are completely useless unless you can make it to a cap point which sometimes there is only 1. Guess what... they said ""no"" and have since never acknowledged community suggestions since then due to the horrible PR fallout. They balance the game based off players stats in that particular vehicle. Leaving some vehicles completely broken or overpowered for months while data comes in for them to actually do something about it. Easily the most frustrating of these cases was the fact that the battle rating spread is so compressed from power creep that they couldn't figure out what level to put the Maus at to make it competitive and balanced so they just removed it from the game. LOL yeah they barred new players from being able to research it cause they were too lazy to fix their game. They also will gladly make up stats or armor values about tanks to fit their view of what they think it should be capable of. 

The grind:
dear god the insane grind, if you don't get premium AND a high tier premium vehicle ($80 for a year of premium time and $40-$60 a piece for the vehicles, some of which are also broken - STRV 103-0 - to name one) then it will literally take you 6-12 months to grind out a single nation. So if you are strapped on time to dedicate to gaming, then just pick a nation and stick to it or you won't see anything past tier 3-4 (early world war 2 armored vehicles). It will easily take you a year or more to grind out the top tier jets/tanks of any nation.

New vehicles:
Anytime they add a new vehicle or whole nation, which is all the major updates contribute to the game, they generally make it overpowered so people will spend money on getting the ""op vehicles."" The other portion of new vehicles have some extremely frustrating broken/missing feature that they don't address for months and in most cases years after it being well known to the community. 

The maps:
Only 6/38 have protected spawn points, leaving you open to being sniped (sometimes from the enemy spawn) 15 seconds after spawning. There are countless ""unintended"" spots that completely break the map allowing you to see the entire battlefield while also being immune to fire if you have a strong turret (they tried to fix this but failed.) Horrible design flaws continue with layouts that, in combination with game modes, make tanks designed for hull down and defensive game play completely worthless because you HAVE to push to the objective to cap and win. Oh that's right there is 1 single type of game mode: domination, where you have to push to the middle of the map and cap a point, sometimes there's 1 2 or 3. Yup that's all we get for variation in game play across all types (sim/realistic/arcade). Also since they added thermal sights and night vision devices, every 10th game you get is a night battle. Ya and it can take a week or two w/o premium time to grind out the modules that allow for this. Especially for night battles but also generally most people just leave the match  after 1 death. This is only a problem for the higher tiers though, made worse by top tier premiums making for many players to not have lineups to  have a proper ability to fight and finish a match. The worst offenses for Gaijin's inability to make viable maps is that they give you city maps that measure 1km from your spawn to enemy spawn in modern MBT's... As well as very poorly thought out maps that encourage players to go straight to the enemy spawn and spawn camp instead of trying to navigate/fight in their confusing layouts that make no sense from a gameplay perspective but ""are accurate to a real life location.""

Helicopters:
Two words- completely broken. Damage models allow for a helicopter to shrug off 120mm APFSDS rounds through the entire length of the heli unless you precisely hit the pilot, and a lot of the time immune to even direct hits from SAMs and ATGMs. Even hitting the engine and causing a fire won't cause it to crash; only gently begin losing altitude all the while spamming hydra rockets at you, which auto-kill you if you're in a light tank/anti-aircraft. They don't even have their own (functioning) game mode meaning you're forced to use them in ground battles to grind out the later heli's. Which by-the-way require an EXTREME amount of grinding to get to the top of the line, OR as the developers likely intended: just buy your way to. For example, I'm grinding the German line with the BO 105 CB-2: I have 50 kills and 32 battles in a PREMIUM heli with premium time and I'm not even a 5th of the way through the first heli to research. 40k/170k RP (research points) and then there's 3 more after that (requiring an additional 1.2 MILLION RP+4 million silver lions) when you finally get the most OP/actually good heli for Germany. which gets 8 fire and forget missiles that allow you to raze entire flanks/teams within a minute if left unchecked. Did I mention only about a third of battles in ground mode actually will net you enough spawn points to even take one out with AGMs and not just dumb fire rockets. This coupled with the aforementioned horrible map designs, leading to many many games being throwaways, make it nearly impossible without spending money to achieve the top tier heli's. 

Air realistic battles: 
have 1 single game mode variant and it hasn't changed at all since it's introduction to the game back in 2011. It's fun but it takes 1-5 minutes in loading queue to find a game then it takes anywhere from 3-6 more minutes to actually see combat. Also it doesn't really have any use for bombers of any kind, AKA they are irrelevant to winning the game except for literally 2 bombers in the whole game that can actually win the match if they're ignored - B-29 and TU-4. You can't respawn either in this mode so if you spent 7-10 minutes climbing to altitude trying to catch a bomber, only to have them shoot you in the engine then guess what: you have to fly back to your airfield and repair and if the match ends by the time you are capable again you receive nothing for your effort. At which point you just spent 20 minutes waiting for a game, then just flying around climbing/running/cursing.


It reminds me of good old Battlefield 2/3 when there was mass war with helis/planes and tanks all duking it out for victory. 

Game modes: 

Realistic mode, a majority of players -including myself- play this, there aren't enemy markers unless they are hit with any type of munition, which pings a red icon on the mini-map. No assist to aiming and allows for sneaky plays at the cost of also being chop liver for aircraft which are constantly a headache and only require 2-3 kills. AA is cheap to respawn in but some nations get excellent AA while others don't even have any for certain BR's (battle ratings). A massive problem with aircraft being so easily available is the all too common revenge bombing, usually involving the enemy just flying directly into the ground on top of you dropping their bombs a second before death - usually also having enough points again to spawn into a light/medium tank again.

236390,War Thunder,"Allow me to preface this by saying I have been playing this game for years and have spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on this game. Whether on premium currency, buying vehicle packs from the online store or buying premium time. At the time of writing this review I have 240ish days left of Premium time left.

I started playing just before they released Ground Forces. The game started out very fun and engaging, but now 1500 hours later I see the game for what Gaijin have turned it into. They turned a fun game, albeit with a heavy dose of grinding, into one of the least fun games I have played in a long time.

Pros:

1. It looks great when maxed out graphically.
2. The variety of vehicles is amazing. (caveat about this later). There are manyt different nations to play as.
3. Netcode, while not the best I've seen, is very passable for a Free to Play title, with only minor hiccups throughout my time.
4. Bugs and glitches, they definitely exist but they did not hinder my gameplay to the point where I would complain about them.
5. Cross play with either Xbox or PS4, but not with both simultaneously.

Cons:

1. Economy, whether for Silver Lions (SL) to purchase things you've unlocked, or Research Points (RP) to actually unlock them, is a slog. It has been only getting worse as time goes by. It can take ages to unlock the ability to purchase a new vehicle(topping out at just shy of 400 thousand RP), let alone have the Silver to actually purchase the vehicle (upwards of 2 million) and then pay to put a crew in the vehicle (2-3 hundred thousand). Keeping in mind, without paying for premium account, you may only get 500-1500 RP and 10-20 thousand SL per match, which can take anywhere from 5-35 minutes.

2. Premium currency is very expensive, and some of the best and most unique vehicles can only be obtained by purchasing Gaijins premium currency, Golden Eagles(GE). There are alternate ways to getting it besides buying it, as I have heard that certain apps will allow you to accumulate GE over time, but I did not use them myself. There is a secondary currency that they use called Gaijin coins that are 1:1 with USD, which is used in the marketplace they created.

3. The Marketplace. I hate it. Vehicles sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars, it completely changed the way the game felt once it was introduced. It's just like CS:GO skins, only its not just skins. Imagine if you had to buy the AK-47 in CS:GO for $700 before you could use it.

4. The balancing is probably the worst offender in the reason for this review. Gaijin has shown over the years that they do not intend to balance the game, going so far as planning on removing vehicles because they would be to hard to think of a way to balance them. Standard M.O. for Gaijin is to release one or two shiny new vehicles that are overpowered for one to two out of the seven in game nations, wait for everyone to spend money getting to those vehicles and then once the novelty has worn off for players, do it again. It is never a level playing field for every nation. One country gets something that completely outclasses every other nation, every patch. I'm tired of it and its not fun.


I could absolutely write more about the game, but I really don't want to give it any more time. Can you have fun with this game? Yeah, sure, but you probably used to play with dirt when you were a kid and thought it was great too.

236390,War Thunder,"[i]Please read before making consideration:[/i]

I am friends with a former Senior Mod from the War Thunder forums. According to (that person), the mods actively check these reviews and downvote any of them that have any kind of criticism. Luckily for us, Steam prevents them from just deleting it like they do on their forums. I believe the top review here is negative, which is good despite my review being positive overall. People need to be aware of all the faults in this game, which are as numerous as all the things this game does right. 

If you decide to download this game just be aware of the unilateral censorship and active deletion and muting of anyone who offers up criticism (constructive or otherwise) on the forum. They do not tolerate it at all and you will have your post removed and will be given a warning point. The forums are helpful, but can be avoided entirely - which is what I recommend. It's not worth the trouble to deal with the mods if you do or say something they deem critical in any way.

All that said - the game itself is very fun. It's the best plane game on the market right now. Not that that says much, but it's something. The tank mechanics are very poor though, but if you don't mind some occasional RNG wackiness, they are a fun time-killer. 

Thanks for reading, happy tanking (and piloting).

236390,War Thunder,"Oh boy, War Thunder. After playing the game a little I wish I could give it a neutral review, but as of the current direction the game is taking I will leave it as a negative one.

The game itself is fun. It's free, so try for yourself. The main issues the game has begin showing once you reach the endgame grind. e.g. Tier V+. The grind has been getting worse and worse, especially without a premium account and vehicles. Not only in research, but also in purchase and running costs. 
Gaijin attempts to balance things by increasing repair costs, which does not really change the balance, but just makes it impossible to play certain vehicles, such as Bombers, for prolonged periods of time with any sort of profit. As a 100% free player, if the unlocking of vehicles doesn't bring you to a halt, then making enough money to actually play them will do the trick. 

It's quite a shame because under all the grinding and money sinks, War Thunder is a fun game that has taken a turn in the wrong direction. Not into a Pay 2 Win, but in a painfully slow grindfest which fails to reward players properly for their performance in matches.

The worst offender in recent years though, has been the Gaijin market. What started out as a neat little idea similiar to the Steam Marketplace, the gaijin market moved away from a community content driven store, where players could sell their vehicle camos and profit, to a more intrusive model, selling parts for construction events and trying to squeeze as much money out of it as possible. 

I only want the best for the game, hell, in my over 3000 hours I spent at least 200-300€ on the game and without regret.

236390,War Thunder,"I have played this game since I was first introduced to it by jingles. (Jan, 5 2013) When i first started playing i was in love. It was the only thing I ever did all day. The thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time. The game was great. Then the updates started to come... At first it was just harder to make money and xp. People hated it but I kind of liked it. Then the BR system came and balance left. Matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad. Then the russian bias got real. Im not one of those people that complain that I died to X russian plane/tank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying. (planes putting out fires, t-34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the side, ext) But even this wasnt what made me quit this game. It's the company. They are absolutly terrible. Constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs. They threaten to ruin RB if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters? And even steam isn't safe. They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative. I can forgive russian bias. I can forgive the terrible BR system. I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community. To Anton Yudintsev, you made a game that was amazing. I loved it so much and always will. But what you have become as a company will destroy you in the end. Listen to the community, let them help you make the game better. If you do that, this game has a chance to rise back up into greatness.",introduced jingle jan 5 2013 started love thought jet drove 14 hour great update started harder xp hated kind liked br balance left matchmaking trouble fair match wasnt bad russian bias real im complain died x russian plane tank seeing russian tank plane survive thing destroy tank annoying plane putting fire 34s bouncing tiger 2 shot side ext wasnt quit company absolutly terrible constantly censoring opinion dosent threaten ruin rb dont attack youtubers help finding cheater safe constantly downvote negative forgive russian bias forgive terrible br forgive company treat community anton yudintsev amazing loved company destroy listen community help chance rise greatness,1,-0.5299
236390,War Thunder,"As a player who's been playing since the beginning of Raining Fire (released September 2020) I'm proud and disappointed at the same time of this game.

When I first started playing, my dreams weren't focused on the F-4E or MiG-21 variants. I stuck to the US tech tree, and the thought of just strafing ground targets in a SBD-3 as you fly low to the ground was neverending fun for me. I wasn't trying to go grind for top tier jets, I just wanted to have fun with what I had.

New Power came (November 2020) and I think that's where this game started to go downhill. New premium jets were being added alongside standard jets, and, as time went on, I started to change my mindset to grind for jets. That's where my problems begin.

I can applaud the developers for modeling every single aircraft, but i'm not happy because of the grind. Youtube channels rumored a F2P player to finish a tech tree within a year - if they were lucky.

Now, you may be wondering ""why did he give this game a thumbs up if i was going to talk bad about it?"" ""what went wrong?"" 

I gave it a thumbs up because it has the potential to be one of the best combat games out there. Thousands of vehicles, a nice community (no-one really complains about losing or anything or ranting about (X) jet from my experience) the developers are working hard in the midst of the pandemic, and more.

Now, here's the current problems with War Thunder.
1 - The grind is almost unbearable if you have a F2P (Free 2 Play) account

I've tried to grind the US tree with standard planes alone, but that was extremely hard to a point where I felt the need to buy premium vehicles/bonuses/time.


2 - The system is designed to pressure you into spending cash

Although this is classified as a ""con"", the true reason for Gaijin to do this could be because War Thunder is a free game. Because of this, they have to make packs/vehicles/premium currency a thing so that way they can maintain the servers and keep the game alive. Without cash, they can't manage the servers. Without servers, they can't manage the game because the servers can't be used. Without managing the game, War Thunder will slowly die.


3 - Vehicles in Rank IV or V and onward tend to have extremely high repair costs, crew trains, research requirements, and high purchase costs

If you managed to grind a rank V vehicle, you still have to play games in order to get enough currency (Silver Lions) for the vehicle purchase. If you have enough, you still have to deal with a Crew Train (doesn't cost as much as purchase) though poor management of currency can lead you to have extremely low amounts of Silver Lions.


4 - The game needs to decompress

If you never played the game before and don't know what I mean by this, tanks and aircraft have this system called ""Battle Rating"". They are divided into said battle ratings which fit them best. Currently, the game has stopped at Battle Rating 10.7 for tanks and aircraft (ships at 6.0/6.3). 

However, the problems start when the developers add more modern aircraft, and, if they don't decompress soon, players may have to deal with F-15s (if they ever get added), F-16s, Su-25s, etc as a F-100 who was unlucky enough to get put in a Battle Rating 10.7 game. F-100s were made in the '50s. 
They could face aircraft made decades after them 
(all the vehicles mentioned in this portion of the review were made in the 70's except for the F-100)


5 - The team needs to advertise their game better

If you don't know what I mean, almost all of the ads shown featuring War Thunder always have a top-tier tank, plane, or helicopter (top-tier in the community means modern-day vehicles or similar). 
So imagine someone seeing these ads, saying ""oh what a cool M1 Abrams! i can't wait to download and play with it!"" and then downloading the game and realizing that instead of a M1 Abrams, they get a M3 Stuart, a World War 2 era vehicle. 
They then see a M1 in the US tech tree, but come to the realization that they will have to go through hours of struggling, grinding, getting enough currency for the vehicle, only to finally get a M1 Abrams that they will have to use at one of the most dreaded battle ratings of the game.


If the game developers fixed some of the issues here, that would improve the quality of their game by a lot. War Thunder has the true potential of being one of the best combat games out there, but the developers don't seem to be trying to fix the current issues, which, if fixed, could have the game be a lot better and live up to it's old status of being one of the best combat games.

Would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what goes on within. 
If you want to stick to 'low tier',  where it's mostly fun (no grind, no high repair costs, etc) you can, and if you want to play this game for the sole purpose of having fun with early World War Two tanks, planes, or ships, this game would be great for you.

That's all I have to say for now about this game.

Update (5/21/2021):
With Update 2.7 (Red Skies) introduced via trailers and videos from content creators (it's not out just yet), I have taken a look at the dev server streams and saw that they have fixed quite a few things. Thus, I may do a revised review of the game, though not until the game updates to Update 2.7, because we can't judge books by their cover.",beginning raining fire released september 2020 proud disappointed started dream focused f 4e mig 21 variant stuck tech tree thought strafing ground target sbd 3 fly low ground neverending fun trying grind top tier jet wanted fun new power november 2020 started downhill new premium jet alongside standard jet started mindset grind jet problem applaud developer modeling single aircraft happy grind youtube channel rumored f2p finish tech tree lucky wondering thumb talk bad wrong gave thumb potential best combat game thousand vehicle nice community complains losing ranting x jet developer working hard midst pandemic problem war thunder 1 grind unbearable f2p 2 tried grind tree standard plane alone extremely hard premium vehicle bonus 2 designed pressure spending cash classified con true gaijin war thunder pack vehicle premium currency maintain server alive cash manage server server manage server managing war thunder slowly die 3 vehicle rank iv v onward tend extremely high repair cost crew train research requirement high purchase cost managed grind rank v vehicle game order currency silver lion vehicle purchase deal crew train cost purchase poor management currency lead extremely low amount silver lion 4 need decompress tank aircraft called battle rating divided battle rating fit best currently stopped battle rating 10 7 tank aircraft ship 6 0 6 3 problem developer add modern aircraft decompress soon player deal f 15 f 16 su 25 f 100 unlucky battle rating 10 7 f 100 50 face aircraft decade vehicle mentioned portion 70 except f 100 5 need advertise ad shown featuring war thunder top tier tank plane helicopter top tier community mean modern vehicle similar imagine someone seeing ad saying oh cool m1 abrams wait download downloading realizing m1 abrams m3 stuart world war 2 era vehicle m1 tech tree realization hour struggling grinding currency vehicle finally m1 abrams dreaded battle rating developer fixed issue improve quality war thunder true potential best combat game developer trying fix issue fixed live old status best combat game recommend yes go stick low tier mostly fun grind high repair cost sole purpose fun early world war tank plane ship great 5 21 2021 2 7 red sky introduced via trailer video content creator taken look stream saw fixed thing revised update 2 7 judge book cover,0,-0.9382
236390,War Thunder,"Hi Guys, my name is Drake and as of writing this review i have played Warthunder for 3269.9 hours. i have reached the top tier in 3 countries. yes after 3000 hours. all i have is 3 countries. that is WITH premium time and vehicles speeding progression up.

At its core warthunder is a good game, decently well made. but what truly lets Warthunder down is its developers

Gaijin is the definition of lie cheat and steal, they do not listen to the players unless they do something so stupid that the whole playerbase revolts, like when they tried to add p2w repairs and boosts for your vehicles. they removed the maus with a nonsense excuse that it was ""too hard to balance"" when really they just wanted to make it and event vehicle to make money off people that want it. they seed old vehicles that you can no longer get to players in lootboxes that you buy with real money from their rip off Great Value TF2/CSGO marketplace where those vehicles litterally sell for THOUSANDS of real life dollars

they can't be bothered to maintain their game at all, there are still bugs in this game from when it launched like 8 year ago, they make players write a fucking essay on the bug for them to MAYBE pay attention to it because none of them even play the game, so they would not know.

i have NEVER seen worse spawnkilling in a game. ever, ever ever ever. people target the spawn first because its legal with no punishment. no ""keep out"" zone, 10 seconds of spawn protection for tanks.

the prices for premium vehicles are way too much, 60 dollars for a top tier premium (yes they sell top tier premiums) is a little much man, not to mention thaat if you want to progress in any semblance to a reasonable time you MUST HAVE Premium time.

don't let them lure you in with that shiny Abrams or that nice Apache or that sick F-4 Phantom II because unless you are willing to spend a 1000 hours of your life or open your wallet then you won't get them, infact you wont even get close, about a little under 1 percent of players that start warthunder will reach those vehicles, because you need millions of total rp (research points) to get them, and when you get 2000 rp a game... well you see where this is going.

honestly the only reason i have played this game so long is because all my friends play it and its all my potato laptop can run

no review has ever been close to describing all the problems with warthunder and this one won't either. don't even bother as long as gaijin runs the show

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.

There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. 

More tips:
-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. 
-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. 
-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. 
-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. 
-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. 
-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.
-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"[b]24/02/2019 - My review is entirely obsolete due to them removing the starter edition.  They've also changed the prices of the operators, making them more cheaper so hooray![/b]

[h1][b]This is for the people who brought the starter edition... [spoiler]like me.[/spoiler][/b][/h1]

If you brought the starter edition, your best option would be to pick 10 operators since base game operators cost 12,500 renown each.  So 5 operators each for attacking and defending and the 10 that I'm about to list are possibly your best bet to having the best experience in Rainbow Six Siege.

[h1][u]For the attacking team[/u][/h1] 
[list]
[*][b]Sledge[/b] - If you are absolutely new to the game and you don't know where to start, Sledge is one of the best options to choose from. He isn't a hard operator to play with (Considering his name, you should know why...) and the team doesn't rely too heavily on his gadget.  
[*][b]Thermite[/b] - One of the best operators in the game because of how good his rifle is with low recoil and high damage.  His gadget is also one of the most useful in the game especially for creating a [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/oB-9j98APlM?t=1m8s]BIG FUCKING HOLE[/url][/spoiler] on reinforced walls.  Though, to create that hole, you have to make sure you stay alive, the team relies heavily on him to get into the objective but if it's jammed or electrified...
[*][b]Thatcher[/b] -  Thatcher is your main man.  One of the biggest problems you'll face as a Thermite are Mute's and Bandit's gadgets which jam or electrify reinforced walls.  With Thatcher, all you have to do is throw your EMP grenades and no more [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/NPucxmxW5eM]FOOKIN' LASER SIGHTS.[/url][/spoiler]
[*][b]Ash[/b] - She's one of the fastest operators in the game and literally has no hitbox.  Her gadget is breaching things from afar, pretty much a breaching grenade laucher which sticks into any surface.  Just remember that you'll be called a sweaty try hard from time to time...
[*][b]Twitch[/b] - Now this may be a controversial pick since her drone is about to get nerf'd but her rifle is what keeps her on this list.  Her ability isn't that special, basically a drone that can't jump but can shock people and destroy their gadgets.  However, her F2, a variant of the Famas, shoots around 980 RPM and it's possibly one of the most deadliest assault rifles in the game.[/list]

[h1][u]And now, for the defending team[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*][url=https://youtu.be/F-6ZkbVpTcU][b]Rook[/b][/url] - He's one of the easiest operators to play and helps the team just by dropping a pack of armor.  That's all you have to do and you get to survive one extra bullet and will mostly be put in the DBNO stage instead of death.  The only thing you have to remember is to make sure you drop armor in the beginning of the round which a lot of people forget...
[*][b]Bandit[/b] - Bandit's gadget is pretty simple to use as long as you use it on reinforced walls since his gadget is the only one that can destroy Thermite and Hibana's charges on contact.  Also, his MP7 is known as a god tier gun, being incredibly easy to use.  [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/hkLUOuE_-5I]Did I also mention he had to deal [b]DRUGS?[/b][/url][/spoiler]
[*][b]Jager[/b] - Aka the ultra sweaty try hard main.   To be honest though, there is a good reason why people main this guy and that's because of how good he is.  His gagdet may not be that useful at times, having the ability to destroy any type of throwable but I like to call it wishful thinking.  Another thing to help him is that he's currently the only defender with an assault rifle so he gets to do more damage than most defenders which only carry SMGs.  
[*][b]Smoke[/b] - He's simple but somewhat hard to use.  See an enemy trying to get in?  Block him out with gas.  That's why he's called Smoke.  He excels during the last few seconds of a round when enemies are desperately rushing in.  [spoiler][b][url=https://youtu.be/8MHk0WwrzgY]WHAT'S IN THE CANISTER?[/url][/b][/spoiler]
[*][b]Mute[/b] - He almost works in the same way as Bandit but his gadget has a radius meaning he can block off a Thermite's breaching charges on two walls.  He also has the ability to place his jammers anywhere where as Bandit can only place his on shields, barbed wire, and reinforced walls.  He is one of the harder operators to play if you don't use him correctly so I'd recommend learning him soon.  [/list]

[h1][u]Honorable Mentions[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Hibana[/b] - She's an attacker who serves as an alternative to Thermite.  Her gadget is a mix between Ash and Thermite, being able to shoot out 6 pellets and burn through reinforced walls.  She's a flexible operator and her ability can be amazing at times.  She's a DLC character so she will cost 25,000 renown.  [/list]

[h1]So do I recommend the game?[/h1]

[b]Absolutely.[/b]  Even if you buy the starter edition, all it really means is that it will take more time and patience.

Ich spiele schon seit längerer Zeit dieses Spiel und kann nun eine bessere Review schreiben, als zuvor.

Ich würde dieses Spiel jedem weiter empfehlen der auf Team Ego Shooter steht , da es in diesem Spiel sehr das Teamplay gefragt ist...

Die Runden dauern nicht als zu lange und wenn man keine Lust auf Ranked hat kann man gechillt Casual spielen.

Ubisoft versucht wirklich das Spiel am Leben zu halten und setzen dies auch gut in die Tat um

Das Spiel reizt einfach es gibt immer neue Spieler man möchte jede Season beweißen was man drauf hat 

von mir ein dickes + für Rainbow Six Siege



and btw : THE FUTRE belong to R6S !

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Oh, where to begin?
Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike.
So...

What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on.
Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.

When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.

Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years. 

The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.

When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. 
So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?

First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating.
This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.

There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones.
Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled.
The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.

Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. 
Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.

I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has.
Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows. 

Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3",oh love hate relationship siege hated time bit sad manage best despite developer effort close definitive fps pitfall scare new veteran player alike fps round attacker v defender choose operator hero semi unique weapon gadget ability loadout round life per round win completing objective defusing bomb killing enemy player defending hostage attacker scout map small camera drone round defender reinforce wall set trap board door window actual round start weapon look camera ping enemy equipment enemy completing objective kill fps game objective important running open care world probably result instant death dying core siege forced learn mistake dying impact round apart dynamic destruction bullet penetrate soft surface wood thin wall make information extremely valuable tool arsenal destroy surface specific weapon equipment creating new pathway line sight round truly feel different thing siege lack variety enjoy core year weapon great recoil lean left aim sight prone climb obstacle figure control feel pretty natural fps game limited unsatisfying comparison work work machine despite pretty good graphically 1440p 144fps 1070 maxed setting sound great siege bad reputation steepest learning curve videogame already good fps game siege play differently learn thing new fps general honestly siege title worth mentioning tutorial teach outdated plus training mode badly implemented properly half best learn real round watch high player practice aim external program consuming frustrating compounded siege teeming smurfs high player secondary account low lobby hacker bug probably due destruction physic complexity title fix patch brings new one speaking complexity sheer interaction mean sort balance issue satisfied handled client clunky awkward cosmetic mixed bag ugly generic cool one definitely variety friend mandatory heavily encouraged toxicity fun round higher win probability last probably siege tom clancy despite name hoping sequel vega 2 unfortunately siege detail issue picture core mechanic extremely solid completely unmatched industry offer gunplay strategical depth siege despite obvious serious problem winning clutch fight divine headshot three wall feel crap high high low low scared good honest friend go next favorite love hate 3,1,-0.8966
359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.

I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:

The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else. 

To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal. 

Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.

If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.

That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.

I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.

Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.

It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.

The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.

This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.

So that was a shitload of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"[h1][Description][/h1]
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.
 
[h1][Pros][/h1]
+ Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets.
+ No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release.
+ Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far
+ Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior.
+ Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher.
+ A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency.
+ You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players.
+ Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits.
+ Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together.
+ Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones.
+ Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.

[h1][Cons][/h1]
- Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future)
- Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity.
- Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode.
- Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.
 
[h1][Conclusion][/h1]
While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.

Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018

===================================================

Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.

People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them. 

CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)

Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).

=====================================

Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.

Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.

Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.

Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.

Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.

Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions. 

Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!

============================

I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!

Update on January 3rd:

Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:

We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016. 

We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.

Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/) 

Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.

Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.

Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.

Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.

That's it for the January 2018!

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.

I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.

You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.

Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.

The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.

Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level.
Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned.
Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"8/10 Rainbow six siege is a damn fine shooter 

BUT that doesn't mean its perfect so im gonna explain whats good & whats not 

-whats good? 

Most of the time shooting in this game seems very fun and balanced unless its a relatively new operator that was just added (more on that topic soon) 

the game rewards map familiarity, some maps can have destructible floors, walls and ceilings which makes it highly rewarding to go into custom games and learn them on your own.....speaking of which 

custom games! this is such a blessing to have if you really want to take your skills to the next level, also it may help you study any new dlc maps so you can at least know what you're about to get yourself into this season 

Free dlc!!!! finally a decent shooter that doesn't seem like all the devs want is money. yes there is cosmetics in game but nothing like ""pay to win"" but most members of the siege community may disagree with me due in part with the events that happen usually half way through the season (there are 4 season through the year, so you get 8 new ops per year and usually a new map and possibly a new rework on older maps to make them ""better"") each event is different than the last one minute you are carebears shooting each other the next you are rootin tootin shootin cowboys (at least from what the data miners have found) but they have loot boxes that you must buy at least 50 dollars of if you want All the cosmetic for the event in question 

this game heavily requires communication and strategy. Every single operator on the rainbow six team differs from the others, one places bear traps that downs enemies, another has a infra-red sniper scope that can pierce through thick smoke and highlights enemies making it much easier to get distance kills but with that there is weaknesses. the bear traps can be shot to be destroyed and are fairly easy to spot due to how massive they are. the sniper glaz is a powerhouse but when you take a slow sniper against smgs that can shoot faster than you can make a bowl of popcorn, you need to make sure you keep a distance and use recoil against them but also make every shot count one miss could mean it all. 

there is an operator for everyone.
you like being slow and able to take some damage? we have that. you can play as fuze who releases a cluster bomb of grenades in a small area that can pinch off the enemy team if placed right. or as doc who heals your team with stimulant shots. 

you like being faster than god itself? play ash shes a fast operator that rewards the run and gun style plus her ""gadget"" is a grenade launcher that allows you to blow away any soft walls that lay in your wake. or as bandit whos able to place car batteries on barbed wire making them electrocute anything that may cross as well as add electricity to any reinforced walls. 

or how about a nice mix? you have twitch who can take her drone around and remove enemy's gadgets, cameras and can even inflict damage on the enemy team. or you may play as frost (the bear trap operator). 

there is pve as well but its very lacking but it does exist 

the devs are also very quick to fix MAJOR bugs in game.

but my favorite thing about this game is the content creators, they all are very fun loving guys and gals and they help support this amazing community. 

-whats bad? 

there is moments when ranked play can just feel like udder crap, toxicity is very common in this game most time its just bland dry sarcasm or humor that can be taken the wrong way. 

new operators are kinda always broke when they first release but are usually fixed not too long later but other times its too long 

this game has a high learning curve 

headshots are instakills! sometimes it will feel unfair because you will turn a corner and get domed seemingly out of nowhere. so get that aim up dude. 

this game has frequent updates to fix a bug or issue but sometimes that just creates more bugs

1966720,Lethal Company,"The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.

Its extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.
Hearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.
It truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.

PERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:
A monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.

1966720,Lethal Company,"I don't know what comparison to draw to explain the games mechanics. It's a survival horror but it doesn't fall into a monster hunt category like Phas. 
This game does allow for players to make their own fun as well, it does not have to be hardcore at all if you don't want it to be. Its very socially comparable maybe to Among Us although I was not a fan of that game. 

This game is about collecting scrap. The objective is to meet an ever climbing quota in 3 days which makes it run based, after failure to meet quota you restart. There is a shop you can spend money at for cosmetics or useful items. Because you need to hold everything in this game it means you really gotta plan with your team what you're going to take with you (If you're going for long runs) otherwise you'll find yourself short and you might find yourself being introduced to the companies disciplinary measures for lazy workers. 

Each monster has audio queues to recognise and methods of detection that you will have to play around. Giants have very keen sight but pick up on movement and don't hear well.
Dogs can't see at all but they're fast and chase after sound. 
I'll leave it at that for now but there are methods to dispatch/avoid the various creatures and most don't feel alike to deal with. This also makes monster combos something to really keep in mind when setting up your teams load out. 

There are 3 tiers of maps based off difficulty/reward. The final tier require that you pay(Not real money) to get in but these maps are required for making it into later quotas for long runs. These are also the maps you'll run into monster combos, a real challenge when your making your way past the 1500-2000 quota range. Before that difficulty takes a bit of time to climb, don't be surprised to see 1 go running in solo and making quota alone for the first 6 or so days. 


I've played Phas and a bunch of its clones (Some better honestly than phas itself) but I still like this game way better than all of them. 
If you found waiting around in Phasmophobia for the information to basically come to you was boring then I think you'll enjoy this game much more. You have limited time in a day so your actually fighting the clock to be more efficient until you can't keep up. 
I personally don't want to sit around waiting in a survival horror until I can progress because then I'm relying on the spook factor to entertain me while I would otherwise be bored with nothing to do. The spook factor has very much died for me in horror games.
This games design promotes finding faster and more active ways around problems. Is a giant camping your ship? Send someone out to bait it, and once they're far use the teleporter to return them to the ship while you use the opening to get out.
You can just sit and wait for an opening but the time that's ticking away is your punishment for not coming up with an active solution. This is an important aspect to the difficulty which drives me to want to play the game in the first place. Its not just about surviving the encounter long enough to get paid with some process of elimination running in the background. It's about improving the efficiency of your game plan and doing better every run. A single player can make a huge difference on the team, and having a knowledgeable team is like a multiplier on an individual players skill. 

Half the excitement for me comes from the dice roll upon joining a lobby with new players. It could be a funny lobby, a try hard lobby, people experimenting with the game there is so much variety in how this game 'can' play out.

An extra note for players hosting Boss only lobbies. Its early access, the rank doesn't work. It resets and displays wrong. If you're kicking anyone who isn't a boss from your titan run lobbies you're probably kicking some of the more experienced players.

1966720,Lethal Company,"This game is AMAZING. It's both horrifying and hilarious - the screams of terror coming from my teammates becoming muffled as a snare flea smothers them is just golden. The proximity voice chat is perfect. I'm hoping they add more moons to make it easier to meet higher quotas (the highest we reached was 2267 or something like that, and it was disappointing to just start over). Here's what you need to know to join the company:

- Never take your eyes off a coilhead. 
- Always check the ceiling.
- If there's an open vent, you aren't alone anymore!
- Just because that hallway was safe when you came through it, doesn't mean it will be safe coming back.
- Try to bring back your dead colleagues' bodies. It saves you getting a steep penalty AND the corpses are worth 5 credits!
- Never give the good equipment to the teammate who consistently fails the gap jumps.
- When you're selling at the Company Building... spam the bell. Trust me. Nothing bad will happen. Yep, just keep spamming it. 
- When you see the Flowerman, run fast and pray. Don't believe the Bestiary. Flowerman follows no rules or logic. Look at him, don't look at him, it makes no difference. He just decides, ""Yes. This one I'll murder. And this one, I'll let go... for now."" When the Flowerman says it's your time, you're GONE. 
- If something is moving and it's not wearing an orange jumpsuit, it has the capacity (and motivation) to kill you.

Hope that helps, and don't forget to meet that quota!

I had nothing but the radio in my hand and the voice emanating from it guiding me through the twisting turning maze that was this facility.

Immediately in doing so a mannequin with its head only attached to it body via a spring charges to me from behind, only stopping once I start looking at it.

- A vast, detailed and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and its neighboring regions, packed to the brim with locations to discover, collectibles and activities to clear. A Potterhead’s wet dream made manifest.

- Varied and satisfying combat system that constantly opens up new opportunities as you learn more spells, and stays fresh, engaging in the long run.

- Excellent customization possibilities, featuring a myriad of cosmetics and skins, other than your very own customizable ‘base’ to furnish by hand at leisure.

- Exciting progression that portrays your growth as a wizard (or witch) rather well, giving you new tools and utilities to access previously-locked content and areas.

- Solid roster of side characters; most of them are likable / unique enough, and incredibly, their writing isn’t complete garbage - kudos to that.
[/td]
[td]
- Excessively repetitive open-world activities in the long run, that create bloat and annoyance for those who want to complete all side activities.

- Combat balance issues with potions, ‘healing spam’ and unforgivable curses: especially when upgraded they prove overpowered and make most fights quite too easy.

- Most named foes and quest bosses (but not all) are just normal enemies on steroids, that don’t vary in mechanics and don’t have unique behaviors.

- Some inconsistencies with lore and character behavior. Example: if you use unforgivable curses in public or during quests (with witnesses), nobody will give a damn.

- Underwhelming finale that doesn’t really reflect the importance of what you accomplished, and doesn’t give any detail about how your actions influenced other characters afterwards.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
Hogwarts Legacy takes place in the iconic Wizarding World setting created by J.K. Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. 

The main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.

[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]
The world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. 

Most dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898

[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]
Magical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. 

Combat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.

[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]
Quests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. 

Challenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",sum h3 depth analysis h3 table tr th pro th th con th tr tr vast detailed impressive recreation hogwarts neighboring region packed brim location discover collectible activity clear potterhead wet dream manifest varied satisfying combat constantly open new opportunity learn spell stay fresh engaging long excellent customization possibility featuring myriad cosmetic skin customizable base furnish hand leisure exciting progression portrays growth wizard witch rather giving new tool utility access previously locked content area solid roster side character likable unique incredibly writing complete garbage kudos excessively repetitive open world activity long create bloat annoyance complete side activity combat balance issue potion healing spam unforgivable curse especially upgraded prove overpowered fight easy named foe boss normal enemy steroid vary mechanic unique behavior inconsistency lore behavior example unforgivable curse public quest witness damn underwhelming finale reflect importance accomplished detail action influenced character afterwards tr table table tr th bug issue th th spec th tr tr significant frame drop inside hogwarts transitioning different section specific place throughout castle regardless setting case fall damage register enemy 3900x 2080ti 32gb ram ssd 1440p tr table table tr content replay value took 82 hour complete hogwarts legacy taking considerable extra clear optional content 90 collectible secret hard difficulty replay finished except achievement hunting content linear tr tr worth buying yes especially fan saga content quality fair proposed 60 price expected aaa release tr tr h3 verdict good h3 url http steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails id 2548409603 rating chart url far best based franchise masterpiece mean fan series certainly drawn issue tr table quote follow curator page url http store steampowered com curator 41449676 summit review url high quality review regularly quote http steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails id 2936728702 depth h3 writing h3 hogwarts legacy take iconic wizarding world created j k rowling far harry friend born fifth student titular magic academy admitted late unspecified special circumstance virtual rendition rowling work short exceptional hogwarts environs town hogsmeade dangerous forbidden forest recreated faithfully minute detail course thing differ movie book set 1800s follows classic manifest destiny archetype custom discover hidden potential tie greater purpose despite genuinely memorable character interesting side quest narrative help fall flat stale especially towards ending phase nonetheless enjoyable adventure await notably romance love hate dichotomy relationship side character choice pretty result questlines h3 exploration collectible secret h3 world vast visually magnificent peppered point interest hold collectible currency utility initially foot iconic enchanted broom flying magical creature able explore leisure clear enormous side activity good portion prove inaccessible gain spell ability sort metroidvania fashion promotes meaningful backtracking fast travel highlighting spell prove invaluable saving exploring collectible mostly cosmetic enabling customization wizard private room unlock suit various style dungeon location additional puzzle hidden path lead collectible extra resource exploration feel rewarding genuine sense mystery surrounding new interest despite dungeon location repetitive long haul http steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails id 2933385898 h3 combat boss h3 magical battle spell sole mean offense defense usually multiple enemy supported allied npc protection spell order deflect incoming attack dodge roll case unblockable one enemy varied range magical creature dark wizard goblin soldier name weak specific charm others shield break specific spell category damage utility movement special ability immunity certain effect combat feel engaging paced gory universe standard death far common movie book combine spell effect advantage environment add base passive upgrade trait spell related talent gain progressively add layer depth late overpowered potion passive trait talent endgame spell supposedly fearsome dark wizard prove nuisance due power creep h3 quest minigames challenge h3 quest usually involve retrieving talking specific solving treasure hunt based visual clue solution logic based puzzle depending case side quest unique memorable fetch chore dry open world shenanigan repeat fashion meaningful unique quest bloat challenge paramount unlocking unique bonus increased inventory capacity cosmetic unique passive upgrade equip gear piece require slay x specific enemy finish x activity long term goal massive grind 25th pair glove cosmetic worth effort,0,0.9983

What I liked:

- You don't need to know every Harry Potter book/movie before playing Hogwarts Legacy to get immersed into this world
- Hogwarts and its surrounding areas are built in high detail and provide an awesome atmosphere
- Exploration is fun, as the world is believable and well designed
- The combat system seemed unusual at first but I ended up loving it. Might actually be one of my favourite mechanics of all video games I played: It is fast paced, dynamic and (at first) challenging, but once you get the hang of it, the fluid combat is just satisfying
- Some of the quests were really fun

What I didn't enjoy:

- After an interesting start, the first third or first half of the game felt repetitive and somewhat tedious: To learn Spell X you talk to professor Y but he or she won't teach it to you unless you do some basic fetch quest type of tasks first. Learn the spell and repeat the process over and over again
- This way of storytelling repeated all over the main quest line. The main quest itself would have been several hours shorter, if the people you need information from would just give it to you. Instead, you often end up having to do them some favors first or do preperation work. This does in fact make sense and wouldn't be an issue, but after a few hours you start to notice this repeating pattern. (The second half of the game is more interesting in my opinion)
- The game would have benefited from more depth in terms of RPG mechanics. Meaningful choices, more interactions in the open world. The majority of NPCs in the game are just for decoration (e.g. generic students all over the castle) but only a small amount actually has a purpose for the quests.

[b][u]Spoiler free Review![/u][/b]


Sometimes games are getting released with way too much hype. Forspoken, as an example, would be such a game. Either is it because of bad optimization or misinformation by the studio, the disappointment can end up being immeasurable for people who already pre-ordered these games, or people who have those games on their wishlist for months. Sadly, we had a lot of those lately. Don't even get me started with license games in general....

Hogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, shows that sometimes the hype train can be true.

I don't usually pre-order games anymore, but the premise of being the best game based on the fantastic world of ""Harry Potter"" made me buy it in an instant.

The following review won't contain any spoilers! I also want to mention that I am not even close to the end of the game, because I have way too much fun exploring.

[i]Also I know about the controversy, but it won't be part of my review (Not even as a meme!).[/i]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2929913613


[h1]Story:[/h1]
So far so good. It starts off with a generic ""You are the chosen one!"" scenario, but it is going to get better and better the further you go. You just have to trust me on this one, because I don't want to give away too many information. All I can say is that the story fits the HP universe very well. If this game would be a book I wouldn't be able to stop reading it until the very end.


[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Overwhelming, would be the right word. There are so many mechanics in this game it is amazing and exhausting at the same time.

First off you have the exploration part, where you can move around freely and explore every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings. I tell you there is a lot to discover and to collect. Mysteries that need to be solved, locks that need to be picked and information about special places that need to be gathered. The amount of collectibles are insane and you will most likely spent hours over hours getting everything to 100%. The puzzles you can find are very well-made and solving them is fun.

Then you have your main quests and side quests. I really love the side quests in this one, because they involve your fellow students. You learn to know them a bit better every time and the most of the quests are very creative.

Also: You don't get exp by fighting enemies! You get exp by discovering new locations, doing mini games or other things like that.

If you want to get from one point of the map to the other, you can also use the ""Floo powder"" fast travel service, or use your good old broom! I prefer the last one. It just feels great to fly around and enjoy the world. It might even sometimes happens that I just fly around aimlessly just for fun.  

Decorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! 


[h1]The Combat:[/h1]

What would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. 

Fighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. 

For your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can't really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.
The further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.

As a sidenote: You also don't need to fight most of the time, if you don't want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.


[h1]The RPG Part:[/h1]

There is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don't really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn't fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.
I just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work! 


[h1]The Atmosphere:[/h1]

Just wow!  
Hogwarts alone is gigantic and it feels amazing to get lost in all those beautifully handcrafted and unique halls, rooms and dungeons. The living paintings, the ghosts and the students running around in the halls is so atmospheric. The neighboring villages and landmarks do the same trick. You maybe want to walk all the way to Hogsmeade and drink Butter beer, just to lose yourself in that weird looking, but fascinating architecture of the buildings. Don't even get me started with the Forbidden Forest and other locations, you would be able to recognize from the movies and books.


[h1]The Graphics:[/h1]

I play this game on a mix of medium to low, on my I7 4790 and my 1060 6 GB and the game still looks amazing. As a passionate screenarcher (screenshoter) I won't be able to make any good screenshots in the game, but just for playing it is more than enough. The fps are stable and I never noticed any pop-ins or any texture loading. The Unreal Engine 4 does a wonderful job and just shows how good it can still be (Compared to UE5)!


[h1]The Soundtrack:[/h1]

Simply magical!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAesuW6qZU8
I also love that they mix new composed songs with the soundtrack from the movies. It just feels right!


[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

The gameplay is just as you’d expect for a student in the HP universe, complete with the selection process in charge of a talking hat, socializing with (or antagonizing) your colleagues, wandering around the castle and getting into trouble. Short of impersonating Potter himself, this is the closest experience you will get to enrolling in a Hogwarts school year. Of course, there is no Voldemort, but the story is sufficiently similar, and you will still feel like the prophetically-foretold boy who lived.

You can customize your student’s looks, clothing and even your magic wand and broom. The options are not a lot, but still serviceable enough. Naturally, you can belong to any of the four Hogwarts Houses, and you will be given the corresponding uniform and colored accessories. You’ll find a lot of clothes in your adventures, and each item provides different bonuses to your character. Interestingly, you can change the looks and keep the features, which means that you can always look the way you want, and have the combat perks you most like or need. This is an excellent feature.

Despite the emphasis on the wizarding experience, I believe the star of the show is Hogwarts itself. The castle is huge, rendered beautifully, and chock-full of secrets and places to explore. Ever wanted to wander around the school and grounds and see the places barely mentioned in the movies? Now’s your chance. And it’s every bit as fantastic as you imagine. Discovery is the name of the game, and every single location you’ve heard of in the books is here, and then some. Mind you, this is Hogwarts, not London—so no Ministry of Magic and such. Want to dare visiting the Forbidden Forest at night, looking for the dangerous arachnid lair? Try your luck at finding the common rooms of the other houses? Venture into the Library’s forbidden section? You can do all that. NPCs are quirky, diverse and in tune with the Potterverse. You will finally get to meet Peeves!

Interestingly, there’s no curfews or hard enforced rules. Considering this is a school, and the importance of norms in the movies, this is weird—but perfectly understandable, from a gameplay standpoint. Still, there are moments when stealth is the better approach to trouble, and the student is perfectly capable of hiding and defeating opponents while unseen.

Unlike with many games these days, I found myself avoiding fast travel almost every time. It’s nice to walk to the surrounding villages, and even nicer to fly there on your magic broom. You will find merchants, wild animals, rogue trolls, abandoned ruins and dark wizard camps. You can even explore ancient tombs, and there are many puzzles scattered all over the place for you to solve, courtesy of the late Merlin. Solving them will grant bonuses that aid you in several ways.

The story is interesting, usually predictable and mildly convoluted. It also echoes Potter's journey with small twists here and there. The dark figure of the mysterious looming enemy is still present, only this time the goblins play a bigger part. As usual, there are undertones of real-life problems, like racism and segregation.

An interesting choice regarding ethics is the use of the Unforgivable Curses. This topic is dealt with somewhat lightly, but the implied values and decisions are still there. Will you become a pre-teen murderous criminal and use these curses indiscriminately? Your choice. As for me, I decided I wouldn’t—and this meant a whole branch of the skill tree was unavailable to me. While you can’t pickpocket and rob to your heart’s desire, you can most definitely steal from every home in Hogsmeade, even in front of the owner, with no consequence at all. From a modern gaming perspective, I expected something less immersion-breaking.

The music is fantastic. Not Williams, but deeply reminiscent of his work. Once again, the similarity was pushed to the limit, stopping only short of exorbitant royalties. You’ll recognize the notes and motifs over and over, and it’s never invasive in terms of gameplay. Some comments from your character can get repetitive, though—and the flu stations suffer from the same.

The Room of Requirement is at your disposal as your main base of operations. You can decorate it to your heart’s desire, and gradually expand its size and functionality as the story progresses. Different props and magical stations will become available to find or purchase, and you can place them wherever you want. Eventually, you’ll get your own magical spaces to keep fantastic beasts like the famed magizoologist of the movies. The potion-making mechanics, however, are cumbersome and—at least to me—almost completely unnecessary.

True, there is little variety in the enemy department. Combat mechanics are a bit simplistic, but serviceable. The student is not very agile, but it works well. Sometimes the enemies will feel bland. Unlike Voldemort and his minions, these guys lack depth and personality, and you will frequently end up fighting and defeating mindless golems and statues that always act and look the same.

The graphics are really beautiful. And not only the world: the map, the cards, everything contributes to the gorgeous look of the game. A general sense of quality can be seen everywhere. The details are wonderful and always in line with the Potter universe.

The voice acting is excellent, varied in mood and accents. The only ugly detail is the sound editing, especially the pitch slider for the main character’s voice, but this is also present with other characters and even cats. This produces weird sound aberrations that are sadly somewhat common.

I did encounter a pair of bugs, but not game-breaking ones. In a weird case where my character clipped into a wall because I tried to use the broom too close to it, the reverse action solved the problem. I am aware of the complaints by other players, but for me it was a stutter-free experience, with no crashes at all, although texture popping can break the immersion from time to time. Loading times are not annoying save for the ""shades loading"" that always happens at launch.

I used the Xbox One wireless controller to excellent results.

In terms of mechanics, [i]Hogwarts Legacy[/i] is plagued by a sign of the times: lots of errands, collecting items, fetching quests, and the like take place in a very large open world. The beautiful castle and scenery help in that department, and you've got travel points, a flying broom and a magical steed to aid you in your travels. Thankfully, there are no microtransactions, gems, crystals, or any other annoying token currency so common today. Sadly, no Quidditch!

I could not help but to feel a little empty at times—in [i]Hogwarts Legacy[/i], the sense of “game-ness” is a bit painful, given the wondrous world and potential for immersion. The game could be much better with a bit more complexity, from more interaction with the environment to maybe better customization options. However, the game is complete and functional as it is, and I understand why these design decisions were made.

The price is a little high to my liking, but with a 15-20% off it would be fair.

Playing [i]Hogwarts Legacy[/i] has left me a sense of wonder I have seldom felt in a game lately. Even the story itself evokes that of Harry, and purposefully so. But it works. If you are a Potter fan, this is a must buy. You'll thoroughly enjoy the experience. This is the best alternative yet to be a Hogwarts student.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"[h1] Welcome to the wizarding world [/h1]

[i]I keep getting asked by people on my friend list what I think about the game, so I'll drop a pre-emptive review/thoughts about the game so far.[/i]

[b] The world [/b]
I could gush about this forever. The world is so well crafted and there was so much love put into it, it's kind of absurd. You start off in the castle, it's bloody massive, very faithful to the template you know, it's clear they tried their best to do a 1:1 replica. Walking through the halls and rooms in ecstatic, never did I feel that exploration is in any way forced, I was encouraged to explore and I have yet to properly utilize fast travel, it just doesn't get old and I still keep bumping into corridors that eluded me, still finding new things. And that's JUST the castle, the moment you look past the castle and take in the sheer scope of the world, it is possitively jaw dropping. The world is ginormous and the developers found clever things to sprinkle everywhere you go. Every now and then you bump into a small village out there, each one is different and again, very detailed and even tho they keep the same aesthetic, it never felt like exploring more of the same. It is honestly kind of overwhelming how much there is to find and play around with, this is a real work of art that even if you do not fancy the world of Harry Potter, should give you plenty of enjoyement to travel through.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
I jumped in on Hard difficulty as I was seeking some challenge out of this, however not much challenge is really provided. I keep being capped on my healing potions, rarely having to reach out for them. There are moments that test you certainly, large group of enemies are fun to tackle and the higher difficulty does not allow you to make many mistakes. Combat is satisfying, you generally play with a selection of 4 main spells you chose, from what you have learned, but you're not limited to them. You get up to 4 spell tabs for a total of 16 spells at the ready that you can switch between during combat at will. You'll learn combos of spells that work well together and swinging your wand around will feel really good. Enemies attack back with attacks you can protect against and ones you can only dodge, always visually apparent by a different colored circle around your head, it's a simple nuance but you'll trip up here and there, game doesn't make you feel invincible. Enemy variety could be larger, but it's not absolutely terrible, what's a bit of a shame is that you rarely battle more than 1 enemy type at the same time, maybe that's something that will be happening more later on, I can imagine that could spice up combat a bit. Every enemy type has some kind of weakness for you to discover and you'll be keeping mental notes.
Beyond your spell selection, there is not really much else you can do to build your character differently, all gear slots are basically stat sticks that you can eventually augment a bit for specific situations but I feel like it's nothing too significant. Still they made the best out of what they had, maybe gearing being more casual was the goal here.

[b] Story and questing [/b]
The story is intriguing but nothing ground breaking, so far it stands on its own pretty well, without spoiling as this is in the opening scenes, you learn that your character can see traces of ancient magic which leads you on a path to pursue this calling, but there's a faction of goblins and their leader who are after the same thing, the knowledge of great magic that's only rumored to exist, very few people in the past knew of its existence and could wield it. The game presents sense of urgency while also intentionally slowing you down, but you can argue it is doing so for you to slowly master this magic and uncover the whole truth so I give it a pass. 
As for sidequesting, you have the usual fetch quests most of the time, that are made interesting by the possibilities a world like this can present. I never felt annoyed doing a side quest that was simply ""deliver"" or ""find and bring"" as it pointed me to places to discover, this is very much carried by the setting and the amazing world. 
Some side quests are more convoluted and eventually lead you to what could be described as collectible chains. The game slowly introduces collectibles and series of puzzles for you to complete through side quests and it kind of feels natural. The only time I wasn't happy with this was when the unlocking spell ""alohomora"" was locked behind one of those, multiple tiers of it even, as someone who wants to unlock every door, I felt forced to go on collectible hunting but in the end, again, I was happy doing so as it led me places... Did I mention exploration is fun yet?

[b] other systems [/b]
Flying! My god, getting your first broom and taking to the skies feels surreal. You could fast travel, sure, but why would you when you can fly? Game places very few restrictions on where you can and can't fly, practically the whole world is traversable on a mount, it's amazing.
Room of Requirement. If you like creating your own space or ever found yourself lost in building a house in The Sims, this will be right up your alley, everything is customizable and by exploring you will find more items to place down,, but this feature got overshadowed for me by taking care of your own beasts. I damn nearly cried grooming and feeding the creatures, it's so adorable, I could spend hours just watching them in the space you get for them, this is my single most favorite feature.
Beast catching. You have to catch your beasts so better go out there hunting, many types of beasts to catch and bring home out there in the world. Some are easy to catch, some harder, always having to find the best approach, it's honestly fun.

[b] Missing this [/b]
Reputation system, honestly, the game allows you to cast unforgivable curses and nobody seems to care you do so. You can fling avada kedavra next to dozens of witnesses and most you may get is a couple of comments. I wish there were some drawbacks, if not in ""reputation"" then at least visually, think Mass Effect 2 where Shepard would look more scarred the more evil you'd be. I'd take anything.
Points system, it's Hogwards, part of it is winning points for your house and while during some quests you get the ""points to *your house here*"" comment, it isn't reflected anywhere. There's virtually no rivalry between the houses as a result.
Quidditch, please... The game comes up with an excuse to not have it but man, what a shame.
And lastly, I would like to see some deeper relationship feature, building friendship with some important characters, outside of main quests. Doing things for them and maybe being able to take them with you on your exploratory adventures. When I think Harry Potter, I also think of the friendship the main group had going for them, it sometimes feels a bit lonely in this giant world.

[b] The bad [/b]
Performance is rocky, the game drops frames unexplainably, in cutscenes and in a few areas, this is something that can be fixed with patches so hopefully it'll improve.
Voice pitch? Don't even bother, leave it on the default spot when creating your character. It makes your voice robotic, echoey and just plain weird.
[strike]And lastly... Why in the seven hells in a game with 4 houses you think it's enough to give players 3 character slots, at least give the damn 4.[/strike] Been resolved, you now get 10 character slots.

[b] Conclusion [/b]
This game makes me feel like a kid again, I don't remember the last time I was this happy and eager to explore a world, this is coming from someone who grew up on HP, this is all practically a wet dream made real. I am overjoyed the be part of all this and despite knowing this could be a much better game, both improved in what it offers and in some of the glaring issue it has, I can overlook it because so much of this game has been crafted with a lot of love.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"So I have finished my first playthrough of the game, have put 57.9 hours into it at this point and completed the content to 100% outside of a few steam trophies.

Personally, I have really enjoyed this game and think it's a great release and everything I ever wanted out of a Harry Potter game. 

The story is good, the voice acting is actually phenomenal on the part of the non player characters. As for the player characters there is a slight issue of a robotic voice likely due to the pitch but nothing that was game breaking. The combat is engaging, though I do lament a lack of variety when it comes to the enemies we confront. Hogwarts and the world are represented in incredible detail and I have lost myself running through the castle and taking it in more than once.

I have a few gripes with the game sadly, that I do hope are fixed in down the line. The lack of a photo mode for example, a few animation issues with certain foes like the trolls who rubberband to follow the player character to complete their animations, and as said above a lack of enemy variety. As well, I wish there were more missions in the school focused around the student life, as we quickly feel like a part time student. The castle does lack a bit in classes to take to learn more about the universe itself or even just student activities like Quidditch, Wizards Chess, and more.

Outside of those slight gripes with the game, I think Avalanche did a terrific job bringing the universe of Harry Potter to life through this game. And I look forward to what they do in the future with it, may it be via DLC or potential similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world with other academies like Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang or even stories focused around the adults of the universe with the Ministries. I believe a lot of people may enjoy playing as an Auror or a Unspeakable.",finished playthrough 57 9 hour completed content 100 outside trophy personally enjoyed great release wanted harry potter good voice acting phenomenal non character character slight issue robotic voice due pitch breaking combat engaging lament lack variety come enemy confront hogwarts world represented incredible detail lost running castle taking gripe sadly hope fixed line lack photo mode example animation issue certain foe troll rubberband follow complete animation lack enemy variety wish mission school focused student life quickly student castle lack bit class learn universe student activity quidditch wizard chess outside slight gripe avalanche terrific bringing universe harry potter life look forward future via dlc potential similar game exploring part wizarding world academy ilvermorny beauxbâtons durmstrang story focused adult universe ministry believe enjoy auror unspeakable,2,0.3818

I don't believe I'm one of many with this perception of Hogwarts Legacy but it may prove interesting to some nonetheless.
Long review below:

The Good:
+ It's a nice visual game, some parts of it look ""magical"" indeed.
+ The gameplay works and functions well from start to finish.
+ The story has a few interesting moments but nothing that will blow you away. There won't be anything you won't see coming.
+ The spells feel great, combat was one of my favourites aspects of the game. The devs did their job right on this front.
+ A magical adventure for Harry Potter fans, it IS the best of all Harry Potter games, really immersive in some parts, fun in others and an overall good game. All in all, your money won't be wasted here. There's plenty of content to go around for everyone.
+ Soundtrack and sound in general is authentic to what the Wizarding world should be.

The Bad:
It's a shame that many RPGs  that are open world learned nothing from Skyrim, Witcher and Red Dead Redemption.

- Everything is so scripted to the point of comedy. As a result of that, it won't take more than several hours to realise how bland and empty Hogwarts is.
The best way to describe this is by comparing it to the tv series: Westworld (for those who have seen it). You feel like you're really trying to role play in a fake world.
The same animations will play in the castle over and over, the same NPCs with the same lines.
You get to experience all yearly seasons but besides some changes in the castle and around it, the NPCs react to nothing. Their garbs won't change according to the weather.

- Immersion breaking.
When you go outside of the castle in summer, you'll spot two students playing a game. That's a very nice moment to see the NPCs have activities around the castle. However, you'll reach winter and the same students are playing the same game, in their same outfits outside in the courtyard even at night time at 0 degrees C temperature. The same orchestra music that you first hear when you go across the hall will be playing throughout all seasons, through all day/night cycles. It goes from a wondrous, special moment to a tedious, run faster so it'll bother you less.
For an RPG, one of its priorities should be to establish or at least try to make something remotely natural for the NPCs to do. There's many more such situations but I won't go further into that.

- Progression is tied to the main story.  You cannot interact with your dorm colleagues or anyone around the castle unless it's a quest or a silly side quest. The house you pick doesn't matter. You'll only get 1 quest per house and it'll vary the looks of your outfit. I chose Ravenclaw but was shown around by a Weasly. I was expecting to have someone from my own dorm to be my friend/guide to lead me through the castle. 

- Your choices in the game have no consequence. Cast avada kadavra wherever you want because nobody cares. It's hilarious at times.

- I understand that the developers are trying so hard to be ""progressive"" but in their pursuit of fulfilling an agenda they made the setting of 1800s Scotland feel like 2023 woke Hollywood. You'll hear the name of ""Sirona"" and how special she is more times than you'll enter her tavern.

- Enemies around the world: 
You'd expect the ""Forbidden forest"" and ""any other place in the world"" to be somewhat different from each other since it's an RPG.
The enemies around the castle would be of a lower level while the forbidden forest would have tougher or more dangerous enemies. That's not the case.
You'll fight: humans, spiders, frogs, wolves, trolls, goblins and That's it. There won't be a special enemy type anywhere in this world.

- No interesting side quests or random events. Hogwarts Legacy doesn't have a natural side quest in it. You're exploring and suddenly you come across something - well, kinda... Some merchant who needs his pet rescued or kill more poachers. That's all you'll get.
The motivation to do these menial side missions is even lower due to the interchangeably awful voice acting and writing. It feels like if it’s not the writing that’s off, it’s the acting and vice versa. I would say the acting isn’t as bad as it could’ve been, but the writing reaches lower echelon Bethesda more often than not.

- The HUD is cluttered and breaks immersion.
- No memorable characters besides Sebastian.
- No matter the graphical settings, the game has issues around Hogwarts and especially Hogsmead. Lots of stuttering, textures loading in late, so on and so forth. It's got technical issues still as of June 2023.

Conclusion:
Despite most of its flaws and shortcomings Hogwarts Legacy is a strong game that many people will grow fond of. 
It does the main part right: gameplay, decent story, graphics and depicts the world of Harry Potter better than other harry potter games.
I strongly believe it wouldn't have been as successful if it weren't for huge controversies or if it didn't have the Harry Potter theme around it.

• Gorgeous world with lots of love put into details.
• Interesting side characters with well developed stories.
• Side quests feel as interesting as the main quest.
• Exploration feels interesting and the world is somewhat memorable.
• Combat feels better than it looks.
• Lots of customisation for clothing.

• Poor optimisation, even for high-tier GPUs. Although a lot of
the issues have been fixed since launch, it still is a demanding game.
• If you don't intend to 100% the game, this point might not bother
you much, but the amount of side activities, like Merlin's Trials and
other caves that you find, are redundant, repetitive, and rather boring.
They could have trimmed down a bit.

I'd recommend playing for one House that you prefer and then do the other 3 as quickly as you can until the Map of Chambers, where you'll get the achievement. It's a bit different when it comes to main quest, but not entirely. Once you finish on one playthough I would say that you're not missing out much other than what your first experience offers.[/td] 
[/tr] 
[tr] 
 [td][b]💵 Is it worth buying? [/b] [/td] 
 [td]Yes. I pre-ordered this game and pushed through the painful frame drops at launch. I wish that wasn't the case, but overall the game offers a solid open-world experience even for non-fans of Harry Potter. Worth playing. You might learn to appreciate it as much as I did.[/td] 
[/tr] 
[tr] 
 [td][b]🎮 Steam Deck Compatibility[/b] [/td] 
 [td]The game works just fine, but it's capped at 30 frames, which can make the whole experience rather weird. With the new fixes you're still locked from experiencing the game to it's fullest potential on the Steam Deck. The settings are on low, so it's not really the best looking one.[/td]

[/td] 
 [td]Although not perfect, this game is by far the best open-world Harry Potter game so far. The world feel magical, easy to understand and offers a great experience for fans and non-fans of the franchise. I believe it's a strong entry for this game and if sequels are in the making they will open up the game even more to new possibilities. The game offers by far one of the best experiences any Harry Potter game has ever given.[/td]

[h2]In-depth[/h2]
[h3] 📑 Description: [/h3] 
 
Hogwarts Legacy is an open world that isn't afraid to impress you at every step of the way. You play as one of the Hogwarts students learning the world and exploring its secrets. Dangers are at every step and it's up to you to become the most powerful witch or wizard Hogwarts has seen in a long time.

[h3] ⚔ Gameplay: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★☆
 
Surprisingly the game has a lot more to offer than what trailers show. Combat feels good, with a large array of spells that controls the battlefield and gives you the freedom to do whatever you like.

Learning new spells is done via side quests and main missions which oftentimes are pretty nicely crafted. In the game you are faced with a lot of collecting, puzzle-solving, exploring, and sightseeing.

Although some areas of exploration can get a bit too much even for the ones that wish to complete the game 100%, the game can be fully enjoyed, and go through the main campaign and pick the side quests with a lot of enjoyment.

[h3] 😄 Fun: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★ 
 
I've had a lot of fun exploring this game. Hogwarts is rich with fun areas to explore. The world continues to impress you and learning new skills and putting them to test is fun and rewarding.
 
[h3] 🏞 Visuals: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★
 
This game looks absolutely stunning and it would be without a doubt one of the best-looking games I've played this year. Ray-tracing adds up with a great umph to the overall look, but due to poor performance, it can be heavily costly on your GPU.

The world and the key areas look distinguished, remarkable, and jaw-dropping. This game is a really pretty game and each screenshot I took I am not ashamed to share.

[h3] 🔊 Sound: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★

Sound effects and voice acting are strong in this game and oftentimes feel very polished. I did find some skipped dialogues by the end of some conversations which may be a bug, but other than that, I think pretty much all dialogues and characters are well-voiced.

I have to remark that there's a large array of English dialects, from African, possible Uganda, to Indian accents are well done and feels nice to be able to hear such differences.
 
[h3] 📖 Story: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★☆
 
Although the end of the game felt a bit weak and the villain wasn't necessarily defined very well, the whole build-up of the story is interesting until that point. Characters are fascinating and despite not being a fan of Harry Potter, I can say that the world and the people are extremely interesting and I was easily captivated by the visuals and the theme the game presents.

[h3] 🧵 Length: [/h3] 
 
🔲  Short (1-8h)
🔲 Medium (8-15h)
🔲 Long  (15-25h)
☑️ Very Long  (25h+)
🔲 Unlimited 
 
It's a fairly long game if you intend to finish this game completely and do all 4 houses. The main story alone takes a while and some side quests are too interesting to skip.
 
[h3] 🧩 Difficulty: [/h3] 
 
☑️ Easy 
☑️ Normal 
☑️ Hard 
🔲 Brutally Hard 
🔲 Impossible 
 
The game isn't too difficult and unless you wish a slightly bigger challenge there is something for you. By the end of the game, as you understand the mechanics of the game and how combat works you'll become a powerful wizard/witch.

[h3] ⭕Conclusion: [/h3] 
Hogwarts Legacy is by far one of the best Harry Potter games ever created and this opens up to new possibilities for this IP. As a non-fan of the franchise, I think the game offers a strong open-world experience without overwhelming you with lots of tasks to do, unless you wish to do them. Puzzles are rather simple, but fun and the whole world made me appreciate the game even more.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"I completely beat the game thus at this point it doesn't hide any more secrets from me, tho it doesn't change the fact that it had been a huge fun and Hogwarts Legacy was the game I really needed and I don't exclude replaying it in the future as it's become my personal favorite game of the 2023. It's not perfect, but absolutely deserved a positive review!

[h3]Pros:[/h3]
[list]
    [*]beautiful, addicting world full of satisfying, but often undemanding fights. Using magic was exteremely fun and gave multiple possibilities of having a great combat experience (you can try stealth, defensive plants, potions, choose to learn unforgivable curses or just use mastered spells)
    [*]quite nice character development-you can spend talent points on improving your magic skills and upgrading your equipment items.
    [*]absolutely stunning beasts and landscapes offering tons of activities, side quests, puzzles, exploration
    [*]the Room of Requirements being in general your base [spoiler] where you can prepare your gear, brew potions, grow plants and breed beasts. It can be also decorated both by conjuring items from the collections and by changing its style with the help of your own slave, I mean house elf [/spoiler]
    [*]engaging and fun side quests full of unexpected twists and sometimes heartbreaking situations compensating for the boring main story
    [*]quests unlimited in time or by the main story
    [*]despite not giving actual moral consequences of your actions, in some cases you can get a better reward and/or piss off the NPCs
    [*]large freedom of action
    [*]the possibilities of customizing your character (from their appearance, voice to the gear they use)
    [*]various and interesting side characters, at least some of them
    [*]fun, but again quite simple puzzles
    [*]versatile game for many hours and for every generation. Thanks to the fact that you play as a fifth-grade student, the plot seems more mature and at the same time it gives the opportunity to learn all the basics.
    [*]decent optimization, beautiful graphics and atmospheric music
    [*]great on Steam Deck!
[/list]
[h3]Cons:[/h3]
[list]
    [*]my biggest complaint is in spite of a huge level of immersion, the lack of an actual moral system. We can pour out dark magic all over Hogwarts and no one will even bat an eyelid. And no, we can't be bad per se, just rude. Even if you choose a bad ending [spoiler] and decide to open the repository, except for the mysterious death of Professor Figg, there are no consequences and you can still win the House Cup and be praised for what you've done. There is no penalty for robbing houses or using unforgivable curses. I think the biggest consequence I had was Natty asking calmly BLOODY HELL HOW DID YOU LEARN THIS SPELL [/spoiler]
    [*]choosing a House is a small matter, apart from making friends from your House  faster I suppose or getting an additional quest when it comes to Hufflepuff.
    [*]little varied life at Hogwarts, [spoiler] the first night will be the last you spend in your dorm [/spoiler]. I feel there could be more interactions with fellow students and more activities within the house you belong to (you can't really storage the loots or use your room). Also the character can't sit, so furniture like sofa and chair are just a decoration.
   [*]boring main story. I get you're supposed to feel like a gifted chosen one, but the result was average for me.
    [*]no actual storyline from Ravenclaw
    [*]there could be more potion ingredients etc. so it'd be more complicated to find them
    [*]many NPCs were boring, unlikable and poorly written characters I won't miss, like for example [spoiler] I wasn't even sorry when Figg died [/spoiler]
    [*]no Quidditch (maybe a chance for a DLC in coop in the nearest future?)
    [*]you can't romance Sebastian and Poppy :// but I get, it's a family friendly game
    [*]cutscenes in Ancient Magic and Merlin's Trials spots cannot be skipped
    [*]no photo mode therefore you can't take beautiful screenshots:(
[/list]

It was a great adventure that gets you back to your childhood dreams and reminds you that your inner child is still there, evoking many pleasant memories. As a Potterhead I'm really impressed by the whole universe and how smart the devs created a story before the chosen one and only Harry Pottah.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"It took me almost a year to finish this game because I had a really hard time enjoying it. It's not that the game is bad; it's because it's bland. To me, it feels like they were tasked with creating an RPG inspired by Harry Potter, and they had to check off all the ""standard RPG boxes,"" which they did.

The game does have some qualities, though! The castle is incredible, full of life, and very faithful to the Harry Potter universe. The first few hours were amazing as you get to explore, learn the initial spells in class, and discover the characters. Combat is also pretty decent, dynamic and fluid, which I enjoyed.

However, I quickly grew bored of this game. The main story and most side quests are poorly written (the only good one for me was Sebastian's). The acting and dialogues are also subpar.

Oh my god, I hate how they designed the equipment and inventory. Why is the inventory space so small for the HUGE amount of loot you find? Why do I have to complete Merlin challenges to expand my inventory? Why can't I have a fixed look and have to change it back each time I equip a new piece of clothing? Why do I have to unlock spell wheels with points; they should be given, etc. There are so many meaningless challenges and quests, and most of them are uninteresting.

ENDINGS SPOILERS [spoiler] They also failed miserably with the endings, seriously? They insist on the “removing emotions” part of ancient magic which is an intriguing topics, but in the end, it's like “fuck it” and decided to go with a ranrok dargon form (?). Even the Sebastian side quest ends on a very flat note. I loved his dark side and how he kills his uncle in cold blood, but then you tell him it's not the goblin that cursed his sister, and suddenly, everything is forgiven! [/spoiler]

Combat is also super repetitive because the bestiary is IMMENSELY small. Considering the vast Harry Potter lore, why do I have to fight humans, goblins, and spiders 95% of the time?

I think this game has two distinct sides:

The first one is the Harry Potter side. Yes, it's a good Harry Potter game, a great one even. If you are a fan, you will love this game because you can easily overlook all the flaws.

The second one is the RPG side. It's not a good RPG; I cannot bring myself to recommend it over other games in the same genre with the same budget.

So, because I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, I wouldn't recommend this game. BUT if you are a Harry Potter fan, this is the game you have been waiting for, and you should go for it. Still giving it a thumbs up because I would rate it 6/10. Still wishing for a better grading system on Steam",took finish hard enjoying bad bland feel tasked creating inspired harry potter check standard box quality castle incredible life faithful harry potter universe hour amazing explore learn initial spell class discover character combat pretty decent dynamic fluid enjoyed quickly grew bored side quest poorly written good sebastian acting dialogue subpar oh god hate designed equipment inventory inventory space small huge loot complete merlin challenge expand inventory fixed look equip new piece clothing unlock spell wheel point given meaningless challenge quest uninteresting ending spoiler spoiler failed miserably ending seriously insist removing emotion ancient magic intriguing topic fuck decided ranrok dargon form sebastian side end flat note loved dark side kill uncle cold blood tell goblin cursed sister suddenly forgiven spoiler combat super repetitive bestiary immensely small considering vast harry potter lore fight human goblin spider 95 distinct side harry potter side yes good harry potter great fan love easily overlook flaw side good bring recommend game genre budget huge harry potter fan recommend harry potter fan waiting giving thumb rate 6 10 wishing grading,0,0.991

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"This game is good but it's far from ideal.

Pros:
- amazing interactive while you create your character (with choosing the wand, patronus and faculty)
- very interesting fights. You should use different spells for different enemies, blocks\conter attacks. You can use the elements of the environment in the fight. Interesting animations of spells. You always need to play on the keyboard like on the piano. It's 10\10
- Hogwarts Castle is breathtaking. It's alive, you meet students who do different things (trying to cast spells, craft potions, read books, or a lot of other things). You meet familiar places from movies and books, you find tons of secrets and easter eggs. Hogwarts is amazing
- Some side activities in the game are interesting (like beasts hunting, finding secrets, plant growing)

But what should be improved for becoming a legendary game:
-add more types of the enemy. You enter the dungeon and you know that you will face spiders and in the end you will see the boss - troll or big spider. It's boring and after 3-4 dungeons you no longer want to go into them. People and goblins have different classes, but they are still the same types of enemies. You can add bogarts, wervolves, vampires, some magical creatures etc
-Useless loot. All loot in chests is coins or equipment items. But the problem is that by the middle of the game, you will already have enough equipment to complete the game to the end. And there are no unique items or sets in the game. Because of this, you lose interest in exploring locations and dungeons, because you will either find useless glasses or gloves that will be worse than yours. In addition, the price for them is low and it makes no sense to even collect them for sale. It would be much more interesting to look for some unique Hogwarts sets, Deathly Hallows, or some cool wands with unique abilities. Unfortunately, this is not the case, all things are the same and differ only in skin and armor or attack indicators.
-Strange economics in the game. You don't want to find some rare beasts or loot because it cost like one portion of the healing potion) The rare phoenix which is alone on the map costs the same as Niffler which you can find in any place on the map.
- all of the above make the Hogwarts Legacy world investigation boring and trivial. You don't want to go to the cave because you wouldn't be rewarded for this.",good far ideal pro amazing interactive create choosing wand patronus faculty interesting fight different spell different enemy block conter attack element environment fight interesting animation spell keyboard piano 10 10 hogwarts castle breathtaking alive meet student different thing trying cast spell craft potion read book thing meet familiar place movie book ton secret easter egg hogwarts amazing side activity interesting beast hunting finding secret plant growing improved legendary add type enemy enter dungeon face spider bos troll big spider boring 3 4 dungeon longer goblin different class type enemy add bogart wervolves vampire magical creature useless loot loot chest coin equipment item problem middle already equipment complete unique item set lose interest exploring location dungeon useless glass glove worse addition price low make sense collect sale interesting look unique hogwarts set deathly hallows cool wand unique ability unfortunately case thing differ skin armor attack indicator strange economics rare beast loot cost portion healing potion rare phoenix alone map cost niffler map hogwarts legacy world investigation boring trivial cave rewarded,2,-0.4404
990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"Let me start it off by saying I'm a huge Harry Potter nerd and was one of those kids who waited for the books to come out and once they did I devoured them in a few days, same for movies. I also consider myself a casual gamer, so my opinion on the game's difficulty might be not relevant for you. Last thing to say before I start complaining about the game is, I finished the game 100%, did all the side quests, found all the chests, all the pages, completed all the challenges.Spent around 80 hours to do so, my girlfriend spent around the same amount of time and the rest of the hours are my friends and family members trying it out. So needless to say, I loved the game but here are a few things that I think the game would benefit from if implemented.

Let's start off from Sneaking. It's basically useless, when you first learn disillusionment charm I thought wow cool now i will be able to sneak out of the school at night, as per books and movies students are not allowed to be out of their common room after a certain hour, but apart from a few quests it's completely useless. You can roam the castle any time you want, what's the point of invisibility potions and secret passages out of the castle if you can just walk out the front gate? Furthermore, you can steal from people's houses, no one cares that you even walked in, let alone empty their chests. We’ll leave the morality of stealing aside for a minute and go to my next point.

Money system is undeveloped. 
It’s way too easy to get money in the game; you just go up to any merchant and sell all the stolen goods to them. It would be cool if merchants would accept only the type of goods they sell, like what's the point for the potion seller to buy all the weird clothing items. Furthermore, it would be cool if you couldn’t sell stolen goods to all merchants and would have to deal with a Mundungus like, shady character to sell stolen goods to. On a different note, why don’t any merchants offer a buy back option or have a budget? You just finish hearing them out about how the business is slow and you are in a poorer area, but you want to sell something worth hundreds of galleons, easy, they have the money right there. So in my opinion everything should be more expensive and merchants should have their budget limit, but you should have the ability to sell potions and their ingredients to some of them, something I can't understand why it’s unavailable. And not the ability to sell beasts.

Magical beasts
Catching magical beasts is a great idea, making you use their fur and feathers to upgrade your equipment even better, saving them from poachers, amazing. But why is there an ability to sell them to the lady in Hogsmeade? What's the difference between you selling the beasts and the poachers doing it? In my opinion there should have been a side quest where you help expand the area around the Hagrid's hut (Sorry don’t remember the name of the professor in the game) and give the creatures to the professor for safekeeping. It would make more sense and then the Profesor could teach about those animals in classes, and you as a player could see a physical impact on the castle grounds. 

Scale of the castle
When I first started, I thought it would be amazing. I wanted to explore the castle, but to my disappointment it was just a bunch of confusing halls leading to stairs that lead to more halls and stairs with a few classrooms and common rooms in between. It seems the castle is designed in this way to make it more confusing and take up more space rather than utilize it. They did a great job including things from the books like the kitchens with the elves being right next to the hufflepuff common room and even added some extra stuff like the book & quill in the tower that writes down the name of everyone meant for Hogwarts, but still it feels like it's just above the bare minimum. Probably the school you went to had more classrooms than the castle in this game. Well, at least there’s flew powder if you get lost.

Transportation with flew powder
Don't get me wrong it's great to have fast travel in the game, it really gets tedious to fly all the way down the map for a chat and then all the way back up for a different quest. It's a great idea, borrowing fast travel that’s in the books and movies and expanding it.  But why can you do it from anywhere on the map? You should need to go to one of these locations to travel to any other, not just travel from anywhere to it. This would make it so you have to use your broom more often.

Broom upgrades feel meaningless. 
Now this might be just me, because I flew only the minimum of broom races to get through the campaign, but I didn't notice the upgrades doing anything. What would be cool is if let’s say with each subsequent upgrade you could fly higher thus allowing you to fly over certain mountains, there are few of those plopped on to the map where they don’t really do anything just make you fly around so it would be a cool reward. Talking about rewards let’s go to the house points 

House points 
House points are only mentioned in passing and have no effect on the game, but they could act as a morality system rewarding you for fixing carnage caused by Peeves(Love that he’s in the game, but he doesn’t cause enough mayhem), giving saved animals to the professor, or just doing well in class(I know this one would be tricky but it could be done). And punishing you any time you use a forbidden spell, destroy some school property, or get caught walking the castle at night, or if you get caught stealing outside the castle this would make sneaking useful and actually harder to collect demiguise moons, and astronomy tables, which at this point is too easy. 

The game is too easy  
I’m not some hardcore gamer but this game was way too easy, I played it all the way through on hard difficulty. I came in expecting a challenge and honestly, thinking that an hour or two in, I would decrease the difficulty to normal, but it was quite the opposite. The game was easy and I almost didn’t need to use the plants or potions, except for a couple of fights. I think this was down to the fact that I’m the kinda player that gets distracted by sidequests and since this game is made in stages, by the time I would get back to the main quest it would be way too easy. So it seems like there is no scaling in the enemies you have to fight. And fighting is not the only thing that was too easy. Some of the things I already mentioned, the money system, sneaking, having to deal with house points, but another one is Moonstone. Why is it possible to make a moonstone machine that makes moonstone? Once you have it, Moonstones become completely worthless, you just print them non stop, and there are not enough uses for it in quests. Sure you can build stuff in the room of requirement, but that’s just cosmetics. If you could build out animal pens and other things around the castle and be part of quests, like for example rebuilding one of those castles that ""used to be quite a sight in its time” then maybe it would matter but now this resource doesn’t matter. 

Dialog choices don’t matter
I beat the game once and then watched a little here and there, as my girlfriend was going through her playthrough. And the biggest disappointment was seeing her choose a different response and get almost the same answer, continuing with that thought, your choices don’t matter neither in the small quest lines, nor in the big ones, the outcome is always the same and that's a bit disappointing for a game that tries to portray itself as choose your own Hogwarts story type of thing. 

Now in the end with all these drawbacks do I regret playing it? No, not at all, since I've been a Harry Potter nerd since the early 2000s, it felt cool playing a game of this scale and then sharing the experience with my Girlfriend who also played it. I feel like(hate to admit it buuut) it was a great value.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"Updated Review as of 35 hours combined total.  I wanted to add a few more thoughts.

My daughter who is closing in on 18, and my half century year old self have both been fans of Harry Potter and the Wizarding World. I read the books to her when she was younger and then on my own. We’ve watched the movies and it has always been great bonding for us.

I preordered the Deluxe edition on Steam when it first came available. I knew my Desktop would handle it but had some concerns about the Steam Deck which has become my device of choice to game on when I feel up to it health wise. Luckily it got Steam Deck Verified before early launch.

During early launch we spent about about 10 hours into the game. I put a couple hours in on my Steam Deck with no issues and it ran a solid 30 FPS except the very sparse drop to mid to high 20s on some cutscenes. Note that I made no changes to the stock installation settings. Also note that I play in performance mode as I am plugged in while in bed or on the sofa 99% of my playtime. My daughter had about 8 on our primary desktop which is an aging i5-7400 @ 3Ghz, 16GB RAM, SSD with a GeForce 1060 GTX and reported no issues either.

At this point we have over 35 hours in with the majority of them being my daughter on the PC and me making up about a third of the remaining hours on the Deck. During those hours we each experienced one crash. For her it was a CTD for myself it was a crash that locked up Proton causing a force restart of the switch. Note both of these crashes were prior to the Day 1 patch and we haven’t ran into any further issues since.

Gameplay is fun and a lot more interesting and in-depth than I expected. Learning the various arts like potion making, herbalism, and so long always gives you something to do. I am known for almost always turning off in game music but the soundtrack is perfect for reminding you what world you are in. There are more than enough side quests to keep you busy, to the point of falling behind and losing track of the main quest.

There are puzzles at every turn that are both hard but not impossible. I have yet to have to refer to a walkthrough as much as at times I wanted to. This game really keeps you wanting to avoid spoilers and accomplish things on your own. You will meet a lot of classmates and others on and off campus, however there is really a fairly limited pool that you regularly interact with. That said you will quickly make close friends and even your own Draco Malfoy types who you will hate but might end up have a truce with.

All in all my daughter and my biggest complaint is the lack of better character customization. There are a fair number of presets but there is no ability to adjust outside those presets such as adjust lips or cheeks, noses to your own design outside the presets slider. There is no hight or weight adjustment. I like the amount of control over skin tones and as mentioned there are a fair amount of sliders.

However by modern standards it’s barebones. It’s sad when I have played phone f2p games that have better character creation when you can only really only see your character at the selection screen than a $70-90 USD that everyone is going to want to go all out on character design. It is for this primary reason along with my dislike of how hard on the Deck and I assume PC selection of Foo Flame travel points is harder than it should be. I watched my daughter do fast travel via KVM and it was smooth as could be. I do so on the deck and I eventually give up and fly or walk there.

That said we still rate this game a very strong 9/10 and already call it GOTY for us.",updated 35 hour combined total wanted add thought daughter closing 18 half century old self fan harry potter wizarding world read book younger watched movie great bonding preordered deluxe edition available knew desktop handle concern deck device choice health wise luckily deck verified early launch early launch spent 10 hour couple hour deck issue ran solid 30 fps except sparse drop mid high 20 cutscenes note change stock installation setting note performance mode plugged bed sofa 99 playtime daughter 8 primary desktop aging i5 7400 3ghz 16gb ram ssd geforce 1060 gtx reported issue 35 hour majority daughter pc third remaining hour deck hour experienced crash ctd crash locked proton causing force restart switch note crash prior 1 patch ran issue fun interesting depth expected learning various art potion herbalism long give known turning music soundtrack perfect reminding world side quest busy falling losing track puzzle turn hard impossible refer walkthrough time wanted keep wanting avoid spoiler accomplish thing meet classmate others campus fairly limited pool regularly interact quickly close friend draco malfoy type hate truce daughter biggest complaint lack customization fair number presets adjust outside presets adjust lip cheek nose design outside presets slider hight weight adjustment control skin tone mentioned fair slider modern standard barebones sad phone f2p game creation selection screen 70 90 usd design primary along dislike hard deck assume pc selection foo flame travel point harder watched daughter fast travel via kvm smooth deck eventually fly walk rate strong 9 10 already call goty,3,0.8481
990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"Hogwarts Legacy is a great game, very polished by today's standards in my opinion. But it is lacking in some small areas. Below I have listed the pros and cons of the game. I also listed what I want to see in the future, as well as what I don't want to see in the future! Keep in mind I am not a massive Harry Potter fan and only have seen the movies a long time ago. This list was made over the course of my playthrough during the 72 hour early access for Deluxe Editon owners, hopefully there is a day 1 patch out by now! Enjoy!

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
• Good Performance (Could be better, but it is very good at least for me)
• Great Immersion
• Graphics and Art Style
• Changing Seasons
• Fancy Animation (With spells, puzzles, doors, and all that)
• Great Music & Sound Design (Broom class kinda popped off with that music)
• Engaging Story/Narrative
• Fun Late Game Combat (Ancient magic is sick! Just use your spells and mix it up! It's pretty fun)
• Exploration (Rewards you heavily for it)
• Detailed & Big World (You can go into any building, find many secrets, solve fun puzzles, pet cats, and much more)
• Interesting Characters (There are lots! The voice acting is sometimes bad)
• Great Transmog (Once you get the item you keep its appearance for use whenever you want)
• Great Quests (There are a ton)
• Fun Skins/Outfits (Great outfit pieces, mount skins, wand skins, and all that)
• Almost No Bugs (Visual bugs only, most are funny)
• No Crashes
• Accessibility & UI Options (There are LOTS!)
• Graphic Options (Also LOTS!) 
• NPC Quest Speed (WOW, NPCs that actually move your speed on quests?! More games should do this!)
• Room of Requirement (Fun to customize, can be daunting at times)

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
• No Quidditch
• Cramped Camera (Sometimes it can be at weird angles, maybe add customizable positions)
• Character Customization (I'm referring to the customization at the start of the game, it's a bit iffy)
• Voice Pitch (In the character customization menu at the start, every voice pitch besides the default one sounds robotic)
• Voice Acting (Sometimes)
• Repetitive Early Game Combat (Not a lot of spells to use but it's understandable)
• Limited Gear Slots (Can be increased by doing [spoiler]Merlin Trials[/spoiler])
• Confusing Menu (At first, it was hard for me to get used to it all at once, I couldn't find transmog or my Twitch drops)
• Useless Houses (From what I have played your house doesn't mean much)
• Useless Wands (When choosing your wand, the attributes don't do anything from what I have seen, from a game standpoint it makes sense)
• Small Enemy/Boss Variety ([spoiler]All 4 trials are the same, etc[/spoiler])
• Graphical Stuttering (In cutscenes mostly, sometimes happens when entering newly rendered areas)
• Lighting Transitions & Flickering (Sometimes the lighting can be blinding, or just straight up weird looking)
• Door Loading (When traversing the castle, sometimes the game will show a loading icon on doors)
• Robot Background NPCs (They pretty much don't do anything but walk and talk, with no reactions to spells or anything)
• NPC AI & Animations (Sometimes it's a bit janky)

[h1]What I Want to See:[/h1]
• Multiplayer (At least Quidditch multiplayer)
• Mod Support (Would be awesome, especially Steam Workshop)
• Quidditch (They have the Golden Snitch and the arena in-game already)
• Camera Control (Positioning, maybe increased FOV slider?)
• Photo Mode (Please!)
• Better Character Customization (More skin colors, hair, face shapes, and more)
• Improved Voice Pitch (Better pitch shifter)
• Improved Voice Acting (Most likely will not happen)
• Bug Fixes (Lighting transition fixes)
• Better Performance (Door loading improvements)
• More Accessibility Options (Arachnophobia switch?)
• Community Engagement (Free in-game events to win cosmetics, community updates and more! Ex. Dying Light 2 is a game that does this VERY well!)

[h1]What I Don’t Want to See:[/h1]
• Micro-transactions 
• Overpriced DLC
• Radio Silence (No more updates, no communication, and all that. Would be a bummer)

To conclude, most of the cons can be fixed easily, don't let the cons bring you down. I believe most of the cons will be fixed/addressed. Anyways, here are my PC specs and I ran the game at 1440p with consistent 120 FPS at almost all times! No RTX on!

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
While not as good as our dreams, Hogwarts Legacy is nevertheless a decent game that exudes the visual charm and beauty of J.K. Rowling’s fantasy world well. It is burdened by performance issues, a somewhat hollow world, and some small, though cumulatively bothersome design oversights, but with a passable story and mostly enjoyable gameplay it lands itself a generally positive recommendation.

[h1]Performance:[/h1]
•	GeForce GTX 1660Ti
•	8GB DDR4@1330MHz
•	i5 9300H @2.4GHz
•	HDD 7200RPM
*Game requires min. 16GB RAM.

Initially unplayable on low, changing system and game settings resulted in a fairly playable game at medium - low settings. A recent patch improved it a bit, and while there are FPS drops, there’s less freezing. 

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
[b]World:[/b]
Hogwarts’ architecture is breath-taking, and outdoor environments are varied and beautiful – some dark and creepy, others warm and vibrant. It’s a visual masterpiece, and the atmosphere of the Wizarding world is brilliantly captured. It’s absurd there’s no photo mode.

Some house and dungeon interiors are repeated, which feels lazy, but you're only there briefly to loot chests. Important places you visit often are unique.

[b]Magic:[/b]
Spells are colourful and vibrant, and particle effects are pretty, with light wisps, auras and ‘sparks’ lending a magical quality to the game. Performance aside, these are smooth and satisfying to watch, too.

[b]Characters:[/b]
While not photorealistic, the artistic style is pleasant, and characters do have well-detailed faces and mostly good expressions.

The cast doesn’t feel from 1800, but I’m not so bothered by this. It wasn’t sold as a historical game, and I didn’t expect realism. I didn’t buy this game [i]because of the 1800s setting[/i], but [i]because of the fantasy setting[/i].

Our characters are disappointing, with creation based around presets with very limited customisation – worse than Cyberpunk. Female characters in particular look pretty bad. In the world, lighting affects your face sometimes horribly, though cutscenes show how it in better detail. 

[h1]Audio:[/h1]
[b]Environmental:[/b]
Hogwarts interiors sometimes capture the grandeur of the place in their soundscape in those big open stairways with high ceilings, but I don’t remember losing myself in outdoors nature sounds. Environmental sounds were more remarkable indoors than out, I think.

[b]Voice Acting:[/b]
Characters are generally well-spoken which I like, and some personality does come through. Emotion is conveyed fairly well, but rarely to the point it moved me in any way. Our character (female for me) does a good enough job, but I wouldn’t say it was outstanding.

[b]Soundtrack:[/b]
Music is pleasant, although sometimes perhaps a little energetic. When exploring, it never made you feel like you were floating on a breeze in this beautiful world, like Skyrim did. It was often quite intense in a way that’s a bit much, though in intense moments it served well. Regardless, it did have a fantasy feel about it, and in that way it fit the game well.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
[b]Immersion:[/b]
The stage is beautiful, but the play is empty. There isn’t much sense of being a Hogwarts student. Classes teach you spells, but feel like tutorials. Once done, you aren’t really a student anymore, and this becomes a typical RPG, lacking RPG features. Extra-curricular assignments don’t change this feeling, and come over more as challenges than student roleplay.

You can’t interact with NPCs outside of missions. There’s no companions. Common rooms are lifeless. Mounts don’t stay, despawning when dismounting. At night, the atmosphere is lovely, yet there’s not much to do. We also can’t play Quidditch! They only strength with immersion is the graphics. Beyond that, the game doesn’t capitalise on its unique setting, and feels like any other below average open world RPG as a result.

As an RPG it lacks a sense of choice or consequence. While there are different endings, most of the game is linear, and so the room for roleplaying is limited, as is replay value.

[b]Combat:[/b]
Combat is challenging without being too hard. Because you have to match spells with defences, you can’t just spam your way through fights, and that makes them feel quite rewarding. So far, I like this, though the abundance of fighting in tougher missions can also be very tiring.

I hate the spell toolbar system though. It takes 4 spells, and you can unlock 3 more toolbars, scrolling between them in combat. There are more spells than this though, and I kept needing to change, requiring a visit to the menus. Even with spells I have in my toolbars, scrolling through [i]in combat[/i] is annoying.

[b]Puzzles:[/b]
While overdone and abundant in the world to the point they can feel like mindless busywork, I do actually enjoy ticking these off to 100% the game. There is some variety across different types, so there’s [i]some[/i] complexity, without being frustratingly difficult.

[b]Crafting:[/b]
Crafting isn’t instant, and without minigames, you simply have to wait for a timer up to ~10 mins. This is such an awful, boring design. Once the timer is up, the game won’t produce more either, so you can’t explore and come back to 50 potions, for example.

[b]Cosmetics:[/b]
One thing I love about the apparel system is the ability to change the appearance of anything you’re wearing to something you like more while keeping the stats.

However, nearly every chest has a clothing item, yet you can carry so few. Upgrades don’t mitigate the problem. Yet I can keep several Hippogriffs in a bag, and brooms in my pocket. This is irritating. Returning to vendors so often is tedious, and destroying the clothes wastes money they could be sold for. It also requires going into the menus and then to return to the world, you have to escape through about three layers of menu. [i]It just feels so painfully slow![/i]

[b]Achievements:[/b]
This is like a Ubisoft game - grindy. There’s many repetitive tasks, all of which you have to do to 100%. I expect 100+ hours.

[h1]Story – Spoiler Free:[/h1]
The narrative hasn’t moved me as much as I would have liked, but it would be unfair to say it’s bad. It is yet another ‘you are the unique hero who can save the world’ story, which is fine – it’s nice to feel important. But then you are sent on a plentiful amount of fetch and carry missions, and given you’re a young student, adults are quite willing to send you into danger, too.

By almost 50 hours in-game at 57% total completion, the story introduces some unlikable enemies and some mildly likeable friends, but none are very memorable. The overarching story is compelling enough to drive the gameplay – there is a [i]reason[/i] to play on, but rarely do you [i]feel[/i] the stakes or care about the consequences, as it’s hard to care about most characters. The thing that’s moved me most so far is a mission where you rescue animals. Take that as you will.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
While I recommend this game, it is also symptomatic of the downward spiral in quality we see these days. It’s quite repetitive and shallow, but some of the sting is taken away by a beautiful world and the Harry Potter setting. Many criticisms I have are small, but together sap the game of charm. When the child-like excitement fades and the product is viewed neutrally, it’s not a masterpiece.

The environments are lovely, the audio and puzzles are good, and combat is the right balance of simplicity and challenge for me. Roleplay and immersion are lacking, and the story is mediocre. For these reasons, while I recommend the game, it’s not an overwhelming recommendation. Ultimately, though, do I regret pre-ordering? No, I don’t. I like Hogwarts Legacy. I just don’t love it.

• Decorate the Room of Requirements (if you're into design, you can spend many extra hours in the game)
• Learn unforgivable curses :D 
 
I must say that I also liked the story and the characters.

The only drawback for me was too much similar grinding (this is mostly about Merlin trials.) And I also think it would be great if each new level of Alohomora allowed unlocking the doors faster.

As for bugs, I haven't faced any major ones — but only small things that didn't really affect my experience.

My final word is — I do recommend this game! I enjoyed the time spent inside and outside Hogwarts. Moreover, it would be very nice to get more HL content in the future :3

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"[b]For me, this is one of the best open-world games I've ever played.[/b]

[b]Storyline: 9/10[/b]
The story is presented in a very nice way, like in Harry Potter movies. In most of the dialogue, you can choose what to say. We have many ways to complete the mission. Each mission is interesting and different from the last. We also have riddle games and good sidequests.

[b]Gameplay: 9/10[/b]
Beautiful open world, giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore Hogwarts, caves, forests, mountains, and do much more. The map is very large. Herbalism and alchemy are important and help a lot; we can also upgrade equipment. We can have a real Wizard of Oz adventure. The fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocked by a small obstacle, but in comparison to other games, it is not very annoying.

[b]Characters: 10/10[/b]
Each character has its own charm. The characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We can also choose the main character's path, whether he is a good wizard or a bad one (using unforgivable spells), but the game will not punish us for it.

[b]Graphics: 10/10[/b]
The graphics in this game are amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined; for example, when we move the grass, it moves with us. Graphics capabilities are used at 100%. The movement of water and clouds is very well refined. We can see falling leaves and changing weather. It makes a huge impression.

[b]Sounds: 9/10[/b]
The music and ambient sounds in this game fit great. We can listen to climatic music that is selected for each moment of the game. Character voices are not my favorites, but they fit the characters. There is a lot of music from movies.

[b]Overall: 9.5/10[/b]
If you are thinking about purchasing this game because you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend it for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun will come from it. This is a well-made game not only for Harry Potter fans but for everyone.",best open world game storyline 9 10 presented nice harry potter movie dialogue choose way complete mission mission interesting different last riddle game good sidequests 9 10 beautiful open world giving opportunity explore hogwarts cave forest mountain map large herbalism alchemy important help upgrade equipment real wizard oz adventure fight feeling pleasant blocked small obstacle comparison game annoying character 10 10 charm character matched storyline environment choose path good wizard bad unforgivable spell punish graphic 10 10 graphic amazing smallest detail refined example move grass move graphic capability 100 movement water cloud refined falling leaf changing weather make huge impression sound 9 10 music ambient sound fit great listen climatic music selected moment voice favorite fit character music movie 9 5 10 purchasing open world action game recommend guarantee fun harry potter fan,3,0.9931

1172470,Apex Legends™,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before... 

To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that shit is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase. 

What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it. 

I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, shit, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES. 

It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some shit. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday. 

It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and shit, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.

I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.",apex truly amazing helped outlet best friend fun questionable financial decision invest awesome weapon legend skin 510 hour decent financial commitment interest able thing busy frame ea hacked someone ea unsure whatever banned violating user agreement despite ea support seeing suspicious login activity acknowledging hacked decided stand ban 510 hour unless spend 5 month legal issue apex someone reading create ea invest supposed support happens punishing ea single dollar pas message anywhere certainly spend cause instant,1,0.6988
1599340,Lost Ark,"Although it has been almost a month since I quit this game, I'm going to write this review in the hope that new players will have a basic understanding of what they are about to get themselves into. Not saying that you shouldn't TRY the game (it's free so why wouldn't you), but I hope that by the time you reach the point in the game where you feel like you need to swipe your credit card or start feeling the need to keep playing the game even at the cost of neglecting your real life responsibilities, you'll be able to make an educated decision on whether you want to keep p(l)aying or break yourself out of the vicious cycle that is Lost Ark's gameplay loop.

TL;DR Lost Ark is a well-polished game with amazing action combat, fun classes, and stunning visuals. However these pros are only meant to draw players in whereby they will fall prey to the dev team's intentionally predatory pay-to-win mechanics, slog through hours of doing the same repetitive tasks on six or more characters every day, get verbally abused or gatekept by a toxic elitist community, or get randomly banned from the game for no reason. This game is not intended for your average Joe who holds a 9-5 day job and only has 2 hours on average to play games every weekday; it is targeted to either single rich people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to throw truckloads of cash at the game, or single poor people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to play this game for 16 hours every day.

Korean MMOs are notorious for their top tier gameplay, stunning visuals and graphics, punishing amounts of grinding, and pay-to-win mechanics designed on the philosophy that rich people should always dominate poor people in every aspect of life. Lost Ark unfortunately is no exception to this doctrine. As a new player, upon starting the game you will immediately be wowed by the game's fantastic graphics, polished zones, and fun action combat. But don't be fooled; you are the fish that the devs want to catch and the pretty graphics and amazing gameplay is the bait that they use to hook you in. The story of this game is mediocre and is mainly just generic medieval fantasy garbage that you've likely seen in many previous MMOs or other RPG games. The bad guys of the world are even just generically named as ""demons"". After reading through a few lines of story dialogue you will very soon become lost and confused with regards to where the story is going and eventually you'll just end up skipping the majority of the quest dialogue.

The early game from level 1-50 mostly consists of you following the main story quest while doing countless numbers of generic ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" side quests. In between there are dungeons that you will both run through as part of the main story or optionally as part of a side quest. These dungeons are well designed, but unfortunately you won't be able to team up with anyone to run them because the early game is completely devoid of real human players. Your only companions at this point are the hundreds of bot trains that run around each zone with impunity.

Reaching level 50 as a new player will likely take anywhere between 8-40 hours of gameplay, depending on whether you're speedrunning through each zone or taking the time to stop and smell the roses. Once you hit level 50 you'll enter what the game refers to as ""Tier 1"" of progression. There are currently three tiers of progression: 1, 2, and 3 (the current highest tier). This is where you will establish your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark, which will consist of doing your daily two Chaos dungeon runs, daily two Guardian runs, daily three Una's tasks (which are again either ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" quests), and weekly three Una's tasks (which are again mostly just ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" except scaled up).

The progression from Tier 1 to Tier 3 has been streamlined since the game release but is still quite a chore to slog through, especially since at this point in the game you are unlikely to have encountered a single human player. Guardian runs are nearly impossible to solo as a new player and will basically be unplayable as there are no human players to run them with. Chaos dungeons are just braindead solo instances where you mash as many buttons as you can to kill as many mobs as possible while picking up loot. You will log in to do your dailies but once your dailies are done, your vertical progression for the day is capped and there is nothing you can do except wait for the next day for your dailies to reset.

For the next 50-100 hours you will slog your way from T1 to T2 and T2 to T3 by doing the same repetitive daily routine of chaos dungeons, fetch quests, and kill quests. The whole time you won't meet a single real human player until you reach T3. But T3 is also where the real grind starts. You thought what you were doing up until this point was repetitive and boring? Nope, you're in for the grind of your life. This is also the point at which the predatory pay-to-win mechanics of this game start to show. Upgrading your gear is RNG-based, and as you go higher not only does the chance of succeeding drop significantly lower, but the cost of each upgrade attempt skyrockets to the point that farming your dailies on a single character will not be enough to make any sort of meaningful progress in a reasonable timeframe. You will have two choices at this point: 1) create alt characters and push them to T3 so you can farm more dailies on each character (daily rewards are per character, not per account) to get more materials to upgrade your main character; OR 2) pull out your credit card. Most players will do a combination of both, resulting in them not only spending an unhealthy number of hours playing the game every day but also an ungodly amount of money on the game just to overcome the artificial barriers put up by the devs preventing you from participating in the best content that Lost Ark has to offer, which is the Legion Raids.

By the time you progress far enough in the game to meet the minimum requirements to run your first legion raid, you'll find that nobody wants to take you because the majority of players in this game are already far ahead of you and don't have the patience to teach you the raids, which are actually quite challenging and require you to fail a few times so you can practice. After all, the players that still play the game at this point are hardcore gamers who have 20+ alt characters that they need to farm dailies on every day, so every minute that they spend teaching you and not farming their alts is a minute where they are not making gold. The barriers to playing the most fun content in this game are so high that it is impossible for anyone to surmount them unless they play with a large dedicated group of friends or are willing to empty their entire bank account.

If you still have not quit the game by now you will most likely be forced to when AGS (the publisher of Lost Ark) permanently bans you for violating their code of conduct. The ban will happen randomly and without warning, your appeal will be automatically denied, and no explanation for the ban will be given. This is because Lost Ark has the worst infestation of bots and RMTers that possibly has ever existed in an MMO up to this point, and AGS is so incompetent that their efforts to lessen the problem have only ended up making things worse. Legitimate and innocent players get banned on a daily basis while blatant RMTers who have been around since the game's launch stream themselves buying out the entire Lost Ark economy in broad daylight and still go unpunished. All of your time, effort, and money invested in the game gone in an instant with no chance to get it back.

By all means, try this game out but don't let it hook you in.

1599340,Lost Ark,"As someone who has played the RU version for 1000hrs+ and have leveled two characters legit and boosted 8 of them (to 50) my two cents about the topic:

+ The game is a fun journey from start to the endgame. The leveling process gets a bit dull, but on your first character it's manageable.

+ The start of the endgame is quite fun. When you first hit 50 there's a lot 'island quest' storylines to complete, reputation quests to unlock, new guardian fights/new dungeons/new raids to experience, some 'sea events' and other 'timed events' to check out. Progression feels pretty good and smooth (until you gear gets around +9, the +10-+15 upgrades are significantly 'harder' to succeed => More fails => More costs => Way slower progress).

+ The equalized arena PvP is fun although very CC-heavy and takes a little learning curve to get into. However the rewards are quite poor beyond the 'weekly' ones, so unless you are really into PvP you probably won't spend a lot of time playing it. The ranked PvP is only TRUE SOLO QUEUE, so no premades (which is pretty fun for solo players!).

What does this actually have to do with potential P2W and 'forced alts'?

+ Kinda tricked you with the topic. The game is a fun journey even before you need to think about spending.

To the actual topic:

+ Once you hit your first progression wall (starting from +9 / +10 upgrading) you'll start to see yourself being handicapped by various resources. It might be materials (drops from limited daily dungeons/daily quests etc.), it might be shillings (daily dungeon/daily quests/'limited' cube dungeon), or it might be gold (weekly dungeons/weekly raids/weekly quests). To get through this wall you'll either need to just take it slow (log-in and do your daily/weekly things) or go faster (start making alts that allow you to farm more of the aforementioned) or go super fast (start top-upping with $/€'s and turn that into gold to get the resources needed for the upgrade gamble).

+ 'Taking it slow' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character

+ 'Going faster' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character + 1-2 hours or so per WEEK per alt character

+ 'Going super fast' is only limited by your bank account <- beware though getting to 'max gear' as soon as possible removes many gaming goals you might have when 'taking it slow' or 'going faster'

Now there are other monetizations that boost your progression in various ways but these are laid out in other posts and are not that significant. Basically with 50$ you'll get all the permanent things you'll ever 'need' and then you have the option of running the recurring 'crystalline aura (sub)' for extra benefits. The only thing I'd raise as a 'must-have' is the pet which is around 5-10$ and it's ACCOUNT WIDE, so you'll only need one of them. The reason for the pet is auto-looting, which is a major convinience for your daily dungeon running (the pet picks up the constant loot pinata from the daily dungeons instead of having to run around furiously smackin the loot button). Pets are also given out through events so you are likely to get one for free sooner or later.

TLDR; The game is a fun journey from 1-50 regardless of whether you spend a single dime or not. When you get to the mid-late game (of the current patch) you'll either take it slow (1 character), go faster (alts) or you go super fast (spending $/€'s).

1599340,Lost Ark,"I know what you're thinking, ""Dude, you played the game for almost 2000 hours, how can you not recommend the game?!"" Well, that's the funny thing about this game. You don't really realize what you're getting into until you reach the true endgame. I'll try to be brief and precise about the important issues. 

First off, the game is fundamentally pretty damn fun. The combat is fun and the visuals range from pretty good to gorgeous. There are plenty of systems that are kind of annoying and there's certainly lots of rng and things to grind at in the game, sometimes frustratingly so. But where I really hit a wall and felt my will to continue completely fade away was the endgame upgrade system. This is where most people realize just how pay-to-win the game is.

I reached ilvl 1475 on my main with relative ease, all things considered. I was happy about that considering the extremely low success rates. But once you get into raiding and acquire some relic gear, this game becomes very punishing.. but not the good kind of punishing, the kind of punishing where you can almost hear the sound of laughter coming from somewhere. But, it isn't coming from your friends, or other players, no, it's coming from the devs. They're laughing at you. ""Look at this loser"" you hear them say, ""he failed his 60% chance to upgrade his relic quality, and when he got it the second time, it only went up by 2%. HAHAHAHA, what an idiot"".

Now I could clarify, but it would take forever. Just know that this is just one of many upgrade systems in the game, and it's very expensive and very depressing. Plus the game wants you to do this for several pieces of gear across all your characters. Having multiple alts is also encouraged to help aid your main with materials and gold. Unless you completely whale this game and spend thousands of real dollars each month, you will struggle without alts. This makes the game quite repetitive after a while too. 

The last thing I want to talk about is one of the many currencies in the game called Pheons. This straight up made me quit the game entirely. If they removed it, I might consider coming back. I remember saying to myself ""Instead of subjecting myself to this, how about I just don't, quit, and live a happier life?"" So I did.. at least for a while, i'll explain at the end. I don't think the devs realize how much this currency is destroying their player retention...

Basically, Pheons are a currency that you need to purchase most things and ALL important things on the player market/auction house. They are VERY expensive to purchase outright in the store, and the devs give out insultingly low amounts on rare occasions. You need a lot of them, You will always need them as the game gets updated. Dealing with this currency made me feel like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing just hard enough to keep me alive.

In conclusion, I didn't like how this game made me feel anymore. Pheons and just thinking about cutting an ability stone make me want to alt-f4. Overall, this game started to feel like I was dredging through an alleyway full of heroine addicts trying to sell me some smack and hang out with them. Fuck that. Admittedly, I still fire it up from time to time to enjoy some combat, but I could never take this game seriously the way it is.

Oh, and the game's bot problem is severe and will probably never be fixed.

*edit: Just wanted to add some more context to this. At review time, I hadn't played for 3-4 months. I played a little bit more recently to check in on things, try out the new classes, and check out new skins. The economy appears to be getting worse though. Gold and prices on the auction house have more than doubled, Pheon's are still in play, items are becoming more scarce, bots are still everywhere, and island instances are completely dead. I want to play this game, but It's not worth it. As new games and MMO's come out this year, I imagine more people will leave and move on.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I’m going to write this review in the hope that new players gets a basic understanding what they’re gonna get into. At the time of writing, I stopped playing the game almost 2 weeks ago. Today I logged in to take a snapshot of my character screen (like a souvenir) then I uninstalled. This is going to be a thumb-down from someone who have spent 2,000 hours in this game... yeah, I’m going to be *that* kind of person for once.

Lost Ark is a game that gives you a lot of thing to do but you’re not going to particularly enjoy it. If I have to give an honest opinion about how much I enjoyed Lost Ark in the 2k hours I’ve played, I’d say maybe 20% was fun while 80% was a waste of time. The game WANTS you to waste that time so that you get to the good part.

Reminder: I’m writing this for NEW PLAYERS. So, existing players who gonna read this and comment (I won’t disable comment, criticize within reason) just keep in mind that your/our experience from launch and the experience of someone new today is going to be a stark contrast.

The story is just your average MMORPG shtick. Very likely you’re going to stop paying attention at the poor English localization half hour in the game and you’ll start mashing your G key (thus the meme you might have seen already). You’re going to press G for the next 12 hours or so if you’re fast and you don’t get too sidetracked. Else you’re looking about 15 hours of G-spamming.

The story is not compelling, you get an occasional cool cutscenes which pretty much tells you everything you need to know then you are sent on your way to do the tedious of story question: Go to X, speak with this NPC, spend 1 minute to go to Y, Speak to this NPC, go back to X and speak with that NPC again, rinse and repeat ad-nauseam.

You do the above for 12 – 15 hours before you hit “Tier 1 gear” at which point you start shifting in what’s gonna be your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark career.

The progression from T1 to mid-T3 is going to be brutal for you. It’s a dead zone, YOUR dead zone. There’s only bots wherever you’re going and the content you can do barely has players to help you with. This is literally going to be a phase where you’re going to spend roughly the next 100 hours (realistically it’s going to be closer to 200 hours) to get in a decent spot in T3. “Decent spot” is an always moving target as the game gets new content and the playerbase keeps moving forward. How tedious it’s going to get there all comes down to how merciful (or in touch with the playerbase) the dev is feeling is feeling at that time.

As you settle in your daily routine, you’re gonna realize how much RNG is involved in various aspect of the game and how much of it purely waste your time in a way you’re not going to enjoy. Imagine an important item locked behind a collectible that have a low chance to drop three times every week. You might get it on your first try, you might end up getting it on your 20th week (it’s a thing: ask anyone about the “Moake” hell and how group of friends gets their item drop while others are still left behind after 3 months still killing the same boss).

Gold is going to be your most valuable currency but the one you farm is going to have trash value. Why? Bots. Oh that Schoolgirl skin you see people walking around in? You can get it in the cash shop for $40 OR you can spend 45,000 gold to purchase it in the auction house. What? You’re only making 3,000k gold week? Well, tough luck! Save for 15 weeks and hope that inflation, caused by the disgusting amount of bot, is not going to make the price rocket to 60k by the time you get your 45k. Oh, you can’t even save that gold because you actually need it to hone your weapon, armor, to purchase mats, to buy dungeon/raid chest, etc, etc. Guess you’re out of luck!

Bots are rampant. About 4 months ago, I thought bots were at the worse point (looking at the price of RMT) but oh boy how wrong I was. RMT price is currently half of the price of what I thought was the worse point 4 months ago. What does that mean? The current of the game in terms of botting/RMT is TWICE as worse as the time that I thought it was worse. Inflation is at an all time high.

If you still manage to push through all these barriers and somehow manage to get your character high enough for the end-game raid content then congrats! Also; tough luck. No one gonna take you in their raid. The game is such a huge time sink that there’s very few who are willing to spend the time to fail with you in a raid because you WILL fail and you HAVE to fail to learn but the likeliness of having 7 other people who are either happy to teach you or fail with you is so low that you’re going to be spending quite sometime in the party finder just to go nowhere.

This game was fun back when it launched. Having a huge group of actual people running beside you in-world was such a breath of fresh air. It was fun, everyone was learning, everyone was talking. The current new player experience is a dead zone that I don’t wish upon anyone. The end-game is brutal once you reach it not because of the content difficulty but mostly due to how you’re going to get filtered out. Everything in between is a huge waste of time aimed at squeezing play hours from the players.

""Lost Ark respect your time."": So we were told, turns out it doesn't.

""Lost Ark is alt friendly."": When the game foundation is built upon having multiple characters, this statement is far from the truth. There's so much things to do to make this game alt friendly but dev outright refuse. One of the biggest offender is materials such as Shards which are character bound. If this was an alt friendly game, Shards would never be bound. Neither Guardian/Destruction/Leapstones would have been bound.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Lobby/Gatekeeping Simulator. 

Rushing content to catch up to Korea was such a great idea. Look at the player base from when the game was released to now. Support drought, gatekeeping, the toxic environment, the works. If you plan on starting this game now, don't. Endgame has become a circle jerk of the 1%, competing for MVP status and who has the shinier weapon. Unless you're friends with one of these guys, do not expect to get accepted anywhere. 

This is coming from a solo player (no static or interaction with guilds) that's spent a fair chunk of time and ended up with above-average gear. I'm not entirely ""juiced"" but I can guarantee I'll get into lobbies faster than 90% of players. However, even with the gear that I have, I can still get gate-kept. Only because I haven't spent thousands of dollars to over-gear beyond the requirements for raids, so that they become a mindless damage-dumping fight to skip mechanics. 

Raiding used to be a fun experience at first but it's become a repulsive environment just to get raids done ""fast"" and move onto the next alt. I'm not feeling burnout, I'm just not as motivated as I used to be when I started.

Server merges will not fix anything. Side content has become a joke. This game will literally have to become your part-time job. It will only get worse if Amazon/SGS doesn't do anything about it. Unfortunately this review will just get buried among the other reviews, maybe even along with the game eventually. Life expectancy for Lost Ark; no longer than a year.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I have read stories about people getting false bans, but never thought it would happen to me until it did. Got perma-banned for ""cheating"", tried to dispute it, they wouldn't tell me the reason and sent an automated email response instead. I have never cheated (I don't even know how?!) or bought gold or anything. I've just been playing everyday, enjoying with my family and my boyfriend. I even recently decided to support the game and put in real money to buy skins.

The fact that they took my money and then banned me a couple days later for no reason is enough to turn me off from this game. If anything, THEY are the ones committing fraud, not me... It makes me really sad because I only got to enjoy having my character wear a cute pink swimsuit for a couple of days. :(

Also this game is not friendly to new players (hell, I've heard even new players are getting banned for no reason). I have a lot of hours, but I didn't play the first couple of weeks when it was released and I still feel behind. Imagine just starting the game now. The beginner areas are all full of bots and some co-op quests that new players need to do are all devoid of any players. (Gesbroy is the worst),

Thanks AGS for robbing me of my money and my happiness. It sucks that they're the publishers because the game itself is really great.

The early and mid game was quite enjoyable, otherwise I wouldn’t have gotten to the insufferable endgame.

All of that work to hone for a CHANCE of getting your item level to qualify for the newest content. Then there’s gatekeeping where it’s essentially a job interview. Your hard work of grinding dailies every single day to qualify for the raids aren’t enough, because now you have the meet the expectations of other players who expect you to have the perfect gear, have the boss memorized to the core, and make zero mistakes. So you have to do even MORE grinding in order to get the right equipment and engravings, somehow become experienced in the raid but no one will accept you because you’re not experienced, and become a robot that perfectly executes every single mechanic.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Lost Ark Community Managers put out a July Player Survey and I started writing about why I'm not playing the game hardly since the June Patch for some poor soul at Amazon to probably never read, and figured I'd also put that at the bottom while I'm at it.

As for new people wanting to try this game: 

New players will never have the early game experience I had to push me to play as much as I did. You will skip past T1-2 and half the raids/dungeons the game has to offer that I got to learn on par with a group. Once you skip to T3 and current content you will be gatekept by the ones who want to get the raids done as quickly as possible and move on to their next character for the week.

Learning parties are far and few between, so you can try to sneak into an experienced run. But if you started now or recently, you will have to swipe to reach the newest endgame content quickly, and you'll still be missing the rng obtained card sets you need and stick out like a sore thumb because of your roster level that experienced lobbies check. There ARE lobbies that will take you anyways but expect to spend some time getting denied first. The PvP scene is pretty much nonexistent and the open world bits are unbalanced, so look elsewhere if that's what you're wanting out of this game. 

""But you have over 2k hours"" a lot of that was spent playing the game in a different state than what it currently is, with new raids and content every other month, and building new characters to that new content was relatively cheap and not as time consuming. We are almost caught up to Korea and that pacing of content release is going to slow way down while honing costs and time spent for less gain will continue to go up. 

The combat is very fun and visually the game looks great. Fleshing out your character's build and seeing it come together is very satisfying, but tripods, engravings, and skill points are one and done pretty early on.
Ultimately, your character's growth will become governed solely by honing your item level and nothing else, which doesn't give that same satisfaction as it's exponentially more time consuming and expensive for less and less gain.


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Spending about 250k gold to push my main from 1565 to 1580 after months of doing the same dailies was honestly just too disheartening. The people I play with either run 18 raids a week for gold and have a main 6 roster almost or all 1580+ OR they don't play enough and aren't able to run the new 1580 content on their main. They likely won't be there in time for Akkan either.
I work Mon-Fri, and for months, I dedicated more than half of each day off, including Friday after work to run rested chaos and rested guardians on my roster, and try to squeeze in raids during the week or after grinding dailies during the weekend. 
And to do that just to barely scrape by to reach 1580 knowing I will only be able to continue playing new content if I continue to grind even more was a realization that finally hit after spending months of materials and gold on that honing session. I enjoy the game's raids when I can, but not 6 characters a week. 
For a long while, I ran 10+ characters of chaos and guardians, and established a strong main 6 roster. Then I started to cut back and only run main 6 chaos and guardians that generated the new materials, then with new content only my 4 characters at 1540+ I would run rested daily content on. 
Despite that, I wouldn't have even had enough gold to push ONLY my main to 1580 if not for playing the fish market and holding onto that gold for months. That itself required brainless hours buying Redflesh fish and Pearls because of the Auction House changes to combat bots. That well is now dry, and I don't have it in me to build it back up, either by doing the same chaos and guardian spam every Fri-Sun or sitting there slowly buying up a small ocean of fish watching something on the side.

I will and I won't miss this game. The experience at launch and for a while after was some of the best this game had to offer. Me and all my friends learning new mechanics through tier 1 and 2 dungeons and raids, watching each other hone up, and doing content together. Who can make it to T3 first and start selling those great honor leapstones for 800 gold a pop? The 1340-1370 dead zone was the first time the brakes hit the train, some of us made new alts, some took the time to play something else after no lifing the game since release. Argos comes out and we all prog gate 1 together but then numbers started dropping from our group because of the grind. The rest of us continue on, running Argos 1-3 for weeks till Valtan. Slowly through Vykas, Clown, and Brel NM, some started playing less and for others this game became a second (or first for the students/unemployed) job. 

I grew my roster during this, through more characters to run chaos, occasional swiping, and changing from gunslinger to reaper main I had several strong characters that could run the newest content or at least the first few gates of it. The honing past 1540 is where I finally started to feel the pain of honing draining my resources. My reaper was 1520 on Brel NM release, some other alts were 1500 or working up to it. Same for Brel HM release. My reaper was 1560 and fewer alts were 1540 ready for at least gates 1-2. And yet, I never cleared or even got to attempt gates 5-6 HM because for those who this game became a second job attempted it (and they've still yet to even clear it) without me and the ones I really wanted to try it with. So the ones left behind just stopped playing pretty much because they don't wanna pug it, and understandably so. I usually ran Brel HM 1-2 on 4 characters and 3-4 on 2 of those 4. Now Kayangel is here and my only character I used up the last of my resources to reach 1580. The rest of my roster will never reach that, and realizing so I don't wanna put in the time to even try.

1599340,Lost Ark,"This is a love letter to Lost Ark, a game that crept up out of nowhere and took control of my life in 2022. This game leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to me now, but there was a time where it was sweet and lovely. I wish my feelings for the game had remained strong, but that's not the world we live in, not the world I live in.

The bots are demolishing the economy, the content is unnecessarily grindy, Amazon cares little about communicating with their playerbase, and Smilegate has put every region except Korea on the back-burner. I want to keep playing this game. I want to go back to the days where I was the guild master trying my absolute hardest to support my many guild mates, who I had been together with since Tier 1, when times were simpler. I want the feeling of burnout to stop, but I am sure it never will, even if its been half a year since I played the game religiously.

Amazon will never admit that bots will never be removed and that the problem will only get worse. They'll never acknowledge that the alt grind is too much for the average player. They won't explain the reasons why they run things the way they do. This isn't the game that I signed up for. 

What do I mean by this game not being the game that I signed up for? In Korea, Lost Ark leveled the MMO scene and demolished the competition. There was a mass exodus of players from every major MMO to Lost Ark. Players were tired of games where the developers didn't communicate with its players, had horrendous grindfests, and had severe content droughts. Lost Ark turned into the very thing that MMO lovers had wanted to run away from, and it seems like there's no hope in the future as well. How did this happen? I just want to know personally because it hurts not knowing what went wrong. Legendary director Gold River leaving may have played a part in it. Or the unsolvable bot problem. Maybe Amazon deserves all of the blame? I don't know. All I know is that this is not the game that I downloaded on February 11, 2022, and I don't think it ever will be. I want to call for some sort of action, some changes, but I already gave up on that a long time ago, nothing is going to change and I accept that.

I accept that the game has problems that will never be resolved. It hurts, but I accept it. I love Lost Ark because of what it meant to me. Ultimately, I will love it no matter what path it goes down.

1599340,Lost Ark,"[b]If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you![/b]   Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead.  Excited yet?  You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job!  Wait, there's more!   If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content.  That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of!   Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside...  This is a pay to win game.  That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can.  They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that.   However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands.   I'm serious, it's beyond insanity. 

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you:  it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content.  You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will  express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up.   It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.  

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players.   All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression.   Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character.  Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too.   The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold.   What is gold good for?   The Auction House.  Upgrade items and gear.  Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals.   That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.   

What the heck are Pheons?   They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters.  The gear you wear is what determines your item level.  After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials.  Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in.   So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.

How do you get Pheons?   You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals.   How do you get blue crystals?   By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons.   Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.   

Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server.   These bots have one goal - farm gold.   Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue.   It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag.   Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.   

You see the problem yet?   Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value.  [i]Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK[/i], that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups.   Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies.  There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum.  Maybe as many as 60?

1599340,Lost Ark,"If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you! Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead. Excited yet? You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job! Wait, there's more! If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content. That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of! Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside... This is a pay to win game. That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can. They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that. However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands. I'm serious, it's beyond insanity.

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you: it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content. You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up. It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players. All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression. Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character. Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too. The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold. What is gold good for? The Auction House. Upgrade items and gear. Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals. That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.

What the heck are Pheons? They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters. The gear you wear is what determines your item level. After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials. Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in. So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.

How do you get Pheons? You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals. How do you get blue crystals? By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons. Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.

Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server. These bots have one goal - farm gold. Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue. It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag. Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.

You see the problem yet? Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value. Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK, that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups. Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies. There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum. Maybe as many as 60? I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid. Almost all of them are unnecessary.

I would not recommend this game to anyone for any reason.
Most of your gains in the game are rng. I had a 19.22% to upgrade and I failed nearly 180 times before I gave up. I also failed on a 2% chance 80 times in a row. After all those fails and no upgrades it was time to call it.

I could make a super long review going into in detail why this game is so terrible but most people just want a short answer.

Simply put, the game doesn't respect your time. It sees you as a slave expecting you to spend thousands of hours for no return.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I loved this game. The first part was a grind. Getting a character to lvl 50 felt like it took an eternity. But once I was able to join my friends on end game content, it was a blast. It all went to hell when I decided to start collecting mokoko seeds. One day I decided to sit at a breakable wall on Mount Zagoras and attack it to get the 3 hidden/ blocked collectibles. After about an hour and with the help of a random player, we got the seeds and then I got permanently banned for cheating. I went back and forth with Amazon Games customer service bots and they sent a final ""We can't share any further information about our decision, and we won't reply to further emails about the issue"". 

367 hours down the drain because I did exactly what the game developers designed when they made a wall/barrier that requires a ton of hits to break down. It is sad, but clearly they don't care how much time is invested in their product.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn't want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.

The dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.

People who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won't replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don't use the boxes.

PvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules ""No healing potions, no ultimates"" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it's my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can't do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I'll leave it as ""I'm new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being"".

Addressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don't feel it's a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That's pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don't have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it's not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.

Classes. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won't be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren't available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I'm not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn't' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.

1599340,Lost Ark,"For the new players that see the trailers for this game and think ""wow, this looks kind of fun!"", do not let the weird tags on the store page fool you.

Lost Ark is an 8-player exclusively title that costs $60 to play. 

""But"", you type on your keyboard, ""the game is free, why would I spend $60? Also, can't I play alone?""

No. Here is what will happen if you decide to not spend $60 on this game and do not have 7 friends to play with. You will get 50 hours into a game with the worst campaign, story, and characters you have ever seen with no meaningful content then quit thinking ""why do people even play this, this game sucks!"". Here's the rub: if you have not paid $60 for the South Vern powerpass and experienced the content that unlocks, you have literally not played the game. Lost Ark is not a game at this point of its life before the spot the South Vern pass drops you off at . It saves you 100 hours of the worst filler content you have ever seen. Trust me, there's no point touching this game at all without buying that pass, you will just have wasted all of your time.

But ok, let's see you put in that 100 hours legit since you're a masochist. You're raid ready now! Except you don't have 7 friends, so you're actually not raid ready ever. You see, the Lost Ark community is utter dogshit. You have never had the mispleasure of interacting with the most burned out, toxic, gatekeepy, sweaty fucks in your life before. If they aren't satisfied that you haven't put in thousands of hours in meaningless side content, thousands of dollars in money for more virtual numbers on your character, or god forbid both, you don't get to play with them. For the average player, this means you don't get to play endgame content at all.

So fuck them. Play with your friends. You don't wanna be a part of the Lost Ark community. You just want to be a person that *plays* Lost Ark. And you'll be much happier for doing so. Just run content when you and your friends are ready for it, and don't ever do anything in this game that you don't think is fun.

If you don't have $60 bucks and 7 friends (which I get it, it's hard to convince seven other people to commit $60 and part of their time every week for a multiplayer game), then play a different game honestly.

1599340,Lost Ark,"After hours of my life on this game... I've come to the sad conclusion that it can't be enjoyed.
The only thing I enjoy in this game is raiding with my friends if not for them I would have quit long ago.. I was going to put a list of pros and cons like most reviews but I am finding it hard to come up with pros aside from playing with friends but not everyone has friends that can play around the same times they can.. so I will just post the cons.

1. [Gate keeping] Players gate keep for everything in this game.. Items / your I level / your roster level / your class / your title / your pet / your card set / The crazy part is I don't blame them 1 bit because the game encourages it.. I mean think about it if you can get your raids done faster why would you not? it is not like you get anything for spending time with new players in fact you lose all the way around.. your time to play / your items / sanity.. even playing with friends can be hard because if someone has a hiccup you all die in raids and raiding is a must.. that brings me to number 2 below

2. [The Community] is very predatory you will be kicked from raids for messing up sometimes even once is enough and it don't matter if you are a new player or not..now what I mean by predatory is the high level players often sell buses to low level players or players that don't want to take the time to learn and them same high level players make alts that they use to sabotage other players raids so they can sell them buses to stay ahead in the game.. this has no sign of going away because 1 players mistakes costs everyone in raids and late game gear is locked behind them same raids.

3. [Honing] You have to hone your gear in this game to unlock content and the cost is insane.. just as an example I had an alt cost me over 250.000 gold just to gain 15 I levels.. 1475 to 1490.. you need 1490 to gain access to a raid called brelshaza.. and I didn't even count the gold I spent on getting the gear I needed to raid 60.000 which you need or you will be subjected to gate keeping.. this is over a months worth of gold raiding as a F2P player with 5 alts doing all of your raids weekly.. dealing with hard raids and a toxic community that won't let you learn unless you have friends to play with.. If I am being honest the raids are not even that hard but the community being toxic / rage quitting / sabotaging / makes them hard.. some light to raiding is they are nerfing how hard some of the raids are however they are also taking some of the gold you make out of them raids making it harder to hone up to the levels you need to get into higher level raids.

4. [Dead content] The game is filled with side quests in the form of islands you go to some of which have important things such as skill potions you need for your characters... I think it is an awesome idea to give players more to do in game.. however most of them islands need a group of players and can't be done solo.. so in the end the players that started when the game was released got to enjoy some of them islands until the player base got what they needed and the content died leaving new players or players that didn't focus on that content left out.

5. [Raiding] I like raids with my friends however some of my friends are not that good at raiding and don't have much time to sit and learn for hours so what ends up happening is we take time out to teach each other the raids this costs us entry into the higher level raids we need to progress and the items we have to use during learning time...overall setting us back weeks in progress cause raids can only be done weekly making it hard to enjoy teaching your friends or new players new raids and adding to the gate keeping that is already crazy in this game.. it is hard to keep raiding as a friends group cause honing can be lucky or unlucky setting you back or ahead not to mention time difference work / school schedule then the entry system I mentioned above... this leaves your friends or new players at the mercy of a toxic predatory community making raiding not enjoyable and gate keeping players progress stopping them from obtaining the gold/gear they need to progress in the game.

6. [Trading] Trading is locked behind a system that uses coins called pheons like a tax pheons are also used to buy your meta gear off the market however the cost is high making you not want to trade with players so you have the pheons to buy the meta gear you need to raid so you are not getting gate kept... not to mention you also can't send your alt characters gear that would be good for them cause it will still cost you pheons and pheons cost real money... pheons was a system put in place to stop bots from farming gear and trading it so that a market could exist however it stops players from helping friends or new players from obtaining the gear they need to progress driving market prices up and promoting gate keeping.

7. [Bussing] Bus/carry players.. I don't think Bussing overall is a bad thing sometimes players don't have the time to do raids on all 6 characters or they are being gate kept by the community however Bussing becomes bad when players take advantage of newer players by charging them crazy amounts of gold to pass a raid stopping them from having gold to hone and progress also stopping them from making gold by learning the raids creating a grey area where they have to pay to play or quit because depending on how long they have been bussing they will be so far behind that no one will want to help them learn or catch up leaving them gate kept.

8. [Time spent] Overall all sometimes it feels like the community traps players into playing so you don't fall behind... by gate keeping players with low roster levels or lack of titles from raids they need to progress making it so time off of the game hurts... not to mention it takes weeks/months to get the gold you need to build a meta character.. the game itself encourages you to make alt characters so you can level up your roster faster and so you will have more raids to do for gold but again this takes a lot of time to get done.. you have to take into account the fact it will cost gold to build every alt character you make before you can even use them to make gold cutting into even more of your time..not to mention each of them characters will be gate kept at some point making it take more time to get the gear they need from raids.. if you plan on playing every alt you make for profit the game will feel like a job and take up crazy amounts of your time... if you don't you will be gate kept for not having a high enough roster level and your progress will slow.

I can't recommend it to any new players knowing what I know after 1640 hours into playing...1. Raids need to be nerfed so players can't sabotage new players in hopes of selling buses... also so new players stand a chance at learning not just being kicked from party's and to cut down on the time it takes to raid when you have 6 characters to raid on. / 2. Honing cost is still way to high for a game that is losing ways to make gold Rapport/Raids / 3. Pheons have to go they don't stop bots they drive up the market and encourage gate keeping / 4. side content like the islands should be solo friendly for players that don't play much or don't have 7 friends on standby for when they do have time to play it especially since that content is important for progress / 5. Overall time it takes to get daily's done needs to be reduced as it is essential for roster level and character growth it takes way to much time to even think about side content when you have to do daily's on 6 characters / 6. Remove the ability to view other players roster levels to prevent gate keeping / 7. Remove entry costs from raids so players don't get punished for helping new players or friends learn... instead of promoting bussing / gate keeping / 8. Fix the engravings system so it has engravings we can actually use instead of just more excuses to gate keep players.",hour life sad conclusion enjoyed enjoy raiding friend quit long ago pro con review finding hard pro aside friend friend time post con 1 gate keeping player gate item roster class title pet card set crazy blame 1 bit encourages raid faster spending new player lose item sanity friend hard someone hiccup die raid raiding brings number 2 2 community predatory kicked raid messing matter new predatory high player bus low player player learn high player alt sabotage player raid bus stay ahead sign 1 player mistake cost raid late gear locked raid 3 honing hone gear unlock content cost insane example alt cost 250 000 gold gain 15 level 1475 1490 1490 gain access raid called brelshaza count gold spent gear needed raid 60 000 subjected gate keeping month worth gold raiding f2p 5 alt raid weekly dealing hard raid toxic community learn unless friend honest raid hard community toxic rage quitting sabotaging make hard light raiding nerfing hard raid taking gold raid harder hone level higher raid 4 dead content filled side quest form island important thing skill potion character awesome idea player island group player solo player started released enjoy island base needed content died leaving new player player focus content left 5 raiding raid friend friend good raiding sit learn hour end happening teach raid cost entry higher raid progress item learning week progress cause raid weekly hard enjoy teaching friend new player new raid adding gate keeping already crazy hard raiding friend group cause honing lucky unlucky ahead mention difference school schedule entry mentioned leaf friend new player mercy toxic predatory community raiding enjoyable gate keeping player progress stopping obtaining gold gear progress 6 trading trading locked us coin called pheons tax pheons meta gear market cost high trade player pheons meta gear raid gate mention send alt character gear good cause cost pheons pheons cost real pheons bot farming gear trading market exist stop player helping friend new player obtaining gear progress driving market price promoting gate keeping 7 bussing bus carry player bussing bad player raid 6 character gate community bussing bad player advantage newer player charging crazy amount gold pas raid stopping gold hone progress stopping gold learning raid creating grey pay quit depending long bussing far help learn catch leaving gate 8 spent feel community trap player fall gate keeping player low roster level lack title raid progress hurt mention take week month gold build meta encourages alt character roster faster raid gold take cost gold build alt gold cutting mention character gate gear raid plan alt profit crazy amount gate high roster progress slow recommend new player knowing 1640 hour 1 raid nerfed player sabotage new player hope selling bus new player stand chance learning kicked party cut take raid 6 character raid 2 honing cost high losing way gold rapport raid 3 pheons bot drive market encourage gate keeping 4 side content island solo friendly player 7 friend standby especially content important progress 5 take daily need reduced essential roster growth take side content daily 6 character 6 remove view player roster level prevent gate keeping 7 remove entry cost raid player punished helping new player friend learn promoting bussing gate keeping 8 fix engraving engraving excuse gate player,3,0.997

1599340,Lost Ark,"I have been playing since launch and have since put 2.5k+ hours into this game. I have held out as long as I could in hopes that this game would get better because it has a lot of positive aspects – cool classes, great combat, and a wide variety of vertical and horizontal content.

However, the game’s community is by FAR one of the worst I have experienced. To mirror some of the other reviews – people are incredibly toxic and gate-keeping is the worst I’ve seen in any MMORPG. Don’t have enough item level, engravings, or a specific title? You’re not getting into a party. If somehow you do make it into a group, be prepared to get chewed out if you make a mistake because many raids have a raid-wipe mechanic where all eight players need to be on the same page. Your average player has very little patience for wipes and will force a group quit after a few failures instead of communicating or trying to teach players how to do a raid mechanic properly. With that said, I have met a small number of helpful players in the 8.5 months playing the game but they are definitely in the minority.

Other issues I’ve seen with the game that haven’t been addressed are the rampant bots and inflation. I can’t speak for all regions but on NA West, the server I play is on like 75% bots and it’s honestly disgusting to see how many of them are running around the capital cities. AGS/Smilegate claim they are doing everything they can to combat the bots but it’s obviously not working – you see items on the auction house being sold for millions of gold constantly which is obviously real money transactions happening. The price of items and blue crystals (premium currency you can buy with real money or gold, needed to buy gear and cash shop items) is skyrocketing to a point that is just laughable. The price for 100 blue crystals exceeds that of Korean servers now because of how insanely out of control the botting problem is on NA servers. A single earring can cost 300k+ gold which is absurd when an 8-man raid only gives 3-5k on a weekly lockout. Class engraving books have tripled in price the past few months – it will now take upwards of 400k gold to get 20 legendary class engraving books, depending on what your build is. As a new player, it will be extremely difficult to catch up without at least swiping your credit card a little bit. 

The last issue I have is how prevalent RNG is in this game and maybe a non-issue for those that are accustomed to this type of game. I currently have every adventurer tome at 100% except Brelshaza for South Vern and almost every collectible at 100%, key word almost. The RNG aspect is so heavily ingrained into every aspect of the game that you could get royally screwed on certain drops for months/years if you are unlucky. For example, at time of writing this, I am still missing the Lush Reed island soul and Forpe Island sea bounty to name a couple, despite having run them every time available since launch in February 2022. Gear progression is all RNG based as well – the success rate for honing your gear to the next level drops to such a small amount (1-3%) that you could spend weeks of materials/gold just to increase one piece. 

To a lot of players I’m sure these gripes are OK and no big deal but for me personally, this is incredibly demoralizing gameplay and feels like I am wasting so much time just to fail. I’m surprised I’ve invested as much time as I have and uninstalling the game honestly feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. If you are looking to be rewarded for investing your time, look elsewhere. This is NOT a casual friendly game.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I cant recommend it for several reasons. 

At first the community is insane toxic if somebody dont get a mechanic all will flame him to the death. 
Second the game has an insane learning curve in my opinion (that leads back to the first problem in my opinion, the toxcisity, because everybody gets frustrated) 
And the last problem why i cant play this game anymore and furthermore cant recommend it to anybody is, that nobody has patience to play a game more than 15 minutes. I miss the good old days when you had to try a raid over again and again to finish it and everybody had the patience to do it. But today everything needs to be rushed and failure is unacceptable thats super sad in my opinion and destroys the fun for me at this game.

If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content. That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of! Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside... This is a pay to win game. That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can. They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that. However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands. I'm serious, it's beyond insanity.

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you: it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content. You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up. It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players. All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression. Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character. Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too. The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold. What is gold good for? The Auction House. Upgrade items and gear. Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals. That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.

What the heck are Pheons? They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters. The gear you wear is what determines your item level. After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials. Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in. So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.

How do you get Pheons? You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals. How do you get blue crystals? By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons. Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.

Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server. These bots have one goal - farm gold. Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue. It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag. Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.

You see the problem yet? Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value. Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK, that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups. Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies. There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum. Maybe as many as 60? I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid. Almost all of them are unnecessary.

There are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous ""I'd rather watch paint dry"" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you'll try to participate in, and so much more.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Let me preface this by saying this review's purpose isn’t so that I get unbanned, at this point I don’t plan to ever return and play any AGS games. This is the first time I’ve been banned on any online game and this is the point that really irks me. This is here to provide some awareness for anyone who may be interested in this game and hope that others who’ve been unfairly banned will speak out so at the very least others may be aware and AGS may actually start becoming better or competent. 

Background:
•	Over 800 hours on the account.
•	My characters and some relevant equipment are as follows (AFAIK, Gem levels may be all over the place, 1 or 2 level 7, most were 4 or 5, few 6), I don’t bus at all and I’ve only ridden on a couple busses mostly for new 1370s. Bought the Gold Pre-release founders pack on release:
•	1462.5 Paladin – 1x level 7 Gem, assorted other gems usually all under 5 as I just forged most of my gems for 2 x level 7 Gems before the ban; all legendary accessories 3/3/3/1/1
•	1430 Glaivier – level 4-6 Gems, relic accessories 4x3, 1x1
•	1415 Deathblade – level 4-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1
•	1415 Sorceress – level 4-5 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2
•	1415 Bard – level 3-4 Gems (new Powerpassed character), legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2
•	1402.5 Gunslinger – level 3-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1 or 2

Suspected Triggers for Ban:
•	I’ve been selling as much stuff as possible to try to get enough for Legendary Grudge Engraving. Recently, I merged all my Paladin Gems and got 2x level 7 Gems but both were damage Gems so I moved those to my DB to reforge and bought 1 level 7 CD gem for around 15k Gold I believe (NAE Market Price). The DB rerolled the 2x level 7 Gems and sold them for 16k list, 18k BO which both sold on the market. Also sold T3 Destruction Stones and Honing Stones.
•	Bought a Swimsuit skin with RC and sold some of the pieces on the Market for Market price (pretty heavy fluctuation during the final weeks of the sale)
•	Bought new skins for my Bard and Sorceress and replaced some of the older skins by selling on the market for market price.

Ban and Appeal Process:
I found out I was banned on Sunday at around 9 PM EST. Obviously, I could not tell what triggered my ban so I sent in an appeal request at Sunday at 9:16 PM.
I received a reply at 9:28 PM saying that my ban was permanent and the disciplinary action was merited but they did not state why I was banned apart from Cheating which still does not tell me anything. 

I sent a reply back stating I still do not know what I was accused of and I can’t provide evidence against something I do not know, noted that my characters were the ilevels above and their gems/accessories being not high value. I also noted that most of my characters had rested bonus so I probably wasn’t botting and asking for escalation and got this as automated reply saying I’ll hear back from them within 6 hours.

After that I did not hear anything back. I re-sent in an appeal on Monday and it was becoming clear that they do not read these at all and just send the same prepared responses without any review. This went on constantly so at this point I’m pretty confident that they don’t ever read these and just block you. I read on their forums that sometimes the German one may actually result in an actual person reviewing the case but same response in German. I have sent in other appeals but all had the exact same response.

Seeing as AGS refuses to even tell me why I got banned or even bother to read my appeals, the only thing that this really tells me is that the claim that Moderators read appeals is a bald-faced lie and any CM who says otherwise is perpetuating this lie.
Based on what I did on my account, I suspect someone who RMTs bought my gem or skins and I got flagged as a Gold Seller as based on what I could see, RMT is not necessarily a permanent ban. This was added in my later appeals but same response. My Steam account is an account with over 200 games and is my only used Steam account, to be a used as a Gold seller would be highly illogical. Also, I purchased a pre-release package so its an old account.

Now why am I making this review? After reading the forums and Reddit about these posts, there’s usually some people mentioning that their friends also got banned unfairly but just gave up. Seeing as some of these posts are starting to crop up more, I would implore them to make some noise about it so that AGS may finally have to act. At the very least, it can provide a warning to anyone on the fence that this may happen to them and they should be wary. 

tl;dr - highest ilvl 1462.5, couple lvl 7 gems, sold 2 lvl 7 gems and some skins on the market and got banned. Appeals get a response in 5-10 minutes upholding the ban without saying why I got banned.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Well im nearly at 2k hours without spending a single dime so let me sum it all up as an F2P.

i'll divide this to 4 sections, Pros, Cons, Neutral , Conclusion.

if you dont wanna read it all just go to Conclusion.



[h1] PROS: [/h1]

World : Lost ark has a vast and beautiful world. has around 8-9 continents (more in future) and dozen small islands, to which you can travel using the boat given to you further down the story. some are event islands, some are time based and some are PvP.

Classes : 20+ classes (a new class every i think 2 months) each having different play styles. each class has +18 different skills to choose from. and different tripods that will change a skill behaves. Good animation and audio for all of them.

Combat: Has a great combat system. at first you might be overwhelmed with everything but soon you'll understand the mechanics. 

Events: constantly gives players event rewards and boosts from events.

Reaching End game And Alt characters: after going through the story and reaching level 50, the game gives you 2 powerpass tickets used to instantly level 2 more alt characters to level 50 and more powerpass tickets further down the story plus 1 power pass and a express mission to level up your characters with every new released class so you can reach others with the new class or any other class of your choice. 

Raids: the main content of Lost Ark's end game. it is fun but challenging. 

PvP system: no matter how much you have paid in this game you are always equal to your opponent so there is only skill involved in in PvP. there are different types as well such as 1v1 Duel ,TDM , DM , siege battle , guild wars and so on.

Music: the music for some the raid are so good makes you forget what you are doing. the overall music of the open world is good too.

Update: Frequent Updates such as new content, balance patches and etc...





[h1] Cons: [/h1]

Story: its kinda boring tbh. some parts are awesome tho like the siege battle at start of the story so its not all bad but most will just skip it. ( Edit : the only story that hyped me up was the Elgacia's story. the only awesome story that i did not skip. not even the dialog) 

End game: after 5-6 hours of story you'll get to level 50, the start of end game which unlocks chaos dungeons, guardian raids, Legion Raids and so on.

Dead content: some of those said islands you'll come across need multiple people to complete but since most have done it already you wont find many people.

Leveling up: contents you unlock at level 50 give you material used for leveling up your gear. fortunately if you dont feel like doing it everyday you'll get Rest bonus which gives 66% more mats next time you do it so you wont lose that much.
your gear leveling is RNG. so are other parts of the end game leveling. specially at the higher level it takes a long time just to level one gear so be prepared.

Raid mechanics: each raid has its own mechanics which will impact how you play and it is important to understand them since some mechanics if done wrong will wipe the party. 

Gate keeping: a major problem in lost ark is gate keeping. for those who dont know it means not letting someone in the party because they are low level or have bad gear. it is understandable since people dont wanna wipe because of 1 person who didnt know the mechs but thats what prog parties are for. you can always join a prog party if needed.

Community: just like IRL there are kind people who are willing to help you and there are those who scream at you for a simple mistake. from personal experience if you make a mistake there is always that one dude who screams but the rest of the party usually defend you or try to help you ( given that you arent just trolling).

Class Balancing: Some classes are stronger than one another. its unfair that a sorcerer does 200M with one skill while my full skill rotation with Reaper does 160M.

Choosing a Name: a Nightmare.

P2W: you can swipe that card and get months of progress BUT nothing is locked behind it. a F2P with grind can get everything a P2W can. Paying is just a boost and nothing more.





[h1] Neutral: (some are based on my experience) [/h1] 

Grind: i put this here because I have never grinded that much. i usually do choas and guardians raids 2 times and rarely 3 times a week if i have rest bonus. so when some people say Lost ark is a job, i dont really get it and i have played almost everyhting available in the end game. (i say almost cuz i was busy with school and stuff so i didnt play for 4 months and still managed to catch up to other players) 

Groups and static: if you have friends you'll enjoy this game even more but that doesnt mean you wont enjoy it playing solo. so play with others if possible. find yourself a static group or guild. 

Learning the Mechanics: characters and Raid mechs are hard at first but there are awesome guides on youtube from people like (atk. Lustboy, memorizer92 , Zealsambitions) that will sum up everything so you'll understand them completely.

Developers: They completely ruined this game at the start but as of half a year ago a new development team has been fixing everything such as fatigue from doing dailies, better rewards, easier leveling system, balancing and so on.
If they continue this path Lost Ark will become better and better as time goes by.

New players Friendly? : the new team is looking out for new players. they have made it far easier for them to catch up with others so they wont feel left out. and continue doing so

Bots: this is a free to play game after all so expect bots. AGS is constantly battling bots and unlike before, you wont be seeing waves of 50-100 players all moving on the same path following a script to progress and earn gold so the botters can sell those online. ( do keep in mind they are still in the game but reduced in numbers)



 
[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

There are other things left unmentioned but lets end it here

1599340,Lost Ark,"The game itself is magnificent. Surely, it may have some mobile like feel and it does have some of the sins of F2P model, but if you play the game, you can instantly feel that it's a product of love by the development team. Fights are mechanically challenging, graphics are stunning, contents are more than enough to keep you occupied and coming back for more.

So why the negative review? Simple. The game is published and serviced by one of the worst companies I've experienced through out my over 2 decades of gaming. Amazon Games Studio.

They have done injustice to the game since pre-launch. Butchered the original version in the name of ""Westernization"". To watch the original director actually complain about what they've done, changing names of characters and applying censorship changes, on an OFFICIAL interview was simply depressing.

Game launches, guess what happens. Server overload and instability every single day. Maintenance, patching, more problems, more down time, rinse and repeat.

Economy already went to complete ruin because despite the numerous warnings against how rampant the game will be with RMT and botters without proper measures in place to deal with it preemptively. Out of 1M concurrent you see, literally 50% are suspected to be bots because according to steam accomplishment, less than 15% of players even reach the end of leveling tutorial, and how inflated the market is is simply ridiculous. When community kept warning AGS about how this will happen, they said ""they will be monitoring closely"". What a joke.

So they finally ""do something"", mass ban wave. They pay news outlets to publish articles that they're banning 1 million bot accounts and they should be praised for working hard to keep the game clean.

State of the game remains the same. Guess what though, thousands of players get caught up in false positive bans but they have no infrastructure to support the appeal process. Hell, they literally closed down call center couple weeks ago after Lost Ark's explosive launch. People get stuck in endless loop of sending ticket and receiving macro response without even getting an answer on why they got banned.

You have people getting perma banned for refunding founders pack PRIOR TO GAME LAUNCH, in many cases, to upgrade to a more expensive packs.
You have people who getting perma banned for trying to break down barrier that takes 15 minutes to break while listening to music.
You have people who getting perma banned for buying skins in Auction House because seller of the skin refunded.
You have people who getting perma banned for receiving mail attachments.

What a complete and utter shitshow. What exacerbated the situation is that initially, Community Managers tried to gather information on the community forum to help the cases get reviewed.
The next day, different CM closes down the topic.
Next day, these topics start getting deleted.

Level of unprofessionalism is simply incredible and the game really deserve better.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Sure, here is the English translation of your text:

""So, after nearly 3,475 hours of Lost Ark experiences, I am now summarizing my personal reflections.

At the release, I had no idea about the game. Through friends, I initially bought the Bronze version. Started the download, launched the game, roughly checked out all classes, and fell in love with the Sorc. After about 30 minutes of gameplay, I decided to buy the Platinum package because the game had captivated me, and I knew I would definitely stick with Lost Ark for a long time.

The grind in the game was felt early on, upgrading from T2 to T3 was quite challenging. When my first character arrived in Punika, the goal was to have my other two classes (Bard-Deathblade) there as well. From T3 onwards, the grind got worse and worse, but I had already gotten used to it, at least I had. The first weeks after Argos' release were a disaster for players without a static group, including for Valtan/Vykas/Clown and Brel. Always the same pattern, something new comes up, and you get gatekept by all the wannabe pro gamers in Lost Ark. Whether you have 5 full engravings or not, it's definitely not necessary in Valtan Hard to Clown. New players have almost no chance in the endgame, as they are quickly filtered out based on roster level and/or the corresponding title for the raid. The majority of the community is just trash and can be thrown away.

I played all raids from the beginning; raiding itself was the greatest fun factor for me. In the end, playing turned into work. From initially having 3 characters, it became 14.

Sorc: 1590
Bard: 1570
Bard2: 1555
Summoner: 1565
Glavier: 1565
Artist: 1540
And 8 more characters between 1460-1500, which eventually were only used as Lopang slaves.

I am not free to play, but it is possible as a free-to-play player to have a similar roster. Since a few in my guild are F2P, I can confirm that. Anyone claiming the game is pay-to-win has no idea.

Now to the downside of Lost Ark, in my 3475 hours, I had 3 burnouts and had to take breaks for several weeks multiple times. Lost Ark pushed me to do everything in record time. Eventually, I reached the point where I became too easily irritable if something took too long. Guardian Raids that lasted longer than 2:30 minutes were a disaster for me. Even the low raids Valtan-Vykas and Clown had to be done like on an assembly line; on average, I did 55-60 raids per week.

Today, however, I have decided to quit the game 100%. It became too much. I feel slight depression and signs of another burnout. So, I distributed the gems from all characters to my guild, deleted my equipment, and gave away my materials and everything else. So, I won't start the game again :D

And there was a small farewell party in my stronghold; I even shed some tears when I said goodbye, as I had spoken with many people for months, played with them, and met many really cool people.

Conclusion: The game is great if you don't overdo it, but you can easily feel pressured with upgrading and grinding. Over half of the community is toxic towards others. As a new player, you have almost no chance.

I hope you enjoyed my summary.

Status Update: As many have contacted me recently about my playtime, yes, I have started again. I mainly play casually now; I have been able to get my Sorc back to its original level faster than expected. Most of my playtime around the date of this review is AFK or just photoshoots or playing with friends. I tried to find something else but in vain; I tried Diablo 4, but this game just doesn't offer me the feeling like Lost Ark. That's why I decided to return, but this time with a healthy mindset :D""",english translation text nearly 3 475 hour lost ark experience summarizing personal reflection release idea friend initially bought bronze version started download launched roughly checked class fell love sorc 30 minute decided platinum package captivated knew definitely stick lost ark long grind early upgrading t2 t3 challenging arrived punika goal class bard deathblade t3 onwards grind worse worse already gotten week argo release disaster player static group including valtan vykas clown brel pattern new come gatekept wannabe pro gamers lost ark 5 engraving definitely necessary valtan hard clown new player chance endgame quickly filtered based roster corresponding title raid majority community trash thrown raid beginning raiding greatest fun factor turned initially 3 character became 14 sorc 1590 bard 1570 bard2 1555 summoner 1565 glavier 1565 artist 1540 8 character 1460 1500 eventually lopang slave possible similar roster guild f2p confirm claiming pay win idea downside lost ark 3475 hour 3 burnouts break week multiple time lost ark pushed record eventually reached became easily irritable took long guardian raid lasted longer 2 30 minute disaster low raid valtan vykas clown assembly line average 55 60 raid per week today decided quit 100 became slight depression sign burnout distributed gem character guild deleted equipment gave material else small farewell party stronghold shed tear goodbye spoken month met cool conclusion great overdo easily pressured upgrading grinding half community toxic towards others new chance hope enjoyed summary status contacted recently playtime yes started mainly casually able sorc original faster expected playtime afk photoshoots friend tried else vain tried diablo 4 offer feeling lost ark decided return healthy mindset,2,0.9694
1599340,Lost Ark,"The core gameplay of Lost Ark is fantastic. The classes have unique power fantasies and are fun, and the legion raids are some of the most fun activities in any MMO I've played. Unfortunately, I can't recommend the game since it's bogged down by everything else.

First off, Lost Ark has a severe gate-keeping problem. The game heavily encourages players to create more characters through events like the powerpass and express pass, and each new character has a set of daily and weekly activities they can do, including three legion raids per week. A total of 6 characters can earn gold from those raids, and the gold and gear reward from those raids form the bulk of gold income for an account.

Three raids on six characters is a lot of time, and public groups for them often require proof of previous raid clear experience as a result. After all, nobody wants to waste time on wipes when they have other raids, dailies, and weeklies to do.  If you don't have that visible experience in a new raid (raid titles, gear, very high item level), you potentially face hours trying to get into a group to get that visible experience to make it easier to get into groups. New players coming into the game often can reach the item level and gearing required to complete a raid, but very few experienced players want to play with them. And the game does not provide any incentive for playing with new players. The only way to do the legion raids and get the gear from them as a new player is to buy a paid carry, often using gold from the raid itself. Apart from the gold loss, a negative side effect is that players who buy carries often don't get the mechanical experience of actually doing the raids, which only get more complex and challenging.

Meaningfully progressing to the point where gate-keeping is a minor issue requires a lot of time, especially as a new player and even for the first few legion raids. This time multiplies for every character you create. I have 6 characters and doing the daily and weekly activities on them often feels like a part-time job. While rested bonuses build up for dailies you haven't done, the rewards are far less than doing them every day (75-66%), which results in slower progression. The other aspect of dailies that make it feel like a job is they're far less interesting than the raids. The main culprit is chaos dungeons. Chaos dungeons are basic add-clear dungeons which are similar to rifts from Diablo, but the mobs are far less interesting and mechanically complicated. Simply put, they're a chore. They don't encourage the kind of build-crafting and mechanical skill that legion raids do that are the most fun parts of the game. Unfortunately, they're also the most valuable, giving the most amount of materials needed to progress a character. Unfortunately, Smilegate has already said and reiterated that the requirement of doing dailies on each character will not change.

The social systems of Lost Ark is among the worst I've experienced in an MMO. While guilds exist, the game does not incentivize playing with guildmates. There's no account-wide guild membership system; each character has to join an individual guild and each guild has a low character limit. Combined with the requirement that each character's name be unique, I'm often wondering who a character belongs to. The most developed guild feature in the game is a guild shop, which rewards currency for logging on every day and doing weekly quests, which add to the list of activities needed to do on each character. The most meaningful interactions for a guild are on Discord.

A lot of the systems I've criticized have an easy way to circumvent them: by paying real money. With the currency exchange, you can trade money for gold, which allows you to buy almost everything needed to gear up your character: materials for increasing item level, high-quality gear, item quality increases, card set damage bonuses, paid raid carries, and more. Lost Ark even has packages with these items for direct sale. This is the aspect of the game that feels the most ""pay-to-win"", and it unfortunately drives the severe bot problem Lost Ark has.

Lastly, AGS and Smilegate interactions with the community is lacking. Smilegate in particular does not acknowledge the western version of the game in any way. Despite Smilegate stating they aspire to be a global game developer, it's clear they're far from it. Often AGS community managers won't know if something in a patch or major update until a few days before its released. And the major issues which elicit a sluggish and inadequate response from Smilegate, as the developer, feel as if the western version isn't a priority despite its status as one of the highest-revenue games on Steam. The most they provided to the western audience during their last major yearly presentation, LoA On, was a lackluster English translation. The description of a free reward pack as being ""for the KR region only"" was the insult to injury. This is behavior that is far from other MMO developers like Square Enix, and is in contrast to Smilegate's Korean reputation as being transparent and engaging with their community.

I can't recommend this game to a new player. Unless someone new is willing to spend an exorbitant amount of time to gear up and find guilds and parties willing to take on new players, they won't have a good time. Many friends who have similar hour counts to mine have burned out. I'll also likely take an extended break soon, and potentially leave entirely. If new players are gate-kept and experienced players quit, it doesn't feel like a trend that is healthy for the game in the long run.",core lost ark fantastic class unique power fantasy fun legion raid fun activity unfortunately recommend bogged else lost ark severe gate keeping problem heavily encourages player create character event powerpass express pas new set daily weekly activity including three legion raid per week total 6 character earn gold raid gold gear reward raid form bulk gold income three raid six character public group require proof previous raid clear result want waste wipe raid daily weekly visible new raid raid title gear high potentially face hour trying group visible easier group new player coming reach gearing required complete raid experienced player provide incentive new player legion raid gear new paid carry gold raid apart gold loss negative side effect player carry mechanical raid complex challenging meaningfully progressing gate keeping minor issue requires especially new legion raid multiplies create 6 character daily weekly activity feel rested bonus build daily reward far 75 66 result slower progression aspect daily far interesting raid culprit chaos dungeon chaos dungeon basic add clear dungeon similar rift diablo mob far interesting mechanically complicated simply chore encourage kind build crafting mechanical skill legion raid fun part unfortunately valuable giving material needed progress unfortunately smilegate already reiterated requirement daily social system lost ark worst experienced guild exist incentivize guildmates wide guild membership join individual guild guild low limit combined requirement name unique wondering belongs developed guild guild shop reward currency logging weekly quest add activity needed meaningful interaction guild discord system criticized easy circumvent paying real currency exchange trade gold allows needed gear material increasing high quality gear quality increase card set damage bonus paid raid carry lost ark package item direct sale aspect feel pay win unfortunately drive severe bot problem lost ark lastly ag smilegate interaction community lacking smilegate particular acknowledge western version despite smilegate stating aspire global developer clear far ag community manager patch major day released major issue elicit sluggish inadequate response smilegate developer western version priority despite status highest revenue game provided western audience last major yearly presentation loa lackluster english translation description reward pack kr region insult injury behavior far developer square enix contrast smilegate korean reputation transparent engaging community recommend new unless someone new willing spend exorbitant gear guild party willing new player good friend similar count mine burned extended break soon potentially leave entirely new player gate experienced player quit trend healthy long,3,0.9879
1599340,Lost Ark,"I've played enough to know what this game is and what it is not.  I will start with what it is.

LOST ARK IS: 
- Very pretty.  The graphics are appealing, even if not stunning. We have to remember that this game is not a new game. It has been out in other countries for years. At the time of it's true release though, it was top notch.

- Easy to play and navigate. It reminds me of a browser game in that it walks you through each quest and a very ""hand-holding"" kind of way. You get big map markers that tell you right where to go. You don't even need to read the dialogue of NPCs if you don't want to.

- Deeper than it seems.  Although it plays like a simple browser game. Lost Ark has plenty of systems to keep a player occupied. There are skill, crafting and even a type of reputation system that allows the player to get more advanced items and stats. There is a lot to sink your teeth into here. I could see spending more time playing with these systems than actually hacking and slashing in some circumstances,

- Mostly a true free-to-play game. A player can play all the way through Lost Ark without spending a dime. It may take longer and not be as individualized (you will be playing a cookie cutter version of each character), but it can be done. There are also ways to earn in-game currency if a person really wants to do some customization of their character's looks. There are some features that make the game a ""Pay to Progress"" game, but nothing locks you out of content so you can play it all if you have the patience.

LOST ARK IS NOT:

- Diablo. The hype train for Lost Ark seemed to be marketed toward fans of Diablo and it's hack n slash mega-loot game play, but this isn't a fair comparison. There are some superficial similarities, but fans of the Diablo franchise won't get their fix from this game. Lost Ark is much more like WoW than Diablo, but even that isn't a great comparison. 

-A game changer. As with most mega-hyped games, Lost Ark is not going to change the meta when it comes to ARPGs or RPGS. It's a fun game with some complexity, but it doesn't so much do anything new as it incorporates bits and pieces from other games and melds them together.  The wait was so very long for this game that it will take some time before honest reviews are common. There is a glamour spell on the game that will wear off in time to reveal a solid, fun, and less-innovative game than we thought.

Conclusion: It is a game that fans of the genre should try. There is nothing bad about it. The story is standard good vs evil kind of stuff. They stuff the game with pretty girls and macho boys, just as all such games seem to. It's a decent game that had zero hope of living up to the hype.

1599340,Lost Ark,"If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you! Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead. Excited yet? You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job! Wait, there's more! If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content. That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of! Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside... This is a pay to win game. That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can. They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that. However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands. I'm serious, it's beyond insanity.

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you: it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content. You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up. It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players. All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression. Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character. Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too. The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold. What is gold good for? The Auction House. Upgrade items and gear. Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals. That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.

What the heck are Pheons? They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters. The gear you wear is what determines your item level. After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials. Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in. So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.

How do you get Pheons? You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals. How do you get blue crystals? By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons. Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.

Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server. These bots have one goal - farm gold. Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue. It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag. Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.

You see the problem yet? Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value. Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK, that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups. Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies. There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum. Maybe as many as 60? I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid. Almost all of them are unnecessary.

There are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous ""I'd rather watch paint dry"" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you'll try to participate in, and so much more.

1085660,Destiny 2,"With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:

This overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.

The gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.

The game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (""Darkness Zones"" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). 

With that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (""Last Wish"" from Forsaken, ""Garden of Salvation"" from Shadowkeep, ""The Deep Stone Crypt"" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). 

Of the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)

Don't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.

Some stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.

For anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (""What are random rolls? Which do I keep?"") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. 

The fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (""Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?"") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.

If you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the ""learning the ropes"" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]

Eyes up, guardian.

Footnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:
-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.
-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.
-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. 
-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.

-----------------
TL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.

Destiny 2, an action MMO set in a single, ever-evolving world, beckons you and your friends to partake in its adventure, all at no initial cost.

    [/tr]
[/table]

[h2]Pros[/h2]
[b]1.Gunplay Par Excellence:[/b]
The gunplay is a symphony of power and precision, delivering impactful, satisfying shots. The handling feels robust, and there's an unmatched thrill in sniping an opposing guardian. While there's room for some balance improvements, the core gunplay is undeniably excellent.

[b]2.Dungeon and Raid Mastery:[/b]
The dungeons and raids seamlessly blend puzzles, combat, parkour, and epic boss battles. To conquer a raid, communication is key, particularly when your team comprises friends. However, with random team members, prepare for potential chaos.

[b]3.Exquisite Exotic Perks:[/b]
Destiny 2 shines through its exotic perks, offering a wide spectrum of abilities that can revolutionize your playstyle. From health restoration on melee kills to reflecting projectiles while sliding, these exotics enhance replayability and experimentation

[h2]Cons[/h2]
[b]1. DLC Dependency:[/b]
Although the base game is free, accessing endgame content and unique gear necessitates investing in DLCs. Playing Destiny 2 without these feels like munching on plain fries without salt – possible but significantly less satisfying.

[b]2.Lone Guardian's Lament:[/b]
For those without friends in the Destiny 2 universe, navigating endgame content can be an arduous task, often marred by random teammates who may not be on the same page. Playing Destiny alone can become monotonous, and the solo experience is, for some, mentally taxing.

[b]3. PvP Pandemonium:[/b]
The broader Destiny community may seem welcoming, but the illusion of friendliness crumbles in the crucible of ranked PvP. The prevalence of entitled, non-communicative players who vent frustration after underperforming can sour the PvP experience.

[b]4. Content Vanishing Act:[/b]
Destiny 2's practice of ""vaulting content"" – removing previously paid-for content with the promise of potential reintegration – is deeply frustrating. It's a surefire way to alienate players, as entire planets vanish, extensive storylines disappear, and certain gear becomes unobtainable.

[b]5. Matchmaking Mayhem:[/b]
Destiny 2's matchmaking can be bewildering, leading to situations where you and your friend face opponents with thousands of hours of experience, while your teammate barely contributes. Serious gameplay requires pre-made teams.

[h2] Bugs & issues[/h2]
Ghost melee attacks and unreliable revives are a source of understandable frustration. In critical moments, these issues can lead to unexpected defeats, causing irritation, anger, and even disappointment.

[h2] Technical[/h2]
With an i5 10400f, 2070 Super, 32GB RAM, and a 280Hz 1080p monitor, you can comfortably run Destiny 2 at mid-to-max settings, maintaining an average of 180fps in PvP. While occasional drops to around 140fps may occur, stability issues are rare. A decent PC setup should provide smooth performance.

[h2]Verdict: Good, but not great[/h2]
Destiny 2 offers a thrilling and enjoyable PvP experience, complemented by unique armor and weapons, as well as outstanding dungeons and raids. Yet, the game's drawbacks are too prominent to overlook, warranting a 7/10 rating. It's good but not without significant flaws.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.
I've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.
It's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.
I bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.
Forsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.
The game may be ""Free to play"" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.
Yes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:
Raids, high quality but the same ones every time
Strikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones
Dungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety
Seasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story
Crucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps
Gambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool
Seasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season
None of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.
And it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that ""by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps"" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.
And getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:
Overwhelming
Confusing
No sense of clear direction
All the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc
Why was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)
Any many more comments that made them not want to play the game.

I know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Until the senior leadership team (SLT) and Pete Parsons resigns, I see no point in continuing to play this game.

SLT are solely responsible for the current state of Destiny that has been slowly simmering up until this point. Few Examples here:

- A downright terrible and offensive Lightfall expansion (that cost $50 at launch BTW)
- Lack of consistent ritual content, it took HOW MANY YEARS AND EMPTY PROMISES to get more Crucible maps? 
- The past two or so years have had issues with power creeping and loot feels less and less meaningful each season. Why bother chasing new stuff? its too late to address this now.
- Seasonal content structure is stale and boring. People are tired of playing boring seasonal activities that irrelevant and throw away after a season. This has been a recurring thing since Season TWO.
- Nobody at Bungie can decide if the non endgame content should be hard or easy. Constant whiplash of buffs and nerfs, its impossible to keep up. 
- Predatory monetization and over abundance of micro transactions. $50 expansions with $50 deluxe editions. $20 armor sets. Like when is enough?
- Inconsistent quality of story telling and plot delivering. How can this be some sort of epic conclusion when the past 9 years have seen one good campaign (The Witch Queen) and everything was mediocre to good at best? Hell, before Beyond Light, a large chunk of the story telling was in lore books hidden away. No matter how The Final shape ends up, good or bad, will it feel fulfilling? Hell no!
- The lack of the new player experience. This has been a problem since they vaulted a bunch of content in Beyond Light. Its been over 3 years since that happened HOW is there STILL no adequate new player experience? People have been asking for this and we still have yet to see anything meaningful.


I could keep going but this is off the top of my head. I'm so tired of the ""we hear you"" and promises that never get fulfilled. SLT could have led their team of very talented developers to fix and address the game's core pain points. But they are too busy ignoring their own team's feedback and player feedback. Instead, they are figuring out what the best way to further monetize and exploit players for more money is. 

I will no longer support Destiny or Bungie until their SLT is gone. They think they know what is best for the game but they have zero idea what is needed for a healthy state of the game and refuse to change. And when their vision fails, they layoff the people who implemented their vision instead of taking responsibility. How is that fair? Destiny is one of the best examples of a ""what if"". So much missed potential due to a few individuals who seek profit and money over anything else. Look at what happened at 343i, they cleaned up shop and Halo Infinite is slowly and surely getting into a better spot. Thats what happens when you put the person who led the fix of the disastrous Master Chief Collection as studio head.

I love this game. I hate saying this as if its some sort of +1 over other people to make my opinion worth more than others, but up through Season of the Deep, I was playing every single season / content drop since the Destiny 1 beta (except season of the worthy). But I am SO tired of the constant whiplash of good times and bad times, so its time to stop for good. It shouldn't have to be this way. I have met some great people playing this game and it sucks I cannot continue to play Destiny with them. Some of my favorite gaming moments and memories are from this game.

Was sorely disappointed about the lack of content and amount of things to do. I had a good time with it, but I ultimately wrote the game off as a loss and walked away. Laughed at the thought of a year 2 season pass after getting burned so hard the first time.

2018: Pretty much forgot Destiny 2 existed.

2019: Continued forgetting Destiny 2 existed until October 1st. Decided to give New Light a try because screw it why not. I'm completely overwhelmed with how much the game has grown and the sheer amount of things to do. The game did a full 180 from what it was last time I played it.

They did this at this specific time in the month deliberately as employee benefits last only until the end of the month. A lot of employees had unvested shares because of the Sony acquisition as part of staying with the company, but now those shares go back to Bungie.

The employees found that they had been fired on the day they had to leave. Some team managers were not told who on their team had been fired. Some employees were seen crying at their desks by other employees who were also fired who have spoken up about it anonymously. Employees were not allowed to say goodbye or exchange contact details.

The ""Light and Darkness"" saga comes to an end. A sci-fi, fictional story about standing up to the darkness, to evil, and fighting for the light, for what is good. It's ironic that in the real world Bungie are the darkness getting rid of those who have been part of the company's identity for years - decades even, and who have been instrumental in shaping a lot of our favourite memories we have of Destiny. But it's over now.

We blamed Microsoft for Bungie's problems, then we blamed Activision for Bungie's problems and before we can blame Sony for Bungie's problems it's revealed that it's Bungie who are responsible for Bungie's problems and great hard-working talented people have to pay the price for bad management.

1085660,Destiny 2,"[h1]Not free to play...[/h1]
So you want to try Destiny 2? I could easily recommend trying the game out to see if it is your cup of tea; just know the free to play is a lie. Nintendo said it best, this game is truly a ""Free to Start"" game, as soon in you will be hit with pay walls for content. This game runs on 3 player and 6 player activities, keep this in mind if you are playing with friends. Now what do you get with Free to play:

7 ""Open World"" spaces
3 PvE modes
1 Competitive PvE 
3 PvP modes*
2 PvP event
2 Raids
1 Dungeon

[h1]About Bungie[/h1]
When you play a F2P, it is all about the community and the developer, not so much about the game. Bungie has proven themselves to be a worthy developer for this franchise and future ones. They care about their community enough to provide a majority of feedback changes; however they are tone deaf to certain groups in the community. Their focus has definitely shifted from PvP quite a bit since Destiny 1, most of the paid content now is PvE. To be honest a majority plays the PvE so this makes since on the business side. They are completely against gatekeeping, and want all community members to enjoy all aspects of the game. Due to how their development structure is, it can feel like updates aren't arriving in a timely manner to address feedback, which is why the community has so much ire with Bungie.
[h1]The Community[/h1]
Majority of the playerbase for this game are die hard fans of Bungie, and we know what they are capable of, and thus hold them to high standards. Because of this you'll find a majority of the community has a love/hate relationship with the game. Most players are accepting of new players, especially myself I love to show people through their first time with new content and a good majority are. However like any community there is a good portion of the population who are toxic, which has shrunk significantly with the changes Bungie has made. Gatekeeping is one of the biggest topics discussed about the community, and I can say everything you heard is true. 
[h1]The 2%[/h1]
This community has a problem with Gatekeeping content over harsh requirements and generally are xenophobic, primarily at the end-game. The 2% of the community is completely unwilling to teach or have anyone new play the game as they already formed their niches. However this behavior, has been declining massively, I play with the 2% almost regularly and can say this has declined significantly enough that new players should not see this behavior anymore; unless you are unlucky.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Bungie has a large focus on making the game-feel be the best it can be. They love to recycle content, it is kind of their thing, but they like to do it in creative ways to make it feel fresh. If it ain't broke. Most will be turned off by that, but realistically you play a Bungie game for that solid gameplay, and if they added new content that is a nice bonus. They usually take a long time to perfect this game feel, which really hampers their development time considerably. If you been looking for FPSs that ""feel"" great to play, than you came to the right place. However the physics engine is extremely dated, and is due for a massive upgrade; which Bungie is aware of physics issues. 
[h1]My recommendations[/h1]
If you get into this game and decide to purchase any expansion content, I made reviews for each one with the lens of a new player in mind. But if you want my top recommendations, I would say Lightfall or Witch Queen are great start for players, each one however has it's own focus that I'd recommend reading my reviews on. Lightfall for the gameplay, Witch Queen for the Story. 

[h1]Strikes[/h1]
Strikes are pretty mind numbing, which Bungie has realized this and have mixed in seasonal content into the playlist. However it is still possibly one of their most mind numbing experiences, closely tied to patrols
[h1]GM/Nightfalls[/h1]
Do you enjoy dying in 1 hit? Dealing with bullet spongy enemies? Than this mode is just strikes, but beefed up to ridiculous levels. GMs are gatekept heavily by both Bungie, and the community; they are the hardest activity to get into. 
[h1]Patrols/Open World[/h1]
The open world spaces can range heavily, from highly detailed with secrets, to barren wastelands with no content in them. Generally newer content has focused on keeping these areas interesting with more secrets to discover.
[h1]Crucible[/h1]
PvP has improved, however a majority of PvP in this game is making builds that ruin the fun for everyone else, with 1 hit mechanics and other annoying things. However if you are the one dishing it out, it can feel like a power trip. PvP functions similarly to arena shooters with a loadout system, no weapons appear on the map, but they try to emulate that with Heavy ammo spawns.
[h1]Gambit[/h1]
Bungie's red-headed step child game type, a competitive PvE mode. 2 Teams race to kill a boss before the other one does. The mode can be fun, but matchmaking really ruins this gametype if you cannot get good matches.
[h1]Trials[/h1]
This mode is the one you hear streamers talk about the most, the pinnacle PvP activity. This mode is generally full of sweaty try hards who gatekeep the lighthouse from anyone who dares to try to go flawless.
[h1]Iron Banner[/h1]
A timed PvP event, which honestly is when the most creative builds come out for PvP. Iron Banner is definitely an experience that I think every player should try once since it is a time when most players don't try to run ""meta"" loadouts. 
[h1]Dungeons[/h1]
Dungeons are like diet raids, they are full of puzzles that are pretty simple to comprehend and are limited to 3 players. They can give you a taste of what end-game content is like.
[h1]Raids[/h1]
The pinnacle of end-game, not as hard as other games that have ""Raid-like"" events. Each raid plays differently, I usually compare raids to playing a custom game in Halo 3, as it has the same kind of feel as one. Bungie keeps their raids relatively simple to comprehend, however they are challenging, and I recommend any new player try to do one at least once; with a team that wants to teach.

[h1]The verdict[/h1]
Since this game is ""F2P"" I can easily recommend that you try it out and see if you like it first, what do you have to lose? I can recommend Destiny 2 to anyone who is looking for a FPS game to pass time or are tired of playing shooters that just don't feel right.

1085660,Destiny 2,"The end of an era. I've wrote two reviews for this game, because of how much I enjoyed it.
One during Witch Queen's release, one during Lightfall's release.

Whilst I never recommended the game, it was purely due to the monetisation of the game, and how challenging it was for a new player to get into the game.
I have always praised the gameplay within these reviews, because to me, Destiny 2 is a very enjoyable experience, mechanically speaking.

But now I cannot recommend this game at all, due to the upper management of Bungie killing the dev team and their passion for this game.

Upper management will refuse to listen to what the devs want to implement, whilst forcing more monetisation in. They will refuse to let the devs tone back microtransactions, or focus on what the community wants, because they want to chase a bottom line.

Recently, 100 Bungie employees, 8% of the total company, were laid off because Lightfall didn't meet inflated revenue projections.

Upper management is killing this game, slowly but surely. And until that changes, I cannot recommend this game.

1085660,Destiny 2,"I love this game and have been playing since launch (I also played D1), but this review isn't for or from me.

I have heard Destiny 2 described as: ""Destiny 2 is great for people who already play Destiny 2"".

I have had 3 people I know try to get into D2, with none of them having experience with D1 or Original D2, Curse of Osiris/Warmind.
They have all had the same experience, get in and play past the tutorial and then get very overwhelmed. Be somehow overwhelmed with all the activities but underwhelmed with the loot they receive. Finally finding a gun they like and having to immediately unequip it for something else as a new player high power level guns drop as every drop, but they’re all blue so they all feel like a wet noodle during any content that matters. A big gripe a lot of them had was the loot in general. The amount of times I got ""Oh man that's a cool gun, how do I get that"" or ""Oh damn your character looks SIYUCK! How can I get that armour"" and I have had to say things like ""Oh you can't anymore it was from a past season"" or ""Oh it was a past season weapon that you could focus but now it's a random world drop so you just have to hope you get lucky enough for it to drop randomly, and then be lucky enough for it to be a decent roll. rng on rng on rng baby!"" FOMO sucks and just shouldn’t be a thing.

“Why does everything cost so much” – A dude I know. I think he meant this both DLC $$$ wise (We’ll ignore that) but also in game at the time, legendary shards and upgrade materials are a ball-ache to get if you are a casual player. With everything costing more of them and now weapon crafting being changed to have them as a cost, it’s so hard to keep up as a new light.

They have also recently made the game harder (or in their words “more rewarding”) to play. Which is fine, I love to be challenged in games. But the not-so-much loot we were already getting stayed the same. So it took longer to get the same amount of loot. But wait then we got less loot. So now we are taking longer and fighting harder enemies to get less shitty loot than we were getting before, the vast majority of which we auto-dismantle anyway. The time investment to gear reward ratio feels so bad as things are right now.

I get that bugs happen in games, but it feels like a kick in the balls as a player when bugs that effect the player in a negative way are left to simmer (without communication) for multiple seasons while bugs that benefit the player (lookin at you rahool’s dismantling shop of mystery) have action/parts disabled within a few days. Just seems to show where the priorities are.

This is one of those games where the community is incredible, the lore is spicy (although lightfall campaign?? Not sure about that one chief.) but the game just seems to be the best there is in it’s field so it is stagnating. It happens with other games/game genres, there is no competition, so they aren’t forced to improve (Don’t get me wrong strand kinda slapped). I know there have been countless “Destiny Killers” but they all end up sucking and feeling dry, at least with Destiny we can feel dry in the comfort of the game we have been playing for 5 years, more if you include D1.

EDIT:

I am making an addition to this review and keeping it as negative, heck I would make it more negative if I could. Bungie has announced that the price of the season passes going forward is going up from 1000 silver to 1200 silver, call that what you will, inflation, greed, whatever. For me that part is what it is.. It’s only 200 silver.. right… right? The thing that gets me is that Bungie is doing the scummy mobile game microtransaction schtick of not having a silver bundle that gives you that amount. So, you need 1200 Silver right? Okay cool well for $14.95AUD you can get a bundle that gives you (as it’s worded in the store) “1000 +100 BONUS”. So you are 100 silver short of being able to buy the pass? So that means you have to purchase either the next bundle up (2000 + 300 BONUS Silver for $29.95AUD). Or you have to purchase the 1100 silver bundle and one of the bundle below that one (500 Silver for $7.55AUD) Totalling your silver purchases to 1600 Silver for $22.50AUD.

This also brings me to the topic that Destiny 2 is the only game I have played that has a battle pass that doesn’t give you some of the “themed premium currency” back in the pass. COD gives you COD points back, Siege gives you credits back, Fortnite does it. You are able to purchase one battlepass, complete it and save your credits for the next one. Not in Desty 2, spend more money next season you hobo’s!

So you are spending money on the big DLC’s (Lightfall), the season passes (which now cost more), the dungeons (that are now separate, so I hope you purchased the dungeon pass or the deluxe edition). You could have purchased the Lightfall: Big Honky Big Boi Deluxe Edition that comes with the “years worth of content”, but if you are one of the many people who isn’t confident in the technical state of the game, can’t play basic strikes without it being an error code simulator, or just don’t feel confident shelling out that much money for 3 seasons of what is mystery content at this point. (Mystery content that is 100% going to be filler stuff until the next big story expansion). I don't blame you for not buying the Deluxe edition, or for not upgrading to it. I'm honestly lost rambling at this point so don't even know where to go from here.. I guess I'll reupdate this review the next time there's a development, hopefully one day I'll be able to make it a positive review.

EDIT 2:

Just a quick update to note that the latest season has been released today (May 24, 2023), resulting in a the usual big season store refresh. However, it's worth noting that this time around, there is no armour available for purchase with bright dust (the earnable in-game currency) as there usually is. Instead, this time items are only available for silver. But wait, there's more! They have introduced three new eververse bundles containing exotic weapon ornaments that come bundled with silver-exclusive shaders who knows if/when these shaders will be available without opening your wallet. There used to be such an emphasis on the fact you could do it both ways, you could earn cool looking gear/shaders in game or you could buy others with silver. The community would tell you it wasn't a big deal and you didn't have to buy it if you didn't want to, which was fair. Jump to now where.... wait..  where'd all the armour that's obtainable in-game go?

I would like to bring up the somewhat random point that SPARE RATIONS IS BACK! So your old sunset gun is now back with more rolls that you have to grind for again. Really not sure where I stand on the whole reusing weapon models thing, on one hand I get it but on the other hand it seems lazy? This season we have normal spare rations and also spooky taken ghost spare rations, also seems like a nostalgia plug, imagine all the youtube titles ""WOW SPARE RATIONS IS BACK!"" ""SPARE RATIONS PVP KING AGAIN"" etc, etc. It is immensely frustrating that they have endless creativity for Sparrows, Ghosts, Ships, and exotic ornaments, but the actual gear is mostly reissues and reskins??

The reusing gun models argument aside they really have an issue with having weapons in promotional artwork/mission launch screens that just don't exist in game?? I'm also confused because they cancelled sunsetting and are now bringing back sunset weapons with different rolls? So was it really a space issue? I get they're shuffling seasonal stuff out but at this point it just seems like a cop-out

I'm not sure if they are just trying to milk the IP for all it's worth because the final shape is coming up or because they need to show papa Sony how much money they're making. It appears that even though it was easy to blame Activision there is an increasing emphasis on monetization regardless of Bungie splitting from Activision in 2019.",love launch d1 heard destiny 2 described destiny 2 great already destiny 2 3 d2 d1 original d2 curse osiris warmind past tutorial overwhelmed somehow overwhelmed activity underwhelmed loot receive finally finding gun immediately unequip else new high power gun drop drop blue wet noodle content matter big gripe loot general time oh man cool gun oh damn look siyuck armour thing oh anymore past season oh past season weapon focus random world drop hope lucky drop randomly lucky decent roll rng rng rng fomo suck cost dude meant dlc wise ignore legendary shard upgrade material ball ache casual costing weapon crafting changed cost hard new light recently harder word rewarding fine love challenged game loot already stayed took longer loot wait loot taking longer fighting harder enemy shitty loot vast majority auto dismantle anyway investment gear reward ratio feel bad thing bug happen game feel kick ball bug effect negative left simmer communication multiple season bug benefit lookin rahool dismantling shop mystery action part disabled day priority game community incredible lore spicy lightfall campaign chief best field stagnating happens game genre competition forced improve wrong strand kinda slapped countless destiny killer sucking feeling dry destiny dry comfort 5 year include d1 addition keeping negative heck negative bungie announced price season pass forward 1000 silver 1200 silver call inflation greed whatever 200 silver get bungie scummy mobile microtransaction schtick silver bundle give 1200 silver okay cool 14 95aud bundle give worded store 1000 100 bonus 100 silver short able pas mean purchase next bundle 2000 300 bonus silver 29 95aud purchase 1100 silver bundle bundle 500 silver 7 55aud totalling silver purchase 1600 silver 22 50aud brings topic destiny 2 battle pas themed premium currency pas cod give cod point siege give credit fortnite able purchase battlepass complete save credit next desty 2 spend next season hobo spending big dlc lightfall season pass cost dungeon separate hope purchased dungeon pas deluxe edition purchased lightfall big honky big boi deluxe edition come year worth content confident technical state basic strike error code simulator confident shelling 3 season mystery content mystery content 100 filler stuff next big expansion blame buying deluxe edition upgrading honestly lost rambling guess reupdate next development hopefully able positive 2 quick note latest season released today 24 2023 resulting usual big season store refresh worth noting armour available purchase bright dust earnable currency usually item available silver wait introduced three new eververse bundle containing exotic weapon ornament bundled silver exclusive shaders know shaders available opening wallet emphasis way earn cool gear shaders others silver community tell big deal fair wait armour obtainable bring somewhat random spare ration old sunset gun roll grind stand reusing weapon model hand hand lazy season normal spare ration spooky taken ghost spare ration nostalgia plug imagine youtube title wow spare ration spare ration pvp king immensely frustrating endless creativity sparrow ghost ship exotic ornament actual gear mostly reissue reskins reusing gun model argument aside issue weapon promotional artwork mission launch screen exist confused cancelled sunsetting bringing sunset weapon different roll space issue shuffling seasonal stuff cop trying milk ip worth final shape coming papa sony appears easy blame activision increasing emphasis monetization regardless bungie splitting activision 2019,1,0.875

You buy the expansion thinking you're ready to go. And it used to be like that. Not now. You now have to buy Dungeons that come out during that expansion. Yep. You have to pay to access content that should otherwise be already in the expansion. And then add season passes on top.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Been thinking about how to make this review in the most objective way possible as i've spent way more time than the average player (5.4k+ hours on steam, plus probably around 2.5k+ between PS4 and XBOX) here. I'd love to recommend this game but it is simply not possible.

From an in-hands perspective, this is a magnificent game with probably the most polished and satisfying gunplay and abilities in the entire market. Nothing comes close and that's a fact.
The work that the teams in charge of combat, audio, music, art and visual design have done here is one of the best in the business.

Now, despite that, the game has gigantic issues that are hard to overlook once you spend a meaningful period of time with it:

[b] 1.-Addiction development [/b]

Bungie has designed the gameplay loop and its systems to develop an addictive behavior on the playerbase. It is heavily incentivized to play the game on a daily basis, or at least on a weekly basis, as it uses FOMO (Fear of missing out) to convince you about staying. 

""If you don't play this activity on this period of time, well...tough luck, this reward will come back when we decide it will come back"". This leads the player to plan their life around the time frame Bungie deems convinent to provide said rewards. You can't openly say ""well, today I'm gonna grind this activity to get this weapon/material"" if that activity or reward isn't part of the weekly rotation.

You are not the owner of your time.

If you don't care about having a competitive edge on PvP or a must-have gun or piece of armor for PvE if you use LFG methods, this point will become irrelevant as you can play the activities that you enjoy at your pace instead of feeling forced to do so.

[b] 2-""You're gonna be here...forever"" [/b]

Most of the seasonal content, if not all, is set to be delivered to the playerbase on a weekly basis until it wraps up. The issue here is that Bungie wants you to log in weekly for around 5-8 weeks if you want to keep up with what's going on but the content is so scarce that, in reality, the story could be finished in a day and the activities could be completely mastered in a week if the playerbase had the option so they could freely go play something else.

The live-service model has its good and bad things as it ensures the game will be frequently updated with new stuff every 3-4 months but it can also feel like the game has no end. For instance, The Final Shape would feel way more important if the game wrapped up there, but it's been confirmed there will be more stories and content after it but won't move on to a new game, like a Destiny 3 or something like that. Everything will keep happening on Destiny 2.

[b] 3-Schrödinger's reward system: Loot is plentiful but it also isn't. Some of it can be deemed as must-have...but it also doesn't matter [/b]

Crafting, in theory, was a great concept as it was meant to be a way to alleviate issues with RNG simply denying people of the loot they were chasing after countless grinding sessions.

Now, the problem with its implementation was the addition of [b] enhanced perks [/b] back on Witch Queen's release. This created a butterfly effect that has:
[list]
[*]Made the loot chase completely die since once you get the pattern/blueprint of a gun, every future roll of it will be immediately discarded as there is no chance of improving it.
[*]Made activities like Raids only need to be completed a handful of times to get the specific loot you want and then you can completely stop doing them, which is unfortunate as it is the best content the game provides but, at the same time, RNG exotics like Vex Mythoclast or Touch of Malice make said content frustrating as you get only a handful of tries to get them per weekly reset.
[*]Made actual endgame guns from Master Raids, Master Dungeons and Grandmaster Nightfall unable to compete with the crafted guns with enhanced perks, becoming completely irrelevant and devoiding these activities of any meaningful possible rewards, Artifice Armor is not worth the time unless you REALLY want to minmax.
[*]World loot is now worthless with no chance of having some hidden gems pop off like how the Cartesian Coordinate fusion rifle or the Truthteller grenade launcher did.
[*]General Play like Strikes or Crucible grant close to nothing other than a handful of glimmer. Their loot will mostly come from focusing engrams at the Tower.
[/list]

With that being said, the loot doesn't matter because...

[b] 4-The game has never been easier, and it will continue down that path [/b]

The latest subclass reworks and exotic armor tuning has trivialized most of the game. Bungie's response to this has been making endgame bosses with overshields, immunity phases and health gates, meaning most encounters will be unnecessarily extended even if the player/fireteam knows what they're doing. 

In the past, extending an encounter meant the player/fireteam screwed up at some point but now it is expected.

[b] 5-The core game has been neglected beyond belief [/b]

Vanguard Ops, Crucible and Gambit have received the least amount of general changes since the seasonal model was implemented back on Shadowkeep. Proof of this is the removal of several strikes and maps from both Crucible and Gambit, the addition of only 3 maps to Crucible after almost 4 years, the addition of Seasonal Battlegrounds to Vanguard Ops that are balanced around seasonal bonuses that no longer exist and complete, utter lack of attention to Gambit in any shape or form.

The weird part of this is that these 3 are the main population retainers and Bungie expects you to be there ad nauseam yet they're ignored.

The current Game Director has promised to change this, and if that happens, it would be massive for the playerbase.

[b] 6-Bungie aggressively wants your money [/b]

The amount of loot a season has normally is more prone to be in Eververse instead of the endgame. This said loot is also massively more appealing and also thrives on FOMO. The worst part of this is that prices are really high, as there will always be people willing to pay whatever it is necessary to ""look cool"". Since these people exist, Eververse is non-negotiable and no consumer-friendly changes will be made on it. Ever.

[b] 7-The game is held together by papier-mâché, macaroni and vibes [/b]

The technical side of the game has seen some of the most egregiously awful server downtimes and game-breaking bugs I have seen in the past 2 years. Tech issues happen everywhere, but when this is coupled with how the game is designed, if you miss out on a desired reward because of these issues, it leads to massive playerbase disappointment (see: The Craftening and Server Instability preventing people from getting the Igneous Hammer hand cannon in Trials of Osiris between Sep 15th through Sep 26th, 2023)

Check out the gameplay here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etQtlNT009k

Advantages:
1. The game looks very polished. Even the steps sound satisfying. It's clear what the game wants you to do but it doesn't hold your hand so you feel smart for figuring a puzzle out. The storytelling throught environment is impressive and the visuals are great.
2. It's scary! The first actual monster encounter is terrifying and even though we've seen tons of animatronic games already, this one seems to be different as the monster animations are amazing, it ducks to go through the doorway and gets in the vents. The monster's behaviour seems very promising for the upcoming chapters.
3. A very interesting mechanic (the grabby hands). It is VERY promising and I can't wait to see what the developers will come up with to surprise us. So far you can grab objects, flip objects, open doors and even softer your fall. I think this might become very interesting and complicated.
4. Cheap.

Disadvantages:
1. Bugs. Not a lot but if you like exploring (like me), you'll encounter them. You can see a couple in my video if you'd like.
2. Only 1 chapter so far. Very intriguing but not enough to tell whether the game is going to be good or not. So far seems incredible!

Overall:
I'd definitely recommend buying the game now since it has only 1 chapter. I'd rate the game now as it is 8.5 hugs till you pop / 10. I'd guess that it would get more expensive as more chapters come out so buy it asap. It's VERY promising and cool. The first chapter is short but quite impressive. Just do it, you won't regret it. Hope my feedback was useful! If it was - drop a like so it could be useful to other ppl too :3

1721470,Poppy Playtime,"The game isn't bad, as it stands now, there is only one chapter and it alone is really well made, enough to scare the shit out of most. Really nice stuff. However, I have a big problem with this game, more specifically the dev team behind it because as of now, they've released a set of video NFTs that cost WAY MORE than the game itself to create some kind of treasure hunt, remember those we had back when Scott Cawthon was making new FNAF games? Basically that but the execution is fucking awful. You need to buy a bunch of videos to piece together the evidence but you only get the final one if you pay for all of the other ones. 
NFTs do not belong in gaming, specially not like this. 
So basically, the game is pretty good but I don't trust the devs. Ended up refunding since I don't support NFTs in the slightest.

Edit: There has also been a confirmation that they basically stole creative property from the guy that made Venge. It's on Steam, and it's apparently a game way better than Poppy. There are some videos on YT talking more about that.

Edit 2: LMAO they made the game free",bad stand chapter alone scare shit nice stuff big problem specifically released set video nfts cost create kind treasure hunt remember scott cawthon new fnaf game basically execution fucking awful bunch video piece evidence final pay one nfts belong gaming specially basically pretty good trust ended refunding support nfts slightest confirmation basically stole creative property guy venge apparently poppy video yt talking 2 lmao,2,0.866

As of today, however, I have just learned that MOB Games are a load of worthless scumbags who made a game to spite someone else and is now forcing people to pay $90 just for lore, damaging the environment in the process. I have never had my hopes ripped from me so quickly for a game like this. They got too greedy too fast and I will never forgive that. 

In the end, there are those who are still going to play it, and that's fine.

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"Well, where to start?
First: Warzone, started to get bad when they changed the game map, leaving it worse than it was at the beginning of it, but it still had fun gameplay and few bugs, in addition to being optimized in a much more decent way than the original. current.
Second: The previous game started with skin trends, which was cool, because in the first game, the skins were well done and fun, for the most part, the weapons chosen for the skins were weapons that were actually usable and didn't have as many Pro Team packages.
Third: The weapons in the game really had correct damage, compared to this one, in the first warzone, you created the class with that weapon and it killed, today you create the class, one hour it kills, another time, it seems that it only shoots beans , it doesn't even kill a chicken, the weapon categories are unbalanced, the players' vests have become infinite, unless you get one of the crappy weapons that are practically insta kill, but not usable in practical terms for the game.
Fourth: the previous game had problems with cheaters, yes it did, however, there you saw the anti-cheat system working, in this one, in addition to the game being infested with cheaters, if you report it, you can end up being banned for ""false report"" , that is, the developer itself does this so that no one else reports the suspects, so as not to have the trouble to keep checking, at least that's what it looks like.
Fifth: Many, like me, spent a lot of money on skins, etc, on the other game, and what does the developer do? Throw everything in the trash, if you want something, buy it again in the current game, so far so good, it's the market, they have to make money, etc, so make decent skins, same complaint as in the second topic...
Sixth: Are we playing COD, or are we playing Fortnite, or something like that? Call of Duty is a franchise that I've been playing since 2003, having paused only in the futuristic era of the game, because in my opinion, it was horrible, and coming back in 2017 when they released COD WWII, which was bad too, but better than the futurists, now in this COD, even characters with superpowers have it, if those weapons that kill you and turn you into pieces, into lightning, explode you etc, now you have to deal with flying characters and the like, I'm sorry to say, but this game that in theory it was supposed to be for people over 18, this is becoming a game for people under 12, it just needs to cartoonize the scenario and you can now call it Call of Fortnite.
Finally, the game has serious optimization problems, it has many cheaters, many grotesque bugs, it is not fun like the previous one, the store has practically nothing decent, the devs in each update, which in theory was to improve the game, do the opposite and they shit on everything that ""worked"", the map is not bad, but it is not good enough like the first warzone, and the worst the DEVs do not decide which game mode to leave, each week or even in the same week , the game has a different mode and for those who play in a duo, they usually just get screwed.

SBMM is creating some severe issues, leading people to think there is Skill Based Damage, but it doesn't stop there. The game is completely inconsistent on a technical level. Depending on the time of the day, your shots will do a different amount of damage to AI and players, there's plenty of proof if you look around online OR simply play the game and experience the frustrations of these co-op employee ran servers.  Every patch to fix bugs that I never had, I then would get in the bug that the patch apparently ""fixed."" Meanwhile serious bugs and hacking exists, that the team closes their eyes to and they push you $20 skins.

If you want to yuck it up and shoot some people, play the free version and add it to your rotation of games. I strongly suggest that you do not pay for this game.  If you make even a reasonable wage at 20 dollars an hour, you're still pissing away 3 hours of your 40 hour paycheck, just to be disappointed and have another over-marketed failure replace this.  Not to mention, any skins or battle passes are not worth the money, due to the high level of issues, bugs, crashes, and lack of transparency with the company, etc. 

They promised their community that they were going to break the annual cycle and let this run for two years.  Some folks bought the game due to the promise - Turns out, that's a lie and the next game will be out shortly.  It was all just a ploy to get you to purchase a game that they will intentionally trash, just to hype up another dumpster fire to bring in more money next year.  

Activision does not listen to their community, nor do they care. We are ""retention numbers"", a paycheck and good for their stock listing, that's it.  I have played COD since before many of you were alive.  I have uninstalled MW2 and will not play any further COD releases in the future. I was optimistic with their new approach to a COD game, but once again, I was let down by a company that panders to whatever makes them money.

This company is in it only for your money, not to create a quality game.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"[b]To preface:[/b] [i]A lot of the issues I have with the game in its current state (as well as the state it was in when I wrote this review) have now been adressed by the developers and promises have been made to remedy those issues. But as we all know, promises are easy to make and hard to keep, so until there are actually significant improvements, this review will stay as negative (also Steam doesn't allow neutral recommendations).[/i]

Well, I've sunk over 2000 hours into this game. I've met a lot of good friends in this game's community. And until a few weeks ago, I would've wholeheartedly recommended this game to any of my friends looking for a more hardcore WW2 shooter without going down the rabbit hole of full realism.

So why the negative review?

It's really simple. Black Matter, the original developers of the game, had their issues. Their updates weren't perfect, but they at least tried to get the worst issues fixed as soon as possible via hotfixes, sometimes within a week. And they were quite tardy with content updates up to the point that stuff that was promised for 2021 wasn't even in the 2022 version, but they at least made the impression that they were working on them.

But now Team17 has taken over. Yep, the Worms NFT guys. They paid over 40 million for the IP, came in with a long-winded video in which they were talking about their devotion to historical accuracy and the player base. 

What we got was a half-baked British faction with WWI weaponry, no alternative uniforms and glaring historical inaccuracies plus a bunch of QoL issues and new bugs, and no hotfixes but an ANNOUNCEMENT that some bugs will be fixed over a month after they've been introduced. 

Now some people might say the Brit update was Black Matter's last creation before the takeover. But still, T17 deemed it fit for public consumption and released it in the state it currently is in.

Oh, and there's also been a price hike. Because new bugs cost money.

They also announced a new gamemode - with what possibly is the most abysmal, half-assed trailer you've seen north of a PS2-era cutscene that made many of the devoted players really question their dedication to the game. And judging by their track record so far, hopes for it are - as is to be expected - pretty low.

All of this does not bode well for the game's future, and similar games that are in development (Resolve, Burning Lands etc) cannot come out too quickly because it looks like the HLL ship is sinking fast, brother. And Team 17 is drilling more and more holes into the hull.

So, to sum it up: 
The game itself is fine in its basics, but declining in quality sharply lately. Still worth checking out, so maybe not dismiss it out of hand. But since all new purchases will now go directly into Team 17's pocket and he best way consumers can leave feedback for a product is with their wallets, I absolutely would not recommend paying full price for it.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"A detailed HLL review/overview |June 3 2022 

Hell Let Loose is THE best WW2 game I have played, it's less hardcore than a game such as Post Scriptum and therefore is enjoyable for casual gamers but is challenging enough to satisfy Hardcore players.
If you want to win in this game you must work together, this means running with your squad, listening to your Squad Leader and communicating often, lone wolfs generally have a lower overall score than someone who plays with his squad, kills do not count for many points but are satisfying nonetheless, especially the *tink* sound of headshots.

Before you start your HLL experience make sure you have a functioning microphone, communication wins games and you don't want to be having to stop every 10 seconds to type something.

Building ""garrisons"" in this game is super important, they are the static point at which your entire team can spawn at, they require a Squad Leader and a support player to build, the support drops ""supplies"" and the SL builds the ""garri"".
Each Squad Leader can also build an 'Outpost or OP', this is a mini garrison that only your squad can deploy on.
Enemy garrisons can be destroyed by blowing them up with  bazooka/panzerschrek/tank rounds or just dismantling them manually. Removing an enemy garrison is very important because they can only be built every 200m and thus giving your team greater map control.

You can either play as Infantry, Armour, Recon or Commander.

Infantry is the main source of aggression and defence in the game, they push the objectives, protect your tanks and cap points while also defending positions while other squads attack the point. You are awarded points when you are in enemy and friendly territory so staying back and defending captured positions nets you just as much points as attacking while also allowing you to have the defenders advantage of the enemy pushing right infront of your gun.

My personal favourite is Armor, you play as a 3 man squad (Driver, Gunner and Spotter) it is your task to eliminate enemy tanks and support the infantry, it is adrenaline filled fun and hugely exciting.
 
The driver role is much more than just ""driving"" you need to listen to your spotter who will be telling you where to position the vehicle and you also have a hull MG for infantry suppression, it is your responsibility to keep your frontal armor facing the enemy. 

The gunner is more self evident; you shoot things, but it also takes skill and patience to place a shot from 700m+ and hit the right spot to do the most damage, especially if you are outgunned by a heavier tank.

Lastly the spotter, this position is very important, you have a periscope which enables you to see the enemy from long ranges, this means you may be telling your gunner to shoot somewhere so far away he/she cannot see the target and are relying on you to use the marking system (called pinging) to see targets. The driver also relies on you to help find a path through the countryside because he only has a small window slit to see through, so again, communication is key. 
You are in overall charge of the tank and it is recommended you play the ""Tank Commander"" role from the Spotter position so you can mark targets swiftly and communicate with other leaders effectively. 

Tanks on the German side are the Puma Armored Car(50mm), Luchs light tank, (armed with 20mm autocannon) Panther medium tank (very mobile but hard hitting medium tank with a 75mm gun) and the Heavy Tiger tank (slow and methodical beast with it's massive 88mm gun)

Tanks on the Allied/Soviet Side are the Greyhound armored car (37mm gun), Stuart Light tank (37mm) the 75mm and 76mm Sherman Jumbo's, BA-10 recon car, T-34/76 and IS-1 Heavy tank. 

The recon role is a two man team consisting of a Spotter (binoculars) and a sniper who has either a 4x scope (Americans, Soviet) or a 8x scope (Germans). While there is a massive difference in zoom between the two scopes, the smaller zoom on the American/Soviet rifle allows for quicker and more aggressive up close play (100m-250m) while the german scope is cumbersome therefore encourages you to finding a nice position and picking the enemy off from 250m-500m. Recon is responsible for either helping your team push by taking out high value targets such as MG's, officers or other Recon Squads but can also slip behind the lines and destroy enemy garrisons and resource nodes (more on those later). 
Unlike regular Squads which can only place their OP two ""red squares"" back, recon can place theirs anywhere which enables deep flanks and stealth missions. 



The Squad Leader role.
Playing the SL role is rewarding but does come with a lot of responsibility, your 6 man squad is relying on you to make informed and quick decisions on a tactical level, i.e. Do you move to the exposed flank and hold it from a vantage point such as a farmhouse and prevent the enemy from streaming through, or do you be more aggressive and try to flank yourself while having to worry about your comrades being hit from that exposed flank? 
At first it can be a bit overwhelming (you have Command chat and squad chat in your ears). I would suggest you try the other roles (especially the Support role) before you attempt to play as an SL. The key to this role is communication, patience and also making snap decisions as well as taking advice from other squad members. Your main role is to push the points with your squad, flank the enemy, mark enemy movement on the map, build garrisons to support the push and communicate with other SL's and the Commander constantly, all while under fire and trying to figure out where the enemy are.


The Commander role.
The Commander is responsible for major Strategic decisions and influencing the flow of battle. The role can be played in a few different ways, some prefer to get down and dirty building defensive or offensive garrisons and being closer to the front line, whereas others prefer to sit further back and direct traffic from their map (more like an RTS game) and micromanage.

For the Commander to be effective he/she needs resources, and the only way to acquire them is for SL's to have 2 members of their squad (support for the supplies, and an engineer to build) build "" nodes"", these consist of munitions, manpower and fuel.
Munitions are used for artillery and anti-tank gun shells as well as enabling the Commander to drop ""supplies"" on a chosen position (as well as other abilities). SL's and their Squads can use these supplies to build nodes, garrisons or just to fortify a chosen area (engineers can build bunkers etc with supplies, anti-tank can build AT-guns). Manpower enables the Commander to use specific offensive/defensive abilities while fuel allows the Commander to spawn in tanks, and recon vehicles.

Naturally, if the Commander has no resources because players have not built nodes they cannot do these things, and as anyone who has played an RTS knows, No resources= no win.
It is highly advisable that you DO NOT play Commander until you are very comfortable playing the SL role, because it is much more nuanced and does require you to be a stingy bugger, you need to make hard decisions and prepare to take the blame if it back fires in your face. 
You need to delegate tactical responsibility to the SL's via the command channel, and focus on the greater strategical picture. My advice is to be firm but not a tyrant, every SL will be telling you ""we need supplies here"" or ""we need a bombing run here"", it is up to you to decide whether they actually need those things or if they could be better put to good use and send them another squad to help out instead.

You can also earn XP (and support your team) by driving supply trucks to and from the front line laden with supplies for the engineers.

This turned out to be a mammoth review and I hope it helps anyone who was sitting on the fence about buying the game, it is 100% worth it and the community (Australian at least) is very welcoming and helpful.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I have logged 29 hours so far on this game. Sure, probably not impressive. But I'm a dad, married and have a needy dog. Logging that many hours is a big deal to me because that means I successfully snuck that many hours of gameplay in. So, if you're someone like me that loves video games but has to sneak away at night after the spouse falls asleep and the kids are down for the count after 13 bed time stories, keep on reading.

I bought HLL in lieu of Battlefield 2042. I have logged many years of gameplay on the Battlefield series. But, the reviews came out and I was let down. So, I browsed and browsed for a game to play. I have experience on Squad, liked it, but it wasn't fully drawing me in. Was very complex. A fun game (definitely check it out), but there was so much going on I just couldn't commit. Hell Let Loose is very simliar to squad. So, I'mma break this down as best I can.

What I like: 

o 1 shot 1 kill, for the most part. It's hardcore. Literally. Don't worry about pumping rounds into people's bodies. One shot will do.

o Games can last for 1.5 hours, so you get REALLY into it. You have to, just so the game can end.

o It is extremely well balanced. It doesn't matter if you are level 3 and the other team is level 132. You all get the same guns. Snipers get scopes. That's it. None of this ""oh well in WW2 they had a type of red dot site"" garbage that some games do. Nah, fam. That carbine? Iron sites. That STG-44? Iron sites. That LMG? Iron sites, my guy. Which is great, because that means when you die, it wasn't from some garbage or BS. It was a legitimate kill.

o The community is fantastic. I was so lost when I joined my first server. Had no clue what was going on. I hopped into the ""recon"" squad and was the spotter. Told the dude ""Hey man. First time playing this. What do I do?"" You know what his response was? ""Not a problem man! I'll walk you through it."" This dude literally explained how this game worked for me in one match. It was fantastic. When you join regular infantry squads, I have had the same experience. ""Hey, how do I do nodes? How do I mark things?"" The community has been my favorite part. They're all there to have fun, and they hate toxic individuals. Very rarely do I encounter someone who is toxic. And if they're a dee-eye-see-kay, they usually get booted from the game.

o Are you a tank guy? You like driving around in track vehicles shooting big rounds? You can do that and not get destroyed by a squad full of rocket launcher dudes. Nah, each squad gets 1 person to have an anti tank launcher. Which means it takes coordination and team work to take down armored vehicles. Don't worry, to run a tank? You need 3 people. Everyone plays a role in the tank, not just 1 person. You need driver, gunner and tank commander. So, that helps offset the fact that they're giant beasts and gives the guys on the ground a fighting chance.

There's a couple others, but overall, this game is exactly what I was looking for. Big maps, great graphics, SO MUCH CHAOS oh man the audio! It's insane. Artillery blowing up everywhere, machine guns ripping over your head to where your screen goes blurry and you got the spins like it's St. Patty's Day and you're in Boston.

But overall, it's just the balance of the game. No squad can be overpowering and dominating. No vehicle is overpowering. It's all balanced as it should be, because neither succeed unless everyone works together.

So, if you're like me who's a sort-of-casual-player-but-also-wants-to-be-hardcore, get this game. It's a breath of fresh air from Battlefield, the community is great, and it's nice to play a game where everyone is communicating but also, for the most part, treats each other with respect.

9/10.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I have nearly 4,000 hours in this game. Team17 recently bought this game and is wholly incompetent with updating this game. There are 6 major issues.

1) Recent updates didn't fix any major outstanding bugs, and instead added new ones like a double reload animation on bolt rifles, XP not being awarded for duplicate actions, and several others. 

2)They released the British faction with historically inauthentic British uniforms, incorrect dates on loading screens, and incorrectly themed weapons like naval SMG's for infantry units and ww1 bolt rifles / machine gun during a ww2 themed game.

3) Not only was this faction historically inaccurate, but it was unbalanced in the negative. Their guns sway more than existing guns, their guns take up more screen space than existing guns (making it harder to see targets), their weapon spread across classes leaves them outgunned by the Germans, Russians, and Americans. The heavy tank for the British faction is using pre-armor overhaul driving mechanics and it's front armor isn't working properly. In short, the faction is trash. 

4) Most controversially, they increased the run speed for all infantry by 15% which allows infantry to effectively chase down heavy tanks and zigzag across open fields effectively. This change was not asked for and it has ripple effects through the game - Negatively impacting armor, small unit tactics, medic's usefulness, etc. The best part - Black Matter (the previous developers) used to have this 15% increase and in Update 8 they outlined EXACTLY WHY they lowered the run speed in the first place (it was for game balance, pacing, and to prevent zig zagging). Team17 didn't do any homework into the history of the previous developers and why game design decisions were made and instead decided to make a muck of the meta just because. 

5) Team17 also decided to add a new game mode which only can contain 50 players total instead of the 100 players total of every currently existing server. Which means people hosting servers will have to purchase an entire new server simply to host this new game mode. Never mind that the new game mode is antithetical to the premise of hell let loose in the first place and wasn't really asked for by serious players of Hell Let Loose.

6) The icing on the cake was the Devotion to Duty trailer which was so embarrassingly bad they had to take down from their official Youtube account and publicly apologize for. It still exists by PC Gamer channel if you want to look at the pure mediocrity.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"My very first game on HLL: I join a server, select the Allies, enter an open squad (yes, they can be locked) and select a machinegunner. As soon as the match begins the squad's officer asks via voip if there are any new players. I answer ""me"", ask him and my other squaddies to forgive me if I make mistakes, and the squad leader just laughs it off and tells me ""no worries, just follow my directions, keep your eyes sharp and your ears sharper and you'll do fine"". And then, we start moving towards a quaint French town called Carentan. 

""See that church at the center of the map?"", the squad leader tells us. ""Our orders are to occupy it and defend the area no matter the costs. Watch out for windows and rubble because there'll be Krauts everywhere."" And there WERE lots of Krauts in the area. I run forward in the open like a headless chicken, and a German rifleman shoots me in the torso. I crumple to the ground, as the noises all around me grow duller and duller and my vision starts to blur as life abandons me. 

""Don't let go and hang in there mate!"", the squad's medic shouts. So I wait, while the medic tosses a smoke grenade to conceal his movements, reaches my dying frame and brings me back to the realm of the living with a quick morphine shot. ""Now dive for cover! Go behind those barrels over there!"", he tells me, which I eagerly do, still bleeding out. Once behind cover, the medic pulls out the bandages and starts to apply a field dressing, while the squad leader checks the surroundings with his binoculars.

""Enemy infantry in those windows! Shoot, damn it!"", and before I ask him exactly which window, he points me a specific one in the distance. I squint my eyes as hard as I can, and notice that there are indeed a couple of indistinct shapes looking at us. I then deploy my mighty M1919 heavy machinegun, ignoring the gunshots that plink all around me, and start laying down a withering hail of suppressive fire against that and nearby windows. I doubted I ever got a single kraut, but that wasn't what mattered - what mattered was that the jerries had no way of peeking out of those windows without getting mulched. With me supporting their advance, the remainder of my squad moves towards the building under the cover of smoke grenades, while our riflemen toss as many grenades inside the windows as they can. I hear gunshots coming from the buildings, a couple of players curse as they get downed while the squad leader shouts ""I've got 'em, I've got 'em! Come here gunner, we need your mg!"" 

I make a mad dash towards the building right as a hail of enemy machinegun fire is poured into the smoke, not aiming at anybody in particular but still managing to hit me - again - and cause me to bleed. Nevertheless, I manage to get inside the building and get the medic to patch me up again. ""This is becoming a habit, mate. I should start to charge you for every dressing"", he jokes. We both laugh, at least until a kraut tosses a grenade inside a nearby window, something the medic does not notice. ""Grenade right behind you! Run!"", I yell at him. We both run as far away from that room as possible right as the grenade goes off, I emerge unscathed from the blast but the medic is hit and starts bleeding. ""Cover me while I patch myself up"", he asks me, but right at that moment one of our squaddies who was garrisoning the building's ground floor yells ""OH s**t, they're insi-"" before an SMG burst causes him to scream. Realizing that there's only one way up the building and that I am right in front of the stairs, I lay on the ground and deploy my machinegun yet again. A kraut climbs the stairs and runs right in front of my machinegun, getting riddled with bullets and falling on the spot. Two more krauts enter after him, both of which get similarly cut down while I yell ""they're coming! Right up the stairs!"". A friendly rifleman arrives, tosses a couple of grenades down the stairs, and I see torn human limbs flying everywhere. ""Germs're sanitized"", he shouts back. The squad leader laughs it off, congratulates us both, and then orders us to keep marching towards the church at the center of Carentan. It's only 100 meters away from our position, but due to a german Tiger parked right in front of it and at least two German platoons, it might as well be miles and miles away.

The Tiger is relentless in its attempts to kill every single yank its spotter sees. At least until a Sherman outflanks and destroys it with its powerful 76 mm gun. Suddenly the tide of the battle has been turned, and the germans are the ones desperately scrambling away from that hulk of steel on tracks, falling back inside the church. Around the church, artillery fire starts falling on the battlefield like rain, tearing to pieces any soldier unfortunate enough to get hit. Undaunted, our assault specialist throws a couple of smoke grenades before getting cut down by submachinegun fire. His heroic sacrifice allows us to enter inside the church in relative safety and engage the last kraut holdouts in a desperate close quarters battle they are hopelessly outmatched for due to their bolt-action rifles and the elevated number of automatic and semi-automatic firearms we possess. 

At long last, the church of Carentan has fallen into Allied hands, but we do not even have the time to pat on each other's shoulders that a massive artillerly barrage rains all around the church. Allied soldiers who aren't quick or lucky enough to get inside are pulverized by the concentrated explosive fire, the sherman that was covering us gets blown to smithereens, and all that's left to defend the capture point is our 5-men squad and a rifleman from another platoon who somehow made it to the church by the skin of his teeth. 

""They're couterattacking. Run for the bell tower!"", our squad leader orders us. We dash for the church's bell tower like madmen, while the rifleman straggler tosses a couple of grenades to cover our retreat. Finally at the top of the bell tower, I realize that it is spacious enough to give us ample room for manoeuvers, gives us a very nice overlook of the entire town, and has only one way in or out. ""Defend the bell tower at all costs, G*ddammit!"", I hear the squad leader scream. Thus, I pick a spot with a clean line of sight to the stairs and deploy my trusty machinegun again. 

Kraut soldiers start coming our way, in unorganized waves that get mercilessly scythed down at first, and in coordinated attacks with grenades, smoke grenades and submachinegunners later. Me and the straggler get shot again, but the medic in our team quickly bandages up again. It is only in that moment that I realise my machinegun is completely out of ammo. ""Out of ammo!"", I yell to my squaddies, which prompts the straggler to drop an ammo box right next to me. Thanking him, I proceed to restock while the Germans keep on assaulting our position. The situation grows more and more desperate until, at long last, it happens.

Allied reinforcements arrive, three whole platoons of soldiers supporter by a Sherman Jumbo. Realising that they have been beaten, the krauts cease their attempts to storm the bell tower and focus on the attackers. It is at that moment that our squad leader orders us on the offensive. With the desperation that only a cornered animal can muster, we toss the very last two grenades we have down the stairway and catch the german defenders in a devastating pincer attack. The church of Carentan is now ours once again, for real this time. The squad leader congratulates us all, me in particular. ""You did very well for a first timer, mate"" - he tells me - ""now try to keep it up with the two remaining capture points. Let's go!""

686810,Hell Let Loose,"This review is written from the perspective of someone who has predominantly played Battlefield, and only Battlefield, since 1942 came out when I was in high school. Therefore it draws heavily on comparison between the two games, not to try to contribute to any kind of rivalry, but because it's really my only frame of reference. I'm in my mid-30s with a full-time job, so most would probably consider me a filthy casual, but I've been playing long enough to not be completely clueless.

With that said:

Hell Let Loose is the kind of epic scale, cooperative shooter that I always wanted Battlefield to be. When BF2042 came out and abandoned many of the core ideas that drew me to the series initially, I turned to Hell Let Loose out of desperation. I'm glad I did, because HLL is chock-full of those ostensibly ""only in Battlefield"" moments that keep you coming back.

If you're coming to the game from Battlefield like me, it's important to note that this is a far less arcade-y, far more strategic game. When I got started, I was constantly getting one-shotted a few seconds after spawning. Because getting it wrong is so punishing, HLL forces you to learn about good positioning and battlefield awareness. In fact, I noticed that after a few months of playing HLL that when I went back to BFV, my play had improved significantly. While definitely more hardcore than Battlefield, once I adapted I didn't find gameplay significantly more difficult or tedious, or less action-packed.

Is the game perfect? No, definitely not. It's not as polished as a AAA game, the graphics are good but not spectacular, performance isn't always great, and many of the mechanics are boring and/or frustrating (artillery, resource nodes). But the most significant factor that has made it easy to look past these complaints is the awesome community.

I had not played other, more hardcore shooters (like Squad or Post Scriptum) before, but the veterans I played with were friendly and helpful and helped me quickly acclimate. While I regularly play with a friend, unlike in Battlefield, it's not a night and day different experience between squadding up with friends and squadding up with randoms. Mic use is prevalent (in fact, I wouldn't recommend playing without one) and I've had many, many games on public servers with a full squad communicating and working together. It's awesome. 

I'll end with a tip about the game that I wish I had known before I started. Obviously, it's not a game that you win by K/D ratio alone, but then neither is Battlefield. But unlike Breakthrough or Frontlines, it's not even really about attacking or defending cap points, either. While these things are all obviously important components, at its heart this is really a game about SPAWN POINTS: building your own (garrisons, outposts) and finding and destroying the enemy's. Without actively prioritizing both of these things, I rarely see teams win, even if they're doing everything else correctly.

In short, this game saved me from the pit of sadness I experienced after the disappointment that was BF2042. I've played a ton over the past few months, and almost every game is fresh, dynamic and chaotic. It's taken on the mantle of delivering the large-scale, historical combined arms combat experience it seems DICE is no longer able to deliver. In many ways, I consider it the true spiritual successor to the original Battlefield 1942 I fell in love with so many years ago.",written perspective someone predominantly battlefield battlefield 1942 high school draw heavily comparison game contribute kind rivalry frame reference mid 30 probably consider filthy casual long completely clueless hell loose kind epic scale cooperative shooter wanted battlefield bf2042 abandoned core idea drew series initially turned hell loose desperation glad hll chock ostensibly battlefield moment coming coming battlefield important note far arcade far strategic started constantly shotted second spawning wrong punishing hll force learn good positioning battlefield awareness noticed month hll bfv improved significantly definitely hardcore battlefield adapted significantly difficult tedious action packed perfect definitely polished aaa graphic good spectacular performance great mechanic boring frustrating artillery resource node significant factor easy look past complaint awesome community hardcore shooter squad post scriptum veteran friendly helpful helped quickly acclimate regularly friend unlike battlefield night different squadding friend squadding randoms mic prevalent recommend game public server squad communicating working awesome tip wish known started obviously win k ratio alone neither battlefield unlike breakthrough frontlines attacking defending cap point thing obviously important component heart spawn point building garrison outpost finding destroying enemy actively prioritizing thing rarely team win else correctly short saved pit sadness experienced disappointment bf2042 ton past month fresh dynamic chaotic taken mantle delivering large scale historical combined arm combat dice longer able deliver way consider true spiritual successor original battlefield 1942 fell love year ago,1,0.7523
686810,Hell Let Loose,"(This review is mostly about the recent update 14 and the acquisition of the Hell Let Loose brand by Team17, and it may change over time based on future updates and insights.)

Black Matter, the former developer, has crafted something truly unique in the gaming market with Hell Let Loose, setting it apart from other games with its distinctiveness, tactical elements, and deliberate, slow-paced gameplay.

The former developers had a vision that they expanded over time through numerous changes and improvements. Although the game gradually shifted from its original Kickstarter vision to a more ""arcadish""-style shooter and had to sacrifice some historical authenticity for balance reasons, Hell Let Loose remained a passion project by Black Matter, with its unique charm and great attention to detail. Black Matter had also the reputation to maintained a close relationship with the community. This endeared Hell Let Loose to many longtime players who loved and shared the game.

Since the acquisition by Team17 and the release of the recent Update 14, noticeable changes have taken place in Hell Let Loose. These changes have sparked intense debates about the game's future and the direction that Team17 intends to steer Hell Let Loose towards.

Issues began to arise shortly after Team17 took over with the 13.5 ""health"" update. This update not only introduced questionable and unwanted design changes and animation replacements, which the community considered not only worse than the previous one but also unnecessary and low priority and also brought persistent bugs that could have been identified, avoided, and resolved through intense testing before launch.

The recently released Update 14 and the lack of a testing phase prior to its implementation is already demonstrating noticeable impact:

- During the beta stage, Black Matter made an adjustment to the sprint speed in order to balance the game flow and prevent what is commonly referred to as ""Zig-Zagging"" or ""Mosquito"" movements. The game does not feature an inertia or stamina system, enabling players to sprint indefinitely. The previous developer opposed the implementation of such a system and instead opted to adjust the speed as a compromise.

The re-implemented higher sprint speed with this update (which is also higher than the beta speed as many already figured out) not only reintroduces the ""Zig-Zagging"" Issue. 
The game has also evolved around the adjusted sprinting speed, which brings additional issues to other aspects in the game that still operate at different pace and were adjusted in response to it, such as vehicles, tanks, spawns, and certain weapon types. 

Now, for example, it is possible to catch up to a medium tank that is in its highest gear and traveling at maximum speed, all while continuously sprinting.

All these aspects should logically be upscaled for balance reasons, but remained untouched by Team17, which could have been avoided through an intensive testing phase before launch.
There were also no information given by Team17 regarding why this change was implemented or considered priority.

- The current repetitive spamming and exploiting of the new dive-to-prone in mid-animation (dolphin dive) introduces questionable movement into the game. These techniques not only provide unfair advantages but also feel completely out of place.

The update also raises questions about its design choices and appears to be poorly shaped and optimized, to name a few examples:

- The new British weapons exhibit noticeable weapon sway during side-to-side movement and have bulky sights that obstruct a significant portion of the vision. This implementation is completely unique and only occurs with British weapons; it does not happen in such extent on any of the German, American, or Soviet weapons, as they were implemented under Black Matter and feels completely inappropriate and inconsistence in the game.

- According to many players, many weapons of the new British faction are historically inaccurate, something that would have been unthinkable under Black Matter's careful research and dedication to presenting the weapons and factions in the game as historically accurate as possible. 

- The driver controls of the British heavy Firefly are reminiscent of the controls of the medium Sherman prior to Update 10 (when all armor in the game was updated). It appears that Team17 used outdated code for the Firefly, neglecting to bring it up to par with the other tanks in the game. It is also possible right now to penetrate its front with a medium tank.

And again, persistent and annoying bugs:

- Incorrect amount of XP rewarded at the end of the game.
- Holding the tab key or opening the map cancels certain actions in the game.
- Overall network problems, with many players complaining about server connection losses and rubberbanding issues.

Many of the current issues raise the question of whether there was any QA prior to the release and if the new developer truly comprehends every aspect of their own game and shares the same vision as Black Matter, which has been cherished and loved by many long-time veteran players over the years.

Some decisions Team17 also made to the game deeply split the community in an extent, which I never have expierenced with any other update under the old developer Black Matter. 

Prior to Update 14/13.5, Hell Let Loose was far from being a perfect game and needed urgent optimization and adjustments, but the current state of the game introduces unnecessary additions, which not only bring new issues to the game, but should also have lower priority in comparison.

In case someone wonders, although they announced the revert of the speed change with an upcoming update and also mentioned an overhaul of many issues with the British forces in the subsequent patch, this review will remain negative until these announcements are actually implemented.

Always remember that actions speak louder than words. 

But it was a necessary first step to make that overdue announcement in the latest dev brief.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Seriously the best WW2 shooter (aka PTSD simulator) I've ever played. COD WW2 and Battlefield V were absolute jokes and this game puts them to shame. This game is for everyone: milsim lovers, casual players, WW2 history buffs, etc. Do yourself a favor and get it.

Note: To make the game run better you need to do 2 things:

1). Click on the Settings cogwheel to the right of the game's Play button in your Steam Library --> Properties --> General --> in the Launch Options put: -dx12 -USEALLAVAILABLECORES

2).*Do this step AFTER already setting all your in-game graphics options* 
Go to C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\HLL\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor and open GameUserSettings.ini. with Notepad. Find the FrameRateLimit value (you can search for it by pressing CTRL+F) and change it to whatever your monitor's refresh rate is (mine for example is 165hz, so I would change it to 165. This will tell the game to run at a maximum of 165 fps). Then click File --> Save. After this you need to right click the file and go to Properties. Next to ""Attributes"", checkmark ""Read-only"" and click Apply.

The reason for doing this is every time the game starts up it tries to set the framerate limit back to 60 fps, so if you don't do this step you are just gonna be locked at a maximum of 60 fps. Also, when you change GameUserSettings.ini to be Read-only the game can't change the framerate back to 60; it can only read the file and then it will use whatever you put in for the framerate limit. If you need to change any of your graphics settings you will need to uncheck Read-only so the game can save the settings to the file. Make sure the framerate limit is correct before re-checking Read-only.

Optional bonus fix: Watching the intro movies every time the game starts up is annoying, so if you want the game to skip them go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hell Let Loose\HLL\Content and rename the Movies folder to ""Movies (rename to just Movies to enable intro movies)"". Alternatively you can just delete the folder.

Hope this helps! :D",seriously best ww2 shooter aka ptsd simulator cod ww2 battlefield v absolute joke put shame milsim lover casual player ww2 history buff favor note 2 thing 1 click setting cogwheel button library property general launch option dx12 useallavailablecores 2 already graphic option c user user appdata local hll saved config windowsnoeditor open gameusersettings ini notepad frameratelimit value search pressing ctrl f whatever monitor refresh rate mine example 165hz 165 tell maximum 165 fps click file save click file property next attribute checkmark read click apply start try set framerate limit 60 fps gon na locked maximum 60 fps gameusersettings ini read framerate 60 read file whatever framerate limit graphic setting uncheck read save setting file framerate limit correct checking read optional bonus fix watching intro movie start annoying skip c program file x86 steamapps common hell loose hll content rename movie folder movie rename movie enable intro movie alternatively delete folder hope help,3,0.9545

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Team17's inherent ineptitude and complete lack of a stakeholder engagement strategy is on full display following U14. As a community owner and server provider, I am extremely disappointed with the level of communication we've had through official channels both prior to game updates/patches, and afterwards when we've encountered issues. 

Communities such as mine form the backbone of the broader Hell Let Loose community. We host 6 servers across three regions ($780 AUD/month), attract and retain new players, promote the game to our broader audience, and contribute to the game's social fabric. To say I am disappointed that I cannot elicit answers from Team17 on the most basic hosting questions is an understatement. 

The lack of a PTE (or anything outside of developer QA) prior to the latest updates is nonsensical, and it really shows in U14. Other reviews have articulated the myriad of bugs better than I can, but needless to say, the amount and severity of the bugs is unacceptable for an established $70 game made by a large studio. The QA processes need an overhaul, and desperately needs broader community involvement. 

Invest in your key stakeholders as we have invested in your game.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I've been compelled to write this review because I'm tired of seeing all these jaded vets rage on and on about how the game is dying despite being part of the problem themselves. There will be a TLDR, otherwise here we go.

This game is a good game. Is it a great game? No. Is it a bad game? No. It is a solid good title if you are looking for a game that is not a twitch, run and gun shooter, but also don't really have the patience to learn to play something like ARMA III. This game is all about team play and communication. If you can't do either of these things this game is not for you. Having a mic is pretty much required if you want to play in anything other than a regular infantry squad, and even then you are putting your team at a severe disadvantage by not having one. The game is strongly in favor of being historically accurate (with some minor tweaks for gameplay reasons), so much so that the maps you play on are straight up recreations of the real life locations from back during the years of World War II. The various fronts, uniforms, and sounds this game uses to create its atmosphere is awesome. When you're in the shit with your face in the dirt you honestly get scared from how intense it all can be. Players will even do some light hearted roleplay over proximity when they're calling for a medic which can get pretty funny.

This game is slow and the gameplay reflects this. The fact that the two game modes (Warfare and Offensive) can last for a whole 1 hour 30 minutes or 2 hours respectively frequently speaks to this. You will be running for minutes on end a lot. You will be dying a lot. Respawn waves often take 20+ seconds depending on where you spawn. Capturing points takes 2 minutes and the enemy can stop you very easily. There will be many times where you will be shot, burned, blown up, or knifed and you will never see your attacker. There will be times where you will never know where the enemy is coming from. There will be times where you will go half an hour without a single kill, or maybe even a whole game. There will be times when you push the enemy back to their last point only for everything to fall apart on that final push and suddenly you are the one on your last point.

Then there will be times where you kill 20 people all by yourself. There will be times you singlehandedly turn the tide of a match with one spawn point, one kill, one explosion. There will be times where you work with your squad to accomplish an objective that allows another squad to accomplish theirs which allows the commander to do his thing to clinch you the game. There will be times where you fight for every bloody inch of a point for 30 minutes and then finally come out on top. There will be times where you fight over the midpoint the whole game and it comes down to the literal second on the timer, and then everyone cheers when you successfully cap. There will be times when you lose, but you won't care because the enemy played so well and your team matched them blow for blow that it felt like you didn't lose anything at all. There will be times when you fight an epic last stand and you just manage to beat the clock that it makes you feel like you really are fighting a war.

Hell Let Loose is not without its issues. Medics are alright, but they could be better, the artillery system needs changes in how it affects gameplay (although personally that issue is way down on the list), the British faction is kind of a mess, there are some bugs still stubbornly around, the flamethrower is underpowered, and collision (especially driving) on certain objects is really annoying. But you often forget about a lot of this when your charging towards the point and people are blowing up around you and machine guns are laying down suppressive fire and you finally reach the trenches and sweep through them killing everyone in your path. Those cinematic moments straight out of Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan is what you play for.

Sometimes you will hate this game and wonder why you wasted your time on such a hopeless match with such idiotic teammates. Other times you will love it and wish you could play with the guys you met in that game forever. The lows can be really low, but the highs can be really high.

There are those that say this game is going down the drain and this is not a true. Some of this game's veteran community has become extremely jaded over the past year and a half or so for a variety of reasons. Some of them are warranted and some of them aren't. When I first got this game back in December of 2021 the community was awesome. Never met such nice and patient people so consistently in a game about brutally murdering each other during the worst war of human history. This community is no longer that most of the time. It is full of veterans who are no longer understanding of new players. It is full of servers run by admins who think they are always right, who can't be challenged at all lest their fragile egos crack. Bickering is frequent, arguments and name calling are plenty, roaming bands of clan tags will constantly complain and heckle in chat, and most people don't want to lead teams because they don't want command screaming in their ear constantly the whole game.

Not all veterans are like this, but most of the whining does not come from the new players because these vets constantly scare them off with their horrid attitudes and elitism. It's like watching a CoD lobby unfold over the course of an hour and a half. There are those who still try to make the game as enjoyable as possible (shout out to McBluffin and his crew, go check them out and join their discord awesome people), but they are unfortunately the minority of interactions I see nowadays. I will never forget teaching a new player how to tank and him telling me at the end of the match ""Hey, thanks for teaching me. I was gonna drop this game because of the previous crew I was working with, but you guys made me change my mind.""

To all the new players or prospective buyers there are kind veterans out there, so stick it out. It is worth it, trust me. Once you find the right group this game is like magic (and drugs), you will never want to stop playing. This game is worth your money. The Team17 take over has been bumpy regarding the release of U14 and the ""trailer"", but this game is far from dead. Most of the bugs seen nowadays are legacy bugs from when Black Matter was still developing (something the vets will neglect to tell you due to their hate boners) and Team17 is currently ironing them out. They've already tackled/fixed quite a few and I am hopeful that they will figure the rest out soon. This game is in no worse a state than it was a year and a half ago, and is no worse off than when Black Matter was developing. So please, give this game a try. It will surprise you. I know it surprised me.

TLDR: This game is solid. It's got problems concerning various longstanding bugs and certain systems need attention, but they are being worked on. Its got great atmosphere and some real cinematic moments. Its had some bumpy trials since Team17 took over, but they have smoothed them out for the most part. Some of the veteran community could use a real attitude adjustment, but not everyone is crotchety. Its not great, its not terrible, but it is good and worth your time. Give this game a try, hop on with some buddies or find some of your own in-game and go win the war. 7/10",compelled write tired seeing jaded vet rage dying despite problem otherwise good great bad solid good title twitch gun shooter patience learn arma iii communication thing mic pretty required regular infantry squad putting severe disadvantage strongly favor historically accurate minor tweak reason map straight recreation real life location year world war ii various front uniform sound us create atmosphere awesome shit face dirt honestly scared intense player light hearted roleplay proximity calling medic pretty funny slow reflects mode warfare offensive last 1 30 minute 2 hour respectively frequently speaks running minute dying respawn wave 20 second depending spawn capturing point take 2 minute enemy easily time shot burned blown knifed attacker time enemy coming time half single kill maybe time push enemy last fall apart final push suddenly last time kill 20 time singlehandedly turn tide spawn kill explosion time squad accomplish objective allows squad accomplish allows commander clinch time fight bloody inch 30 minute finally top time fight midpoint come literal timer cheer successfully cap time lose care enemy matched blow blow lose time fight epic last stand manage beat clock make fighting war hell loose issue medic alright artillery need change affect personally issue british faction kind mess bug stubbornly flamethrower underpowered collision especially driving certain object annoying forget charging towards blowing machine gun laying suppressive fire finally reach trench sweep killing path cinematic moment straight band brother saving private ryan hate wonder wasted hopeless idiotic teammate time love wish guy met forever low low high high drain true veteran community extremely jaded past half variety reason warranted december 2021 community awesome met nice patient consistently brutally murdering worst war human history community longer veteran longer understanding new player server admins challenged lest fragile ego crack bickering frequent argument name calling plenty roaming band clan tag constantly complain heckle chat lead team command screaming ear constantly veteran whining new player vet constantly scare horrid attitude elitism watching cod lobby unfold course half enjoyable possible shout mcbluffin crew check join discord awesome unfortunately minority interaction nowadays forget teaching new tank telling hey thanks teaching gon na drop previous crew working guy mind new player prospective buyer kind veteran stick worth trust group magic drug worth team17 bumpy regarding release u14 trailer far dead bug nowadays legacy bug black matter developing vet neglect tell due hate boner team17 currently ironing already tackled fixed hopeful figure rest soon worse state half ago worse black matter developing please surprise surprised solid problem concerning various longstanding bug certain system attention worked great atmosphere real cinematic moment bumpy trial team17 took smoothed veteran community real attitude adjustment crotchety great terrible good worth hop buddy win war 7 10,3,-0.9978
686810,Hell Let Loose,"// Please scroll down to ""EDIT #3"" - I still like the game, but the devs have dropped the ball in a few ways

For an early access game, Hell Let Loose does everything right.

This is the best modern WW2 shooter on the market IMO. You have the pacing/action of Red Orchestra/Rising Storm with the tactical play of Squad and PS.

Unlike Squad and PS, you won't have 30 minute breaks between fighting and won't have to wait 15+ minutes after the match starts to fight. The maps are large enough, but their design encourages players to get into the action quickly, while still retaining a very important tactical meta. That meta doesn't just include field tactics such as flanking, defending, finding superior firing positions, etc., but also a Commander role which leads your team and has the power to call supply drops, strafing runs, and bombing runs.

Armor can dominate the battlefield if used appropriately, and player-controlled artillery guns can wreak havoc on enemy positions. The experience of being an infantryman while tactically pushing forward alongside armor and a platoon's worth of soldiers, while being hailed with artillery and enemy small arms fire, is really a sight to see.


There is both role and career progression that unlocks authentically-appropriate cosmetics, FOR FREE. No MTX, no lootboxes, you can only earn these items by playing the game.

The devs post updates almost weekly; some are small, and some are quite large.

There are 5 completed maps on live servers, 1 more is being released within the next few weeks, and they stated they have 3 additional maps in the current development pipeline (community believes at least one of these is Carentan). (edit: I think it's more like 10 or 11 maps at this point, with plenty more on the way)

Graphics are surely good enough. Audio design and animations could use some reworking, which is exactly what is happening. The current audio for weapons and animations for weapons/movement are being upgraded significantly at the moment, and this update will be pushed to player clients within the next few months.

The devs have stated they intend to include the Asian theatre (likely US-Japanese) and Eastern Front. 

If you were disappointed by BFV, this game might be for you. It doesn't exactly play like BF, it isn't quite a sandbox. And you really really need to work with your team. Having a mic is preferable, but most leaders in-game will be OK with your presence as long as you can understand/follow orders and occasionally type in the chat.

Very bright future ahead for HLL, and it's already shining quite a bit IMO.

I rate HLL in its current state an 8.5/10, and I believe the release product will be truly amazing.

EDIT #1: Changed 4 maps to 5 maps.

EDIT #2: Adding performance information I posted in another thread -

i7 3820
EVGA GTX 1080 FTW
16GB 2333mhz
850 EVO SSD
1440p

Almost all maxed settings, slightly higher than default FOV, and two settings on Medium - I think one is Shadows and I forget the other. FX/textures are definitely kept maxed. Also using FXAA. And setting corpse despawn to lowest possible.

Steady 60 - 90, drops to 40-45 with heavy action/lots of players. Pretty playable, it's not like a twitch reaction shooter like CoD that often, though I still would like a better processor. But due to Intel's annoying socket release I'm stuck with this until I get a fully new PC.

EDIT #3: Well, things have faltered slightly. Since I last updated this review, the devs have added MTX and a console version. Pacing of updates has slowed down as well, and the game suffers from long periods of imbalance in which everyone (including the devs) agree certain features aren't working well, but they refuse to diverge from their ""once every 5 to 6 months"" patch schedule.

Example: they are deactivating the Commander's Final Stand ability in the upcoming early December update (U11)  - this has literally been publicly known to be exploitable for YEARS.

It's still a great game, but there are rough edges that will likely never be sorted out.

-Create new squad because all of the others are locked
-Get flamed by an experienced player who says I have no business in being a squad lead at level 10.
-Shoot the veteran, find another server
-Create THE H squad, because its unlocked everyone joins
-Get ignored by the commander for the duration of the game (refusing to drop supplies for garrison,etc) due to lack of experience.
-Give the squad the order to defend WN70. Squad listens to every word, they're as ""inexperienced"" as I am.
-Battle is in stalemate, Americans can't go up and our team cannot capture Dog point.
-Leave the battlements and push through the enemy zone alone, killing 5 Yanks, destroying 2 OPs in the process.
-Another mad lad from the H squad joins the cause pushes with me.
-Notify the squad that you just put an OP.
-Push through to Dog point with the mad lad.
-Clear out the Dog point, rest of the squad is proning inside the bushes close to dog point not knowing what to do.
-Run to them like the Lieutenant Speirs scene from Band Of Brothers and tell them  to move their asses to the Dog point to capture it..
-The H squad who is full of newbies overwhelms the Dog point and captures it, winning the battle as a result while none of the other ""experienced"" squads could do something about it.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"This review is primarily aimed at recent events ( 6th of July, 2023 )
Will update if needed.



Currently, I recommend you to not buy it, do not support the lazy devs. Or better say publishers.

The game was never perfect, many things are totally dumb, broken, overlooked and undone. But the progress was there. Slow, but visible...

Suddenly the devs left and publishers took over. And oh boy, are they worse. By a lot. It feels to me that publishers went like ""oh the game is kinda finished ? Lets kick the devs out then so we can take all the money and just milk it.""

They even released such a fake deep and structured video bambling about progress, family, focus on realism, future updates etc. After just a first month or so, we all know it was just bunch of horseshit. 



 - Half cooked British faction.
Its not even half cooked, its simply not done. Publishers took the file with ""British"" and simply put it in. They didnt even check that 90% of the folder is empty.

 - New map - El Alamein
It feels like a design demo. Undone, unpolished, weird, unfinished.... Just yuck.

 - New faction trailer - US Para
Oh boy. What a movie. What a shitshow.... I recommend you to go watch it. It looks like it was done by a fan with zero experience (but a lot of passion) in Garry's mod. Not by a big company whose game is one of the most notable Steam games in the past 2 years.

- SHITTON of new bugs
Most game breaking of them all, they fucked up the server browser. So basically a big number of players can no longer see around 300 servers, we see like 5. 4 of them are Hong Kong or Russia. With 0 people. With ping over 200. Nice.



After the take-over, the game suddenly feels a lot worse. Milked. Used. It almost feels abandoned...

And I feel cheated....


But Im not trying to be just a hater, so some Pros are in order as well:

FPS aspect is nice, it definitely can be a lot of fun.

If you find a squad that actually cooperates (rare) you can live thru some awesome tactical experience.

Kinda ok realism. Gore, sound affects, enviroment, mud everywhere. It feels authentic. Just kinda fucked up by publishers who had F in history. 
Main British SMG in WWII was definitely NOT Lanchester. 
The main British rifle of WWII was definitely NOT Enfield P14. Thats a World War ONE rifle.... jesus.... 
Nice, we have Gewehr 43....How bout Gewehr 41, while being in 1944 in most battles ? 
M3 grease gun was definitely more common towards the end of the war. 
M1 Carbine as well.
The cosmetics aspect is definitely weird as well. Feels like they forgot to make it, eveybody already left the studio so they had to ask the janitor.

Maybe Im just pedantic....



Overall the game deserves a solid 6,5/10, maybe even 7/10.
Current state however be like 3/10. Maybe even 2,5/10.


UPDATE
2nd of January, 2024

The game is still shit.

Random crashes, sudden FPS drops from 50 to 5, server browser sometimes not working, net code feels worst to be honest, (maybe my PC / internet are dying ?? Dont think so, its only HLL), sometimes the game doesnt load properly, etc.

British got a lil update, they have the correct kind of Lee-Enfield now. Nice. But nothing game changing otherwise, it still feels half cooked.

But dont worry ! We have yet another cosmetic DLC, the Pea Dot uniform ! Hurraaay ! .... Only problem is that it was kinda common in 1944 when Panzer and SS divisions got relocated to Normady to help the Panzergrenadiers defend. But you have to pay 5 Euros. For a quite common, definitely not rare, uniform. Well...


So yeah.... Will update in needed again, but I dont think its gonna happen anytime soon.... 

Gonna continue playing ? Yes.
Why ? Because its a readily avaliable WWII game.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I don't often review games because I am lazy, but this game deserves it. I am a 32 year old gamer and my fps experience goes back to Doom. I played all the FPS games. A few of the cod's, all the counter stirkes, most the battlefields, tribes,unreal's, quake's, titanfalls, rainbow six etc. This game is different then them all. Team work isn't wanted its absolutely needed. There is no kill feed, no glamour for the solo person with 50 kills at the end you just get to celebrate the win while your countries music plays on the score tab. Its a very, very different game. I am not super familiar with this genre having only played ARMA 3 for a few hours but the people playing this game are passionate. A lot of them take everything super serious which has its ups and downs but mostly ups. The player base is small enough you start to see the same people in games, but its large enough its always possible to find a full server to play on in less than 5 minutes. There is so many niches to fill in this game I suggest watching a youtube video before loading it up. The strats you need to win in this game take a lot of team coordination (average game has around 10 diff squads all geared towards diff tactics to help you win). I'm semi drunk and rambling but I really enjoy this game, yes there are times where you are getting crushed and you basically spawn in, run for 5 mins and die but those are few and far between. After a few games you get the hang of it start your own squad so you can have some control on where to place down spawn points.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Hell Let Loose lies at an excellent intersection between Battlefield, Squad and Insurgency. It brings the scale of the former, the logistics and teamwork of the middle and immediacy of the latter to impress with its 50 vs 50 WW2 battles that teeter between bombastic chaos and matter-of-fact single shot kills. Having just two modes - a 90 minute Warfare mode with single objective conquest, and the staggered 30 minute Offensive mode where a frontline is gradually and permanently pushed back by attackers -, restricting loadout customisation to two or three presets and no allowance for custom rules might seem overly strict or boring to some, but really it allows the game to enjoy an unusual focus foRr a genre that's by now bogged down in noise and lack of polish. HLL's ambition is to push you into almost a slice of life style of storytelling, where each individual is but a small cog in a grand machine.

It does this by dividing teams into neat hierarchies, where equipment and abilities are restricted to roles, themselves restricted to categories: At the top of the pyramid sits the commander, who gets access to the leader voice chat channel to communicate with officers, and who can use map-wide abilities like supply drops, bombing runs, spawn vehicles or issue map marker orders for the team. Beneath the commander are the officers, who are in charge of relaying information between their squad and other officers and the commander, and issuing orders to their squad. An infantry officer's squad who has access to the usual shooter roles: Engineers can build and destroy structures, support can provide construction supplies and ammo, medics can revive and heal teammates, assault gets access to SMGs and more grenades, and so on. Each squad is expected to follow orders from their officer and communicate as a small team of their own. Alternatively to infantry, there are special squad types for recon and armour, with two-man sniper teams and tank crews respectively, each having their own specialised roles and exclusive abilities and gear.

Ideally, a match will unfold with the three squad types working together under their officers, who in turn work with other officers and their commander as one great team, shifting between attack, defence and support. The latter is most interesting, because there are cases where some players or even an entire squad will be dedicated to logistics, driving supply trucks back and forth to build defenses in controlled territory. These unofficial roles are just as important as any medic or rifleman, allowing players to fortify points, man artillery, or act as infantry support or repair crews for tanks. Participating in this massive cooperation never fails to be thrilling. I enjoy getting headshots on the frontline or sneaking into an enemy objective and laying mines down, but there's a quiet satisfaction to spending an hour transporting supplies to engineers or building intricate layers of barbed wire and barricades that's just as rewarding. Intellectually engaging with the map, the movement of the team, evaluating risk and reward - these are rare treats that make not shooting a single time the entire match just as fun as doing so a thousand times, and no matter the role, extensive use of the map and compass's grid coordinates, bearings, cardinal directions and distance measurements separates the good players from the best.

Agency works differently in HLL compared to most shooters, but it's one of the first pressure points where things can go horribly wrong. A match in Battlefield can be turned around by a single person, even despite the vast scale. All it takes is a great flank and quick reflexes or helicopter pilot to potentially dominate an entire team, but in HLL the opposite is true - most conquests are a meat grinder regardless of your individual experience or skill. In fact the better both teams are, the longer conquest takes. It can thus become frustrating to have your performance tied so intrinsically to the team's. A great squad could theoretically turn the tables, but most of the time you're simply at the mercy of your officer and commander (or lack thereof), and while the highs of teamwork are higher than they otherwise would be, the lows of miscommunication and a lack of team autobalancing are very low indeed. This is offset by the game's intentional deemphasising of player stats, hiding kill/death ratios or victim/nemesis trackers away in a secondary screen, but the act of dying 20 times in a match and losing at the end still stings. Such an issue is however an unavoidable result of the demands of teamwork. When things go well - which they mostly do - HLL shines. Matches tend to ebb and flow over wide frontlines, incorporating the staccato pacing that can at times near the absurd. There are points when you'll have been lying on your stomach for five minutes until a single shot pierces the silence and your enemy a hundred metres away falls dead in a heap, and the rifle's echo fades into silence; there are others when you'll be sprinting out of a trench into a wall of enemies in a vast field scarred by craters and debris, dodging the rain of bullets and competing bombing runs as tanks charge through the cacophony and their thunderous fire sends your head spinning. The magnitude of the action can be truly impressive, and knowing that it's often the result of those 49 coordinating strangers, from infantry riflemen to sniping saboteurs all following the violent vision of a single commander at the helm, is awesome.

There are some bugs, imperfections in audio, and poor level design that marr the proceedings, but presentation and controls are generally excellent, giving HLL a sleekness uncharacteristic of multiplayer shooters, and far surpassing Arma 3, Squad, or any other milsims. And realistically, you're going to struggle to find another indie/AA game that looks or sounds as good as this, much less at such an enormous scale. HLL isn't a perfect game by any means, but its relentless focus on teamwork, trimming of fat, and straightforward design make it the best time I've had with a shooter in eons. There isn't much room for one man army heroics in its action, with all facets of its design encouraging and rewarding teamwork instead. With ample space for gameplay styles from solitary sabotage to quiet construction and frontline armoured engagements, there's something for everyone. It's a mature game for players who are tired of the uncontrolled chaos of Battlefield or Call of Duty that makes most matches blend together into an indistinct haze of inconsequential mass slaughter, and enormously thankfully it also eschews their stats pages, storefronts, caricaturesque customisation, battle passes, daily missions and endless notifications and popups that make those competitors become overwhelming assaults on your senses that also demand to be treated like a second job. It still needs some polish, and some new maps and equipment would be welcome, but I've hugely enjoyed my time playing HLL. Cerebral without becoming exclusionary, intense without becoming mind-numbing, I cannot recommend this enough as a minimalistic breath of fresh air.

I won't lie:  I had the exact same frustrations as everyone else: ""I can't see anyone!"".  Take it from me:  MOVE SLOWLY.  APPROACH CORNERS METHODICALLY.  STICK YOUR HEAD OUT SLOWLY.  WAIT.  LOOK FOR MOVEMENT.  IF NONE, TRY MOVING.  REPEAT.

The only way to have a ""truly"" enjoyable time is to use a headset, participate in chat and strategy, call in requests for supplies, put down garrisons and outposts.  If you are a squad leader, make sure someone is an engineer and set up nodes.  This may require having supply drops on the HQ or having someone else run support and drop them in your squad.  Resources and a competent commander make the game SO much more enjoyable.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Hell Let Loose: Review and recommendations

My name is General Rocker. I am sixty-three years of age and I am a life-long gamer. Started young, will game till the day I die. As my name indicates, I am a musician, but I got my alias via facilitating one of the largest Counter-Strike group around the turn of the century, [CoFR]Crusty old Fossil Rockers-- our motto: One foot in the grave, the other on your neck!

Hell Let Loose caught my attention since its inception because I've played Day of Defeat for twenty years now, having started as a BETA tester, and continue to look for new WWII first person shooters. I also play modern-era shooters that emulate modern tech, such as, Arma and Recon (with my 93 YO father), but I find the iron sights and limited tech far more challenging. I am partial to WWII strategy games, too. 

My first experience with HLL was amazing. I started playing the last patch before release. I cowered and was totally blown away by the weapons emulation, with suppression fire tearing up all around me. The battle dynamics in this game are fantastic, and quite realistic in much of how the game deals with accurate fire from weapons that are not dumbed down for the kids. Bombardment runs are amazing to see and horrific if you get caught up in one. Wow! A pistol kills just as well as an MG in this game so long as you know how to use it. Additionally, good luck if you are a frag whore interested in going alone. You will get all shot up without support from friendlies in this game, which makes squad chat integral. 

I appreciate the way in which the HLL team has figured out how to balance re-spawn in an interesting light, using garrisons, outposts and half-tracks to accomplish this task fluidly. The interface is cumbersome, though, and I wish a chit-mark would help me re-spawn without having to click on an icon all the time, for I frequently miss the timer and frustrate myself having to wait to re-spawn. The fact that re-spawn points are dependent upon leadership is brilliant, but the voice system needs a good rework. We shall see. You do need a mic to play this game!

Frankly, I'm impressed by the work conducted by the  HLL developers, who continue to improve the game. I get the sense that they are on to a solid niche for a franchise, and will continue to expand content so long as the game is profitable. That said, I do find intrinsic flaws in the game design that hinders its potential, as is true for most games that struggle with profit margins and marketing demographics. Such issues are for publishers to decide, whereas, I offer my feedback free of charge with hope my input might offer insight to creative coders. I was happy to see how the developers have incorporated feedback from users, and have made many improvements as a result. 

It would be nice if DEV incorporated their insight into a robust configuration platform that would enable the server admins to curtail the gaming experienced based upon preference; however, I see lots of rigidity to this effect, which may or may not be technical. What I mean is lots of defaults on the game are pretty ridiculous from a WWII squad perspective. I'd like to edit the size and configuration of squads, limit the use of artillery and other roles, along with other aspects that would be better if set as optional. Don't want tanks? No ART? (that would be so nice on occasion) No snipes for this map? I prefer a squad of 12 for WWII games, for this is not Counter-Strike. ETC. How about you let the clan decide how to set up the battles? Flexibility is lacking in most FPS games, and this is yet another who wants to create a canned, out of the box experience, and falls short simply because there are insufficient set-up options. 

I wait impatiently for MODS that might address my concerns. I follow the revisions and see the work going on, and the new maps on the way, but no indication that they will create more flexible server game-play options. In the mean time, other than way too much artillery, the game is a winner, and will get better as the DEV team ramp up content. As is true with all these kinds of games, much better on a closed server with like-minded individuals.",hell loose recommendation name general rocker sixty three year age life long gamer started young till die name indicates musician alias via facilitating largest counter strike group turn century cofr crusty old fossil rocker motto foot grave neck hell loose caught attention inception defeat twenty year started beta tester continue look new wwii shooter modern era shooter emulate modern tech arma recon 93 yo father iron sight limited tech far challenging partial wwii strategy game hll amazing started last patch release cowered totally blown weapon emulation suppression fire tearing battle dynamic fantastic realistic deal accurate fire weapon dumbed kid bombardment run amazing horrific caught wow pistol kill mg long additionally good luck frag whore interested alone shot support friendly make squad chat integral appreciate hll figured balance spawn interesting light garrison outpost half track accomplish task fluidly interface cumbersome wish chit mark help spawn click icon frequently miss timer frustrate wait spawn spawn point dependent leadership brilliant voice need good rework shall mic frankly impressed conducted hll developer continue improve sense solid niche franchise continue expand content long profitable intrinsic flaw design hinders potential true game struggle profit margin marketing demographic issue publisher decide whereas offer feedback charge hope input offer insight creative coder happy developer incorporated feedback user improvement result nice incorporated insight robust configuration platform enable admins curtail gaming experienced based preference lot rigidity effect technical lot default pretty ridiculous wwii squad perspective size configuration squad limit artillery role along aspect set optional tank art nice occasion snipe map prefer squad 12 wwii game counter strike clan decide set battle flexibility lacking fps game want create canned box fall short simply insufficient set option wait impatiently mod address concern follow revision new map indication create flexible option artillery winner ramp content true kind game closed minded individual,1,0.99

Everything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.

That said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like ""right, so back to that thing I was doing.""  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.

1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,"I played the game from beginning to end solely on the Steam Deck. 

To disable the game's dynamic resolution, set the in-game framerate to 120 and use the SteamOS overlay to cap the framerate to 40Hz and 40FPS. Resolution is set to 1280x720, borderless, high textures and low shadows with characters displayed set to 4. These settings will provide 40fps gameplay 99% of the time aside from extreme, periodic stutter in areas with tons of NPCs (this seems to be an engine issue). Otherwise, smooth sailing. 

The game is a fantastic retelling of the 1997 classic with modernized combat and the exclusion of randomized battles which does a remarkable job making each character feel important to the plot and each other. Each character has a unique gameplay style that keeps combat fresh and engaging. I enjoyed the original game quite a bit, and everything in this version has received the highest degree of care and polish.

The Good:
-The story alone is reason enough to buy this game, honestly, its the most 10/10 story you will ever experience 
-The fighting system is fucking awesome, very much fun
-Stunning Visuals, especially at night time
-The new life that was given to the slums of Midgar makes the emotional bonding even bigger
-THE SOUNDTRACK SLAPS AS HARD AS EVER

The bad:
-The performance really sucks, but you can work around it
-Theres just too much filler content, everything feels so stretched out 
(for example some of the ingame animations were just unneccessary gameplay stretches that weren't any fun *robot hands*)
-The 80€ price tag is just unfair, if you have the money buy it, if not wait for a good sale. 
-The Level Design is just BAD, honestly, its more linear than FFXIII, which is not a big con, but it still sucks.

All in All I rate this game a solid 8/10, the story, fighting system and soundtrack absolutely carried this game.

1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,"One of the best RPG's and worst PC ports...

Once again Square Enix never fails to make an amazing RPG but completely ruin the PC port. Graphics options are very limited, only letting you adjust textures and shadows. The FOV is locked really low to somewhere around 35 and TAA is FORCED with no way to toggle it except a mod which reveals the horrible checkerboard rendering they used to run the game on the PS4 but didn't fix for PC. So no matter what you're stuck with a slightly blurry image.

PC issues aside, this is a really amazing game, one of Square's best RPG's in decades, a complete remake from scratch from the PS1 original, not a remaster, this is a completely new game. The gameplay and cutscenes are very well done, fixing many of the issues from FF15, this one has much better voice acting and story flow as well as not bombarding you with side quests this time, there's only a handful at different points of the main quest you can easily do in an hour, it's the main story that fills most of those 40+ hours which is a breath of fresh air from other games that use side quests as filler.

I was very surprised to see how much this stayed true to the original game, nothing was cut out or censored, all the same themes and settings from the original game remain including the Honey Bee Inn and cross dressing scenes. One of my favorite small details is seeing your Materia slotted into your weapons, it looks exactly how I imagined it would after all these years but couldn't see in the original PS1 graphics.

This is almost a perfect game except for one truly annoying flaw besides the PC issues. I wish they just stuck to the same story from the original but Square couldn't leave well enough alone with the introduction of the ""Plot Ghosts"". They show up at random times during the story and come from an alternate timeline to ensure this games timeline stays on the same track as the original, it's really annoying and 4th wall breaking and I'm afraid it's leading up to major changes in the sequels with the wrong characters dying.

But it's still a great game, I highly recommend it. You can tell they put a ton of extra work into this full remake which wouldn't be possible in a regular remaster.",best worst pc port square enix fails amazing completely ruin pc port graphic option limited letting adjust texture shadow fov locked low 35 taa forced toggle except reveals horrible checkerboard rendering ps4 fix pc matter stuck slightly blurry image pc issue aside amazing square best decade complete remake scratch ps1 original remaster completely new cutscenes fixing issue ff15 voice acting flow bombarding side quest handful different point easily fill 40 hour breath fresh air game side quest filler surprised stayed true original cut censored theme setting original remain including honey bee inn cross dressing scene favorite small detail seeing materia slotted weapon look exactly imagined year original ps1 graphic perfect except truly annoying flaw besides pc issue wish stuck original square leave alone introduction plot ghost random time alternate timeline ensure game timeline stay track original annoying 4th wall breaking afraid leading major change sequel wrong character dying great highly recommend tell ton extra remake possible regular remaster,2,0.9558

1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,"So what is Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, and how does it compare to the classic 1997 Playstation title? 

Well the original Final Fantasy VII for some is one of the best RPGs of all time. And it is indeed well deserving of all of its praise. It was revolutionary, and a major game changer for the console RPG genre. A tale of a band of characters brought together with similar goals of saving the planet. And furthermore, it was an RPG that actually spanned an entire planet. Well the ""remake"" is the first part of a series of games that is more a re-imagining of the classic title, rather than a straight remake. And this is what might confuse some people who played the original. Not just the fact that the game takes place in mainly Midgar, which is a small portion of the original, but also that the story has been repurposed. The characters are all the same. You have your defiant group of heroes, lead by Cloud. You have the evil villains, such as Sephiroth. The planet destroying company of Shinra. It's all here. And some things will seem right as rain for veterans of the original game. But then, some things will seem way off, and you'll get to pints in the game where the story goes left when in the original it went right. This is where the game turns less into a remake and goes full blown ""What If...?"". This is where the game feels more like that gray area between a remake, and a full on reboot. It's neither, and it's also both. If you can go in with the mindset that things are not going to be the same in key moments of the game, then you should be in for quite a wonderful journey. If you however want the same as the original, just stick to the original. 

I won't spoil any of the story or story changes for those who have yet to play. I will however say for those new to Final Fantasy VII, you owe it to yourselves to also play the original. 

https://store.steampowered.com/app/39140/

Aside from changes to the story, there are some major changes to how the game plays as well. It's like a mashup of the original with the newer combat found in Final Fantasy XV. That is to say the combat is mostly real time. And the type of attacks will vary based on the characters. Cloud uses his massive sword. Barret uses his gun arm. Tifa uses her martial arts. You get the idea. Coming back is the ATB system. The way it works in FFVIIR is that you get different abilities to choose from based on the ATB guage. The normal combat however is not locked to this. It's important to manage this as normal combat is fine for some enemies, but certain enemies will require special attacks to really do some damage. ATB can be filled with normal attacks and guards from enemy attacks. Also like in FFVII you can equip various types of materia to your weapons and gear. Materia gives you different abilities, such as magic, buffs, debuffs and more. Some of them even allow you to use summons. Also you can mix and match different types of materia for bonus status effects. This allows for some nice customization to your characters.

Midgar in the original FFVII was big. But it was not THAT big. It was a section of the game that acted as an entry point to a much larger world. It was definitely not a world that comprised of a massive epic journey. But it was a necessary entry point. It made us discover the reasons for what these characters were doing. What drove them. But at the same time, it was still a small section of a larger game. In the ""remake"", Midgar is expanded upon immensely. It's larger. Much more open. Much more full of life. And as depressing as the world may seem, being ruled by a planet killing corporation, it is still a sight to behold. Bustling towns, shanties, urban areas, industrial complexes... They all look fantastic. It's both the Midgar we knew, and the Midgar we didn't. 

Aside from making Midgar much bigger, they also fleshed out the length of the game in both some good and not so good but necessary ways. For starters character development is much greater in this title than the original's Midgar sequence. Characters who were largely throwaways in the original (you know who) have been given new life and personalities. Also there is a lot more to do in Midgar now. And sadly some of it seems like excess padding. But its the same tropes you will find in most RPGs. I'm talking about the side quests. Lots of them to be found. But as stated, this is a necessary thing, as it leads to some valuable rewards. 

Final Fantasy VII Remake is not the perfect Final Fantasy VII game. But neither is the original. Remake does some things better, but also some things worse. It's the same, but it's also different. It's an adaptation to something some of us hold dear to our hearts. So while it's different, I say buckle up and enjoy the ride.",final fantasy vii remake intergrade compare classic 1997 playstation title original final fantasy vii best rpgs indeed deserving praise revolutionary major changer console genre tale band character brought similar goal saving planet furthermore spanned entire planet remake series game imagining classic title rather straight remake confuse original take mainly midgar small portion original repurposed character defiant group hero lead cloud evil villain sephiroth planet destroying company shinra thing rain veteran original thing pint go left original turn remake go blown feel gray remake reboot neither mindset thing key moment wonderful journey original stick original spoil change new final fantasy vii owe original http store steampowered com app 39140 aside change major change play mashup original newer combat found final fantasy xv combat mostly real type attack vary based character cloud us massive sword barret us gun arm tifa us martial art idea coming atb work ffviir different ability choose based atb guage normal combat locked important manage normal combat fine enemy certain enemy require special attack damage atb filled normal attack guard enemy attack ffvii equip various type materia weapon gear materia give different ability magic buff debuffs allow summons mix different type materia bonus status effect allows nice customization character midgar original ffvii big big section acted entry larger world definitely world comprised massive epic journey necessary entry discover reason character drove small section larger remake midgar expanded immensely larger open life depressing world ruled planet killing corporation sight behold bustling town shanty urban area industrial complex look fantastic midgar knew midgar aside midgar bigger fleshed length good good necessary way starter development greater title original midgar sequence character largely throwaway original given new life personality midgar sadly excess padding trope rpgs talking side quest lot found stated necessary lead valuable reward final fantasy vii remake perfect final fantasy vii neither original remake thing thing worse different adaptation hold dear heart different buckle enjoy ride,3,0.9771

-It's only the first few hours of the original game, stretched out to 20-30 hours. Not the whole thing. The rest will be released in two upcoming sequels.
-They added some contrived key plot pieces that deviate the story from the original. You either love it or you hate it.
-English dub does a fair bit of over-acting; but unfortunately, that's pretty common in JRPG's nowadays.
-As much as ""Explore a Fully-Realized Midgar!"" is part of the pull, it isn't as much as I had hoped. It's mostly some enclosed areas, the majority of which happens in three Sectors in the slums. The rest of the vistas that the game has to offer are just pre-rendered backdrops that become more obvious at higher resolutions.
-There is some microstuttering, which requires some work to fix. First, run the game in DX11 (there's a guide for it). If that doesn't work, find a mod to disable Dynamic Resolution Scaling (DRS).

Other than that, it is an enjoyable time. But depending on what you wanted from this ""remake"" project, it can be either a lot, or a little.

1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,"If you’re looking for a straight 1:1 retelling of Final Fantasy 7, this is unfortunately not exactly that. Tetsuya Nomura decided that making a straight up remake was too boring of a prospect, and instead he has decided to infuse the original FF7 storyline with some kind of mushroom. It’s difficult to explain how this is more-than-likely a sequel while also being a retelling of the main story, so just know that Nomura is famous for the Kingdom Hearts series and we are probably in for a weird ride.

If you played FF7 as a kid, you’re going to be overdosing on the best kind of nostalgia while playing this game. It’s filled to the brim with fanservice for fans of the original game, and the way they managed to translate 2D environments into a full 3D world in a recognizable fashion is astounding. There are tons of moments where the camera pans and you realize you are standing in an old room from the original game.

The problem for me is that all I was really hoping for was some kind of remake of Final Fantasy 7, like it seemed we were getting up until the game came out. The stuff they added in this game, for the most part, is split between filler episodes that don’t actually help the plot or move things forward, and Nomura BS that nobody really asked for. It’s not a bad game, don’t get me wrong. This is my second time through the game, second copy I own. Look at my hours played. I really like this game, and I enjoy it, and a lot of the game hits me hard in the nostalgia gland because there was a solid chunk of my life as a kid dedicated to this game… I just wish it was a straight up remake, and it is not.

1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,"Final Fantasy VII Remake is a visually stunning and ambitious reimagining of the classic RPG that captivated players in the late '90s. While it successfully captures the essence of the original game, it does suffer from some notable issues that prevent it from reaching its full potential. 

One of the main drawbacks of FF7R lies in its early chapters, where the pacing can feel uneven and disjointed. The initial hours of the game tend to drag, with an abundance of slow-paced sidequests that fail to engage. The uninteresting tasks can disrupt the flow of the story and make it difficult to maintain the same level of enthusiasm experienced in later chapters. In the original FFVII, Midgard took like 6-8 hours and was basically a prolonged prologue to a much grander world and story. Here in Integrade this was stretched to 35+ hours and even after finishing it I'm still on the fence if focusing on that specific part of the original was a good idea or not. Some areas or scenes improve the story significantly, others really drag and feel like they are just there to fill the time. I guess you can't justify a high fidelity, expensive remake of a beloved title to be so short.  Thankfully it gets better around halfway where story finally picks up and even sidequests become more enjoyable.

On the positive side, the combat system is one of FF7R greatest achievements. The real-time action seamlessly blends with strategic decision-making, offering players an exhilarating and dynamic experience. I wasn't a fan of this new battle system at first, but it grew on me over the time. The variety of playable characters, each with their unique abilities and playstyles, adds depth and excitement to battles. The strategic use of the ATB (Active Time Battle) system allows for tactical decision-making, ensuring that combat remains engaging throughout the adventure. It shines especially in boss battles. The intensity and grandeur of these battles are magnified by the outstanding soundtrack, which skilfully blends nostalgia with new compositions, enhancing the overall experience.

Furthermore, the presentation of Final Fantasy VII Remake is nothing short of breathtaking. The graphics are stunning, bringing the iconic locations of Midgar to life with meticulous detail and awe-inspiring visual effects. The character models are beautifully rendered, and the voice acting is superb, adding depth and emotion to the already beloved cast of characters. 

HOWEVER

FF7R came out on consoles first, and I'm so tired of games that have to be designed for outdated systems in mind. There are so so so many long corridors or places where you walk or crawl really slowly. On consoles, they were used to hide loading times, but on PC they just pad the time even more.

Sadly, I really can't say anything good about some changes to original plot. The introduction of the arbiters of destiny/fate/whatever... Every time they appeared, my immediate reaction was ""Please just go, and let me enjoy my FFVII"". Instead of enhancing the story, they only serve to complicate matters and detract from the core themes and emotional resonance of the original game. I also have no idea what to make of Sephiroth. I'm not opposed to Sephiroth being present, but how they handled it was not something that sat well with me. I will have to say I don't like how heavy they shoved him into the game at almost every point. He was a mysterious figure in the original, and in this one, he pops up way too much to be considered as such. 

So now we know that it is a first part of a Final Fantasy VII Remake Trilogy Project, and I'm not really a fan of that. While the intention was likely to expand on the original game's narrative, the execution feels disjointed and left me with an unsatisfying sense of incompleteness. Instead of delivering a comprehensive and cohesive experience, the episodic format ultimately feels like a cash grab, unnecesarily fragmenting the story. While the game may hold moments of brilliance and nostalgia for fans of the original, it fails to live up to its predecessor's legendary status.

But I guess we will see. Maybe it will be good, once everything comes out.

Also this game is WAY TOO OVERPRICED. When compared to other games of similar length and caliber, the cost feels unjustifiably steep.

1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,"I waited nearly a year and a half for this game. I spent that time watching everyone enjoying the game, avoiding spoilers, and fighting the urge to borrow a fucking Playstation just so I could play it. It was brutal. In the end, I’m glad I waited. If I had caved and bought it on EGS, my playthrough would have been clouded by the frustration of giving in to FOMO and it wouldn’t have felt as special.

As it is, when I started playing this, I was instantly reminded of being a kid and waking up early on Saturday morning to start a weekend-long marathon of playing. I’m not normally so nostalgic but this game got to me. There was something about seeing all of the Lego-block-looking characters I remember from the 1997 original coming to life with more realistic renders that ripped me back into the past to a simpler time. The excitement I felt then came back to me and hit me right in the gut. It was well worth the wait.

But that’s enough waxing nostalgic. You’re here to see if the game is worth your time and money.

If you haven’t played the original, it’s hard for me to say. The game is gorgeous, the battle system is fantastic, and the story is extremely interesting. The problem is, I don’t know how much it has to offer for a newcomer. The story is incomplete – this is only about 1/3 of the the original game’s story. The characters are all pretty wonderful – but I don’t know how much of my love for them comes from bonding with them as a kid. What I can guarantee are beautiful visuals and a fun battle system. If that’s worth $70(!) to you, go for it. Otherwise, you may want to wait for the rest of the games to come out or for a discounted price.

Now, if you’re old as hell (like me), this game could easily be worth every penny. As someone who doesn’t consider [i]Final Fantasy VII[/i] his favorite in the series, I consider the remake to be one of the finest games in the franchise. I love how the developers were able to overhaul the battle system to appeal to new generations of gamers. (However, if you’re not looking for a new spin on the fights, there is a “Classic Mode” that is apparently more like the old style of battle system. I don’t know how well it works, though… I never tried it.) The updated story has me on tenterhooks! While it’s very close to the original game’s story, there is enough different here that I’m excited to see what happens next. I have a feeling that things are going to get very interesting… And, I know this might sound like something trivial, but the addition of voice actors makes everything so much more engaging that it was twenty-five years ago. I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish.

So, I’m going to say something that will be considered blasphemous but it has to be said: I like this remake so, so, so much more than the original.

And it's not like they used that extra time to make it an amazing PC port with all the features we love. But I'll get to that later. First they extended their PS exclusivity deal for the DLC. Then they went and made it an Epic Exclusive when it finally did release on PC. And now here we are, finally on Steam.

[i]This wouldn't be such a big deal, I suppose...if this wasn't just part 1 of a 3 part trilogy. And they'll likely repeat this practice for parts 2 and 3.[/i] Expect to have things spoiled by the time those hit Steam. Expect for everyone to tell you whether they're good or not before you have a chance to form your own fresh opinion. [i]I'm just tired of publishers using PC (and Steam in particular) as a place to chase sales from double/triple dippers instead of treating all of their loyal fans equally, like plenty of other publishers do.[/i]

This trend leaves potentially millions of players who waited patiently for the Steam release in a weird place, where they feel like second class citizens.

[b]Do I still recommend the game? Yes. It's got an amazing story and top notch gameplay. The port itself is functional, but unfortunately a bit bare-bones. It seems to be the same port released on Epic. However, the major stuttering in Sector 7 seems mostly fixed. It is unclear if this is due to a game patch or NVIDIA's driver fix they posted a short while after the Epic release. No ultra-wide support is disappointing, considering modders had it working within days. Many graphics options are simply not present. But it is far from the worst port they've done (ahem...FF13-2).[/b]

-------
[b]TLDR: Square needs to take some lessons from Capcom on how to treat their loyal fans.[/b] I own every Final Fantasy game on Steam. Would you expect someone to go buy an episode of a TV show on Apple TV if they own all the other episodes on, say, Amazon? No. That would be silly. Their Epic deal was no different. But I'm glad it's finally here with the rest of the Final Fantasy games in my library.

1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,"A true masterpiece, Buy this game and you wont be disappointed! Square listened to the complaints that FF 15 had for it's combat system, and it shows because they have perfected this new formula. Using abilities in real time with your ATB gauge is buttery smooth and switching between Cloud/Barett/Tifa/Aerith on the fly during the heat of battle flows so well it's almost like second nature. Visuals are crisp, there isn't an area in this game that doesn't make you just stop what your doing and look around with your camera angles at how beautiful Midgar is. The story and characters are even more immersive than you could ask for, and don't get me started on the OST. You would  be hard-pressed to find a remastered soundtrack that gets you as hyped during battle as this one!

1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,"Final Fantasy 7 is a part of my childhood. I still remember the advertisment i saw on Tv and even though i didnt know anything about the franchise i was mesmerized. Coincidentally my brother was about to buy a ps1 and asked me what games i'd like to have. And i settled for FF7 and Tekken.

Anyhow I personally didnt have much hype for the remake since i played almost all FF games and the newer ones (some bad FF13-13-2) and some okayish to good  (Lightning Returns, FF15). I didnt think they'd be able to pull it of. Luckily they did.

There are criticisims about how the story got kind of changed, but i dont see that as a bad thing. I wont go into detail here because of spoilers, but if you want to relive the same story and game with better graphics just mod the old game and play it.

Pros:
*Tifa
*Beautiful Artstlye + GFX
*Good Combat
*Great adaptation of the locations we all love and like
*New Versions of the songs we love
*Good difficulty imo
*Beautiful character models(especially tifa daiummnn)
*No stutters 
*DLC hit me right in the feels
*Hot Tifa mods on nexus


Cons:
*The ""fate"" stuff needs to be fleshed out more, 
but well there are other games upcoming so they still can do that.
*Even though i like the combat system,
but i wish materia would be more important(maybe it will with added materia in the next game)
*The game has more of an impact if you played the original else it might be slightly confusing.
*Sometimes shadows and hair textures look grainy because of TAA (afaik) but there is a way around that.
*Not enough Tifa
*The other parts will take their time to release :(

- An exceptional remake that not only captures the essence of what made the original great, but also expands upon it with more lore, additional characters and interesting situations.

- Engaging, dynamic combat system with a good level of mechanical depth to it.

- Well-designed multiphase boss fights that mostly prove challenging, feel unique and epic as such confrontations should be.

- The side content such as quests and minigames is worth doing, as it gives good rewards.
[/td]
[td]
- Some bosses, a few quests and optional battles are barred behind replaying the entire game in NG+. There isn’t enough replayability to warrant doing so at all.

- Even if worthwhile, the optional content often proves dull and acts as filler to inflate the campaign's length in a cheap way.

- Intergrade’s story goes on until the party leaves Midgar for good, which is about 35% of the total. This isn’t a complete remake, as the devs decided to split the whole thing in three instances, for whatever reason, instead of doing everything in the same game.

[td][b]Content & Replay Value:[/b][/td]
[td]It took me 46 hours to complete the story on Normal, while also clearing all secondary content. After that, NG+ mode with some additional battles / bosses, and spin-off episode “Intermission” offer more content. Despite that, the game is largely linear and I don’t see a reason to replay it once cleared, as the NG+ content doesn’t warrant going through mostly the same stuff again.[/td]

[td][b]Is it worth buying?[/b][/td]

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Premise, Setting & Writing[/h3]
The city of Midgar stands as a shining beacon of technology in an otherwise desolate wasteland, using the all-powerful Mako energy to maintain its modern standards of living. Shinra Corporation de-facto rules above all, being the ones that built and maintained the reactors. Turns out using the planet’s vital energy as fuel isn’t the best choice long-term, so a group of ‘eco-terrorists’ called Avalanche wants to put a stop to Shinra’s ambitions by destroying the whole shebang. Protagonist Cloud Strife, ex-Shinra elite now turned rogue, is hired by the insurgents to help them fight the power - that’s how your story begins.

This remake not only expands upon the original characters, but introduces many all-new ones, each with their own backstory. Generally speaking, they’re interesting enough and add to the story in a good way, with personalities distinct and remarkable enough to not feel generic. Between item descriptions, enemy files and lore entries, there’s a good amount of optional info about the world for those interested, personally I found this aspect interesting, as much of it wasn’t elaborated upon in the original FFVII.

[h3]Exploration & Level Design[/h3]
Until late-game the levels will be largely linear, with just a few side-areas to explore for loot and some ‘open’ areas that act as containers for side-quest-giving NPCs. Later on, fast-travel between various sectors becomes available, allowing you to finish eventual leftover quests and explore each area accurately at will - not much to find, though, as far as secrets go. Vendors are available in some places in the form of machines or actual people, who will sell you new weapons, unique accessories, Materia, and sometimes give you quests and minigames  to earn trinkets or other stuff not obtainable in any other way.

The ‘random encounters’ with enemies have been reworked into seamless transitions between battle and exploration, that you can also skip by simply running away in many cases - a welcome addition. It’s annoying that many sections have scripted sequences where characters move at a deliberately slower pace, in most cases adding tedium instead of scenic buildup.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835932350

[h3]Combat System[/h3]
Instead of the turn-based system of the original VII, this remake opts for real-time battles where you control one character at time, while the other two are left to the AI, though you can switch between them at any time. Hitting enemies with basic attacks will fill your ATB gauge, essential to use spells, abilities, items and pretty much do anything else - your companions will behave competently while in the hands of the computer, but won’t use higher skills unless you switch and order them directly - mostly, they’ll just stand there and soak up damage, or attack enemies when appropriate.

The combat mechanics have been expanded upon, now featuring ‘Stagger’ and ‘Pressure’ effects, both critical to winning battles; deal great damage in a short time, and enemies will progressively build up stagger, making them extremely vulnerable for a short time - a circumstance that can also be triggered by targeting weak points or other specific actions unique to each enemy. For the rest, expect abilities, spells and items as in any JRPG, with particular emphasis on elemental weaknesses and status effect dispelling as keys to winning the more demanding fights. Summons are also a thing, but only in specific battles, and work as temporary NPCs you can’ìt control directly, but spend ATB to trigger their abilities instead.

Special mention for bosses, which prove elaborate and unique at all times, not to mention challenging and full of interesting mechanics that break the canons of battle, forcing you to get creative. The only critique I would make to bosses is that they won’t allow you to fully go through a well-planned combo if their health goes low enough, thus triggering a cutscene and resetting their status immediately, even while staggered or otherwise incapacitated.

[h3]Character Management & Progression[/h3]
Completing quests and killing mobs will credit you EXP, AP and SP. Now, these ‘currencies’ of sorts can be used to respectively increase character levels, something that happens automatically, level-up equipped Materia (also automatic) and enhance weapons, since each of them has its own skill tree of passive abilities, and is generally better-suited for different roles. Not only that, but each new weapon comes with a unique signature ability you can ‘master’ and permanently learn as a skill. 

Think of Materia as swappable abilities you can slot in weapons and accessories, to build your characters for the roles you prefer - only equipped materia will level up, thus unlocking new proprieties or stronger spell versions, so make sure you focus on what you really need as it’s impossible to get everything maxed out in one playthrough, unless you do a hell of a lot of grinding.

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is a twist on the original cult classic that has been reimagined with cutting-edge graphics, all-new game mechanics, and fast-paced combat. This game will push you to the edge of your seat, but how does it hold up compared to the original?

[table]

    [th][b]🟩 Positives[/b][/th]
    [th][b]🟥 Negatives[/b][/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
    [td]🟩 The story is essentially the same as the original, with little to no altering to the overall sequence.

🟩 Probably some of the best voice acting I've experienced in a game to date in quality and actor choice.

🟩 Summons make a return, and are as cinematic ever before.

🟩 Minigames at some dumb fun to the intense story line and are pretty amusing for the most part.

🟩 Boss fights are fun and quite often a decent challenge.

🟩 Multiple difficulties to help scale your experience.[/td]
    [td]🟥 Fights are far too finicky, not quite as responsive or technique based as I would have hoped.

🟥 Checkpoints are awfully placed, especially during boss fights.

🟥 Side quests feel like filler content, devoid of any real personality.  [/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

[h1]Story[/h1]
The planet is in pain, suffering from the endless consumption of its lifeblood called Mako by the mega corporation, Shinra, to fuel their cities and technology. It's here you meet the heroes, a group of rag-tag misfits called Avalanche who are taking the fight to Shinra in hopes that they can save the planet.

Cloud Strife, a former member of SOLDIER, an elite group of soldiers used to do Shinra's dirty job's has joined forces with this group and are on their way to destroy a reactor in the mega city known as Midgar.

But things begin to unravel quickly.

Shinra plans to unleash their entire force with the intention to destroy the group. All the while, Cloud is fighting to stay afloat in his fractured memories and must battle for control against his demons.

The story remains entirely faithful to the original game, with some content in between to help bolster it. The writing is superb, and the overall story is perfect to say the least. Side quests are the contrast here,  as they are totally devoid of personality and storyline and seem to act purely as filler for the entirety of the experience. Please keep in mind that you only get to play as 4 of the total party in the entirety of this game, and it consists of Cloud, Barret, Tifa and Aerith.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[b]Let's take the fight to Shinra![/b]
The remake is a decent rendition of the original game in nearly every aspect. Memorable boss fights return with new mechanics to learn and master that pose significant challenges. Yet standard combat doesn't meet the same standard. Fights are tediously long, button mashing events that don't encourage you to get better, but force you to overcome a barrage of spam abilities and interruptions. The alternate game-mode provided called ""classic"" really helps with this, making the game more reminiscent of the original and closer to the traditional turn-based gameplay.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835358436

Materia and equipment are impressive concepts that have remained the same and allow you to customise your heroes to your own liking and build them how you see fit. Materia is essentially the magic in Final Fantasy 7, taking the shape of coloured orbs that give you special abilities when equipped that also bolster your individual stats. Equipment is precisely as you can imagine, the different armour and weapons your characters can brandish in combat, obviously increasing their defence and damage output. Each weapon can also be upgraded now to improve their damage output, defence and materia slots, you can also learn a new weapon skill for each weapon you level up. There are special kinds of materia that allow you to summon creatures to help in big fights, these are extremely rare but worthwhile investments to find as they can really turn the tide of some of the more brutal fights.

[b]Better get this right the first time![/b]
Checkpoints take place at every significant milestone. Sadly these can be few and far between, sometimes taking place every 30-45 minutes. The game does allow you to manually save, but it's very easy to forget about this during heated story sequences and running back after dying is tedium made manifest.

[b]A game within a game within a game.[/b]
Anyone familiar with the original Final Fantasy 7, will be all too familiar with the mini games. Intergrade is no different as many of the original games make a return and a few fresh ones grace us with their appearance. You will spend countless hours doing squats, fighting boxes or competing in the coliseum just to earn that rare item you can’t get anywhere else! These really help break the intensity of the story as quite a lot happens in the story and it's nice to take a breath, even though it doesn’t make immersive sense.

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
Integrade offers a breathtaking visual experience to say the very least. A masterfully detailed world coupled with high quality cinematic graphics is just beyond words. Particle effects and creative use of its physics engine naturally immerse and connect you to the journey.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835354765

The audio is just well done, contrasting the visual atmosphere with its crisp quality audio and overwhelming atmosphere, all of this is topped with the deliciously nostalgic soundtrack that has been lovingly remastered and reworked.

[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]
With the game set to ultra, and at a resolution of 2560 x 1440, I never saw the game drop below 60 FPS.
No issues arose during gameplay.
RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 28%)
CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 18.7%)
GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 62.1%)

[h1]Final Thoughts - Good[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
Intergrade offers a true experience to the original in nearly every way even though I feel it has lost a little bit of its charm in the revamp. Combat is less satisfying than I remember, story sequences are less compelling and intriguing, and the overall experience is drowning with overwhelming filler content that becomes repetitive quickly. Also keep in mind, this is only 1 part of the FF7 story, and it sits at a whopping $114.95 AUD. With that all being said, this game is a stunning re-creation to the original and it will keep you captivated throughout, I just can't recommend it at full price, so give this one a go if you can grab it on a steep discount.

1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,"It's been more than a month since I've completed FF VII Remake, and I still haven’t stopped thinking about this game. 

[b]PROS[/b]

- The story, for the most part, is faithful to the original, and is very well told through the use of excellent voice-acting and soundtrack. Most of the storyline additions were great – giving further character development to certain characters, while others changed the plot quite substantially, giving fans of the original game something “new” to look forward to. 

- The graphics are breathtaking. In particular, the in-game character models look just as good as the ones used in real-time generated cutscenes, and it’s not just how they look - it’s how they are animated too. The way they animated facial and body expressions makes it feel like they are real characters you can actually empathise with. 

 - The combat is genuinely fun. The game combines real-time action with ATB combat. It is simple to learn, yet never gets stale. The materia system enables your character to have different builds, giving the game more depth and replayability. In addition, the boss-fights themselves feel very rewarding to overcome as each boss requires a different approach to battle due to their unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses.

[b]NEUTRAL[/b]

-  The PC port has very limited settings. There is no option for anti-aliasing, motion blur, depth of field, field of view, etc… The game pretty much only allows you to change the texture & shadow resolution and the render distance for NPCs. On the highest setting this game will [I]only[/I] look as good as the PS5 version (which is still ridiculously good), although it does play better due to its higher frame-rate. 

- The keyboard and mouse controls are serviceable for the most part of the game. The only time they feel horrible is during certain mini-games such as the bike-riding and dancing sections of the game. 

[b]CONS[/b]

- The pacing can be slow at times. It doesn’t help that there are certain sections of the game where your character is forced to move slowly, especially when walking on ledges or crawling through tight alleyways. 

- The game suffers from shader compilation stutters like most UE4 titles. This occurs at the beginning of each new area or chapter you transition to. The stutter becomes less frequent as you play the game more and build up cache. Regardless, there’s no excuse to not having those shaders be precompiled. 

[u][b]OVERALL[/b][/u]

1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,Fantastic game. As a fan of the original I bought the steam deck just to play this. Looks great and runs well straight out of the box. Hoping the next instalment of the game is also verified for deck.,fantastic fan original bought deck look great run straight box hoping next instalment verified deck,3,0.9432
1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,"I had quite a lot of fun. There are plenty of pros to be found here such as the overall visual style, the weapon stat customization, the combat skills, the NG+ aka Chapter Selection, but holy smokes, I don't know what's going on with the plot after I beat the game.

I'm going to focus on the cons, while the wounds are still fresh.

The side-quests, a majority of them are forgettable. I finished them off because I like completing things, but man, they are not gonna leave an impact on you. Quite a few of them will have you do some backtracking/retreating completed areas which is beneficial because of the experience from battles. I suppose that's their real purpose, just to give you things and make you stronger. They don't affect the main plot for the most part.

The visual style is great, the uneven textures are the opposite. You're going to see quite a few blurry things. It's that situation where some textures are ultra-mega HD+ and then that piece of paper looks like it appeared from the 90's. I found it to be slightly annoying and slightly disappointing. You're already splitting the source material into three parts so my expectations are going to be higher when it comes to the visuals.

I won't say too much about the plot, but yikes. The game is hitting all the core story beats just fine, but the borderline Kingdom Hearts-esque plot additions are extremely repulsive, especially with the ending. I was left feeling confused and saying ""What is going on!?"" out loud multiple times with different inflections. It has gone in a direction that will give the writers freedom to add possibly very weird things, but potentially at the cost of the main plot points being rewritten poorly. That's a high risk approach that doesn't leave me with much confidence considering how I felt about the ending that felt like a fan fiction.

I miss being able to summon Summons at will. You cannot do that in this version of FF7. They're only available during major battles. Summons also stick around. They'll help out and cast specific spells at the cost of ATB bars. After they reach their time limit, they use their signature move. Limit Breakers function in the same way. You can't save one for the next battle and can realistically use them only in battles against strong opponents or bosses. This means I'll never have the pleasure of absolutely annihilating a lone Shinra soldier with my strongest skills.

This point is a bit more on the neutral side. This game is fairly linear. I expect the 2nd one to be much more open-world(ish) exploration. FF7 Remake is all about Midgar and Shinra. [b]So if you're looking for an open-world JRPG, this game is not it.[/b]

One of the biggest pros that I was impressed with was how they handled weapons. Every new weapon you come across will contain an ability you can learn before swapping back to an old favorite. Each weapon also has a baby sphere-grid solar-looking system to it as well that you can use to increase stats, materia slots, or grant passive skills/combat enhancements. I spent a good chunk of time figuring out how I wanted to do things and went back and forth on which weapons to use depending on who I needed to do what. For example, if you have Cloud as a healer, you probably don't want him to use Hardedge because he'll have a very low magic stat.

Anyway... if you're the kind of person that beat the original FF7 4 times, I believe this game is worth your time for the nostalgia fan service and modernized gameplay. I don't think I can grind like I did before in the same way with the OG FF7 and it's neat to see the differences. I just hope they reign it in with the next installments with the absurdity and mindless side-quests. We'll just have to see where the writing goes in the future and pray this trilogy doesn't become an ill-fated attempt at a remake.

      [*] [b]The community can be toxic as hell. There's three basic types of toxicity.[/b]

---------------------------------------

[h1]UPDATE (May 28 2021):[/h1]

[list]
      [*] [b]New content is still being released![/b]

      [olist]
            [*] More mechanics are being added to the game, which changes how survivors play. Ex: Zombies being added in the R.E. chapter (in Player Test Build at the time of this update). 
            [*] Some cosmetics can be purchased with shards, unlocked through game-play, or redeemed via codes released by BHVR.
            [*] Periodic events. Currently, there's an event to find Gnome Chompski once the exit gates are powered. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]Map and graphical updates.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] The game generally looks a lot better now.
            [*] Multiple variants of maps.
            [*] Maps tend to be smaller now, which can be both good and bad. Gens feel closer together but that also applies to hooks. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]The Rift[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] A battle pass has been added to the game.
            [*] Auric cells (paid currency) are part of the reward system- if you complete the Rift you actually get your money back!
            [*] Players are rewarded with cosmetics, lore (The Archives), and various forms of in-game currency. 
            [*] Challenges from the Rift add an extra layer of fun (or psychological distress and anguish) to matches. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]Matchmaking... Again[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Queue times are substantially faster for survivors in the morning than in the afternoon/evening.
            [*] I'm a filthy survivor main heathen, so I can only assume that means killer queue times are better in the afternoon/evening. 
            [*] Still occasionally end up in lobbies that are very unbalanced or entirely unfair, but it's better than it used to be. 
            [*] There's a lot more player consistency in terms of skill, but also toxicity, in higher ranks. 
            [*] If you want to meme and enjoy, the higher ranks tend to be very serious... 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]HIT BOXES MAKE ME CRY.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] This is just a game.
            [*] Please, self... It's just a game...
            [*] [i]Sobbing intensifies.[/i]
            [*] In all seriousness though, the hit boxes need some improvement. Lag, frame-perfect timing, and other aspects all influence whether the hatchet hits your face or clips through your face. 
            [*] I may be a survivor main, but if a Huntress nails me across the map, I'm impressed with the shot and outraged on the killer's behalf if it doesn't register. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]What accessibility options?[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Changing the struggle phase on hook to a series of skill checks was a huge improvement in terms of accessibility for wider audiences. 
            [*] An option to suppress screen flashing effects or toggle an alternate view for them would be helpful. A fade-in, solid color, then fade-out screen aura might be a good option for this? It would preserve visual information without giving an 'unfair advantage' to players.
            [*] For the record, players with disabilities just wanna grind for bloodpoints and cry like everyone else. If your primary concern is giving players an 'unfair advantage,' please remember that accessibility options compensate for a set-back so that people with disabilities have an even playing field. 
      [/olist]
[/list]

[h1]I'd say that the changes boost my rating to a 9/10, but the hit box issues can definitely make this game feel like a 2/10.[/h1]

To BHVR, if they ever stumble their way into this review: 
The new content is great but please look into hit registration and hit boxes. Accessibility options for a wide range of players would also be highly appreciated [i]and[/i] it would increase audience reach and profitability. Keep up the good work.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Out of all the reviews I wrote, This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. 

For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.

But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.

As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. 

I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.

But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. 

I wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"The game has a lot of potential but is ran by people that don't have a vision and only care about themselves and what they think is best for the game.

I have played since 2016 Beta and have more than 10,000 hours of actual playtime on this (my personal account) and previously worked at BHVR on the game. If this was years ago.. I would have recommended the game without any question. However, with the game's current state and direction, I could never recommend it to anyone under any circumstance.

It's just going downhill and that's the reality of it. They are partnering with anyone in an attempt to stay relevant and keep quarterly stats up but that only lasts for a week and then it's back to being a dead game for the most part.

If you ever decide to work at this company, just note that your personal account is at high risk of being permanently banned if you are accused of anything and are wrongfully terminated as a result.

They will not only ban your dev account (which is fine) but your personal account as well, which is actual bullsh*t and petty. I'm living proof of this.

They won't conduct a proper and thorough investigation behind their claims before terminating an employee and will sh*t all over your 6-years of dedicated gameplay, time spent and work into a product that you once loved and cared for to the point that you even took a job to work on the game to make it better not just for yourself but for the community who also loves the game.

Clueless company making clueless decisions on a game that they're clueless about since they don't play it.

I was one of the literal few at the company who has more than 4,000 hours of actual gameplay in the game.

P.S. they still haven't fixed the IP leak vuln that has been the cause of people being DDoSed, doxed, swatted and much more. They've known about it for over 2 years now and refuse to fix something so simple while knowing what the root cause of it is and know what exactly to fix.

Just to give you an idea of how little they care... I brought this up before and during my time working there and it was never fixed. We're now going into 2023 with this vulnerability that's been in the game for over 4+ years.

Still think BHVR cares about you now? Their main focus is and always has been to make money and that's why this issue has never been addressed even though their own Fog Whisperers like Otzdarva, Elix and many others have questioned why they haven't fixed it yet and are victims to these issues.

Their priorities are all over the place and have no idea how to run a game company let alone keep the community safe. It's pretty evident that these are the facts.

They would rather ban innocent people than to solve the huge security risks and flaws in the game. It's disgusting and this type of ""behaviour"" should not be condoned.

I'm more surprised Valve/Steam is even allowing the game to remain playable on their platform considering the company refuses to fix these issues that is allowing these events take place.

Cheaters? I won't get into that. Everyone knows the answer to this already. The company looks at them as paying customers that deserve respect (direct quote from an employee that's in a leadership role btw) and would rather keep them around than get rid of them entirely.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Disclaimer: I survivor main. 

I play games for fun, not for competition, so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps, oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately, hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops), and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with), then no biggie. Next game please~

I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.

As a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up - there is always the next game :)

That being said, this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it, have fun with it, and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ;) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine - just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!), and even then, recognize that there are jerks who play this game, like any other game, and have fun while you compete!",disclaimer survivor game fun competition dbd community bad killer face camp oh die move next good killer find immediately hook bc juke whoop patrol camp 100 ok biggie next please community salt killer come dealing rank survivor properly flash killer face legitimate strategy take fun opinion killer horrible called name survivor tell gud older player ruin newer player player 1000 hour relax fun pip next crazy fun saltiness community buying grab fun ignore hard fixate ranking process unless absurdly highly competitive fine push spout anger recognize jerk fun compete,2,-0.8985

But they refused to compensate me, saying they couldn't find anything strange in their logs. Rather, they said that if you keep providing false information, you'll be punished strongly. Then, they closed the agenda obstinately. I really loved this game, but now I feel betrayed. I would never recommend it. There are so many bugs in this game and no compensation for the victim.

Hello,

Thanks for your message. We have found no evidence of lost progress in our logs so respectfully, I will be closing this ticket.

We appreciate your understanding.

This is the last answer from Buckymanny of the DBD team. In the last request, I said ""If you don't believe the information, I could give you my Steam ID and password, so if you want, tell me"". BUT He closed the agenda with this answer when nothing was been fixed.

I will try to explain why I write a negative review despite having a lot of hours and constantly playing this game to this day.
[b] The game lures people into gambling addiction!!! [/b]
If you're online enough, you could have seen people complaining over the fact that they don't really appreciate Dead by Daylight but they are unable to quit it. The fun fact is the game that is based a lot on RNG factors, aka luck, and tries to look ""competetive"" develops gambling addiction. 
You win, then you lose, after that you go for another match to show off your skills of defeating the unfair events and survive or killl every survivor. It's addiction is based on a constant feeling of irritation, the developers acknowledged it during one of their interviews. Gambling addiction funnily comes from losing, not winning. You will be annoyed by everything. By one of the most toxic communities, by poor balance decisions, countless bugs. Despite bringing the feeling of satisfaction sometimes, your mental state overall will be worse by the end of most play sessions. You won't play this game because you like it, you will play it because you're addicted to the constant feeling of surpassing the irritation. And the worst part is that you will feel rewarded because of the fact that you outsmarted players who are there to mock you and verbally abuse you by the end of a game. It's not healthy no matter how you look at it. Even if you have ""thick skin"", it's simply unenjoyable to waste your time on such people when you think about it.

Talking about the other reasons why I can't recommend this game: 
- It requires you to waste too much time grinding and paying. Licenced characters can only be purchased via real money and if you want to get original ones for free, you need to put 100 hours for each character. And there are so many of them, it may take 1000, if not more, hours to gain them all for free. 
- The developers work on their game when they WANT. The reason for that is the fact that this game does not have any competition. This brings flaws and small patches that do not really feel drastic and entertaining. Moreover, if the upcoming changes are disliked by the community, they will be rolled anyways since what can people do, find another Dead By Daylight? Money were put into creation of the things players didn't like, get it or leave. Oh, wait, you won't. 
- The game feels dull. We have no new content despite new killers and perks that kind of change gameplay. The issue here is that the perks don't do much, currently the game has a few strong perks that the community takes and the other perks are not being used at all unless a player wants to feel less powerful for some reason. And the killers often feel dull as well. Instead of constantly working on the previous perks and killers the developers prefer to make new perks and killers for the sake of pumping up money. They rarely change anything, it's lucky to have a patch with some big interesting changes at least once a year.
- The developers obviously lean towards the side that brings more money with the help of the cosmetics. It's not a secret that killer issues take much more time to be solved than the survivor ones. It brings unfairness into the game in certain cases.
- Moderation on the Steam and the official forums will literally ban you for showing any concern about the game's health. If you complain too much, well, stop spreading negativity. This creates a false sense of positivity when the community is furious at BHVR.
- The support isn't really helpful and deals with many issues quite poorly. The in-game report system only flags certain players, they won't get banned if you press a few buttons there. To have a person banned for sure you need to take extensive amount of steps and most of the times you need proof. So if you don't have your games recorded, you can't sumbit tickets to support effectively. 
- They have started doing limited time payed content, they even took out certain cosmetics that existed before that decision. Feels icky, you can see how they try to pump the money out of you. 
- You will have to close your comment section. I've never seen a community being this obsessed with leaving toxic comments on your profile. 

Please, do not support this mess. It looks fun on the outside but it's a mess.

----
I would like to mention one pretty significant thing about the game's developers that had happened at some point.
The community asked for colorblind setting for more than 4 years. This request had been dismissed until some point when the scandal occured because of it.
One of the developers called the whole thing boring. Clearly they aren't interested in wasting resources on something that won't bring them much income. The game has lost it's initial charm long time ago and has nothing passionate about it.

Dead by Daylight is an incredible product that is trapped underneath the thumb of idiots who don't know what to do with it. Every update just adds more bugs than features.
At one point, years ago, Cote had described the game as ""no longer theirs, it now belonged to the community"" which at the time I thought was beautiful. Years later, however, after new hires like Ethan, the game has belittled, ignored, and straight up asked veterans to leave.
DBD releases ptb's to put up a front that they listen to the community while then releasing multiple patches like The Twins, and Mid Chapter 4.5 that completely ignore the complaints of the community. 

After how many new things broke today, I finally had enough that I was going to submit individual bug tickets to them for every bug they've been neglecting, only to find out they've updated their website to hide bug tickets at the very bottom and shrunk the box to a 5th of the previous size, while having added tons of pictures and ads for the game, and top centering a small FAQ style technical support for things already fixed. 

BHVR is a company that actively disrespects their community, herds morons like sheep into defending their actively bad decisions by posting occasional memes, and milks the game and its players by working minimally and at their own whim while we beg and plead for them to just acknowledge they heard what we have to say.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"I absolutely love this game. The design of (most) killers, gameplay, chase interaction and being able to play with friends or by myself.

I have invested 4 years of game time into DBD. Currently sitting at just over 4K hours total. I've played through all eras of the game and all the ups/downs bugs/problems the game has had. Pre this latest patch the game was sitting at its best point in terms of playability. It absolutely had a myriad of problems but they weren't game breaking and my love for the game helped me to see past them.

However, this latest update is an absolute spit in the face to anyone who has invested any serious amount of time into the game at all. The developers changed multiple things that nobody asked for, received the feedback that nobody liked it and implemented the changes anyway. I have been playing online games for years and BEhaviour are by FAR the worst developers at both time management, choosing what to focus their resources on and ESPECIALLY player feedback. They do not listen.

Even besides the changes nobody asked for and how poorly they were implemented this newest update has also not only has more incredibly unfun breakable walls added and a shitty UI but a myriad of literal game breaking bugs. Walls with no collision, areas of the map (auto haven bus) where the killer CANNOT pass through but the survivor can- which was completely fine last patch AND on the PTB (test servers).

The developers stumbled upon a cash cow and just release skin after skin, DLC after DLC, battlepass after battlepass with no care for the people who helped build their game. They balance the game to the casuals and do not care about their core playerbase as they constantly have new players coming in dropping money on DLC's/cosmetics. I do not want to target anyone specifically but they mention in livestreams that they ""use the wiki"" to know what certain perks do- they do not even know their own game. The lead game designer who I won't name is an absolute moron, his views on the game are INCREDIBLY bad and having someone like that helm the ship is HORRIBLY unhealthy for a good player experience.

For 4 years time players have been asking for a colorblind mode in order to be able to play the game as some people were unable to see scratch marks due to their condition. For 4 years we were told ""its not on our priority list"". Only when the community REALLY made a big fuss about it did they release that they were ""happy to announce we are working on colorblind filters"". They do not care about the player, only their image.
When the last absymal twins update game out riddled with bugs they were very quick to change Moris- something players have been asking to be changed for years, an incredibly easy fix. The only reason it was changed then was to take the spotlight away from how disgusting and unprofessional their released DLC was. I cannot state enough how little they care about their playerbase.

I absolutely love Dead By Daylight. But in its current state and with the way the developers handle their game I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Do not buy this product.

Today my data, 58 hours of gameplay, was completely reset. While playing, i got a connection error, then a message saying ""The season has ended"". When i went to check out my characters, THEY WERE ALL LEVEL ONE.
now, to save yourself from this utterly horrible and game ruining experience (which i know will lead to you leaving a pretty bad review of the game), here's a fix!

STEP 1: Go to the location of your steam data, then your Dead by Daylight save. (Which in my case is OS (C:)\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\129389900\381210\remote\ProfileSaves)
STEP 2: Copy the file located within ProfileSaves to a safe location. (I leave it directly on my desktop)
OPTIONAL STEP 3: Make a Shortcut to your ProfileSaves folder and place on desktop for easy access.
STEP 4: Update your save (copy save and replace) everytime you close the game. If you dont do this, you could lose hours of progress like i did today. (I lost about 4 hours of progress)

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Dead by Daylight is a very fun [spoiler]and sometimes toxic as hell[/spoiler] 1 Killer vs 4 Survivor survival horror game with unique and interesting mechanics.
Each Killer has their own unique power and playstyle to it and each Survivors and Killer will have teachable perks that can be unlocked in their own individual progression bloodweb to ""teach"" the perks to other characters you own to let the players to be able to create their own build and perk combos.

[h1]-Game Objective-[/h1]
[b]Survivors:-[/b]
The goal of the game for the Survivors is to repair generators around the map to open the exit gates and escape the trial.
Survivors can bring items that are beneficial to their survival like flashlight to blind the killer momentarily,med-kit to heal yourself/other survivors,and using the environment to escape from the killer's chase by dropping pallets to stun the killer,and looping the killer to waste time so that other survivors can help complete other objectives in the meantime.

[b]Killer:-[/b]
The Killer will need to use their own power and scratch marks/blood trails left by survivors to track and down the survivors and hooking them to sacrifice them to the entity and ultimately preventing the Survivors from escaping the trials.
A hooked survivor will not be able to escape unless saved by a teammate or successfully unhooking themselves from the hook with a 4% chance or by using other perks.

Pre-conclusion mini-rant:-
[spoiler]Sometimes some players are going to be pretty toxic when playing dbd,there are some players who uses map exploits,teaming up with the killer,sandbagging, BM'ing or insulting others in the post game chat,and as a newbie killer,when matched against good survivors will be very frustrating as u will feel helpless against some god loops and tiles that u simply cant counter while you slowly see ur gens being rushed by other survivors and just feel like you cant do anything....but,theres no other way other than to git gud,develop better mentality and gamesense to counter the gap between.[/spoiler]
no matter how much ranting I did,I still love and enjoy playing dbd<3

[h1]Conclusion:-[/h1]
Dead by Daylight is a very good game to play with friends or by urself,and if u enjoy this type of survival horror game or being indecisive on whether or not you should get it,I'd say give it a try and make that decisive strike!

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"For years I was an every year, 1000s of hours, release day buyer for Madden. Madden 18 was so bad that I vowed to take a break for years to let them sort some shit out. Surely waiting 6 years would make M24 feel like an actual upgrade right? Nope, same old shit. For reference I am a franchise only player so IDGAF about MUT or anything else, my review is ""offline"" (it's actually forced online) franchise centric, considering this is supposed to be the official simulation experience of the NFL.

-Players feel sluggish, and just making them do what you want them to do is a struggle. Making these players do things they could do in real life is the whole point of a football game, but it still feels like running in quicksand. 

-Aggressive catch was useless in M18 and before, it's still useless. Same goes for possession WRs. Madden somewhere along the line decided that it should simply be impossible to complete a pass in traffic unless you're in MUT using Moss. An elite 95+ spec and CIT receiver 1 on 1 with a corner 6 inches shorter in real life is an auto throw and very likely a huge completion. In madden, it is either just dropped inexplicably, picked, or popped up in the air. There just isn't really an animation for catching a pass over a defender. It's utterly bizarre that this has gone unaddressed for a half a decade+. A very common type of receiver and play is simply not viable even 10% of the time in madden. I play with the Colts mostly, and Michael Pittman Jr. isn't Tyreek Hill, but he should be able to separate and make tough catches. But in madden there's simply no value in receivers who win via anything but speed and he isn't any fun to use. Make it make sense.

-these are NFL players, but sometimes it feels like I can't get them to do something I would be able to as a regular person because controls are so sluggish and unpolished. It isn't fun to control these guys, which is a pretty major part of a sports game.

-trench play still doesn't feel realistic. I have Quenton Nelson on my team but he doesn't feel powerful or smart at all.

-it's still very noticeable that the AI has very different rules for itself vs you, which is a terrible piece of game design. The beauty of the NFL is how coldly equal it is for everyone, and you don't get that from madden. Balls my players can reach they'll inexplicably short arm, while the CPU makes plays you know your players never would. 

-The commentators are still the worst in sports games. Delayed and nonsensical reactions. Massive moments don't feel like it, whereas they'll treat a missed preseason FG like it lost the super bowl. Madden should have multiple teams of commentators to keep it fresh, and have much more grandiose of a scope of lines recorded to pull from. If they were innovative I'd say they should start to look into use of AI to help make realistic real time reactions to stuff, I think the possibilities there are so exciting, but we all know EA doesn't innovate.

-still animation based gameplay

Now the thing I am even more qualified to comment on is the inner workings of franchise and team building. OOTP is the gold standard for this and I'll reference it a bunch because of that, but every sports franchise blows madden out of the water here. And again, disappointingly little progress has been made here, sometimes it is worse. 

-AI still feels less alive than any other sports video game. No game is perfect at immersion, but madden is truly bottom tier still. No adjustments are ever made by the CPU. Baffling team building logic. OOTP transports me to a new world, madden makes it painfully clear at all stops that it is a soulless video game made by a company that wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. 

-Bugs everywhere, and the menu is sooo slow. I'm running a 3070/5800x build and the gameplay runs fine fps wise, but the menus still are like pulling teeth. I have heard people with worse computers not even being able to open the game.

-Compounding slow menus, the UI is somehow worse than when I quit madden half a decade back. 

-Scouting, also somehow worse. You literally have to fire your whole scouting department and rehire a new one every preseason to scout effectively. If madden doesn't care to make scouting realistic or fun (this iteration of scouting is neither) then why make it part of the game at all? OOTP doesn't have a scouting mechanic- you hire a scout, with money that you could have used elsewhere, and then you simply have to put trust into that scout that their evaluations are better than other teams' scouts. If you skimped on paying for a great scout you'll have consequences, but paying for the best scout means less money for players, developments, etc. It is different, but 100X more immersive and realistic than madden. I love scouting if done right, but if you don't care to do it right, you end up with a process that just feels painful as it does in M24 and would be better off without it entirely.

-I heard some say madden's created draft classes are improved, but I don't really see it. It's still a shell of what it could be, and still isn't realistic at all. I don't see varied enough skillsets, I still see far too many bad athletes, I see unrealistic skillsets, the terrible scouting system. I did enjoy that scouting grades aren't so specific anymore-""day 3"" as a designation rather than ""round 5"" leaves it open to that player going anywhere from round 3 to undrafted, so if you like a guy you gotta take him. More realistic than before at least.

-not franchise specific per se, but one of my biggest sticking points that I honestly cannot believe has still not been addressed- positional designations. Mind mindbogglingly, draft prospects are *still* shoehorned into being ""LG"" or ""ROLB"" or ""FS,"" when in real life guys are seen much more generally as an OT prospect, an off ball LB prospect, a pass rusher, etc. It makes absolutely no sense, all it does is needlessly complicate things. How has this still not been made more realistic? Get rid of the left vs right BS, that is not how any draft analyst actually looks at prospects, and all it does it add multiple extra menus to scouting that are needless. Especially when madden lets you edit any offensive lineman to any other position with no penalty- another thing they should address.

-Not only do they still bizarrely specify things like left vs right guard, they use positional names out of 2001. LE/RE/DT/OLB/MLB for every team and scheme still? No edge rusher designation? Absolutely embarrassing for everyone involved with this game that this has not been updated in 20 years. Players on defense should be listed as such- interior defenders, pass rushers, off ball linebackers, safeties, corners, with variations within- tweener iDL-edge players, LB/S hybrids, etc. This has been how it works for a long time now IRL, and updating it would simplify it so much! Instead, we *still* have 4-3 teams signing pass rushers with 40 coverage to play off ball, or 3-4 teams with 240 pound 3techs. It hurts my brain how little effort and knowledge it would take for madden to make this change, and what a difference it would make in the quality of their product, and they still haven't. Shameful. 


I could go on, but what's the point? Whoever is making decisions for this franchise decided long ago that integrity or pride was much less important than the bottom line, so they'll keep putting out $70 roster updates designed to take money from small children via MUT. If the NFL understood the importance of a good official video game for a sport, they'd have some standards for EA, but it doesn't look like that will ever happen. TL;DR- buggy, boring, soulless, don't buy. I'll get my hours in, if only to get my money's worth and see if I can get a workable experience to last me another half decade before I give this company money again.

This is quite possibly the worst Madden game EVER produced. I haven't bought one in a few years so I figured I was due. BIG MISTAKE. Do not believe the lies about improved anything or added features. The features added are either useless, broken or both. They're also just re-added features from old Madden games that are poorly re-implemented. 

-1 out of 5 running plays will have a holding penalty so it's basically pointless. I had to turn off holding completely to be able to run the ball.
-Controller will drop input at random either in menus or during plays. Happens more often in menus resulting in random scrolling.
-Route running gets broken during press coverage and receivers just run around random directions or right out of bounds. They also just stop running routes at random. Slant route? You meant stop running at the hash mark right? Picked.
-Random frame rate drops for no reason at all.
-Constant mini-freezing in menus when trying to call plays.
-Probably removed more features from franchise mode than they added, and the implementation on those added are awful copy and pastes from past games. 
-""Manage team"" is a whole menu just to rebuild your entire stadium, to the same 6 templates they had 10 years ago, or relocate. No upgrades, no renovations. Absolutely nothing new at all, just half way re-added features from old games.
-Absolutely ridiculous glitchy ball carriers breaking 10 tackles, spinning out of a massive pile up and running 80 yards for a TD. Don't worry though, most long runs get called back for holding even if it's 50 yards behind the play.
-The training camp drills are broken. They're either glithched to the point of being pointless (Pass rush tunnel drill. The linemen will follow you down the tunnel and get in the way) Or just about learning to exploit buggy AI (WR Red Zone Drill. The only way to get the top score is to run whip routes over and over again). The ""drills"" are pointless and have no application on how to play Madden or football.
-Commentary is the worst I've ever heard. Pointless rambling that has nothing to do with what is happening. Or things like ""That Ravens defense was really great last week in their win against Baltimore."" Zero quality control as usual.

My first instinct was to refund immediately and I should have listened. I'm going to play a few seasons of franchise mode and go back to College Football Revamped because NCAA 14 is a better game than any Madden in the last decade.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"The last iteration of Madden football I've played was Madden 12 back when it was still a decent game.  I've been playing Madden football since Madden 94 so I'm pretty old.  I've watched the Angry Joe reviews and read a lot of the negative reviews for the last few years of Copy and Paste Football.  STILL... I decided after weighing the pros and cons (and after a strong pint of Sierra Nevada Imperial Stout) that maybe, just maybe, it has gotten better and maybe things have changed and the people being salty about it are just spoiled.  So I bought it.

After taking forever to download, I loaded the game which allowed me to pick my team (Raiders) and adjust the QB throwing accuracy mechanisms.  Cool right?  Well, after I completed that pass from Jimmy G to Davante... it freezes.  It just froze.  OK, no problem, I'll just run task manager, shut it off and restart right?  Open the game again, attempt a practice mode, game freezes while on the load screen.  I try again, restart game, pick practice mode, loading screen, game freezes again.  WTF?!?

Other than my CPU being a bit old which hasn't affected my gaming experience with games like Red Dead Redemption 2, NBA 2k23, Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3 etc..., I have all of the recommended specs on my computer.  Nvidia Geforce 1660, 32GB of RAM, well over 50GB of HD space, all the software requirements with DirectX and this game just freezes every time I try to play some NFL football.  

Fine, I'll lower the graphics requirements on the settings menu so I do that and IT STILL FREEZES!!! I updated my drivers on Geforce Experience, same freezing.  After an hour or so of this, I've had enough.  I'm not going to spend more time on this game trying to trial and error why it's freezing so before I'm ineligible to do so, I request a refund from Steam.  

The worst part about this game is I didn't even get to experience the flawed game mechanics, the copy and paste programming, the MUT cards and any of the other crap everyone hates about modern Madden Football because of constant freezing in the loading screen.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Well EA, you've done it. You have made (by far) the worst Madden Franchise game I've seen as a player since Madden 2005. The amount of stupid things that happen throughout your gaming experience is enough to give a 23 year old a heart attack. I primarily play Franchise mode with friends in my time on this game and the amount of problems are truly insane that I must break them down by literal aspects of the game. 

For starters, if it wasn't obvious I play as the Miami Dolphins for my franchise primarily on All-Madden and the defense is literally broken naturally that you must alter damn near every aspect of it to play it properly, unless you want Bradley Chubb and Jaelen Phillips dropping into coverage... Now, lets continue with the defensive issues. You cannot tackle. It's literally impossible. The running backs break every fucking tackle - whether its aggressive, conservative or hit stick, they're bouncing off dudes like crazy and the receivers are only slightly easier to tackle. CPU pass blocking is unparalleled in strength, they get so much time in the pocket its crazy, 85 overall speed rusher Jaelen Philips has a whopping 3 sacks through 10 games and 80 overall power rusher Bradley Chubb has just 4 on the other side of the line. The pass coverage reaction is abysmal which is disappointing as I had seen many clips that showed it being improved for this years version of the game, however my DB's who are literally Jalen Ramsay, Jevon Holland and Xavien Howard, get smoked every fucking play and don't play the ball at all; then if you make the coaching adjustments to play the ball you can write off every possible tackle after catch you even had a chance of as they will soar right by them without hesitation. Now, lets by chance say you get an interception... the CPU doesn't worry because the ancient tight end Mercedes Lewis will run down Jalen Ramsay in a straight away going the other direction. No fucking way that ever happens. 

Now lets discuss the offense, going inversely to the issues on defense. My players never break a tackle, only time it happens is if I get the spam A break tackle prompt and i hit it, but even then it only shows up when I am smack in the center of 5 defenders so whats the use. My pass blocking is horrendous, like last year I notice moments where my tackle doesn't even touch the defender rushing. I'm running for my life and get unbelievable negative plays as a result and even with adjustments being made such as keeping a tight end in or a half back to pick up some stray blocks it just doesn't matter. Then this fucking momentum meter has some severely stupid enhancements - and let me be clear, I do like the momentum meter. However - in what situation does momentum make it so I don't even know my receivers??? That is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Another issue I run into is in my season with the Denver Broncos I can't throw a go route to save my life. Dude will be wide open with 5 yards separation from the receiver and that sucker gets under thrown every time - its amazing. I have been Tyreek Hill with the ball in my hands on a straight away and a man chased me down running at an angle up the field, again, never going to happen. 

Even special teams is broken. I had 3 games in the rain and windy, the wind is not accurate. Playing in clear conditions my kicker can hit from 62 going full power, playing with 13 mph winds going in favor of me the ball came up way short from 59 out. Playing in rain with the wind going 16 mph up and to the right, aimed the kick ever so slightly to the left to adjust for it and the ball went hard left like i was aiming in to section G on my left hand side. 

Fix the fucking game. Make the game fair. Make harder difficulties be harder because they play smarter not make them broken and literally impossible to tackle. Make it so they have fucking clock management for fuck sake, for yet another year the CPU will run out of time going into half time on the 25 yard line in clear field goal range when they started their drive with 3 full time-outs. Game has promise but has sever game breaking issues in key spots that make it no fun.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Ordinarily i wouldn't have anything to say about this game, but after reading a bunch of existing reviews and deciding to just say screw it and buying it, i feel i must share my perspective, in case anyone else out there is in a similar situation as i was.
I noticed fairly early on that like 80-90% of the negative reviews are from people who have bought every single iteration of the game for the last decade-plus. the last one i played was Madden 2000 for the Playstation 1 back when i was 6 years old. I have absolutely no frame of reference for all the little (again, to ME they're little) details with which most of them have complaints.
My friend and I were looking for non-shooter games we could play cross-platform PC to PS5, and since we've been watching more college and NFL games together and i've been teaching him the little i know about it, he said he'd like to try a football game. As luck would have it, this game gives us exactly what we were looking for - cross-platform football.
Is it a perfectly refined and polished game? no. sadly, very few games today are. some of the menus are a little laggy and unresponsive, and there are occasional moments where you have to ask yourself ""just what the hell happened on that play?"" but overall, i've been having a great deal of fun jumping back into the Madden franchise with this game.
If you're like me and haven't played a Madden game in a long time and are just looking to get back into some football, don't let the negative reviews put you off.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Here is my take from a 39 year old who grew up loving the jets on N64 with Curtis Martin and the Z button being the Juke move that broke players ankles like crazy and then played most Maddens until 2016 then stopped mainly because  they put in designing your own plays and having your own playbooks then stopped that.

Some things you must know.  
1.) i rarely play it online
2.) Ultimate team is not something i get into because it just feels like those PTW ""free"" games on a mobile ap that means whoever has the biggest wallet wins.  
3.) i enjoy playing franchise mode
4.) i play on simulation
5.) I dont use the sticks for much of the hitting or ball placements except in rare occasions as its just to much to relearn all the time 

Its a solid football game.    Its far from perfect and there can be a lot of things that could be improved, but its got the players in the NFL, its got stats, whether you agree with them or not is subjective, tit plays well.  I run the game on my laptop and i use my Refurbished deck, which the only reason i even got it was the sale price and the additional 20% refurbished version was a steal for this madden game.  I do have to run it in streaming mode but once i run it in streaming mode the deck controls work perfectly and its fantastic.  Now if they made it work fully just on the Deck Alone... i feel like they might hit another market out there.   

I say all this so you understand, i run the game on my LAPTOP gaming computer with 16 gigs of ram a 3050 and a I5 CPU, that streams the game to my Deck and i just turn the deck to 10 fps and watts to use it as a controller only and get 6-8 hours of battery off of it and watch the game on my laptop or use an HDMI cord to plus the laptop into the TV and play it that way.   

I don't experience input lag, in fact this is the first madden in such a long time i can remember enjoying the running game A LOT in.  Blockers picking up blocks is a huge thing.  Having a shitty blocker in front of you with bad awareness or run block stats is really noticeable.   (Makes me really wish they would put more love in to the full backs so that they would be as effective as they are in game but small gripe)   The running in the game is just crisp.  the days of tacklers just brushing against you to tackle you while engaged must have stopped a while ago.  The holes open and close in zone running schemes in ways that feel like you can pick the hole and run through.  

The passing can seem pretty interesting as i have seen line backers vary their depth against the same play, albeit very rarely but  i have seen it, and the speed of receivers and route running ability is still pretty damn paramount.  I quite enjoy taking the game, and just playing it.  Its not a game i want to buy at 70$ USD, honestly id buy it at launch if they made the single player game 30 or 40$ USD at launch and sold the multiplayer separately.  Madden to me is best played in the house with people around so that if you want to talk shit or be bitter you have to do it face to face.  Want to try to run out the clock?  take the verbal barbs of being called all kinds of names for ""not playing the game"".  

This game is not transcendent or some kind of perfect football game by any means but for fans of teams... especially those teams that are not playing great in a  season it certainly quenches the thirst for sure.  I wont bu the game at full price  maybe ever again, but all these reviews that say its terrible?  Just don't buy it for a few years and keep playing the same one, eventually the game will feel good again.  Its not an every year purchase unless you want to chase that ultimate team money sink...

I recently got into football (2021) and decided I may as well pick up a Madden game for fun and this one was half off despite only being a few months old. Thats a massive red flag, but honestly I'd say it was worth it.

I only play franchise and superstar modes, I'm not interested in h2h or MUT. So far the experience has been great. The game works well enough that I have an enjoyable time.

That said, this is not me recommending the game to you, the average Madden player. If you play these games a lot more than I do than I'm sure you'll run into infuriating issues nonstop. The other day I was unable to play superstar mode because I couldn't connect to the league (????) and so I had to either play a quick match or play nothing. I only loaded up madden to play this (what should be an offline) experience and I couldn't. Other things of note are that people constantly get stuck on each other and it just ruins the timings of routes and the expectations of where a receiver should be when the ball is thrown. This wouldn't be a problem if there was adequate feedback that they were stuck, but they continue whatever running animation they're in, but just stuck in place.

Overall I cannot recommend a yearly sports game. That's to be expected. If you keep letting EA and 2k defecate in your mouth and then start chewing after, they're going to continue making bad games.

252490,Rust,"So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.

Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.

Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.

I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.

Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.

Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning.

252490,Rust,"Once upon a time in Rust, in less cringy format, recollected to the best of my memory.

Together with the help of a random friend, I made a small, simple base and proceeded to work on gathering resources for I'd say about 20 hours, upgrading said base along the way as it was my intent to turn it into a farm.

I was getting harrassed by a small group of people every now and then but they didn't seem really interested in raiding, just camping or taking whatever kits they could get from our exchanges.

After a small conversation in outpost, I realized something very important about landmines, something that seemed very unused at the time.

Out of spite from the exchanges that got nowhere, I decided to put all my efforts into crafting possibly over a hundred landmines, surrounding the area around the base with them. There were many bushes and grass around the area, making it easy to hide those mines.

After that, I started armoring the base, changing specific stone walls to metal walls, and more important (and some fake) walls with high qual.

A couple of hours later when working on furnaces I started hearing the sound of certain landmines popping, often chain detonating as one detonated the other. A couple more exchanges later and some kits I took and another group of people got entangled into the mess, a larger clan, which also ended up getting killed by the landmines, several times. The explosions and constant fights however, seemingly attracted more and more people, nakeds, smaller groups, duos and people trying to cash in by getting kills and kits from others.

I had upgraded what I could, with whatever resources I had left. Occasionally using what kits I could salvage to do a little bit more shooting, but most of the time as a solo you're not getting anywhere when there's such a large amount of players expecting you. Wipe was almost at hand, so I didn't really mind.

The honeycombed walls didn't last long, and it certainly wasn't longer until they got through to where they wanted. But even then, people still kept dying to more landmines. I had honestly lost count of how many I had placed around, of how many resources were used. But boy did I have a smile on my face, knowing that as soon as they got into the TC, there was really nothing I had in terms of resources other than a couple stacks of high qual and metal scrap. And I'm more than sure that the amount of gear lost to the landmines, as they [b]destroy items[/b] in one's inventory if they die to one, was not worth what was found there.

TL;DR I used every single resource gathered over a wipe to make a large amount of people most likely lose an enormous quantity of their work and resources for almost nothing.

11/10 would do it again.

252490,Rust,"After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote ""Sorry guys :D"" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be ""shoot-on-sight?"" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. 

All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game.

Perhaps spawn in the North Pole and get eaten by a fatass polar bear.

Infinite has the core mechanics locked down, even the art style, similar to the bungie era titles. Your spartan is quick and maneuverable, like H2/H3/HR. But not stupidly fast like the cracked out junkie spartan you had in H4/H5. The insider flight tests were amazing, feedback was great, and as millions would say, ""halo is back"". And then the multiplayer actually came out, in beta form, and was so ass backwards from everything they said it would be in the marketing and teasing of the game. Its a desperate cash grab at this point, and everyone knows it.

6 years of development, 100+ employees and 500 million in funding, and yet infinite still, to this day, has less content than that of a $40 game like aliens: fire team elite. They made half of the game ""frEE tO pLaY"", but still charged full price of $60 for the other half of the game. They claimed ""halo reach levels of customization"", yet a good 85%+ of all cosmetics are locked behind pay walls and based on FOMO. I've had the same blue & red armor colors since H2, and jolly roger emblem for 18 years. And yet I can't even get that color combo/emblem in infinite. And even if I could, I wouldn't be surprised if 343 tried to charge me for them.

The campaign is actually very good, and for the 1st time in 12 years, I actually enjoyed playing a halo campaign. It took me probably 4 or so years to actually muster the energy to force myself to play & beat H5's campaign. But I beat infinite's in just a few days, and enjoyed it doing so. I absolutely despised fighting the prometheans in H4 and especially H5. It felt like a chore fighting against them, but fighting against the banished in infinite was like how it always was in the 10 years of halo under bungie...actually fun and enjoyable.

I have zero motivation to play halo infinite. I only come back when they have the special events going on, as to try to unlock all the cosmetics. And during that time, I just hate it. All the desync issues are absolutely killing the enjoyment for me. Grenades keep disappearing immediately after you thrown them. Grenades never stick, or they do stick, then just vanish into thin air. Rockets don't shoot or explode. You'll get melee'd in the front, with full shields, yet somehow get insta killed anyways from a ""back smack"" or assassination. You hit someone point blank with a grav hammer, they don't die, but they can swing it 20ft away from you and still kill you somehow. 

Halo infinite is so far beyond broken and unfinished, its unreal. I thought they couldn't do any worse than than H5...but here we are. 260k players on steam, at launch, to less than 7k daily. They should have just delayed it for another 2 years. 343 have sh*t all over the halo franchise in the 12 years they've had it. They had everything going for them this time around, but still managed to colossally f*ck it up. Thanks for sh*tting on mine, and millions of others childhood, 343 industries.

1240440,Halo Infinite,"[h1]As of the new roadmap revealed today, this game is absolutely NOT worth your time.[/h1]

As a very long time fan of Halo, this game is an incredible display of how incompetent 343 is as game dev, the lack of content almost a year in is absurd, them completely canceling the inclusion of couch co-op is unironically the final nail in the coffin. It's taken them 1 YEAR to add FOUR maps 2 of which aren't even here yet, and we have to wait until March 2023 to see ONE new gun. The balance of this game is one of the worst I've ever played, controller is a direct upgrade to M+KB with the ridiculous aim assist, the pistol is the least fun gun to use and fight against since it can out DM a BR/sniper at any range for whatever reason, the maps are the most basic boring 3 lane ""competitive"" focused things I've ever played in a Halo game. I genuinely regret all the time I put into Infinite to have such a negative time playing this garbage, them bowing down to every complaint some YT/Twitch ""influencer"" you've never heard of has made killed this game, their focus of competitive first rather than fun is the worst thing that's ever happened to Halo.

343's outright refusal to add old fan favorite content from previous games in favor of being ""fresh and new"" shows just how much they do not care what people say, the lack of content could be so easily fixed if they- I dunno- added the maps people love from the previous games, you know the thing that the previous games did as well? No way, that'd be too much of a good idea.

This isn't even mentioning the absolute egregious monetization they have going on in the game, they proudly claimed that there isn't going to be any kind of FOMO before the game launched, but then proceeded to base every limited time in-game event on FOMO. Sure it may be ""free"" but you're forced to do some of the least fun challenges in their limited time gamemodes to progress in the battlepass, and there's a limited number of challenges you can do in a day, so you absolutely have to wait until the next day to continue the miserable grind. If your idea of a free battlepass is to force the player to do daily ""chores"", it's an awful idea.

There's too much to talk about, I'm sure you can go look at a number of other reviews that list just how much is missing from this game, I'm too tired to talk about it all.

1240440,Halo Infinite,"TLDR: Halo infinite is a fundamentally good, fun to play game which is ruined by a broken engine/servers and a company that is both extremely greedy and incapable of listening to player feedback. 

Game is so close to being good, but 343 clearly doesn't give a shit about their community at all.

Gameplay is actually really fun, when it works. It's a fast paced multiplayer shooter with good movement mechanics and pretty decent gunplay. I think the game is absolutely beautiful, and performance (FPS) is usually decent, if somewhat inconsistent across maps.

The problem is that there seem to be many issues with the game engine. First off, the servers are sketchy - sometimes performance is perfect, then drops to unplayable within the same game. Ping is often inconsistent, stutter/delay on any given player action is commonplace. Client/server desync is rampant, you'll die behind walls more in one game of Halo than you ever will in any other FPS. Rocket launcher doesn't 1 hit kill like 25% of the time. Projectiles disappear. Melee attacks don't register. Melee attack damage seems to vary randomly. Shots don't always register. Grenades disappear or do no damage. Guns ""jam"" randomly, preventing you from firing. Grav hammer damage is extremely inconsistent. Powerups sometimes don't trigger, or trigger the cooldown without the ability activating. Player collision doesn't exist, or is extremely spotty if it does, despite what 343 says. The majority of the time you find a BTB match with a friend, you will not be in the same squad, and their nametag is the same color as everyone else's. These are just a few I can come up with off the top of my head.

Honestly, none of these issues would be game breaking on their own. But there are so many tiny issues in EVERY SINGLE GAME that it drives you crazy if you play enough. I feel like I never know if I messed up or the game did:

""Did I just miss all my shots? Or did the server not register the hits, again?"" 
""Did they get a nice angle on me for the kill? Or did I just get shot through the wall, again?""
""Was I too far away to kill with that gravhammer or was that desync, again?""
""Did they react faster than me? Or did my melee not do any fucking damage, again?""

There is also a large disparity between controller and KBM users. This game was designed to be played with a controller and it shows. You can look up accuracy stats, controller players have better shot accuracy across the board. I realize that aim assist is an integral part of Halo, but it's still fucking annoying to get lasered down with an AR by someone with the movement of a potato, something that is actually impossible for a PC player to do consistently because of bloom. I think 343 needs to look at accuracy stats weapon by weapon and make some adjustments to bullet magnetism or something so that there is parity between KBM and controller (even if this ends up making some other weapons relatively worse on KBM).

Cosmetics suck. This game was supposed to be the pinnacle of ""make your own spartan,"" instead it's the worst customization they've ever had in a halo game unless you pay a fuck ton of money and/or grind out the entire battle pass. YOU CAN'T EVEN PICK YOUR OWN FUCKING COLORS. Whatever greedy corporate asshole is in charge of this game's monetization policy needs to be fired.

The battle pass progression also sucks. The challenges, where you get all your significant XP, are artificially difficult/gamemode specific and make you choose between progressing the battle pass and enjoying the game. You can't choose which gamemode you queue into, so if you get a gamemode-specific challenge, you have to just keep queueing and hope you get put into the right gamemode for your challenge. Per-match XP is laughable at a flat rate of 50xp per match, your medals have absolutely no bearing on your XP. You went 3/20 and lost the game in 2 minutes? 50xp. You went 35/5, singlehandedly captured 3 flags, and got a running riot? 50xp. Fuck you 343i.

Oh, you finally leveled up! Maybe you'll get a sick new armor piece, or a nice weapon skin! 
Nah just kidding, enjoy your challenge swap, which 343i has generously added to your battle pass so that you can PAY to get around their borderline broken progression system. Seriously, just name the item ""corporate greed,"" that's the only reason it exists.

I'm being pretty cynical here, because 343i continues to not fix any of these issues. In the 8ish months since the game came out, they have added two new maps and a few new gamemodes, and have made zero improvements to any of the issues I listed above. I want to love this game but if I play it any longer I'm gonna go insane.

In all, Halo infinite is a fundamentally good, fun to play game which is ruined by a broken engine/servers and a company that is both extremely greedy and incapable of listening to player feedback.

EDIT: 4 months later they have fixed nothing and added nothing. The gameplay was fun enough to bring me back despite all the flaws, so take that as you will. Everything besides the gameplay itself is utter dogshit. Microsoft needs to fire every single person responsible for this garbage fire and start Halo over again. Fuck you 343.

EDIT 2: A little over a year later, I no longer play at all. I gave the game another shot around the release of Season 3 and Forge, which was fun when it worked, but the Forge experience was absolutely terrible - the browser for custom games was shit, joining a game in progress didn't work like 75% of the time, just a terrible, clunky mess blocking access to some really fun gameplay (seeing a pattern here???).

Unfortunately, you have to wait a relatively long time for the game to find a match, the average waiting time can often be 2-5 minutes, this is a huge deterioration compared to the previous ~10 seconds, although this is understandable in terms of the number of simultaneous players.

1240440,Halo Infinite,"If you want a review from a hardcore Halo fan, here it is. I grew up on Halo, I lived and breathed Halo my entire youth, and I can say with absolute confidence this game feels like Halo. The campaign for this game is a massive step in the right direction for 343 compared to the previous 2 titles. I enjoyed my play through on Heroic from front to back. I don't want to spoil any of the story, but I will say that it lacks in a couple of departments. However, the good outweighs the bad overall and I would definitely play it again when co-op is added. If you can get the story mode on sale for around $30-40, I found it to be worth around that price. However...I have to talk about the other half of this game.

The multiplayer mode of this game had so much potential. When it first came out, I absolutely could not get enough. The maps, the new guns, everything felt so right and I felt a happiness I hadn't for a long time. I wasn't even that mad about the 10 dollar price for the battlepass, as I felt that for the most part, the content you got was worth it (Especially if you have fond memories of Halo: Reach). 343 was extremely vocal about all the content / bug fixes / updates they had planned. I was so overly excited for all of these things, and I felt that for once I could actually believe in 343 Industries. However, as time went on, and I became more distant from the honeymoon phase of the game, I began to feel the burnout. 343 had not been up to schedule on everything they said they were, and the excuses kept coming. Something was wrong, but there was still enough hope in the community for them to pull through. I finished the battlepass, and eventually stopped playing. Since then, season 2 has released. However, the community has been extremely vocal about the slew of issues presented with this new season. Unfortunately, it seems that 343 has all but lied throughout the launch and post-launch of this game. I want to like this game, I really do, but its getting to the point where its becoming impossible. Somehow, if a couple years from now they have fixed the multiplayer, and people are having fun, I will return. But until then, I wouldn't waste my time.

1240440,Halo Infinite,"Ok let's get right into it and I'm not going to sugar coat anything. As a preface, I am a long time, 20-year Halo fan who's been positively impacted by Halo and all the experiences that came from it.  I've done it all, split screen and LAN parties all night to finally getting internet to play Halo 3 online when that came out. I absolutely love Halo and everything about it. Therefore, it saddens me greatly to see the current state of Halo (and gaming in general). 343 had 6 years to get this game right, 6 YEARS and they still mostly flopped. By wanting to ""reach a broader audience"" they watered down and ruined the identity of Halo. This is nothing more than a theft of a beloved IP, using its name to steal money from the consumers. 343 AND Microsoft (yes, we can't only blame 343 because this is Microsofts flagship IP, afterall) ruined this franchise.

The only positive things about this game are that the gameplay and campaign are actually pretty decent. Other than that, we don't have Forge and we have no idea when or if that's going to happen, no split screen or co-op campaign, no progressions system, customization is in shambles and locked behind paywalls. It's garbage. They claim that the multiplayer is free to play but is it really? We all know that most of us got the campaign when it came out which was $60. That's the typical price for a game with both single and multiplayer. So really, this ""free to play"" multiplayer seems like an excuse for Microsoft and 343 to have their atrocious online store and battle pass systems. Absolutely pathetic and disgraceful.

Really the whole AAA gaming industry is pathetic and disgraceful. How many more Cyberpunks, GTA Onlines (the current and upcoming plans for it, anyways), Battlefield 2042's, Call of Duty's, and Halo: Infinite's are we going to take before something changes? I don't care if 343 gets this game to a completed state NEXT YEAR because this should have been completed on release. That's what I expected when I payed for this game (or any game) to be - in a completed state on release. Not having forge, customization, a progression system, theater, split-screen, co-op campaign, etc. is the Battlefield 2042 equivalent of calling a scoreboard and voice-chat ""legacy features"".

Do not recommend and never will until 343/Microsoft/the gaming industry, have finally and truly learned their lesson.

1240440,Halo Infinite,"Halo infinite has potential to be one of the best online experiences out there, but sadly it's held back by many issues that become more and more apparent the more you play the game.

When i first posted my review the game had one of the worst progression systems i ever seen, you pretty much got little to no experience for playing the game, just 50xp per match excluding challenges and that was it
so you needed 1000xp per level, and basically had to play like 2000 matches to get to lvl 100 in the battle pass, can you imagine that?

343 did make ""some"" improvements (now you get more xp for the first few matches of the day and then go back to 50xp) but you still don't get bonus xp for playing the objective, winning or doing well, so it doesn't really matter if you win or lose since you're getting pretty much the same amount either way

Now lets move on the bane of my life, the frigging challenges... how did 343 think this was a good idea is beyond me, they used to be close to impossible (like those of some very specific guns that spawn in some very specific modes or maps that you get to play like once every 3-5 matches, let alone all people rushing for the same thing, not being able to choose what mode you wanted to play made this 100 times worse)

This resulted in 2 main issues, (1) being ""Leavers"" since this system encouraged people to insta-leave if they didn't get the gun/mode or whatever thing they needed (something that's still plaguing games to this day), it was even worse in competitive matches and some other modes since new players couldn't join already started matches, so you basically had to 2v4 people if you was unfortunate enough to have this happen to you (happens to me like 20-30% of the time lately)

Oh yeah, you can't rejoin competitive games if you lose connection, and you have no option to surrender if people leave, so you're pretty much stuck playing a losing battle or risk getting banned if you leave too

Now lets say you don't care about progression/customization and don't mind playing ""Grey"" VS ""Grey"" forever and just wanted to play the game and have fun, sadly you can't because you'll be hit with the second main issue, (2) ""People not caring about the objective/winning"", and instead just focusing on completing challenges, so now you're stuck with someone worst than a bot, awesome!

343 did try to improve the stupid challenges and replace them with some actual doable ones, but i have to admit i still absolutely hate that system, its simply too tedious and adds nothing to the game other than forcing you to use terrible guns you hate & play modes you don't even enjoy and possibly ruin matches for your teammates on your way, by the time you finally finish them you'll end up with 0 time to actually enjoy the game and have fun..

Now to other issues i noticed:
- I'm starting to notice cheaters, they just had to ruin yet another game, but this was to be expected with the MP becoming F2P..
- There is no way to report them as far as i know, please correct me if i'm wrong
- You still can't choose what specific mode you want to play, quick play and ranked will randomly make you play one of 4 modes (Odd ball, capture the flag, slayer & capture the zones), i did enjoy all those modes when i was still new but Oddball and Capture the flag makes my skin crawl now after being forced to play them over and over 3-4 times in a row, please 343 have mercy :(
i simply wish i could play just slayer in ranked, but sadly i can't as of now.
- Big team battles are still broken to this day, servers will randomly stop players from joining so you'll have to keep queuing over and over (sometimes you'll even be forced to restart the game) and hope it'll finally allow you to join a match
- the free battlepass itself is terrible in my opinion, i'm at lvl 43 and i feel like i have close to nothing that's actually decent (it seems like most of it are just ""Challenge swaps"" you use with those terrible challenges i mentioned earlier)
i've seen someone say 343 rigged challenges on purpose to force people to buy xp boosters and challenge swaps, sometimes you can't help but think its the truth

So in short what i think the devs should do is:
- Let us earn bonus xp with kills, wins, playing the objective .. etc and rely less on challenges
- Keep improving challenges and make them less tedious, show us how many we finished and how many we have left (i'd prefer if you stopped forcing people to play modes they don't like)
- Let us choose what specific mode we want to play across all playlists, you have a healthy playerbase you don't need to group everything up
- Allow us to report cheaters and toxic people
- i know you need to make money but maybe give us better & more free customization items?
- Improve customization in general since its pretty limited at the moment, and chill with the monetization, do you really have to force people to pay 10$ for the color blue?
- Fix Big team battles, that mode is awesome and its a shame seeing it the way it is right now..
- Give us an option to surrender if we're missing players in ranked, or don't penalize us for leaving if there are only 2 players left
- Improve player collision, i've had so many melee hits not registering..
- Allow us to rejoin matches if we crash or lose connection.

Despite everything i mentioned i still like this game and and consider it to be one of the best out there (that opinion does change when its terrible systems get to me, and i have to admit i did find myself feeling worse than if i haven't played it in some days) but i still have faith in 343 and hope they'll be able to turn this around soon enough.


Edit: After wasting many more hours being forced to play modes i hate with some of the worst guns in the game only to get close to nothing in return i feel like i'm done with it for now.

You'll enjoy this game best when you're still new, but once the ""coolness"" wears off and you start paying attention to all the issues it has you will slowly get tired of it until you just can't keep going anymore, what a shame..",halo infinite potential best online experience sadly held issue apparent posted worst progression system pretty 50xp per excluding challenge needed 1000xp per basically 2000 match lvl 100 battle pas imagine 343 improvement xp match 50xp bonus xp objective winning matter win lose pretty let move bane life frigging challenge 343 good idea close impossible specific gun spawn specific mode map 3 5 match alone rushing able choose mode wanted 100 time worse resulted 2 issue 1 leaver encouraged insta leave gun mode whatever needed plaguing game worse competitive match mode new player join already started match basically 2v4 unfortunate happen happens 20 30 lately oh yeah rejoin competitive game lose connection option surrender leave pretty stuck losing battle risk banned leave let care progression customization mind grey v grey forever wanted fun sadly issue 2 caring objective winning focusing completing challenge stuck someone worst bot awesome 343 improve stupid challenge replace actual doable one admit hate simply tedious add forcing terrible gun hate mode enjoy possibly ruin match teammate finally finish 0 enjoy fun issue noticed starting notice cheater ruin expected mp f2p report far please correct wrong choose specific mode quick ranked randomly 4 mode odd ball capture flag slayer capture zone enjoy mode new oddball capture flag make skin crawl forced 3 4 time row please 343 mercy simply wish slayer ranked sadly big battle broken server randomly player joining queuing forced restart hope finally allow join battlepass terrible opinion lvl 43 close decent challenge swap terrible challenge mentioned earlier someone 343 rigged challenge purpose force xp booster challenge swap help truth short earn bonus xp kill win objective rely challenge improving challenge tedious finished left prefer stopped forcing mode choose specific mode across playlist healthy playerbase group allow report cheater toxic maybe customization item improve customization general pretty limited moment chill monetization force pay 10 color blue fix big battle mode awesome shame seeing option surrender missing player ranked penalize leaving 2 player left improve collision melee hit registering allow rejoin match crash lose connection despite mentioned consider best opinion terrible system admit feeling worse day faith 343 hope able turn soon wasting hour forced mode hate worst gun close return enjoy best new coolness wear paying attention issue slowly tired anymore shame,2,-0.5

1240440,Halo Infinite,"[h1]Under New Management[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
It's a story that every Halo fan is familiar with. 343 Industries, a studio spun up by Microsoft to be the stewards of the Halo IP going in the future, took over the franchise in 2011 after the departure of series creators Bungie. They then proceeded to drag the franchise and its fans through two sequels which, while not awful in totality, were proof that 343i had no clue what made Halo so special in an aesthetic nor a gameplay sense. 

[b]Halo Infinite[/b] was seemingly meant to be the course correction for the Halo series in the modern era. It had the Bungie era aesthetics, music evocative of Marty O'Donnell's amazing scores, and a gameplay loop that brought the focus back to the sandbox. Weapons, vehicles, power ups, and equipment placed on the maps, equal starting loadouts, and a set of base abilities that blended old and new felt refreshing in an age of gaming where this kind of arena design was dead in the mainstream. Despite a solid foundation however, 343i's attempt at creating a live service ecosystem around what they had built was doomed from the start because of just how bare bones the launch game was.

Critical features like campaign co-op, the custom game browser, and Forge mode did not ship at launch, split-screen co-op didn't launch at all, and the features that were initially included were half-baked or broken. The content updates were extremely slow to come out, utterly failing to keep the core community engaged as new maps trickled out at the slowest rate they had in the series history. The free 2 play cash shop and the battle pass system being the only meaningful ways to earn cosmetic items critically damaged the experience of the average player, a problem only made worse by a horrible armor coating system which disallowed players to change their armor colors as they saw fit. This combination of failures and downgrades made much of the community write off Infinite for good, seeing every update as too little, too late.

Despite the general attitudes around the game, a hiring freeze that prevented new developers from coming onto the game to help fix it up, and a huge management shakeup that led to the previous studio heads departing from the company, 343i kept on working diligently to fix the game's issues. Pierre Hintze, the man who led the Master Chief Collection's amazing overhaul, taking over as the head of 343i has led to an incredible shift in priorities from the developers: building up on top of the solid foundation they already had by giving the community what they want.

Halo Infinite is officially in comeback mode.

The new developer-made maps are a huge improvement over the stock maps, finally allowing the arena game design to shine. The playlist rotations keep things fresh every week. Free events happen all the time, finally letting free players collect some great looking gear on a regular basis. Custom games are lively and full of tons of creativity. Forge mode is astoundingly powerful, with some forged maps looking indistinguishable from developer made maps. They've even started to implement the best of the community's maps directly into the matchmaking system, in both competitive and casual playlists. Shoutouts to the Squad Battle playlist.

It's amazing to see how much better Halo Infinite actually is right now. Even in a gaming landscape where games launch broken and then somehow get even worse though post-launch updates, there are many reasons to be optimistic for the future of this game due to the dedication 343i has shown in the last several months. I hope that people will be able to give it a chance again, because if 343i stays the course, this could be one of the best Halo games of all time.",new management hr hr halo fan familiar 343 industry studio spun microsoft steward halo ip future took franchise 2011 departure series creator bungie proceeded drag franchise fan sequel awful totality proof 343i clue halo special aesthetic sense halo infinite seemingly meant course correction halo series modern era bungie era aesthetic music evocative marty donnell amazing score loop brought focus sandbox weapon vehicle power ups equipment placed map equal starting loadouts set base ability blended old new refreshing age gaming kind arena design dead mainstream despite solid foundation 343i attempt creating live service ecosystem built doomed bare bone launch critical feature campaign co op custom browser forge mode ship launch split screen co op launch feature initially included half baked broken content update extremely slow utterly failing core community engaged new map trickled slowest rate series history 2 cash shop battle pas meaningful way earn cosmetic item critically damaged average problem worse horrible armor coating disallowed player armor color saw fit combination failure downgrade community write infinite good seeing late despite general attitude hiring freeze prevented new developer coming onto help fix huge management shakeup led previous studio head departing company 343i working diligently fix issue pierre hintze man led master chief collection amazing overhaul taking head 343i led incredible shift priority developer building top solid foundation already giving community halo infinite officially comeback mode new developer map huge improvement stock map finally allowing arena design shine playlist rotation thing fresh week event happen finally letting player collect great gear regular basis custom game lively ton creativity forge mode astoundingly powerful forged map indistinguishable developer map started implement best community map directly matchmaking competitive casual playlist shoutouts squad battle playlist amazing halo infinite gaming landscape game launch broken somehow worse post launch update reason optimistic future due dedication 343i shown last month hope able chance 343i stay course best halo game,0,0.9827

1240440,Halo Infinite,"To start I feel it is important to say that I have played a lot of Halo over at least a decade. I have played every main title in the franchise as well as most spin-offs. This is the first multiplayer that 343i have released that actually feels good to play but it still has some issues.

[h1]The Good:[/h1] [list]
[*] A good start with the number of gametypes available, although I hope this will increase after the beta period.
[*] A solid sandbox where no weapons or vehicles feel pointless.
[*] The gameplay feels smooth and responsive and has translated well to a more modern shooter in style.
[*] Runs super smoothly, much better than the flights.
[*] Academy features make the game very accessible to new players.
[/list]

[h1]The Bad:[/h1] [list]
[*] Not enough maps for launch. This might be changing after the beta period. Also, no Infection, Juggernaut or other classic gametypes as of November.
[*] Outright bad player progression system. They have already done some minor tweaks but more is needed. Performance based XP!!
[*] The amount of player expression accessible at the start is abysmal. Comparing this to Halo: Reach levels in your marketing was a joke.
[*] The in-game UI needs some work with toggles to allow a more 'legacy' approach.
[*] [strike]No Jeff Steitzer in BTB! (343 are working on this post launch!)[/strike]
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
While not currently the best Halo multiplayer, Halo Infinite has a solid start here on PC with this multiplayer beta period but it definitely has work to do on the player progression and expression fronts. Because the game is 'live service' I am sure the issues of not enough maps or gametypes will be addressed post-launch over the next few months. In the mean time I recommend hopping in if you already haven't and giving it a go, even if you are new to the franchise and find it quite daunting.

1240440,Halo Infinite,"So this negative review comes with a heavy heart; I love Halo and to an extent I love this one too. I cannot recommend it though, and honestly I can't really recommend any further Halo game due to how this one has been treated. I'm not sure that it was just me believing that Halo would rise to the greatness it once was but my expectations were met then crushed shortly after release.

The Campaign:
Rather than spoil it for the few who still wish to check it out, I think I'm just gonna describe how I felt about the campaign. Short Answer? I liked it. Long Answer? I felt the story was a bit off brand for chief but I think it's a solid entry, and nowhere nearly as bad as say... Halo 5, which was to me a big nothing burger. The problem with halo infinite is that it requires knowledge from Halo Wars 2 and Halo 5 in order to have context. If a Player had skipped these entries to the series, they could be lost on the significance of some characters and events and will have to go back anyways. I enjoy the cast though and their chemistry, even if a bit of the heart-to-heart moments feel a bit ham-fisted.

Game-play of the Campaign is great. While I'm not necessarily a fan of the fact the opted for a semi-open world approach for this game, it does provide the opportunity to mess with the sandbox. Whether it be loading up a troop carrier with sentinel beam marines or swinging around like spiderman, there's definitely plenty of ways you can play around with your new toys. Unlocking these new toys only feels partially natural, as a lot of the UNSC weapons and vehicles are locked behind valor. Valor is unlocked by doing events around the map like rescuing marine squads. Doing these events tend to be more of the same towards the end, which makes me wonder why they didn't just provide these weapons as the game progressed. Probably to pad out the game to make it a collectathon like most Open world PVE games nowadays. Halo Infinite definitely takes inspiration from the Ubisoft formula at the least.

The big issue is that to me, this game doesn't feel like it's worth 60 dollars, especially when the Multiplayer is free, which is an issue we'll discuss soon. Maybe if Halo was to follow through with the 10 year plan they envisioned and added story DLC, then maybe I would consider it worth it down the line. As it stands though, wait for it to be real cheap if you REALLY want it. I personally think the lack of replay-ability isn;t worth it 2 years later.

Multiplayer:
Halo Infinite's Multiplayer is a mess. Don't get me wrong, the core gameplay and foundation are there and for the most part are solid. What isn't solid is pretty much everything else; from the way it's handled to the very conception of it.

The gameplay itself, to me at least, feels good. Sure I could have a better aim, but the movement feels solid enough, my shots register and the sound design does make guns feel pushy. Infinite once again moved away from a  loadout system in order to provide a fair playing field for both teams and all players. Armor abilities have returned, but rather than it being integral like the loadout systems of Reach and Four or Halo 5's system. The abilities function more like equipment like halo 3. Limited use and you have to pick it up. I feel like it's better to have this system as it'll require map knowledge to get the most out of what you pick up. Sure sprinting is still in Halo, but unlike other titles, sprinting is only marginally faster; making only a big difference across longer, BTB orientated maps with a lot of area to cover between firefights. 

What the big problem is of Modern Halo infinite, which has been plaguing the player base since launch is the drip feed of content. Aside from the store, content doesn't seem to really come around. TO explain why this is an issue, Halo Infinite is supposed to be a live service game. Much like many other franchises who thought that Live Service is just a money printer, 343i and Microsoft apparently had no long term goal in terms of maintaining the game. Afterall, laying off hired staff in exchange for contractors that only work on the game for a set amount of time then leave was surely a good idea for an engine that was developed in house, so it's not like adding content on a regular basis would be hard right? I jest, but the fact of the matter is much like popeyes chicken, Halo infinite is more breading than chicken. It's hollow and there's not a lot of reason to play outside events and finishing the battlepass. It's not like you can show off your spartan or do things like PVE with them anyhow, so why bother.

On the topic of customization, it's laughable. Not the system itself, as it's more extensive than Halo 5, but there's certainly a lot of practices that are downright scummy. THe first issue is that Halo infinite is the first game that doesn't allow you to change your primary and secondary colors, instead opting for preset armor coatings. Sure, you get a small amount for free off the bat and you can earn more through weekly challenges (visors too) but it's a huge step down. Instead of being able to be a full white spartan, you now have to buy a 20 dollar bundle in game. Which brings us to the store. The store was, much like other live service games, designed to create fomo. High mark up on digital items during a weekly period on order to twist your arm to buy. Sure, it's not [i]necessary[/i] but a lot of armors for previous games, which were free mind you, are in this store and that will not change. This store existing is the entire reason Multiplayer is F2P and you cannot convince me otherwise. Afterall, how could they justify selling PIECES of a skin to the playerbase at exorbitant prices. It's expected of Fortnite and Call Of Duty, but at least you pay for a whole body cosmetic in that case on top of other items in said bundle; not to say I defend the practice for them.

Summary: 
Halo infinite is a good game riddled with bad decisions caused by greedy execs. I would say not to play this game, but that'd make me a hypocrite.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'm a 70 yr old lady, and I've played for some time now and I love this game. I will never be hardcore or even a good player. But there are so many things to do in this game it is almost overwhelming. Quests are very good, the story-line is very good and last but not least, the graphics are fabulous. 
On the downside; it is expensive being a Plus member, especially on a retirement pay (shoe-string budget). I recommend a much cheaper monthly fee. There is ofc the DLC content you get with the Plus membership but the ideal is to have a cheaper option only for that magical bag space just for crafters. Well, it's just a thought.

Happy New Year 2020!
Just a review of 2019 gameplay (many hours as you can see).
And I'm still playing (since my birthday 7 Dec 2017). I have just scratched the surface...
If you are looking for an adventure out of this world (pun intended) Elder Scrolls Online is the very very best.
I do pay for Eso plus, I need that magic bag since I farm and horde like a squirrel and craft like a boss. I have soon maxed out my main crafter.
I am in a guild with absolutely fabulous and helpful people. I have started to have a bit of confidence doing trials and dungeons with this guild, they know I am old and slow and they are patient with me. Hopefully, I will be a better team player this year. I am working on it.
In the meantime, I quest, explore, collect whatever, do delves, public dungeons, world bosses, farm and craft. And I enjoy it all!
All the best to all gamers in 2020.

I have edited this review, the starting-date was wrong, I got the game on 6 Dec 2017, and started to play on my B-day, 7 Dec 2017. Otherwise, counting the hours of gameplay, I must have been glued to the screen, LOL. I do have a life outside Tamriel, I promise... 
To All gamers Stay Safe in these crazy times. / Onna_Bugeisha

UPDATE 2022; This coming 7 Dec I'll turn 73 yrs which means that I now played this game for 5 yrs and I still love it.

Thank You! To all wonderful people for your heart-warming comments and awards. I like the titel ""Gaming Grandma""  

I have a confession to make - I fell in love with Horizon Zero Dawn, and spent some time there, i.e. I did 6 re-runs of that game (lol), it's a fabulous game. 

Now I am back in ESO again with the new High Isle chapter and two new companions, there are just so many things to do in ESO you never run out of options. Things like crafting, just exploring and farming, decorating your homes and create gardens... even fishing is very relaxing when you need a rest from bandits and monsters. 

Have I mentioned I lured my husband from Guild Wars 2, to come and join me in ESO last year? Now we play together, so much fun. 
A very important advice to all couples out there... this game is captivating and time-consuming - so please, see to it that you both play together or you might end up wondering what in the world happened to your significant other, seriously. 

I hope to see you in game or mail me (I am @Wing-Zun - on PC, EU server), I am in three trading guilds (BTW an excellent way to get some gold).

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I have been paying this game for years, building my opinions of the game. The easiest way to describe it would be Pros v.s. Cons. 

Pros:
Easy to learn, hard to master.

The Questing only gets better with each expansion.

You don't NEED to interact with anyone. Treat it like a single player game if you want and call it hard mode.

Fun dungeons that don't get boring with just a couple of runs.

Tons of ""End Game"" content to keep one busy far after they reach max gear level.

Super Fun PvP system with Cyrodil Tri-Banner War

If you want to specialize in something like crafting, it is diverse and fun enough to keep you entertained, then become extremely profitable in the future.

Cons:
To be a crafter in the most efficient way, you NEED to subscribe to ESO Plus (but as a little sneaky pro, ESO Plus gives all the DLC bundled with it plus ""crowns"" equaling the price paid for subscription""

VETERAN MAELSTROM ARENA IS UNFAIRLY DIFFICULT favoring Magika DPS players with very good sustainability and constant shield action. A bit of tough love that pushes away newer or less experienced players.

PvP, though really fun, has a very steep learning curve that leaves many unsure where to start, luckily PvP isn't the main focus of the game.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So where does this leave us? Is the game worth putting in time and money? Simple answer is, yeah. Despite a rough launch in 2014, ESO has improved and worked out MOST of it's flaws and kinks, making it the great and enjoyable sandbox MMO it is today. 

-If you are playing and feel you need some direction you can send me a message via mail in game @Cactusking158 and I will do my best to answer any questions that come my way.

Happy adventuring, and may you meet many fine people along your journey.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"TLTR: ESO is the best MMO I've played so far.


The Good.
It has retained many of the best elements from the Elder Scrolls series.
-Fantastic sound-score.
-Fine graphics.
-A world that feels alive.
-Great exploration gameplay.

The leveling and combat system is far better than any Elder Scrolls game, by miles. For PvE combat is great, tho I haven't played for long enough to get into PvP yet. You can choose to grind up to cap in a single session, if that strikes your fancy. Or you could care less about leveling and still participate fully in all non-endgame PvE.

ESO does not waste my time with long travel times, I can get to anywhere I've already been in between 30 sec to a minute. For me this is a very important point. I detest games that fakes longviety my wasting my time.

ESO is not in any way pay-to-win, and it doesen't unnaturally inconvenience the player to make me pay extra. The only inconvenience in the game comes with spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants while questing at the same time. This was an inconvenience in the Bethesdas Elder Scrolls games aswell because of inventory. You can pay to unnaturally compensate for this inconvenience through an ingredient-bag.

ESO has pay for vanity.

The world is immensly open. I can go anywhere I want and be successful straight from the start. There are many questlines with their own story tying into the main story. I can choose freely what storyline to follow, or I can ignore the story entirely if I just want to grind my way to the endgame content or just want to explore. This also means the game is extremely accessible for anyone.

Crafting is plesant and feels meaningful so far. There are crafting-quests in addition to crafting for trade, if I want to pursue it as a career. There are few games where I enjoy crafting, but in this one it seems ok.

Stealth gameplay is fun, although not innovative by any means.

Playing together ad hoc is fun even without groupinng up. Just running together with random people for an area or a difficult fight is quite fun. Probably because combat is fast-paced, players are considered allies for the purpose of abilities, and game mechanics generally supports doing so. It works very well for any open area I've been to, and is faster than grouping up.

Some of the dialouge is good.

Some of the quests are ok.


The Bad.
With the game being extremely accessible, people looking for a challenge will have to do a bit of searching or research where to go and who to hook up with.

Because the enemies and treasure scales with level, ESO doesen't have the mother-haul aspect of treasure-hunting that some older Elder Scrolls titles had. For instance, in the original Morrowind I could sneak into an ancient abandoned fortress, find a coven of vampires there so powerful they could one-hit kill me, sneak past them, discover an endgame weapon, steal it and leave. It was a very unique feeling when just stumbling into it while exploring.

The community tools for ESO are the porest of any MMO I've played. I haven't found an accessible way of reaching ppl even for PUGs. There is no tutorial on how to effectively get a group going, and frankly zero incentive to do so anyway in any area I've been so far. Further, getting a guild seems to be a matter of blindly accepting guild-invites from ppl spamming general chat. For instance I've found no credible channel on how to get info on guilds that may be suitable for me, seek them out and ask for an invite. As a noob I find getting involved in the community in ESO a frustrating chore.

There is a tool for queing to participate in dungeons (instances) with PUGs. The tool is never explained however, you just have to find it yourself. Also the queing I've done takes 30-90 minutes. Some times of the day I'm unable to find PUGs for dungeons at all through this tool.

The community also doesen't seem very inviting towards new players in my experience. I've not seen anyone being very helpful towards each other yet. It's not that it's hostile, just not very friendly either. It may of course be because the Morrowind expansion was just released and all the established players are over there, for all I know.

I cannot fly, levitate or do Khajiit-level jumps in ESO.

Some of the story isn't good. They all pivot around the main story in a very overt way. Like in the old arcade games, where there is a scheming badguy and everything except the end-fight is about thwarting his minions. ""His"" minions are everywhere in ESO: Tamriel, and it's just to much of the same. This is very different from the other Elder Scrolls titles, where the monsters of the land seemed to make up a whole ecosystem on their own, with their own lives and events. It makes the stories that follow the quests boring after 25 hours, and deteriorating rapidly at 50 hours.

Most of the quests are very boring. Fetch me those items or kill me those enemies. For me this may well become a reason for abandoning ESO, they were the reason I never played WoW for more than 20 minutes. In ESO they aren't as bad as the ones I experienced in the other title. It's normally 3-5 targets instead of 20-30. At first it seemed that this type of quests would be few, but it proved to be very frequent. A real pity.

Many of the quests are really stupid. And I mean really really bone 'ead stupid. Like the world-class schemer who's locked himself inside a tomb and left the 3 keys outside the door at different but easy-to-find locations. Makes sense.. It's back to the old arcades, only back then the format required some abstractions. In ESO it's not an abstraction anymore, but a literally really dumb story-element. While there are some straight-forward story elements of the type ""some soldiers have been captured, go rescue them"", nonsense solutions are more common. Fully expect an NPC to suggest solving a problem by shooting her magic rainbow-ray at the moon while farting some magic sunshine. But first you must go find her some rare shrooms at one location, kill 4 zombies at another location, get 3 seashells, then kill an evil monster turtle-boss. Then she can find the spy who's been taken prisoner by the enemy and learn what he knows. And on to the next one.

After a quest is done I get a pat on the back, where the NPC tells me this was all my doing. I'm a hero. It's not that it's wrong, it's just that after a while all quest-givers start to seem like a benevolent school-teacher praising a 7-year old.


The Ugly.
Customer Support are flat-out ignoring support-tickets. 

There are 3-year old bugs that prevent installing or starting up the game for enough players that the forums have several threads each day regarding them. New players enter the forum frustrated, not being able to play. Some are able to get it working through forum advice, and others can't and refund the game as a result. The ugly part is that the developers don't communicate with the players and doesen't even acknowledge the problem. It's been 3 years now, so it seems they just don't find the bugs worth the cost of resolving vs the number of resulting refunds and bad reviews.


Final Words.
I don't know how long ESO will keep me engaged. I'm currently doing the story and exploration, but unless the story starts diversifying in the next area I fear I'll seek other content. Maybe that content can keep my attention, maybe not. Regardless, this is the best MMO I've played despite its shortcomings. The combat is quite good, and the absence of time-sinks count for alot.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"This is a review from a new player aimed at new players.

I played ESO back in 2014 during the beta and didn't like it. I was expecting Skyrim online and it didn't qualify so I lost interest very quick.

Fast forward to april 2018, after years spent on Dark Souls, Dragon's Dogma, Rocket League and others ... Me and my buddies are looking for a game to play together like in the good old days. We're all dads with families now and there's no way we can get back to grinding like we used to (no pun intended).

I remember ESO and wonder how it's doing. People are talking about the One Tamriel update. I start a thread on Reddit asking if it's casual friendly, and everyone assures me that it very much is. Might be worth a shot so me and my buddies decide to give it a try.

ESO still isn't Skyrim Online, and won't ever be. The logistics of a MMO don't really allow the atmospheric beauty and complexity of a game like Skyrim. It is however way deeper in lore and atmosphere than any MMO I ever played, and you can tell great care is taken into making the world of Tamriel feel alive and breathing as much as can be. Every NPCs are voiced and side quests are literally everywhere. Many of them feel generic after a while, but some are actually really clever and well written. The world is absolutely humongous and very varied, with there again great care paid to respecting the Elder Scrolls lore. Long time ES players will appreciate the numerous references to stories and characters they already know well.

Graphics are pretty great for a MMO as well. I run it maxed out and lighting effects are downright gorgeous in some places. Art direction is consistent and while some places feel a little rushed, others surprise you with high levels of details. Riding from city to city through woods and moors, across deserts and sea shores, you always feel immersed in the world as should be. They also keep improving as the latest chapter, Summerset, is more beautiful and detailed than ever before.

Gameplay is one of the things that surprised me the most as I wasn't expecting it to be so fast paced. Fighting takes skills and strategy and you do need to learn to get better to earn victory, as opposed to simply leveling and spamming skills like it's sometimes the case in similar games. Me and my buddies have progressed steadily and we find ourselves beating dungeons we never thought we could beat before, and not just because we leveled up but because we learned to work better as a team. It's a very satisfactory feeling that the game encourages.

Classes are varied and skill lines designed to make you enjoy a high level of freedom in gameplay. I run a Magicka Templar, and designed my character so I can switch from DPS to Tank or Healer or a mix of both when I play with my friends without much of a hassle. I'll never be as performing as someone who would 100% specialize in either of these roles, but I would say that for once hybrid builds are absolutely do-able in this game, which is very rarely true in MMOs.

One thing responsible for us enjoying the game so much is the famed One Tamriel update. It basically removed level walls from the world and introduced a scaling system on the world map. It basically means that from level 1 to 50, you will adjust to monsters on the world map and normal delves to a beatable level. It does remove true challenge from these areas, but also allows you to roam the world freely to explore as you wish, which is a worthy trade in my opinion as it allows new players to be free to discover this enormous world like they were on an actual adventure. There are also no limits for partying with friends, so you don't need to worry about overleveling when you play on your own. While it could take from the satisfying experience of leveling up in early levels, the very flexible skill system feels like enough of a reward to keep it interesting.

World Bosses, Dungeons and Trials aren't scaled, and that's where the challenge begins. Each dungeon has several levels of difficulty and we have been steadily progressing through them in our 2 months of playing. Boss battles require strategy and analyzing the mechanics and can be quite epic. Sometimes you just don't have the required level or gears, but sometimes you just have to keep trying to get better. We have beaten many bosses we thought we would never beat on our first couple tries.

Past level 50, you start getting Champion Points, to a maximum of 750. They allow you to keep enhancing your character slowly and end up making quite a difference in the long run. As you get stronger, you'll be able to complete more difficult dungeons, which grant better gears. This is really clever design, as the game never feels like a grind in the traditional MMO sense, but instead more of renewed challenges. So far it has kept it's freshness to us.

The lack of ""grindy"" feeling is really something I want to emphasize on, as it's what's been preventing me from playing MMOs for so long. In my 2 months of playing I never felt myself even having the desire of grinding for levels or gears. I had fun doing quests on my own and playing with my friends, and my character naturally improved by doing so. We are still a long, long way from reaching end game content, and are in no hurry. From my experience, this is quite a feat to accomplish this feeling in a genre that is most often grindy by definition.

On the negative side, I would say that the game can sometimes feel a little bland, but then again it's a MMO and Skyrim, Dark Souls, Witcher III and the likes have spoiled us in recent years. Quests can feel generic and repetitive but you also don't need to do 80% of them.

The monthly subscription is by no mean necessary but access to all DLCs and their dungeons is quite pricey (and free if you subscribe). The bottomless crafting bag you get with the subscription is also pretty mandatory if you want to craft efficiently, and then again it isn't a necessity as you can resell materials instead of holding on to them and ask players to craft for you.

Crown store is mostly cosmetics or a shortcut to things you can buy with ingame currencies like skill respecs and the likes.

All in all, the game we were looking for at the right time for us. I highly recommend it if you are also looking for a similar chill, friendly experience in the Elder Scrolls universe.

[b]Game Pros[/b]
• Giant fully explorable beautifully designed world
• Night/Day Cycle (3 hours each)
• Weather
• 1st and 3rd person is easily accessible
• Designated PvP area
• Customer support is very helpful
• Various lines and skills for crafting 
• Ton of possible character builds
• Mass amount of quests. (You'll have a hard time running out of things to do)
• Frequent updates
• A lot dungeons ranging in difficulty for you and your friends (or random players) to complete.
• Microtransactions are mainly all cosmetics (Other than mounts and crafting styles) 

[b]Game Cons[/b]
• If you have poor internet, prepare for the longest download. (80Gb)
• You can only group up with players from the same faction. So if your friends join a different one, you're out of luck
• Minor bugs (Rooms can take a little to fully load, possible freezing/crashing)
• Pricing of mounts is a little high (It takes awhile for the normal player to earn even 10,000 Gold. While most horses are 42,000 gold. Other than that, there is one that is 10,000 Gold. Only other option is buying it through the micro-transaction store)
• Only guild stores and AI markets. There is no public tradepost (like you would find in Guild Wars)

[b]Controversial Features[/b]

• WoW 
• Skyrim 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Elder Scrolls Online is a very fun and potentially an addicting Massive multiplayer online game. 900+ quests, giant open world map with a ton of caves, and dungeons, to explore. Sure there is some cons here and there, but overall I would reccomend this game to any person who enjoys MMOs. In the first 2-3 days of having it, I hit 30+ hours of gameplay. If you got the money and time, i'd pick this one up for sure. And no, you can not do shouts, and there is no dragons. This isn't skyrim.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[h1] The Elder Scrolls Online - Tamriel Unlimited [/h1]

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Tamriel.  A continent at war. The Dominion, Pact and Covenant fight for supremacy in the Imperial province of Cyrodiil. Meanwhile, Molag Bal has stolen your fucking soul. 

[h1] Review -11/26/15 [/h1]
[b] Graphics [/b]

Tamriel Unlimited is pretty. It has a variety of different environments - from the sandy, sunbaked land of Elsweyr, to the frigid, unforgiving land that is Eastmarch. Whilst no, the graphics aren't particularly revolutionary, and definitely not the same quality as Skryim, this is to be expected. For an MMORPG, the Elder Scrolls Online is up there with one of the best looking. Occasionally the world looks a bit 'the same', but usually as you advance to other provinces, the environment and ambience is noticeably different. 

EDIT: After a discussion with someone who commented on this review (which you can read below) I'd like to add this: 
Skyrim was a very graphically capable game. The base game, on ultra, compared to ESO, on ultra, is more graphically detailed than ESO in my opinion. However, this may depend on different viewpoints and whatnot. The graphics design and feel each game wishes to portray is different, and this may lead to differences in opinion - which is to be expected.

8/10

[b] PvE [/b]

Player vs Environment is the part of this game that gets particularly monotonous. It's the easiest way to level up, as you gain a considerable amount of experience for each quest you complete, but  it does indeed become a chore. The characters are forgettable, the quests the same. Kill this, gather 'x' amount of this, talk to her/him. In my 145 hours of playtime, only a few quests have got me genuinely interested. You skip dialogue as it does not mean anything or add to the plot. It does, however, reveal some beautiful locations and there are a FEW interesting quests. For the most part, however, PvE in ESO:TU is pretty 'meh'.

4.5/10

[b] PvP [/b]

If you're not sure about buying ESO for the PvE aspect, definitely consider buying it for the PvP aspect. It is likely the most fun I've ever had in an MMORPG. Nothing quite compares to standing aside a host of 50+ players as trebuchets pound castle walls, the walls crumble, and hundreds of players clash on the field of battle. If you're an Elder Scrolls fan and have always fantasized about some sort of war in Tamriel - buy this game. You're allowed to enter Tamriel at Lvl 10 (3-4 hours of playtime?). Once you enter, your stats are boosted to Veteran Rank 1(?). This means a Level 10 can still be (relatively) effective fighting higher levels, so it's pretty balanced. The PvP itself takes place in the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which has been invaded by three seperate factions-

The Aldmeri Dominion (High Elf, Wood Elf, Khajit)
The Daggerfall Covenant (Breton, Orc, Redguard)
The Ebonheart Pact (Argonian, Nord, Dunmer)
(With Imperial package you can play as an Imperial in any alliance)

There are 15/16 castles around the province, 6 of which surround the Imperial City. There are also various outposts. Around the castles are resources, which, if captured, give benefits to the faction who owns them.
The PvP is what makes this game, and what convinced me to stay for 100+ hours.

9.5/10

[b] UI/Levelling [/b]

The UI is well-designed, not too obtrusive. Levelling up is also pretty simple - each time you level up, you get to choose which stat to invest in - stamina, health or magicka.You can then choose a skill which you can plonk in your hotbar and use. Nothing broken or overpowered, though it does take testing to find the most effective skill sets.

8.5/10

[b] Crafting [/b]

I'm not going to lie, I've not experimented in crafting at all, so this section is from friends' experiences.
It's good. Dying your items can make your armor very unique, the materials are varied and it does take up time. It's not simple. Which is good.

8/10

[b] Framerate [/b]

I play this game on a GTX 770 and i7 4770. In the midst of a battle, with dozens of spells and effects going on as well as 100+ players on screen performing their own actions, it did not drop below 50fps. Well optimized, large scale PvP is the only time I've ever dropped below 60fps.

9/10 

[b] Grouping [/b]

The group questing/dungeons in this game are good, again, but not particularly revolutionary or exciting. Standard group quests and dungeon, pretty simple. Not a huge variety right now, I think there are about 7/8 without the Orsinium/Imperial City DLC. I've had loads of fun playing dungeons with friends, but it does become a bit stagnant once you've repeated them several times.

7/10

[b] Conclusion [/b]

This game is good. The PvP is excellent, and while the PvE isn't particularly impressive, it still functions. Bugs have almost all been ironed out. Worth your money if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, and are willing to accept certain sacrifices made by Zenimax to make the game a better MMO.

[b] OVERALL: 8.5/10 [/b]

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"So, I hated this game at first...

 I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of ""FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO"" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. 

It is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.

So I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.

Now I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.

Add-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.

For those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.

If any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I've thought a lot about whether to give this game a bad review or not. I almost did, but it would be unfair to the game. The largest and most painful issue I have with this game is the in-game shop and the way that this game has been monetized. It is so terribly monetized, that I almost gave this game a negative review. ZOS claim to only sell cosmetics and conveniences, however both of these things clash with the core gameplay of ESO. 

There are a number of rewards which are only obtainable through purchasing crowns with money, and with extremely expensive costs too. The game is objectively worse off by the existence of these things. I can count on one hand the number of mounts you can collect in game, but the number of mounts you can buy or obtain through ZOS's loot boxes is closer to 100. This gives players less things to actually play for, less things to collect and fewer targets to set for themselves.

In addition, you can buy time-savers which grant you ability points (if you've collected them on other characters), experience scrolls, mount training and the research scrolls for professions. The issue I take with the existence of these items is indicative of the fact that ZOS are aware that these grinds are a slug. They are literally time-gated; you can learn one mount training skill every 24 hours, of which there are 180 skills to spend. That is half a year of spending points to max out your mount training. This grind must be done on each character. The research scrolls speed up the rate at which you research a trait in a weapon. When researching a trait, you must wait an increasing amount of actual time before unlocking it and researching another. My main character has gotten to the point that she must wait 20+ days to learn a new trait in some professions. Or I can throw my wallet at ZOS and get it done instantly. ZOS, I want to play your game, but you're making it so hard.

The largest houses you can buy typically sell for around 14,000 crowns (€85) and are unobtainable otherwise. On the other hand the housing system in the game is phenomenal. It suffers a lot though when considering how expensive furnishings actually are, especially when compared to how little gold you actually get for just playing the game. While players can obtain some furniture pieces through playing the game, these are extremely few and far between when considering just how many furniture pieces there actually are in the game. The nicer furniture pieces are often priced at 10,000 gold, up to 100,000 for the fanciest pieces. When you only get 300 gold for completing a quest, as a player, you must look to get money through other systems if you want to engage fully with housing and furnishing. ZOS, PLEASE increase the amount of gold you get from quests. This leads me to the auction house in game, and ESO plus. 

The best way to obtain money in this game, is by engaging in the auction house. I love the auction house system in the game, and the way it forces players to be a part of a guild(s). One thing to help you make gold is the use of the extra bank storage and (literally infinite) crafting bag you get when subscribing to ESO plus. If you plan to sell any crafting materials and you don't have the crafting bag, be prepared to have a full inventory every 10 minutes. It's like ZOS are aware that not playing with the crafting bag is a handicap, and so they move it to a pay-wall. There are other ways to make money in the game, such as farming for rare item drops for hours on end, hoping that one will eventually drop which you can sell for a lottery cash out

ZOS are masters at creating problems and selling you the solution. The in-game store and the monetization is in direct conflict with the soul of this game, and I never feel satisfied playing this game. I want to engage in the housing, but the rate at which I can actually buy furniture, if I just do quests is extraordinarily slow. The crowns I get with the ESO plus subscription make it a bit better, as they allow me to buy furniture and housing with crowns instead of gold, but I can't help but feel like this doesn't have to be a problem at all.

ZOS, fix your monetization. I paid for this game, let me play it without locking features behind time-gates and pay-walls. If you want this game to be subscription based, make it subscription based, put everything from the store into the game, and remove the store. You can't have it both ways. I want to love this game, but with the way this game is monetized, I can't. 

If you enjoy questing and story-telling, you will probably enjoy the game if you don't engage with any of the things above. But you might get frustrated at always having a full backpack and having to walk past all of the mining and herb nodes because you don't have the space to pick them up. And then not having any money because you can't trade the materials you don't have.",thought bad unfair largest painful issue shop monetized terribly monetized gave negative zos claim cosmetic convenience thing clash core eso number reward obtainable purchasing crown extremely expensive cost objectively worse existence thing count hand number mount collect number mount obtain zos loot box closer 100 give player thing thing collect fewer target set addition saver grant point collected character scroll mount training research scroll profession issue existence item indicative zos aware grind slug literally gated learn mount training skill 24 hour 180 skill spend half spending point max mount training grind research scroll speed rate research trait weapon researching trait wait increasing actual unlocking researching gotten wait 20 day learn new trait profession throw wallet zos instantly zos hard largest house typically 14 000 crown 85 unobtainable otherwise hand housing phenomenal suffers considering expensive furnishing especially compared gold player obtain furniture piece extremely far considering furniture piece nicer furniture piece priced 10 000 gold 100 000 fanciest piece 300 gold completing look system engage fully housing furnishing zos please increase gold quest lead auction house eso plus best obtain engaging auction house love auction house force player guild help gold extra bank storage literally infinite crafting bag subscribing eso plus plan crafting material crafting bag prepared inventory 10 minute zos aware crafting bag handicap move pay wall way farming rare drop hour hoping eventually drop lottery cash zos master creating problem selling solution store monetization direct conflict soul satisfied engage housing rate furniture quest extraordinarily slow crown eso plus subscription bit allow furniture housing crown gold help problem zos fix monetization paid locking feature gate pay wall subscription based subscription based store remove store way love monetized enjoy questing telling probably enjoy engage thing frustrated backpack walk past mining herb node space pick trade material,1,0.9756
306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Below you will find a video of my first impressions with the game.

The game is very good. But here is the problem, most people come into it expecting Skyrim online. DO NOT DO THIS!

First let me get this out of the way, as this needs to be noted! 

If you look at the game as an MMO first and a TES game second you will not be disappointed. Others will look at the limitations compared to Skyrim or other TES single player games. Instead i look at the freedoms! I can loot just about every container i come across, i can go into pretty much every building i come across. Other mmo's don't do this. Other mmo's don't have things scattered across their dungeons to loot aside from corpses. Someone else might say ""well i can't pick up everything like i can in Skyrim"" No you can't, but what mmo let's you? In this you can at least interact with objects more than other games. 

The combat: You don't just stand in place watching cool downs! You have to react to your enemy, you have to block and dodge. You can't get away with auto attacking! They have improved the feel of combat, you don't feel like you are slicing thin air anymore. 

The community: It's amazing! Everyone i have spoken to has been extremely friendly, eager to group up, eager to role play and get into character. No one is arguing in the chat! No one is spamming to sell you gold.

The crafting: It's just as much fun as other TES games, collecting the reagents you need isn't a chore because the world is fun to explore and gather in! There are plenty of recipes to find and experiment with.

The world: The game looks great, it's not mind blowing great, but it does look good, especially for an MMO. This isn't going to look like a graphic mod for Skyrim so forget that! But it's no slouch either. The lighting is very well done but some textures can be bland. 

The customization: This is a big one! This game has a TON of customization options, dozens of skills to choose from which only get added on from joining things like the fighters and mages guild or becoming a werewolf or vampire! You can use any weapon and any armor type, there are thousands of builds for each class! The best customization i have ever seen and i've been a rabid MMO gamer since 2003. 

The crown store: It isn't pay to win! It's very similar to GW2 and there are only aesthetic options available. I was so pleased by this that i found myself WANTING to give them money in return for a cool looking mount, pet and costume. They don't pester you for money with pop ups or anything annoying like that. You buy the game and you choose to purchase aesthetics on your own terms. 

I haven't experienced PvP yet and i haven't got to end game, i am enjoying my time in the game as a slow burn and i recommend you do the same! DO NOT be in a rush to get to cap! Live in the world, enjoy your ascent!

In closing i will just say the game got a bad rep early on. Essentially people were paying for a beta until Tamriel Unlimited launched so i can understand their frustrations. But the game is in a MUCH better place now, i'm sure it's going to be very popular when it launches on consoles and the PC community seems to be growing now that the game is B2P! 

Thank you for reading my review and i hope you find it helpful.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'm pushing 1500 hours and decided it was time for a review. Here you go.

As a long time Morrowind addict I was hesitant to jump on the ESO bandwagon.  I'd heard a lot of bad stuff about it when it was first released and solidly decided I was in the camp of 'that's not a real Elder Scrolls game, it's a cashgrabbing, PVPing, mainstream-appealing mess'.  Which. to be fair, was kind of accurate back around initial release (from what I've heard). Jump forward give years though, and it's come a looooooooong way.

Lore: 
If I'd started playing and found the lore side of things to be poorly addressed I would have stopped playing. I haven't stopped playing. Established lore is maintained and adhered to well, and the game adds its own bits and pieces - some new stuff, some expanding on previous knowledge.  And there's plenty of books lying around for the lore enthusiasts to pore over. You could quite easily play the game and completely ignore the lore aspect, if that''s your thing, but you'd be missing out on a huge part of the charm of the ES world.

Gameplay: 
Top notch questing, both the main questlines (of which there are many) and also standalone side quests. Keeping in line with previous titles in the series, there's been an effort made to minimise 'Go and kill X bandits' or 'Fetch me X golden watercress seeds' type quests. While ultimately all quests will be basically 'Go there, do this, come back' they are well presented, relevant to the storyline and generally cohesive.

There are less world-changing decisions that can be made than in other games of the series, but that's part and parcel of the MMO genre. Occasionally you will meet a new character who obviously thinks they know you - as far as I can tell this is an overhand from early days when different areas of the world were levelled, and progress was more linear. Modern ESO has level-scaling across the board, meaning you can access previously 'end-game' zones from the get go. It's not gamebreaking, and very minor - took me ages to even realise it was happening. 

Combat:
My first impression was that regardless of class/playstyle you end up being forced to do magick-y stuff. Coming from earlier games where playing as a warrior (or whatever non-magic class) means you can basically light attack, heavy attack or block I was....somewhat irked. Combat is basically a combination of buffing yourself/debuffing enemies with 'abilities' and then using normal attacks interspersed with other 'abilities'. All these abilities are accompanied by much pomp and circumstance - flames, sparkles, sound effects and such. I was kind of miffed that I couldn't just hit things with a sword/arrow/morningstar and occasionally swig a health potion. Once again, it's an MMO - not a single player adventure game. Took a while to get used to, but you adjust. There's also wiggle room if you want to be more of a purist, but you'll be cutting yourself off from most of the group/endgame activities by doing so.

Classes/Races:
Well handled. Nightblade is the quintessential 'Thief' class, Sorceror is the 'Mage' and Templars, Dragonknights and Wardens are a bit of a mixed bag. There's less of a Warrior/Mage/Thief theme and more of a Damage/Healer/Tank vibe to the whole affair, due to the traditional 4 man party setup for group activities. Too much reading online will convince you that to be any good at all you need to shoehorn yourself into the current 'meta' build for whatever role you want to fill. Reading these guides and builds is a great way to understand how to use skills more effectively or learn how different armour sets can help in combat, but at the end of the day they're best ignored. Play the character you want to play - if you were good enough to benefit from squeezing an extra 1.6% DPS out of your toon you wouldn't need to read a guide to find out how to do it.

Races are pretty faithful to tradition, with 'passives' that are vaguely in line with with the old 'Altmer have extra magicka', 'Khajiit be sneaky' stuff. Nothing to prevent you from making an Orc healer or an Altmer brawler if you wish, though.

Community:
Generally good, always feel free to ask questions in zone chat if you need a hand with something. Lot's of helpful sorts out there. PUGs can be a bit toxic sometimes, but it's easy to just leave the group if you can't be bothered dealing with someone excessively unpleasant. Hundreds of guilds to join, everything from trading to roleplaying to hardcore score pushers. On that note, if you're trying to do an endgame trial and suck, the other people are NOT being toxic. There's an expectation that you will contribute effectively, and if you're not, well tough potatoes.

Crafting:
Only mentioning because it's a big part of the in-game economy and a main reason for lots of people to play. In the course of your adventures you'll collect oodles of furnishing designs, armor and weapon style diagrams, foodstuffs, raw resources and other shiny bits and bobs. Level up your crafting skills and you can make your own gear, make furniture, potions/poisons to use or sell. You can also just go out foraging for stuff and sell your spoils through a guild for a tidy profit. Nice low-key way to spend an hour or two if you don't feel like combat or questing and just want to romp around outside enjoying the landscape.

Real money:
Yes, there's a 'Crown Store' where you can buy stuff with your IRL fundage. I don't think many people use it. Lot's of flashy stuff (and lots of cosmetics) that after a few weeks of playing you can mostly find or make yourself in-game. Subscribing to ESO Plus gets you an unlimited inventory for crafting resources (very handy) and access to all the DLC content (which can also be purchased one-off if you prefer). It also gives you 1500 crowns per month, so you can fritter it away on the more useful/appealing items if you so wish. The game is fully playable without subscribing, it's really just a QOL improvement and means you don't have to pay upfront for the many DLC zones.

Overall:
I love this game. It's huge, both geographically and in terms of content. New areas are being released regularly and despite the whining on forums, the dev team does a good job of addressing issues and making the game enjoyable, accessible and true to the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe.  You can play this as an MMO, a single-player game or anything in between. You can RP your way through the overland regions, or min-max your way onto some very competitive leaderboards.  For me, it's a great continuation of he Elder Scrolls series and also a very enjoyable (and affordable) MMO without that horrible WoW feel to it. You're not forced into any particular playstyle based on your class or race, and there's enough content to keep anyone busy for many thousands of hours. 

If you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, or MMOs, or RPGs in general, I suggest you give it a try. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but such a large bag that you'll never get bored.

Dont like the items you got? Trade them for gems, save up gems and get what you want.

If you have the money to spend on subscription gaming, perhaps there are better options out there.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[h1] Gamble's ESO REVIEW [/h1]
[i] After spending over 4000 hours i feel its time to voice my personal opinion about the game. [/i]

[b] My Own Experience [/b]
I first started The Elder Scrolls online when the Vvardenfell DLC released roughly Mid June 2017, after years of playing other different types of games i decided i needed my MMORPG fix again. I was not sure what to expect but i knew i was a fan of The Elder Scrolls Universe, playing most the previous games in the series and being a big fan of the lore so i decided to give the online version a chance. 

I purchased the normal game standard edition which is the base game. To buy the DLC for the game there are a few options such as straight up buy the DLC which will cost you crowns (they do sometimes have offers for these) or you can buy into their ESO+ subscription. From a fresh point of view, i was thinking ""do i really want to pay more money after just buying the game"". After asking a few of my friends who had played the game before i did more digging and found out it was HIGHLY BENEFICIAL, you get a lot of perks such as:
[list]
    [*]Access to all current and future DLC's 
    [*]Unlimited crafting bag (Go nuts and pick up everything!)
    [*]Double Bank Space
    [*]10% more gold/xp
[/list]
[i] HINT [/i]
I would recommend you buy the base game first, see if you enjoy the game and if you think you will play the game longer buy ESO+ honestly that crafting bag is life, a lot of people from my experience say ""i cant live without this anymore"". and the fact that you get access to all the DLC content is just fantastic.

[b]Factions in the game [/b]
Before playing the game i did some research to find out the best race and class to choose for each role. Like other games i played i wanted to see what each class had to offer e.g. which class did the most dps, who was the best healer or the most beefy tank. When picking a race you are also choosing a certain faction depending where that race comes from in the world, which is one of 3:
[list]
    [*]Daggerfall Covenant (Blue)
    [*]Ebonheart Pact (Red)
    [*]Aldmeri Dominion ( Yellow)
[/list] 
[i] HINT [/i]
Now a days there is an option to buy ""any race any faction bundle"" which some people might see as annoying and an excuse for the devs to take more of your money. However this is mainly aimed at open world pvp, so unless you are going to pvp a lot or want to be in the same faction as your friends, pick any race which you find appealing. There is always the option to make another character of the same faction to play with friends.

[b] Classes currently in the game [/b]
I remember the first Character i ever made was a Warden, As the DLC had just released and not many people had played it i thought it would be good fun. Later down the line however i learnt the hard way the bear can be annoying. There is a way to control your bear so it doesn't randomly pull mobs in trials or the boss at the end. I remember doing this many times :D  but i was never told and it was never obvious there was a button to press for your bear companion to be non hostile. 

Many of the classes tool-kits have been changed which has lead to them getting buffed and nerfed either many times or a few times. Honestly sometimes it feels like the devs are unsure how to balance some of the skills in the class. They either go from one extreme to making it powerful or not very useful and weak. Saying that now a days if you wanted to play, there are so many different sets to wear in the game to help you out, if you want more damage or need better sustain. Please see the list below of the current classes in the game so far.
[list]
    [*]Templar 
    [*]Sorcerer
    [*]Dragonknight
    [*]Nightblade
    [*]Warden (Crown Store)
    [*]Necromancer (Crown Store)
[/list] 
[b] Races currently in the game [/b]
I enjoyed the customisation different races, you get given lots of choices to make your characters look unique and different. E.g a fat male Wood Elf dressed as a belly dancer, or a fancy Orc with a moustache. Please see the list below for current races in the game
[list]
    [*]Breton
    [*]Redguard
    [*]Orc
    [*]Nord
    [*]Argonian
    [*]Dark Elf
    [*]Khajiit
    [*]Wood Elf
    [*]High Elf
    [*]Imperial (Crown Store)
[/list] 
[i] HINT [/i]
Honestly unless you want to min/max your character, you don't really have to worry about choosing which race and class to play. Now a days there isn't too much different between all the races. Other then that just have fun! Try out many classes and see which suits your play style.

[b] What is there to do in the game? [/b]
When first playing I was not sure what to expect but i knew that i wanted to have fun and see all the different things the game offered such as:
[list]
    [*]Map zones (Questing, Fishing, Skyshards, Dolmens)
    [*]PVP (Battlegrounds, Imperial city, Cyrodiil)
    [*]Trials (12 player content)
    [*]Guilds (Trials, progression, trading, Roleplaying, causal) 
    [*]Dueling (Tournaments)
    [*]Housing (Competitons)
    [*]Achievement hunting 
    [*]Arena's ( 4 player content and single player content)
    [*] In-Game Events 
    [*] Dungeons (4 player content, normal and vet)
[/list]
[b] Positives [/b]
Lots of helpful and friendly guilds, there are so many guilds in the game you could almost go as far to call them small communities, usually in a guild if you need help or are unsure they will answer any questions you have about the game.

Progression guilds, are great if you want to get into the end game content, unlike other guilds that require x amount of dps, progression guilds normally don't have such a high benchmark and love to help train new people, give advise and explain the mechanics of tougher content.

You never know when you will make friends, the amount of times i have been doing something random and then i just become good friends with a person is crazy, A lot of people are nice and are willing to help if you have any questions.

So much lore in the game to explore, as the game takes place in the past you can see what the world used to be like.

[b] Negatives [/b]
FPS seems to be an issue when pvping in open world e.g. you run into so many loading screens, or come against so many players that your PC cant keep up and your skill bar doesn't work. 

When trying to get into a dungeon, that can be quite the experience, sometimes even with a full group the finder doesn't seem to work, people can leave randomly halfway through a dungeon, they can just be rude and run most the dungeon and skip bosses. PUG AT YOUR OWN RISK! that's right your heard me, when trying to randomly enter a vet dlc dungeon yikes. It is honestly like gambling with your time, you will either get a really good group, or a terrible group of people who get mad, blame others and leave. 

Dry End game content, sadly this isn't the most challenging game of all time. When you get later into the game with more experience and understand the mechanics from the dungeons, you lose that sense of its a challenge. The same can go for trials, with all the top end raiding guilds out there, they go and smash so many of these trials in record times each patch. 

Steam Login issues, sometimes after a long maintenance you find that some people are able to login fine but people who brought the game on Steam have to wait hours more to play the game.

[b] Overall [/b]
I have really enjoyed my time playing this game, from the social aspect i have met so many people in different guilds, who have become good real life friends. Sometimes in guilds they run so many events like, make the ugliest outfit, dungeon races, fishing together in a group of 20+ or just dress the same as a guild and bombard a town by dancing everywhere. I WOULD RECOMMEND this game if you want to be part of a good community, who loves the ESO lore and wants to have fun, there are honestly so many guilds out there which offer a lot!

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"First and foremost I am a solo player. I am just going to compare this to WoW and my personal preferences as a solo player. This game seems to be a better fit for me than WoW.

I enjoy the leveling process in WoW, but lose interest fast once I hit max level. I am simply not interested in raiding, playing in groups, or PvP. I like being able to walk away from the game or take a break at any time. In WoW the quests are pretty boring, they're primarily text, etc. Your character just really cannot become more powerful playing solo past a certain point. However, I have a pattern of re-subbing WoW every time an expansion comes out and quitting shortly after hitting max level.

Now I am giving ESO a go and I've been enjoying it a lot. Why? The quests are amazing. It's fully voiced over which means I am actually engaged and paying attention to what's going on (all I did was skip the dialog in WoW). The quests are far more detailed when it comes to the story behind them, the tasks, the environments, etc. It's so much more than the zillion fetch quests or kill X monsters quests in WoW. The main story quests in WoW were good, but that's it. The rest of them are not. In ESO there is just no end to high quality engaging quests. I opted for ESO plus as well which opens up a million more. I'm only level 19 after 71 hours and having a great time.

I prefer the combat in ESO. It's simpler. I'm OK but was never really good at WoW. Just OK. ESO lets me keep it as simple as possible. I run 1 bar of 5 skills; that's it. The combat is less twitchy, but still very reactive in nature. You have to block, roll, interrupt caster, and use your 5 abilities, but it's just way simpler. Those basic functions of rolling, blocking, and interrupting are way more intuitive in ESO in my opinion because you're using your movement keys and attack keys to do it; not a special ability. The monsters in ESO are easier to ""read"" compared to WoW. In WoW you really need to sort of memorize different types of attacks, abilities, etc. to know how to avoid or counter them. In ESO there is a target on the ground to avoid, it's always the same interrupt, always the same roll, etc. It's been easy to manage for me as an OK player and, honestly, more fun for me. I don't feel like I suck. I also feel like ""meta"" probably matters less in ESO and small mistakes don't really ruin anything. I might be wrong because I am still new, but that is the feeling I am getting.

Anyway, that's me! Solo player, just OK or decent at playing MMOs in general, needs voiced over content to keep me engaged, etc. I am really liking it and definitely recommend it. Hopefully this helps someone with a similar preference or background make a decision.",foremost solo compare wow personal preference solo fit wow enjoy leveling process wow lose interest fast max simply interested raiding group pvp able walk break wow quest pretty boring primarily text powerful solo past certain pattern subbing wow expansion come quitting shortly hitting max giving eso enjoying quest amazing fully voiced mean engaged paying attention skip dialog wow quest far detailed come task environment zillion fetch quest kill x monster quest wow quest wow good rest eso high quality engaging quest opted eso plus open million 19 71 hour great prefer combat eso simpler ok good wow ok eso let simple possible 1 bar 5 skill combat twitchy reactive nature block roll interrupt caster 5 ability simpler basic function rolling blocking interrupting intuitive eso opinion movement key attack key special monster eso easier read compared wow wow sort memorize different type attack ability avoid counter eso target ground avoid interrupt roll easy manage ok honestly fun suck meta probably matter eso small mistake ruin wrong new feeling anyway solo ok decent mmos general need voiced content engaged liking definitely recommend hopefully help someone similar preference background decision,2,0.9976
306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"At the time of writing this I am roughly around 180 hours in the game.

When I first got into Elder Scrolls it was with Skyrim. Playing only that and none of the other previous games I was blown away with how detailed that game was. When I heard that a MMORPG was made with the same title I was very enthusastic. When I got Elder Scrolls Online, I was told it would not be ""Skyrim Online"", and to an extent, those whom mentioned it were correct. However my thoughts and feelings on that statement have changed quite a bit.

After playing for as long as I have, which in comparison to many others, I have found this to be right at home with my previous experience with Skyrim. I absolutley love this game. I feel that it is totally worth the $60 price tag and I invite other open minded players to give this game a shot. There are many differences from the Single Player version of Elder Scrolls but all of the reasons I loved Skyrim are placed in this game.

The ability to customize my character in any way I see fit, the endless caves, areas and places of interest to see. Fully voiced NPC's and endless hours of lore and other content for players to experience. Not to mention that NPC's reconize your heroic feats as you walk by them, often singing your praises and sometimes even questioning some of your actions that you have made in the game. In fact, there are many circumstances where I have had to make a tough decision and have spent much time dwelling after the fact if I made the right call. Should I have helped fight at the docks or was defending the fort the better call? The result might be the same but the fact that I even had to contemplate the lives of fictional NPC's that I would never meet again shows how enriching the plot can be.

The  PvP in my opinion is very hard, but very fun. I die often, but its not frustrating. Being able to team togeather with random strangers, plan an attack and take a fort seems like it would be difficult to do but everyone is on board and ready to play the game. They want to succeed as much as you and I found the community helpful and enriching, not to mention being able to use seige weapons is so much fun and adds a level of excitment I didn't realize was part of the game.

In the non PvP side, I found most players to be felpful, friendly and very outgoing. I found a guild almost right away and in that guild was open minded Veteren players who wanted to help grow and encourage newer players. Often investing a lot of time and energy explaining various parts of the game such as Armor, Weapons, Skill's, ect. Even non guild members and complete strangers are often pretty nice. I can recall looking for a Werewolf Bite and after a few bad players asking me for a ton of gold and crafting materials in order to give me a bite, one player simple messaged me and say ""don't pay them anything, I will give it to you for free."" Not only that but he also gave me tips on how to complete the Werewolf single player quest.

I plan on sticking with this MMORPG for a very long time. Its fun, its first person, its 3rd person and its live action. It has its faults, all games do, but if you can take things with an open mind and a grain of salt you will find much love for this awesome game. It wont ever be ""Skyrim Online"" but in many ways I really feel it is. A great story, great community of players, a big wide open world to explore with choices that are unique to your character. Seems pretty close in my opinion.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I originally pre-ordered this game back in 2014. I found it to some-what fun but other titles at the time were far more interesting to me and ended up side-tracking me from playing ESO.
I had stopped playing the game all together, and did not return.

I recently read that the game had been revamped for 2020 offering many more features, and changes.
I have now played a character from the start in 2020 and leveled that character to max level, here is my honest review:

PROS: 
-Great scenery, graphics are great, character models look awesome.
-Excellent exploration, seriously, you will find yourself just running around looking at interesting things from time to time.
-Fun combat, controls flow nicely. Also cool to see an MMO that can be played on controller.
-Character building is very unique in this and allows the creator of the character to really build a very unique feeling class. This allows for quite a diversity in game-play.
-PVP Game mode is very fun. Definitely has a learning curve, but once you figure it out, the PVP is very unique and offers a lot of replay-ability.
-In game purchases are available but none of them are a pay to win option. (The in-game purchases are mostly stuff like costumes or cosmetic changes.)
-There are some nostalgic elements in this game that remind me of previous single player Elder Scrolls titles.

CONS:
-The questing is interesting, but can become repetitive and chore-like. (As is per normal of an MMO)
-Alot of the quests share some overly similar story-lines. However, I do also understand this is an MMO with tons of quests in it.
-The dungeons do get better towards the higher character levels, but at first they offer zero challenge and are fairly boring. I found myself just kind of running around, using random abilities with no serious sense of direction.
-First person game-play is neat to offer, but is never used. There is seriously no point in using it.
-There can be a few moments when playing where you can get stuck on terrain or find it hard to jump up on top of something, which can be minorly annoying. 
-Group queuing for PVP is currently removed, which in my opinion takes away from the PVP experience.

Overall I would recommend this game if you're a fan of MMOs and of course a fan of the Elder Scrolls games.
This game does have an Elder Scrolls feel to it, the environment and game-play does feel like Tamriel.
If you're going to compare this game to World of Warcraft, you won't like it. It has a very different play style, however I do believe that ESO has a refreshing feel to it.

The developers appear to still care about the game as well, being that content is regularly added to keep the game interesting.

TLDR: Game is good, give it a go.

Yes, this game was pretty bad before the free update. They knew that no one would like the paid subscription and so they finally made it free (after initial purchase).

This game is a MUST HAVE for Elder Scrolls fans, and players who want a ""new"" type of MMO.

PROS:
+ Good Combat System, No turn taking, and no point and spam keys.
+ No ""Grab this, kill ten of these"" Quests are INTERESTING AND FUN.
+ Lore is great, I really get immersed in this game.
+ NOT PAY TO WIN.
+ GOOD ECONOMY. I can buy iron ore 12g in one area and sell it to another player 15g in a different area.
Also no Crowns for Gold, So rich people cant mess up the economy.
+ Decisions affect gameplay.
+ Feels like a single player game, plays like an MMO.
+ First person, third person, and birds eye veiw for all players and preferences.
+ Amazing soundtrack.
+ No paid subscription.
+ No lowkey *BUY OUR STUFF PLZ* (ex. Guild wars 2 chest drops and keys.)
+ Quick and fast customer support.
+ PvP is very fun. Destroying forts with siege equipment is a blast.

Cons:
- Character creator is absolute trash. needs WAY more hairstyles and body mods.
- Must do quests to level up. Grinding takes forever.
- Needs more classes besides 4 basic ones.
- Needs more spells.
- Wish it had more of a ""I am me"" feel. 
- Shopkeepers will give you 1 gold for items that took your FOREVER to get.

The good outweighs the bad TREMENDOUSLY. Buy this game, have fun and recommend it! Lets get this to overwhelmingly positive like it deserves.


***EDIT***

After playing for some time, I started to play with a friend. We started two new characters and were going to complete quests together.

The group questing needs some major improvements.

Suggestions to the Developers:

+Add need/greed system
+If I complete an objective, my partner should NOT have to complete that same objective.
+Players should have a ""Waiting for buddy"" before going to next area/ talking to an NPC.
+Players should be able to teleport to buddy, their exact location if they become to far apart.

eso cross play 2024",eso need cross listen eso cross 2024,2,0.0
306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"A few things for new players:
1. Stealing is the right (only) way to make decent gold if you're anti social and don't want to sell stuff on guild stores. There's multiple sets that can be used at once to reduce your detection radius when sneaking and going cat will reduce it even further. To the point you can sneak into npcs and they won't see you (cat not required, but makes it easier). From there it's just how much laundering you can do each day holding you back. Destroy white drops if you want to fast track your gold making.

2. If you ever plan on getting something via crowns, DO NOT buy crown packs. Buy ESO plus instead. ESO plus gets you just as many crowns as the pack, but with the added bonus of the crafting bag for a while. That crafting bag will be your best friend. Yes, it sucks it's a paid service instead of just being baseline, because it really should be baseline.
While you have ESO plus as well, go get companions. NPC allies who will help you fight, heal or tank. They are super helpful when going solo! You may have to look up how to get them.

3. Nothing matters until max level (CP 160) look up a good set for your build and where to get it and *avoid* that area until you're max level. The way equipment drops works is once you get a set piece and bind it you're unable to get that piece again until you have the full set. You do not want to get a super awesome for your build item at level 10. Once you do reach max level and start equipment hunting, do not bind something until it has the perfect stats you want. You can always upgrade quality, but re-rolling stats is much more expensive and requires dlc or a guild. And once you get the full set, anything can drop again. Good luck getting what you're looking for.

4. Guild stores are your friend! Often for cheap, you can get a full set of max level gear that's decent enough to get you started. There's an official website to list everything on sale and it's price and where it is. https://tamrieltradecentre.com/ will help a lot for finding what you need, use it often!

5. NEVER EVER PAY FOR VAMPIRISM OR LYCANTHROPY. EVER. People give these out free so often and you will likely just be scammed. AFK near whichever shrine you choose and you'll be bit eventually. Asking in map chat will often get answers, don't listen to the jerks who try to put you down for asking, it's the best way to get bit. Look up where shrines are if you don't want to do the next thing. You can be cured anytime at any mages guild in major towns, like Riften, for a small cost in gold. This will not reset your XP gain on the skill line, but it will refund the skill points.

6. Addons are a must! For example a Minimap that shows where spirit shards are (skill points), chests, bosses, ect. They are extremely helpful and you're better off learning how to use them before you get started. Is it less immersive? Yeah, a little. Does it make the game playable? Yeah, a lot.

7. On the store there is a free object called the armory. Place this in your first house and every character from then on, fast travel to that house and save a level 6 zero points distributed, no armor set. This will let you reset your character anytime so you can reset skills and stats, and reset any vampirism or lycanthropy you may have for free. This thing is really, really helpful and for some reason not talked about at all! You can get an inn home in most major towns for very cheap or even free, place it there!

The game does have it's problems but it's fun to hang out in, gather gold or bs with friends (or strangers in map chat). You can make a name for yourself in pvp/alliance wars or you can just become a massive collector owning every house in the game and be a guilds pride and joy.

[b]Is this game Skyrim 2?[/b] No.

[b]Can I heal mid-battle by shoving 50 cheese wheels in my mouth and then unpausing?[/b] No. 

[b][i]So what is this game?[/i][/b]
This game is an MMORPG. It has the story elements that are familiar to Elder Scrolls fans, but the format is similar to that of any MMORPG. There is a lot of content you can play solo, but there is also content that can or must be done in groups. 

[b]Story[/b]: Depends on the zone, can range from 4/10 to 11/10. 

[b]Quest Design[/b]: Depends on the quest and on play style. Can be a 9/10 if you're interested in the lore, but if you're more interested in skipping any and all relevant dialogue and just doing tasks, it can get dull. 

[b]Content[/b]: 11/10, I am far-too-many hours in and I have about 30%-40% more content left in the game in terms of quests and areas alone, not including dungeons and trials. 

[b]Graphics[/b]: 9/10, the fantasy style means that the game ages well despite being 2014. 

[b]Difficulty[/b]: 3/10 to 9/10. (Easy to learn, difficult to master.) 

[b]Combat[/b]: 6/10. It's average, nothing too insane but not horrible either. 

[b]UI[/b]: 5/10 in its base form, but can be raised much higher with addons on PC. 

[b]Price[/b]: Low. It goes on sale often, and if you get the non-upgrade edition of the newest expansion (Greymoor at the time of this writing), you get all of the past major DLCs as well, so you don't need to play catch-up. Unlike what others may claim, [i]subscription is not required[/i]. You can get the subscription if you want to try out the DLC or if you are a hard-core player or interested in doing major crafting. However, if you are just a casual once-in-a-while player, there is no need to buy the subscription. This also means that if you are about to have a busy time irl, you can pause your subscription without being locked out of the game if you still want to plat occasionally but not enough to warrant it.

Yes, there are crown crates and a crown store and stuff that does cost real money in most cases. No, you can't collect everything in the game, even if you toss a Jeff Bezos salary at it. And that's part of the beauty of it -- no two people have the exact same stuff. Besides, all of the things that people cry are super expensive or in the crown crates? [b][i]It's all cosmetic!!![/i][/b] I really don't see why people are losing their ***es over it when they're the ones willingly paying stupid amounts of money for minor cosmetic changes. 

You can play the game 100% without ever needing to get anything from the crown store or paying any more for it. This ain't World of Warcraft, people,

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'll start by saying this. I have played many MMOs in my days. Some more than others such as Ultima, Runescape, World of Warcraft, FF14...but Elder Scrolls Online, mind you this is in this gamer's opinion, has been the richest, immersing, and positive community driven MMO I have ever played.

-:::The community:::-
The player community of ESO has always been thoughtful, encouraging, and kind. There have only been probably two occurrences of a player being toxic in my 1200+ hours of playing. Even if you're not in a guild and you want to ""Sword Online '' it a bit, players you meet in the game are in one word, Awesome! Want to hear something even more dope? Players will sometimes help you get the gear you need by being on the lookout in rando dungeon runs. I do this myself and just trade the gear without asking for anything in return. Why? Because others did it for me when I started to play. Don't know when it started, but this mindset really is helpful for new players or vet players working up an alt. The forums and redit and great places to go for information and if you want to mention something.

-:::Money Stuffs:::-
First, the base game is $20 (USD) with NO subscription cost required. The base game is loaded with content on it's own. There are free-to-play events that last for about a week or two. During the event, usually the base game is even cheaper. Micro transactions exist and expansions will cost extra, but you don't need to spend an extra dime when you start to play. If you want to get a ESO plus membership...you'll mainly do it for the Crafting Bag! You can pay for one month, farm your behind off, toss it in the bag, and you will still have access to the materials even as a non member. Personally, I don't let my membership drop. I have enjoyed Bethesda games for many, many years and I believe in their mission statement as a company. This is my way of supporting them. In truth, I have spent roughly hundreds in a combination of micros/Xpacs/ESO Prime memberships. If you have a tattoo that says ""No Regrets"", give your tat a double pat, because it is how I feel about the money I have spent.

-:::The gameplay:::-
Ughhh...where to start...
There is so much to do in the game. 1200+ hours and I still have things to do and explore. It's mind blowing! Each zone has unique story lines and quests/daily quests with awesome rewards. There is the main quest, which I recommend before doing anything else. It will get you attuned to the game mechanics, your race/class/weapon types/armor, and learn some awesome lore along the way. The character creation and race/class/weapon/armor combinations are endless. Pick the Race and Class you find that most speaks to you, but let's face it, you'll eventually want to build alts to see what else is awesome!

-Character-
The max level is 50, and more growth with Champion Points after capping. Character creation is just as in depth as any Elder Scrolls game. While questing, sometimes your race or class can trigger a line in NPCs to make it more immersive. Each race and class has their own special abilities and passives. There are the ""End-Game"" builds for grrrr dps, beefy tanking, and poofy Healing, but you can customize your play style for questing and solo-work in your way. Example? Hmmm? Dragon Knight...usually seen as a tanking class using one/two handed weapons with shields while breathing fire, throwing rocks, battle screaming, and jumping into battle like a Barbarian Berserker in DND, but...go ahead...equip a bow or a staff and do those same things and go Ham if you want to. Possibilities are endless for each combination of race, class, weapon and armor types.

-Content-
Bethesda is continuously adding new content and revisiting the game to keep it fresh and fun. They just revamped Champion Points...I haven't delved into the new system enough to make a bias comment, but I can say this; ""HOLY CANNOLI BATMAN"", there is great potential and growth for your character in the new system for PVE and PVP. There is usually a new expansion every year and it is treated like a year-long event with a prologue quest, updates, and things to do that get you ready for what is coming. As with most MMOs, there are also seasonal events like the New Life Festival (my favorite), Jester Festival, Witches Festival, Midyear Mayhem...just to name a few. All have great rewards, quests, and things to do. They add to those rewards each year!

-PVP-
You into PVP? Good, cause I'm not (lol). I can't accurately comment on PVP, because I am mainly a questing player trying to build his own home. That said, I can say this; It's a typical MMO PVP experience with dailies and stuff, but it has quite a few modes to choose from with unique objectives! Wish I could comment more, but maybe once I join a guild, I'll team up with those who can teach me the ways of ESO PVP. I'll edit this when that happens.

-Guilds-
Another area I can't accurately comment on, but what do guilds have in them? People! The Players! Look online about people in their guilds, no matter the game. No matter the size of the guild (and they can get big) they have long lasting friendships built with others they have met. Example I can give is my WoW days. I still talk to my old Guild Master and friend. She is like my Big Sister in a way and we live states apart! The people you meet in your guild could bring you joy. Meet with them and become family! Learn with them! Fight with them! FOR THE HOR...sorry, wrong game...the family aspect still applies though. No matter your race or banner you join, your guild could be that family you were looking for.

-Homes-
Yes, you can buy homes in ESO, just like in previous games. Buying homes makes them account wide, so your alts will be able to go into those same homes. Some players have built their own home. I am currently doing this and it is a massive undertaking, but I am enjoying it! You can even invite other players and guild mates into your home! ""Say What!?"". If that's not cool, then how about this. Your non-combat pets and mounts...you can set paths for them to walk or fly while you are in your house...Awesome! There are so many furniture items to collect and showcase. Get enough of them and you’ll eventually need more than one home to place them in!

-:::Conclusion:::-
I have had so much fun doing it solo, but this solo player is looking for a guild now. Like I said above, Richest, Immersing, and Positive community driven. You have all to gain and only a few hours to lose to download and give it a proper go. There is way too much to say about the game and so much more I want to say about individual aspects. You can download it on PS, Xbox, and PC. Just to be clear, cross-play is not a thing, but PC is where I am at. Come play and have some fun! Go! Go do it! Download! Yeeeesssss!!! Download it!!

+ Builds on the Elder Scrolls universe
+ Active player base

[b]Cons[/b]
- Some dislike the combat (varies per person)
- Issues with server performance, especially with PVP

[i]Skip to the bottom for my final thoughts[/i]


[h1][u][b]Breakdown:[/b][/u][/h1]
[h3][b]Introduction[/b][/h3]
With the latest expansion [i]Greymoor[/i] on the horizon, I thought I'd write my review for The Elder Scrolls Online a few months in advance for new players who may be interested in the game currently. It's best to get a head start before the content drops!

[h3][b]Gameplay[/b][/h3]
The Elder Scrolls Online, which I shall refer to as ESO, is a popular open-world MMORPG developed by ZeniMax Online Studios, and allows its players to explore a vast amount of Nirn during an unfamiliar time period in the Elder Scrolls universe.

[i][b]Play as you see fit[/b][/i]
One of the best features of ESO which I highly commend is its easy accessibility to all players. That isn't to say that the game is easy - rather, it doesn't punish new players for mistakes they may make in the early stages of the game. Trust me, I myself made countless mistakes across a few characters before really getting a foothold. The learning curve may be a bit steep, but the early stages aren't absolutely brutal on new players. Feel free to put your character points into whatever you deem fit - you can always respec your points cheaply later on when it really matters.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975511257

I'm not the best person to go to in terms of advice for beginners; there are plenty of in-depth beginner guides that can help you off your feet. But if you like going in blind as I did, know that it's never too late to follow a build. Furthermore, ESO is available to play in two main ways, PVE (player vs environment) and PVP (player vs player). I personally stick to the PVE aspects of the game, notably dungeons, delves and questing. I haven't quite gotten to the raids yet.

Choose your role (Damage Dealer, Tank or Healer), set up your skill bar and prepare for battle. I've heard mixed reviews of ESO's combat system, but I personally have no problems with it and enjoy combat. Furthermore, there are currently six playable classes (four of which are available for free with the base game), ten races (nine of which are available for free with the base game), and thousands of unique viable builds to choose from for your gaming pleasure.

[i][b]Puts the Massive in Massively Multiplayer[/b][/i]
One of my biggest gripes with ESO, that is also simultaneously one of my favourite features of the game, is its ridiculously massive world that is incredibly easy to get lost in. But with great power (huge 3D world with nice models, fully voice-acted characters, etcetera) comes great responsibility - in the form of 100-odd gigabytes on my hard drive. You read that right: over 100 glorious gigabytes of disk usage.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975507520 

On the other hand, ESO is also massively multiplayer in the sense that it is still very much alive. Unfortunately, the game isn't cross-platform, but on NA PC you still see other adventurers *mostly* wherever you go. The community is also *mostly* friendly, with many guilds waiting to welcome you in with open arms. By the way, you can be a member of up to FIVE different guilds, so there's really no excuse not to make some friends.

If you're the type of player who likes playing through content by yourself, don't worry. You're not alone. You can play through the majority of ESO's content, sans high-tier PVE challenges.

[h3][b]Story[/b][/h3]
In my humble opinion, ESO is one of the best MMORPG story content-wise. I used to be the type of player who would skip through dialogue and cutscenes to get straight to the combat. Eventually, though, I started taking the time to listen to the fully voice-acted dialogue. Some quests are certainly better than others, but overall the quests are of good quality. I highly recommend you level your main character through questing rather than grinding. Not only do you get to experience the quest, but you can also get unique rewards and lots of XP.

[h3][b]Audio and Visuals[/b][/h3]
ESO is a great looking game and is again one of the best MMORPGs visual-wise in my opinion. I'll admit, there are definitely some meshes that look better than others (outlier examples), but for the most part, the game looks great. I really enjoy riding on my mount from point-to-point rather than just teleporting. The better rig you have, the better the game looks. The soundtrack is also superb, and as I've mentioned, the dialogue is fully voice acted.

[h3][b]Value[/b][/h3]
In terms of the base game, which frequently goes on sale, there are hundreds of hours of content available with no other purchases, microtransactions or otherwise. 

[i][b]The Business Model[/b][/i]
On the other hand, there is also a plethora of paid DLCs, expansions, and microtransactions available in ESO's Crown store. The game's premium currency, Crowns, can be traded among players in the form of gifting items in exchange for gold. This is often done through middlemen and can be risky. ZeniMax offers no other form of currency exchange. There also exists a paid membership, ESO Plus, which is not required for the base game, that grants subscribers unlimited access to all DLC (excluding new expansions), a number of crowns and other benefits.

Again, the aforementioned microtransactions are not at all necessary for hundreds of hours of enjoyment, but I myself have made purchases on the Crown store and am currently an active ESO+ subscriber.

[h3][b]Bugs/Issues[/b][/h3]
In the actual game itself, you don't run into issues all too often. I experience the occasional crash, but this may not necessarily be due to ESO. Regarding server performance, however, much of the community have raised complaints about the poor performance of the games servers and matchmaking capabilities specifically. This problem mostly applies to those interested in PVP, however, problems do exist with the Dungeon Finder (hit-or-miss queue times).

In general PVE play, especially if you're sticking with the overworld content, you shouldn't experience many problems. If necessary, restart your game every few hours to keep the memory usage low.

[h3][b]Performance[/b][/h3]
My computer (see below) has no problems running ESO at high settings, however, I acknowledge that for lower-end rigs you may encounter difficulty in running the game. Make sure to check the minimum specifications, and if your PC has equivalent or better parts. The in-game settings menu allows you to customize the graphics settings to suit your needs.

CPU: i7-8750
GPU: GTX 1060
RAM: 16GB DDR4

[h1][b][u]In Closing:[/u][/b][/h1]
[i][b]Greymoor is coming.[/b][/i]
The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited is one of the best MMORPGs currently available on Steam. Play how you want in the game's expansive world, against other players or enemies, and prepare yourself for the Dark Heart of Skyrim.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"first, please pardon me for the grammar error
second, i played this game about 40+ hours now, and just only get lvl 20, so i don't really have any experience with the  end-game content yet, but i'll talk about negative and positive side of this game that i experience through out my journey

positive side :
1. storyline and storytelling system
for an MMORPG, this game got really good storyline, zenimax not only concentrate on the main-quest storyline, but also on the side quest, about 90% of the side quest i've done got really great dialogue and very interesting story, most of them always revolve around TES series lore, which is really interesting by itself

and so far 100% of all quest i done are voice acted, it adding the immersive-ness of the game, and help the player with ""tl;dr"" problem 

2.Quest system
as i said, questing here really fun, not feels much like a chore because of the story they offer

and also this game give you multiple choice in some side quest, which will effect you gameplay and the outcome of the quest, its quite rare to find this kind of feature in other MMO

3.Job System
you practically can be whatever you want, wanna be a tank-mage? you can, or a warmage?, you can of course, every job can access all weapons and armor, so you can customize your character whatever you want what will suit your gameplay

4.Skill System
if you ever played GW2, skill system here rather similar BUT much more interesting and complex, because you got a lot of skill to upgrade, and you can choose whatever skill you want, theres your basic job skills, racial skills, world skills, weapon skills etc, and when 1 skill already achieve max level, some of them you can transform it into much more powerfull version of it, create your own skill combo

5.World Design
indeed probably the world design not as detail/as beautifull like other MMORPG especially P2P MMORPG like FF14, but it fit the theme really well, theres variations in each area and faction which fit the lore and add make the game much more immersive, i find my self waste hourse just for exploring the world :))

6.Gameplay
well imagine skyrim/TES series with classic MMORPG skill, thats practically what you get, it's fun, at first probably need a little bit adaptation, but when you get hang of it, its fun even though probably not as fast paced as you imagine, but TES series never been a fast paced action RPG genre

7. Economy system
now, this part that i really like, there is no public auction whatsoever, you can trade/get some kind of auction, but only through a guild, thus in this game you could join up to 5 guilds

with this system, you can cross trading between guilds, looking for best price to buy and sell on each region, really reminds me of XIAN online type of economy, dynamic controlled by player

now, let switch to the negative side of the game :

1. the soundtrack
IMHO, theres no single memorable soundtrack in this game, in FF14 i always remember which soundtrack belong to which area, but here....every music feels the same, theres like no identity at all for each music.

2. the character creation
the character creation too shallow imho, theres no clear different between each slide bar for every part of the character body, thus i can't made the character i really want even though i waste 30-50 minutes creating it


tl;dr -> The Elder Scrolls Online : It sucks no more, highly reccomended for everyone :)",please pardon grammar error 40 hour lvl 20 content talk negative positive side journey positive side 1 storyline storytelling mmorpg good storyline zenimax concentrate storyline side 90 side great dialogue interesting revolve te series lore interesting far 100 voice acted adding immersive ness help tl dr problem 2 questing fun feel chore offer multiple choice side effect outcome rare kind 3 practically whatever wan na tank mage warmage course access weapon armor customize whatever suit 4 skill gw2 skill rather similar interesting complex skill upgrade choose whatever skill there basic skill racial skill world skill weapon skill 1 skill already achieve max transform powerfull version create skill combo 5 world design indeed probably world design detail beautifull mmorpg especially p2p mmorpg ff14 fit theme there variation faction fit lore add immersive self waste hourse exploring world 6 imagine skyrim te series classic mmorpg skill thats practically fun probably bit adaptation hang fun probably fast paced imagine te series fast paced action genre 7 economy public auction whatsoever trade kind auction guild join 5 guild cross trading guild best price region reminds xian online type economy dynamic controlled switch negative side 1 soundtrack imho there single memorable soundtrack ff14 remember soundtrack belong music feel there identity music 2 creation creation shallow imho there clear different slide bar body waste 30 50 minute creating tl dr elder scroll online suck highly reccomended,1,0.9916
306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I love this game, but I think it's time that I air my grievances.
As you can see, I have spent quite a lot of time in ESO. I have probably played ESO more then any of its developers, and all we as a community ask from them is that they listen and understand our problems. So, that's why I am writing this rant as a means of informing the devs. However, any ESO dev has probably already stopped reading and decided to play a match of Tales of Tribute, or, as I call it, a waste of time. Speaking of Tales of Tribute, to even play that, you need too pay for it, so let us discuss...

1: A history of free and paid content in ESO:

June 2023 - Necrom - $40

Now, if my math is correct (which it probably isn't), buying all of the DLC's at launch, and not counting limited time free events, you will have spent around $690. Some will argue that you can just buy the monthly subscription, but why is it that games such as Wow and Warframe can give away their new and old content for free? Sure, ESO DLC's have one major quality that others lack which likely contributes to the price, full voice acting, however, they use the old Bethesda trick of hiring the same actors to voice countless NPC's but, whatever I guess...
I'm not asking for everything to be given away for free, I am quite literally asking for scraps that are several years old. You can however, purchase things from the crown store with gold. This is done via in-game gifting. So, you would send a player gold, and in return they will spend their crowns to gift you the crown store item that you want. This is not without its problems, with the biggest obviously being scams, but, getting DLCs this way is fine... I guess. However, if you do get scammed, you will have to contact support, and speaking of support...


2: Zenimax as Developers and as support:
While I do somewhat respect @Bethesda_Kraken for responding to reviews, I personally think that no response, is better than a copy/paste generic response. Anyway, let me walk you through communication between the players and Zenimax, in my own experience.

Experience 1:
1: Ignore the steam forums.
2: Several players post a bug/problem, in my case, a bug regarding a lead.
3: Players say that the lead is not dropping and that it is probably bugged.
4: Zenimax says that it is not bugged, and that it is very unlikely that something like this would be bugged.
5: Time passes.
6: Zenimax says that it has been bugged, and that they will work on a fix.
The fact that this has happened several times is hilarious.

Experience 2:
1: Players ask for something meaningful to be added or fixed.
2: Zenimax releases an archeology/antiquity minigame.
3: Players once again ask for something meaningful to be added or fixed.
4: Zenimax releases a card minigame.
5: Players complain.
6: Forum thread locked/deleted.

This game has come a long way in 9 years, and I don't want it to fail or get worse, but for many like myself, we play this game because we like the world of the Elder Scrolls. So when the Elder Scrolls 6 is released, why should I stick around and play this? When I compare this to something such as Warframe or Destiny 2, which also had rocky starts and have changed dramatically over time, I can't help but feel disappointed and cheated. Both of those games are free with zero subscriptions. and yet I feel that they are less predatory than ESO. Anyway, I will continue to update and change this review over time, thanks for reading.

It's all so tiresome...

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I don't know where to start with this review but I want to say that this has been a game I keep coming back to and now currently play as my main MMO. I picked it up between the Legion and BFA expansions of WoW as a game to kinda dip my toes into. Now it's my main MMO and I'm in love with this game and all aspects of it. Well...most aspects, not all

The combat feels deep and rewarding with a plethora of ways to handle building your character. You can try all types of creative and fun builds without the worry of being a parse monkey (unless you're going for the highest level of progression). The only bad part is the fact abilities sometimes fail to fire off which can be frustrating. Pls fix the bugs, ZoS.
The open world is the best of any MMORPG with how the game utilizes its world. All quests are voice acting, all NPC's are voiced. The questlines in the game are amazing.

I love the PvP even if it can be frustrating in its performance lately. But there's no game that feels quite like this one. Most people write off PvP because the skill gap and don't know why they are dying. But I promise if you take the time to learn the fundamentals and mechanics of it, you might fall in love as well.

Dungeons: Best dungeons of any MMO hands down. Maybe not the base game stuff, but the DLC dungeons on veteran and vet hard mode are incredible.

Trials/Raids: The only part of the game I can't speak to the quality of because I don't have the patience to be on a raid team. I enjoy the dungeons and the pvp and that's enough for me.

Arenas: Amazing solo and group arenas exist with tons of awesome rewards and weapons

Character building: This game is a true RPG in how you kit out your character and play specific builds. You'll find out when you play

The bad: Crown store. Stay so far from it, it is predatory to new players and half the stuff on it shouldn't be on it. Even worse, the crown crates rely on FOMO to get you to buy them. Please do not buy them. I am a hypocrite for saying this because I've bought them, but I'm the exact player they're preying on it with. I know I shouldn't buy them yet I do.

ESO Plus is also pushed on you pretty hard as a new player because you won't have a craft bag and won't have access to any of the DLC content. Fear not new players. When starting the game. DO NOT pick up crafting materials while on non-sub account. Instead, use the time to put items on research because you can't even really use those materials unless you have things researched. So research while exploring the game and playing at your own pace. Craft later

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Your expectation of The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™ should first and foremost be that of an MMO, not an Elder Scrolls game. While the game does have the lore and basic 'dumbed down' aesthetic of The Elder Scrolls it lacks the atmosphere. What I mean is it does not draw you into the lore and entice you as does it's single player cousins. Rather, you find yourself mindlessly fighting through zone to zone, quest to quest, dungeon to dungeon with no genuine interest in its lore or atmosphere. This is a hugely common trait to an MMO and not something the Elder Scrolls is known for bringing.

That being said it's by no means a bad game or MMO. In fact, it's outstanding. The combat loosely resembles The Elder Scrolls and has a fairly decent spectrum of play styles between the classes. PVP in ESO is a breath of fresh air but can soon become stale and has a hugely disadvantages experience curve in the start.

To summarize, you'll find yourself trying to delve in and love this game as you would the world of The Elder Scrolls. However, you should not add this to your library simple because it wears The Elders Scrolls 'cloak' as you may be disappointed. As an MMO, it's fantastic and fairly unboring but does leave much to be desired despite its large amount of content. 

If you are looking for a good MMO that wears The Elder Scrolls aesthetic and features a few new treats to the MMO scene then this may be the game for you. If you are looking for a multiplayer skyrim then you will be sorely disappointed.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Review after a long long play time

As you can see i am pretty busy trying to complete the Game with all its content. After 2k + hrs. i think i am able to do a Review.

Yes i played other Es Games. I started with Skyrim as it came out, i loved it. i also tryed Oblivion after that and the last game before i  went to Eso was Morrowind. All games have 1 in common. the Absolut freedom from the very beginning. After you finished the Prologue you will be gently released into a huge open world Area. The ammount of quests you can find in eso is absurd. Its things like "" Bringe me this Staff or kill that Monster "" But there are also Mainquest lines in every Map you can explore ( yes the maps are connected to eachother and you can travel them even by foot. ) These quests can get very long. maby you need 1 or 2 days to complete them. 2 lvl systems are ingame. once you hit lvl 50 you start over with the so called cp system ( Campion Points ) its similar to the skyrim skilltrees from the look. the cp point system gets up to cp lvl 690 right now. every point is a powerfull passive you can connect to eachother to build your own char as you like. Want a Tank who can heal just with 1 weapon bar swap ? go for it. Ant there comes the point where all gets much more interesting. The endgame: I have never played a Game with so much Endgame content as eso. once you hit cp 160 ( which is max gear lvl ) you can start to build up your own Warrior. There are many sets. 5 pice sets, 3 pice stes 2 pices and even 1 pice sets. all of these Items can be combined as you wish, to experiment and build up. Some sets can be crafted, others need to be found. The grinding aspect isnt that bad in eso. There was a update , not long ago. now we all can transmute the Traits from all our weapons and Armor as we like. No more farming 1 dungeon 100 times because the dagger you want just dropps in training. Some dungeons can be extremly brutal, even with a good groupe. ( up to 12 man raids ) 80 % of the game can be beaten very easy, but if you wana min max and bring out the best in your char you have to face greate evil.

The next thing i wana talk about is the pvp system. Everyone hwo played Oblivion will know the place very well. Huge battles are going on in Cyrodiil for the fight of the Emperor title. 3 Allianz Teams build a triangle in the map ( wich is abnormal huge for pvp. so train your horse in speed ) the main goal is to dominate arrount the Imperial city. capure as many castles as you can and hold them. This can be buggy to a point where you are not able to play the game . loading screens of death ( unending loading screen ) if a fight between 200 + players breakes out the fps dropps so low you cant even attack... well thats really a - Point in my opinion. But there are other fine Options where you can battle other players. the imperial city itselfe is a battleground and is very stable. the whole city has a huge dungeon system blow the ground where you can battle too. Battlegrounds ar a new form of 4v4v4 Battles. Normal modes like deathmatches, capture the flag and so on can be played here. A very interesting point is the fighting mecanics. rolldoge, block and weapon swaps in the fights allow you for offensive and deffensive manouver at the same time. even animation cnceling is possible, which allowes good players to nearly double the dps or hot you can dish out. Shure there is and will always be a meta, but it changes and after a while you will know that in eso skill matters. its not just the sets and weapons that makes a good fighter. it takes months to really handle a 2h sword the right way. 

the marked system is a whole dimension in itselfe. there are hundreds of traiding Guilds ingame. every guild can hold up to 500 players i think or 600.  you can have 5 guilds at the same time in evry guild you have 30 slots for selling your stuff. some people play the game just because of the marked. ( Master merchant addon is a must have for traiding )

The community is very nice and friendly. no pay to win at all. the whole real money store stuff is just for the looks.
eso + is another thing. i dont think you need it but it is very awesome. you have no storage problems at all and you can travel to dlcs you dont have in your game. there is a festival once every year where you can try out eso + for free. a whole week. try it first for free and if you cant be without it just do it then.

All in all i wnat to say this game has a huge potential and it uses it the right way. shure the game has bugs, lots of them, but its nothing else like skyrim or oblivion. if you can handle the bugs from the older games you can handle the bugs from eso too. nothing that whould spoil your fun.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I have played this game for the past 3 years and would not recommend it. I would like to start with the positive aspects first.

[h1] Pros	[/h1]

[list]
    [*]ESO has great graphics for an MMO, and the environments look amazing. Its possible to use Reshades to make the game look even better to look at. The cities are really big and its possible to visit most the interiors of most buildings.

    [*]The world feels very alive as there are players everywhere, in every zone even the most outdated ones. It makes it easy to find people to do activities such as world bosses.

    [*]In game community is often helpful, lots of people have helped me out when I was new, but the endgame community can be toxic.
     
    [*]The dungeons are fun and have some cool mechanics. They each have a story in them and also each dungeon is unique and the bosses are quite challenging. I had a lot of fun playing them with friends.
[/list]

[h1] Neutral	[/h1]

[list]
    [*]The story and questing is one of the biggest aspects of ESO, and I have mixed feelings about it. Some of the zones have really interesting and engaging story lines, such as Grahtwood and Orsinium, but I found most of it boring. The main story quests of most zones are ok doing it once but it lacks replay value since there are no actual choices you can make that affects the story to a large degree. Most of the choices left to the player are really small and they mostly show up in side quests. I don't like the side quests most of the time because its often about helping someone who really doesn't have any proper background and isn't interesting, and the quest bosses are highly repetitive and too easy to kill.

    [*]The soundtrack is good I guess but I feel that the best tracks are remastered from the previous Elder Scrolls games. I found  the combat music to be pretty annoying.
[/list]

[h1] Cons	[/h1]
[list]
    [*]I found the combat to be awful, mainly because of animation canceling as well as the combat feeling floaty. So the animation canceling is when you can perform a light attack between abilities. All skills have a one second GCD, but light attacks are on a different timer, which causes this issue. Animation canceling increases DPS by a lot and its essential in endgame content. It requires a significant amount of skill to perform correctly, but it just isn't any fun. What's more is that it makes the character look like they're having a seizure, and it clearly isn't an intended feature. The game makes no mention of this anywhere, but if someone wants to do any endgame content they need to be able to do it, as otherwise most guilds will not consider them.

        Another issue is the champion system, its meant to be the endgame progression system. There are 810 points to obtain in total, and they are obtained by just gaining exp. But the system is boring and it just offers something like +1% damage or +1% magicka recovery and stuff like that. There are no class new abilities added with this system and it isn't really fun for endgame progression.

    [*]Classes feel too similar to each other. ESO has 6 classes, but there exists two variations of each class, magicka and stamina. The stamina version wan't intended by the developers(I think) because there currently is stamina sorcerer and stamina necromancer which don't make much sense. But due to the way abilities work it was found that stacking stamina in builds results in being able to do good dps as well. The problem is that every single class has the same types of abilities, just with different colors and effects. Every class has a similar ground based DOT, one spammable, one buff which grants increased damage, one defense ability which boosts armor and so on. When performing dps rotations, every class plays almost the same due to this. But some classes are tweaked every patch which keeps shifting the meta, so one needs to have every dps class available.

    [*]PVP is too laggy and not fun or balanced. The PVP in this game was intended to be a major aspect, however these days it seems to be neglected. The game was supposed to support 200 vs 200 battles, but even with 20 people on the screen it starts to lag and sometimes gets disconnected. FPS also drops, however the game doesn't use a lot of system resources either. Its also unpredictable to tell what enemy players are casting because of the combination of animation canceling and lag. The PVP isn't balanced in the sense that sometimes one faction has way less players than the other one. Also some classes are just better in every way than other classes, and some sets are overpowered.

    [*]Endgame trials(raids) are also laggy, and the trial design is bad in my opinion. There are only three or four bosses in each one of them, and there is too little trash mobs in between bosses. Bosses have some interesting mechanics but it just isn't very fun due to the poor combat, lag and low fps. Trials also don't drop very powerful gear which is worth chasing after or any cool cosmetics.

     [*] Too much focus on crown store. The game is very hard to play without the monthly subscription as inventory space is highly limited. Even after subscribing, too many things are pay walled, such as mounts, pets and housing. The monthly crowns which are provided are so little that its possible to only buy a pet or a costume. The game has 95% of mounts pay walled with no other way to get them. The better mounts are kept in the loot crates which use another currency system called crown gems, and the coolest mounts are called as radiant apex rewards which cannot be obtained with even crown gems and must be gambled for. Housing in this game is really fun and its possible to make all sorts of structures, but its so ridiculously overpriced, the best houses are crowns only, and even then the best furniture is sold exclusively through the crown store.

        The problem with this is that there is very little incentive to play through the game and collect stuff. And now even skill lines and skill points will be sold through the crown store. Skill lines are an important part of the game because they have important passives which are needed in more difficult content, but they are grindy and boring to level up. It literally takes a 100 hours to grind all the skill lines such as mages guild, undaunted, psijic order and to collect every skyshard to unlock all the abilities on one character. Many players have asked for it to be account wide, but in the end the solution is sold through the crown store. So the crown store isn't limited to cosmetics only, there are game play impacting items as well. I would call it pay 4 the convenience 2 win or something like that( p4c2w :)).
[/list]

I wouldn't recommend this game due to these reasons, as the game is slowly being designed with only the cash shop in mind. I've spent a lot of time and money on this game and I regret it a lot. I mainly maxed out my all of my characters skill lines and skyshards, as well as spent many hundreds of hours becoming a master crafter. Almost everything is available for purchase through the crown store these days, its so bad that its possible to become a master crafter in just a couple of minutes with the crown store. I would only advise this game for TES fans who may be interested in playing the story casually, because as an MMO its just not that good for the amount of time and money that it asks.",past 3 year recommend positive aspect pro eso great graphic environment look amazing possible reshades look look city big possible visit interior building world feel alive player everywhere zone outdated one make easy activity world boss community helpful lot helped new endgame community toxic dungeon fun cool mechanic dungeon unique boss challenging fun friend neutral questing biggest aspect eso mixed feeling zone interesting engaging line grahtwood orsinium found boring quest zone ok lack replay value actual choice affect large degree choice left small mostly side quest side quest helping someone proper background interesting boss highly repetitive easy kill soundtrack good guess best track remastered previous elder scroll game found combat music pretty annoying con found combat awful mainly animation canceling combat feeling floaty animation canceling perform light attack ability skill gcd light attack different timer cause issue animation canceling increase dp essential endgame content requires significant skill perform correctly fun make look seizure clearly intended make mention anywhere someone want endgame content able otherwise guild consider issue champion meant endgame progression 810 point obtain total obtained gaining exp boring offer 1 damage 1 magicka recovery stuff class new ability fun endgame progression class similar eso 6 class exists variation class magicka stamen stamen version wan intended developer currently stamen sorcerer stamen necromancer sense due ability found stacking stamen build result able good dp problem single class type ability different color effect class similar ground based dot spammable buff grant increased damage defense boost armor performing dp rotation class play due class tweaked patch keep shifting meta need dp class available pvp laggy fun balanced pvp intended major aspect day neglected supposed support 200 v 200 battle 20 screen start lag get disconnected fps drop resource unpredictable tell enemy player casting combination animation canceling lag pvp balanced sense faction player class class set overpowered endgame trial raid laggy trial design bad opinion three four boss trash mob boss boss interesting mechanic fun due poor combat lag low fps trial drop powerful gear worth chasing cool cosmetic focus crown store hard monthly subscription inventory space highly limited subscribing thing pay walled mount pet housing monthly crown provided possible pet costume 95 mount pay walled mount loot crate currency called crown gem coolest mount called radiant apex reward obtained crown gem gambled housing fun possible sort structure ridiculously overpriced best house crown best furniture sold exclusively crown store problem incentive collect stuff skill line skill point sold crown store skill line important important passive needed difficult content grindy boring literally take 100 hour grind skill line mages guild undaunted psijic order collect skyshard unlock ability player asked wide solution sold crown store crown store limited cosmetic impacting item call pay 4 convenience 2 win p4c2w recommend due reason slowly designed cash shop mind spent regret mainly maxed character skill line skyshards spent hundred hour master crafter available purchase crown store day bad possible master crafter couple minute crown store advise te fan interested casually good asks,1,0.997

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"This review will be removed if and when the issues I'm going to write about has been addressed by Rockstar Games,

Currently GTA:Online for PC has next to no serious attention from Rockstar Games on the topic of anti-cheat, anti-grief, anti-mod within GTA:Online. and as of today (day of writing) It has come under my attention that Rockstar has failed to properly protect the personal information, location details, IP addresses and other information of its users. Malicious player can obtain a lot of sensitive personal information by use of common mod-menus for GTA Online. Currently Rockstar Games has not acknowledged or addressed this matter via any of their social media platforms, direct email or via a PR spokesperson. 

Worst thing is that you can fall victim of this without even knowing it. all a malicious modder need to know is your Social Club ID or In-Game Nickname.

Rockstar has the means to combat this, but has failed to do so for many years. 

I will leave a youtube video about this topic here: https://youtu.be/UK1vLaHtgec and in the comment below this review from GTA V Speedrunner and rockstar fan 'DarkViperAU'. who has spoken with people who have access to these mod-menus/tools and brought it under attention to his following.

Personal accounts with this issue:
I myself have also fallen victim to this issue. This happend a couple weeks ago as per writing of this review. I was streaming GTA Online gameplay on twitch and via the stream a malicious person saw my socialclub name in the stream and started targeting me, joining my FRIENDS ONLY session whilest not being part of my friends list. masking his name by replacing it with racial profanity and harrasing me with gameplay exploits and other nasties. blowing me up, hunting me down in godmode and finally crashing my game. after that I switched my stream over to a single player game because I already have put one and two together. 

Thanks for reading. Any questions I will try to anwser. I love Rockstar Games and there games but this is bad beyond believes.

EDIT: Here is a link to a guide I have writen a while ago on how to get a 'public solo session' to avoid modders and griefers messing with you. this is the best way to protect yourself currently within GTAO if you enjoy the game like I do and wish to remain playing it.

[i]Questions I get often under this guide;[/i]
Q: Why do you keep playing a game you dislike?
A: I do not dislike GTAV or GTAO, I want it to better.

Q: Why do you keep playing a game you see as a security risk?
A: I know how to weapon myself against the risk and I still enjoy playing GTAO so I do not quit.

Q: Do you have more sources or proof besides the DarkViperAU youtube video?
A: Yes, I will update this guide when I get more content on this topic, preferably from different sources. Including:

Q: Who cares? Online gaming will always be like this.
A: I strongly disagree. while yes, a 100% cheater free online experience doesn't exist I know GTA Online could and should be better. Just look at what the FiveM Community has done, It runs on dedicated servers, has no widespread cheating issues and doesn't save any user data.

Q: What am I supposed to do with the information you have given me?
A: Whatever you want with it. I want to mainly inform you. the games networking is Peer2Peer and has next to no anti-cheat, creating a unfair and toxic online environment for normal players. with privacy risk, banning issues and so much more. I hope it help you to make an informed decision

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"I have been playing this game for over 5 years. From PS3 to PC.

I have never cheated or used hacks/mods. And suddenly Rockstar decided to ban me for no reason.

Once my ban is lifted, 5 years worth of progress will be gone.

If they won't rectify this issue, I'm going to turn this into a full-blown media scandal.

EDIT:
Just in case my claim sounds dubious, here's what I was doing in the 24-hours before I got banned:

- I just received the Stone Hatchet and completed the 25-kills challenge (and didn't receive the 250,000 GTA$ bonus for it).
- I received the 750,000 GTA$ moneydrop for watching the official livestream event (https://www.facebook.com/rockstargames/posts/10156559856180097).
- I was promoting my Nightclub and waiting for my supplies to fill up.
- I logged out to take a nap for a couple of hours.
- I woke up, tried to log in again, but the Social Club verification was taking too long, so I quit out of the game and restart.
- When I restart the game, I received the message that my account has been banned for 30 days.

I have sent multiple messsages to Rockstar Support, but all of my tickets were closed immediately with a preformatted response:

- ""You did something wrong but we won't tell you exactly what you did.""

I'd like to add that buying the game for single player is absolutely worth it, but online is simply a mess. 

It's been 3 weeks now and R* refuses to acknowledge their error, so I stopped playing and caring. There's no point in playing online if R* can steal your legitimate money away at any time. And the irony is that legitimate players are getting hurt while cheaters are unaffected.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"3 years ago... my father bought me this game as a gift for my 17th birthday because I was huge fun of GTA and Rockstar Games.
He also bought game for himself.
I was so happy because I finally got opportunity to play something I wished for years. ( GTA ONLINE )
I played it so hard on ""GTA Online"" mode with my dad, where I spent around 300 hours of playtime in less than 2 months, maybe even a month.
In time I said above, my character was 107 level, had all guns fully upgraded, had some bussiness, nice cars... etc

Guess what ?

I got banned for 30 days, because they said that I cheat...!

I NEVER used any kind of cheats in any game I or my family paid with REAL MONEY, especially if it is a GIFT!

My father spent around 25 Euros for this game in a way to suprise me + 25 Euros to be able to play with me on GTA ONLINE MODE!

I was totally dissapointed, I wrote a ticket, and they responded me with their 'robot' message saying me that I used cheats and telling me that I have to wait for 30 days to be able to play again... but from ZERO!
BUT HEY! ... I managed to 'survive' without playing GTA V for ENTiRE a MONTH!

Then I finally started again, playing only Races in 'GTA Online' mode for couple of hours then quits.
Next day, when I turned again 'GTA Online' mode I got a nice BLACK SCREEN with BIG WHITE TEXT saying that my account is BANNED PERMANENTLY from GTA Online!

I WAS SHOCKED, again I wrote a ticked and explained the problem,  but they just used their useless 'robot' by saying me that this is their final decision...

So from that day, I SWORE TO MYSELF that I would NEVER buy any kind of ANYTHING from Rockstar Games ,and this will remain FOREVER.  

I know that you don't give a sh*t about me, which you already proved me with this useless 'robot' Rockstar Support,
but with this 'approach' you are losing many your fellow fans and customers.


NOW LETS TALK ABOUT A GAME ITSELF :

'Single Player' is simply fantastic and there is not anything more to say about it.

'GTA Online' mode was simply something best what GTA Series ever had until the end of 2016 year.

After 2016, Rockstar became hungry for money by adding so many things which regulary doesn't belong to GTA Series anymore... like flying bikes, WW3 tanks, futuristic guns and other sh*t.

This resulted in making this game DISAPPOINTEMENT, by losing all recognizable good sides of GTA Series ( where the cops and criminals was main thing in the game. )

By summarizing impressions... I MUST GIVE YOU A NEGATIVE REVIEW, because 2 reasons I said above. ( 1) Your approach to your fans and customers is dumb and useless, 2) You ruined this game with 'updates' from 2017 to this date. )

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"If you are looking for a great singleplayer experience, you can ignore this review. You're getting what you pay for there.

If on the other hand you're looking to play GTA Online I cannot recommend the game anymore. It's fun in theory but the way Rockstar handles stuff is just awful. Not only are they completely helpless with the cheater situation in the game but their attempts to stop them actually hit legit players as well. I've earned quite a good amount of in game cash during one of their double money weeks shortly before the last major DLC hit and Rockstar in an attempt to remove cheated/modded money removed 7 million (thats the equivalent of about 80 real life bucks) from my account. In-game money I had earned through their event. I've contacted the support multiple times only to receive responses that either claimed the money was cheated or threatened to ban me.

After about 5 support tickets I gave up. Rockstar Games is scamming their own customers, and that's why I can't recommend being a customer of Rockstar Games anymore. If you already have the game and still play GTA Online I'd recommend doing the following: Go online and search for a cheater willing to give you modded money, proceed to get as much modded money as possible and spend as much of it as you can. Never even think about playing the game legitimately to earn money and for god's sake don't buy shark cards.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Singleplayer is amazing. The story, characters, map. Even after playing over and over again it's still entertaining. I like it way more than the GTA 4's story.

[b]As for online[/b] - this is the reason why I don't recommend the game, because I think that most people nowadays buy the game mainly because of the online. Don't get me wrong; I used to love it, played over 400 hours of pure online, everything was awesome, I thought that this is the perfect multiplayer game, they are constantly updating it and there is a lot of stuff - which has become the problem. A year and a half ago, everything was more or less balanced, the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me: 

[i]""Hey buddy, want to enjoy the content? Well, you should get our brand new garage only for 2M.""[/i]

Then Gunrunning. Again, my overall feelings:

[i]""Look at this cool update! The players will be able to get their bunkers only for 1.5M. Also, don't forget to upgrade your equipment for another 1M. Did we forget to mention that getting additional people working for you will only cost you half a million? By the way, you will time from time get raided and lose everything, unless you buy another cameras for 400K! All the raids will magically disappear! Want to modify your weapons in your Workshop? Well, too bad, you need a trailer for that, but don't worry, it's only 1 to 2 and a half millions. Do you want to train your shooting? There you go, only for 700K! Do you prefer white over black? The paint costs 105K, so... Did we mention that you can take a nap there? The key for that room costs 265K. Do you want a Gun Locker which you will probably never use? That will be 175K. You want some caddies? 85K or 120K if you want to have them larger. Don't forget to check out the new cars! Get yourself a car that shoots a couple of missiles only for 4-5M!""[/i]

How I felt about Smuggler's Run:

[i]Hello there! This update will be about planes. Want a hangar? 1 to 5M. Which style would you prefer? The one for 100k or the one for 320k? Want different lights? No problem - the more expensive style you chose the more expensive lights you'll get! Isn't that cool? Want some nice 'art' on the floor? Sure, we'll paint it for you, costs only up to 200k, just like your apartment you bought last year to do heists! Furniture? You mean another wall? That's another 280k for you. Again, want the keys to access your bed? 235k-375k. You want to customize your 500k glider? One word - WORKSHOP! And guess what this number, 1,150,000 means... Correct! It's the price!""[/i]

The prices of the content added were skyrocketing, if you wanted to truly enjoy the game, you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack, which is by the way, another big problem with this game, or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long, I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards, so I stopped playing. Since then, I've been ignoring the game, not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes, when I notice that there's an update, I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update, you might think this:

[i]""Oh, finally another heist, things are getting back to the state when you could buy a house for 200k and get full content.""[/i]

The reality, however, looks like this: 

[i]""Hey, it's nice to see you back in the game, look at this brand new heist room only for 2 millions, the same idea, only way more expensive.""[/i]

And as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore, I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers. I finally am thrown into a lobby after 10 minutes of loading, I see that I am immediately teleported to an airport from my house with a couple of other people and I am stuck doing some rather strange animations. I always report the guy when I find out who it is, but it doesn't seem to help.

So in early December 2016 I was grinding hard in GTAOnline during a slow week. I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-specific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month.

At first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final. 

I have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up. 

At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed. 

Let me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it.
 
[b]Overall:[/b]
So: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"**EDIT - Apparently I'm one of the [strike]hundreds[/strike] thousand or so people falsely banned. People were getting banned in the tutorial. Seriously?**

This could be a good game if Rockstar wasn't the most incompetent twats I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.

You read a ton of these negative reviews thinking that these people are just unlucky, that it can't happen to you. I've been playing the game nonstop for a past week, making money for a bunker and new cars and in the middle of a game, I just got falsely banned for a month for no reason at all and my character and progress INSTANTLY reset.

It's a shame because this is a blast to play with friends, but Rockstar just can't seem to manage shit with their own game. They don't try to improve the experience, pushing out a bunch of events that no one seems to care about, releasing new content that require days of grinding and instead forcing everyone to buy their absurd shark cards, which people still apparently get banned for.

Another thing which I found cute is that now their support page reminds you over and over no bans, no matter what, may be appealed and are AUTOMATICALLY closed. So even when they ban people fo no reason: tough luck. 

Not to mention, do you know what I'll find when I log on a month later, all of my hard work reset back to nothing? Modders and cheaters, the same that have been on the game ever since it first came to PC.

This game will forever be garbage because of Rockstar. This review will stay if mine and countless others bans are not overturned.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"600 hours. Great game. Came back on to have some fun with an old friend and to check out the new updates. We did some CEO missions and drove around, deciding not to bother the other players and do our own thing. I log off the game. Five minutes later i receive an email stating i have violated the EULA and my account, character, and inventory have all been reset. Years of work. Gone. I decided to give the game another chance after the same scenario had happened to my best friend before the reset was a thing, just to have it happen to me. Don't get me wrong, we had a blast driving around, grinding up enough money to finally buy the vehicles and homes we wanted, then proceed to try the new modes as they came out like the racing, CEO, adversary modes. I saw all these negative reviews on the page stating how people had been randomly banned, and when they brought this up on the forums, they were called ""liars"" and told ""Dont cheat again fgt"". I thought they were full of shit until it happened to me. I have no chance of getting all i've worked for back unless i buy their damn shark cards, and even then, whos to say they wont ban me again? I can say the uninstall button worked better than the anti-cheat, as ive seen countless modders roaming around unopposed, causing hell to other players. Im 90% sure that the majority of answers im going to get for this review are going to be the ""regulars"" who claim everyone hacks or cheats except them, and that i won't be missed. Thats fine.

899770,Last Epoch,its like poe but you can play it without google and spreadsheets,poe google spreadsheet,3,0.0
899770,Last Epoch,"So I bought this for myself last week as an avid ARPG enthusiast with well over 2000 hours on Path of Exile and god knows how long on D2 back in the day, I blink, and 50 hours have passed. This game shows phenomenal promise, the devs are super active and pumping out content and fixes at a rapid rate and have been faithfully following the roadmap plan.

Last Epoch is far easier to get into than PoE, with a much more approachable passive and active skill system. Every weapon type can be used by every class which allows for some juicy build diversity, there's plenty of synergy between skills and passives and all upgrade points feel rewarding with a satisfying bump in power. 

Let's go over some pro's:

- Tons and tons of character customisation, got all the basic equipment, rings, belts, amulets and idols, a neat item that provide powerful buffs to stats. A 4x4 grid is provided to arrange idols in whatever way you want, with smaller idols providing smaller or more generic buffs such as flat health or a small % increase to fire damage, and larger idols providing big specific buffs such as % lightning damage but the value is doubled if you have over 300 max mana. These idols allow for a lot of extra customisation. 
- Enjoyable story campaign with good voice acting on top, granted the story isn't fully completed yet but I had fun! Time travel, cosmic horror, many biomes and environments, immortal emperors and imperious gods! What's not to like?
- Telegraphed enemy attacks!!! Words cannot describe how gratifying it is to see where the massive void bomb thrown at you is actually going to land, allowing you to dodge or time your defensive abilities accordingly. And if/when you do die, there's a death screen showing you what attack you died to and what damage type/s that attack dealt.
- An approachable deterministic crafting system is something PoE has been crying out for, and thankfully LE provides. Yes it does still require some luck, but basically how it works is thus; you find affix shards all over the place as a lootable ground item which provide a single use ""craft"" to forge onto an item or to improve an existing roll. Every possible affix can drop as a shard, or you can shatter an item with an affix you want to apply to another item and get a random amount of shards back from all the affixes on the shattered item. It's easy to play around with, and shards fly out of mobs and barrels so there's plenty to experiment with! The highest tier rolls (T7) are drop only, with item forging allowing a maximum affix tier of 5 so you can't fully power a basic roll therefore keeping loot valuable late-game. Fracturing an item prevents it from being modified anymore, and can even lower your affix tiers so it's basically a game of chicken if you want to upgrade your item more and more.
- The Monolith of Fate is a solid endgame grind, allowing you to unlock permanent character upgrades upon completing the mini quest lines contained with each Monolith stage. Endless Arena keys can drop from the Monolith loot chest allowing you to challenge the appropriately named Endless Arena against waves of mobs providing a good chunk of xp.
- Advanced affix descriptions provide a description of an affix, for example ""chance to inflict shock"" is a possible item affix, and if you hold ""alt"" while hovering over the item it will tell you exactly what shock does. All the defensive mechanics show the maths behind them. Basically the game is exceptionally well explained! 
- Level setting, backgrounds and atmosphere are top-notch and the End of Time ""town"" has a freaking black hole in the background which is cool as fuck.

Consequentially there are some cons:

- Gold isn't particularly useful yet, and items aren't worth picking up to sell as you get plenty from it dropping from mobs and breakables. However I imagine when the bazaar is introduced and allows player trading it will become much more useful!
- You can't modify uniques or set items which can be annoying if you get one with low rolls or implicits.
- While the game does run well generally, some skills and enemy attacks do slow the framerate down particularly the big screen size ones that can be used repeatedly. 
- No random terrain generation, as in if you run ""shining cove"" multiple times, the zone layout is the same every time. Personally I don't mind this but it could get a bit same-y doing the same layout over again.

Overall, Last Epoch has incredible potential and is already a super fun ARPG with a good story, great itemisation, satisfying character upgrades through levelling and item upgrades and a great dev team who deserve your support.

899770,Last Epoch,"If you're looking through the reviews trying to find why it was review bombed, it was because at one point the devs had made the decision to not add trading after saying they would from the beginning. They had since lifted that decision. They came up with their own solution to the reason they initially said they weren't going to add it. 

You can see more on the trade news here:

As for negative reviews complaining that development is slow. It's not like they're some massive triple A studio that can pump out games at will. They're just a group of remote indie devs. I rather them take this route and make sure they release a proper and polished game, instead of an unfinished mess like Wolcen.

That being said, this game is worth it. It definitely scratches that ARPG itch.

899770,Last Epoch,"Just as a reminder this is a review during Early Access. Some things will change before 1.0 Release version.
I'm Playing during 8.1 March 18, 2021, and have played since sometime around 7.0. 
The game is an Action RPG like Diablo 2, Titan Quest, and Path of Exile. It has many things that the players would like in this genre. 
Classes Types (this is not class names in the game, but the general role they fill).  Necromancer, Wizard, Warrior/Paladin, Druid, Ranger. These classes have 1 base class, and 3 specialization trees within them that help you play the game in a way you may enjoy. Each with abilities that unlock once you advance, while also helping you define your character and playstyle further.
Lots of Abilities to choose from and alter through their ability skill trees.

Gear, and Gear Crafting. Not only do they have a large range of Armors and weapons, but you can also craft a more defined piece of gear. Some higher end gear or gear sets may help define a build you are playing.

Gear Gambling. A merchant that lets you gamble away your gold on a possible item. Helpful at later stages of the game. 

A decent challenge from both normal monsters all the way up to the various bosses within both the story of the game and end game content.  

Things That Are currently missing but are being added/ worked on and can be read on their Roadmaps.
Multiplayer, More content and bosses for story and end game, Other gear options, More abilities, More class trees. (The game is currently missing 3-5 Talent trees for the current available classes)

I do not know about PvP. Seeing as how I am not personally interested in it. From what I can tell It is not currently in the game. You will have to do this research on your own.

I personally enjoy the game even in its current state, which does feel a little lacking, but not by much. Another note. The company is rather helpful and communicates with its player base.

899770,Last Epoch,"As many of you reading and playing this game, I am a veteran of Diablo 2, 3, Path of Exiles, Grim Dawn, Torchlight, etc. etc. I have been playing Last Epoch off and on now for a year or so, and it is without a doubt one of the most consistently enjoyable games in the genre. 

The depth of customization of skills alone is unmatched, but not only that, it is incredibly accessible and beginner friendly. Skills and nodes are clearly tagged with related stats and attributes, letting new and veteran players know what their gear should look like in order to get the most out of them. 

I believe this game straddles the fine line between Path of Exile's overwhelming passive and skill system and Diablo 3's underwhelming simplicity of both gear and skills with considerable grace. 

I would recommend this game to anyone who feels potentially alienated by the mainstays of the genre, or who is looking for a fresh and rewarding experience.

899770,Last Epoch,"This game is just like Wolcen, in no way whatsoever. 

This review is specifically about my experience in the game and with the community throughout the Alpha and Beta. With over 500hrs I feel like I am in a unique spot to hightlight the good and the bad. 

First, the price... Even at the current price of $30 or so the game is an absolute steal. For those who choose to wait and not pay a premium for beta access, the game will be $15 at release. The developers have confirmed that the real money shop will be purely cosmetic. 

This game has two major things going for it, the extremely customizable gameplay and very active and transparent Dev team. The development team has been very prompt when it comes to new content. From what I have seen a new patch is out about once a month, and every other patch has major improvements/additions to the gameplay. Devs are not ashamed to push back an update or a feature in order to ensure quality. Don't get me wrong, there are still bugs in the game but they are addressed quickly and usually fixed by the next patch. Overall, probably the best dev team of any game that I have followed closely. 

Now to my second point, customization. As I mentioned, even at the current price you will have no problem getting your moneys worth. There are 5 classes(still missing one, Rouge) and each class has 3 very distinct passive trees. Each different passive tree of every class has 1, if not multiple different possible builds that can be explored(most can be competitive). Now to the truly ""juicy"" part, every single active skill have their own skill tree(excluding some skills  who's skill trees are not released yet) This means that not only do you have a ton of choices when it comes to passives, but you also have the ability to change how fundamentally some of your active skills work. At 500hrs, I still haven't explored all possible builds. Not to mention that there is a ton of content yet to come out which would only add to the game. 

The main question I have seen from people contemplating buying the game is, ""Is it worth the money?"". If you like RPGs you will like this game. You just need to understand that as of right now(Jun 2020) this game is still early access and may not be as polished as other major games of the genre such as PoE, D3, and Grim Dawn which have had years to improve. One thing I have never had to worry about with this game is the solid development and the steady improvements of gameplay and bugs. 

I hope this helps and If you choose to get the game, enjoy!

899770,Last Epoch,D4 wasn't enough. PoE was too much. Last Epoch is juuust right.,d4 poe last epoch juuust,1,0.0
899770,Last Epoch,"[h1]Here is why I think this game is worth your time and money – right now[/h1]

I like ARPGs since Diablo brought this Genre to life. As a huge Diablo II fan I was waiting for a successor. As many others I was disappointed with Diablo 3. It’s a good game but it cannot follow in the footsteps of D2. Torchlight and Path Of Exile both couldn’t either (for me).

When Last Epoch got my attention I was skeptical towards the presentation of the game. The Graphics were not that impressive and in gameplay videos the combat looked not that smooth.

What convinced me to participate in early access was the Reddit community. There was so much confidence in the skills of the developers and the potential of the game. So I jumped in and I don’t regret it.

[u]I will start with the current issues of the game from my point of view:[/u]

[b]Graphics:[/b]
Although the engine got updates and the game looks ok now the game does not look like state of the art right now. LE is not able to compete with Warhammer or Wolcen not to mention Diablo 4 or Path Of Exile 2. The same goes with the physics – not state of the art.

I am sure there will be additional updates and tweaks but I don’t expect LE to transform into a visual blockbuster. 

[b]Gameplay / Combat:[/b]
The combat actually feels not as smooth as in other games. But this is something the devs work on with improving animations, effects and sounds. This definitely will change till full release.

[b]Performance:[/b]
There are many complaints of people with high end systems that the game has low fps and stutters. This is a problem right now that the devs prioritize, but it is not solved, yet. The weird thing is that I don’t have a high end system and are playing at maximum settings without issues – rare fps drops but far away from being unpleasing.

[b]Content:[/b]
Because I am writing this preview about the actual state of the game right now during Beta and Early Access this is an issue. The story is not finished, yet. Not all announced classes are implemented. There is no multiplayer. There is no pvp. The endgame content after completing the game is not implemented. There are two endgame game modes, Monolith and Arena. According to the devs the Arena is just a placeholder and Monolith is not what the devs want it to be when it is finished.

On the LE homepage you can look up what is planned for release. This sounds promising but many of those mechanics are not implemented.

So why do I think that this game is worth its money at its current state? Because the game really has so much potential. [u]Here come the pros that outweigh all the issues:[/u]

[b]Variety of classes:[/b]
There are 5 base classes that divide into 3 sub classes each. Even with the subclasses the playstyle changes drastically within a base class. The classes feel very unique and are very well thought out

[b]Skill trees (Passives):[/b]
There is one passive skill tree for each base class and one additional passive skill tree for each sub class. With every character level you get 1 skill point you can spend in that skill trees. With progression in those skill trees you also unlock active skills that are specific for the subclasses. For Example: By spending points in the Necromancer skill tree (Necro=subclass of Acolyte) you can unlock the skill “Summon Skeleton Mages”.

At some point in the story you have to permanently choose a subclass. This provides some passive bonuses as well as a subclass specific skill. While you can still spend points in all skill trees of a base class you can only choose one profession. This decision is permanent. All passive skill points can be respeced.
The level cap is 100 and there are quests that grant additional skill points.

[b]Skill trees (Skills):[/b]
Every active skill has its own skill tree. These skill nodes provide passive bonuses for the skills like increased critchance, damage and stunchance (and so on..) as well as playstyle changers. For example a melee attack can be altered to be cast at range (Sentinel/Forge Guard - Forge Strike).

You can specialize in 5 skills at a time. You earn skill points by getting xp. But you level your skills separated from your character level (passive skill points). You can respec single skill points or despecialise the complete skill to choose another skill to level. In both cases you lose you progression and have to relevel skill points. But this goes relatively fast and even more the higher your level is.

[b]Variety of builds:[/b]
There are myriads of builds and variations, countless synergies between skills and passives. It’s like an ARPG sandbox where you can build every kind of character you can think of. It’s fun to theory craft exotic builds that are viable at higher levels. This is where the meta game begins.

[b]High complexity:[/b]
LE’s set of rules is very complex. If you take a look at the character sheet you will see 4 tabs of stats (damage, defensive, minion and other stats) with 81 different stats (e.g. health on hit, slow chance, increased minion health generation or spell critical strike multiplier) on top of the general stats like health or fire protections.

There are 7 different damage types and additional defenses like chance to receive a glancing blow or block protection.

To get behind all these mechanics you have to spend a fair amount of time read the tooltips carefully and spend some time on the forums to read some guides and tips.

For me this is the most important argument to play the game. The very high complexity is what makes LE outstanding compared to all other games.

[b]Items / Crafting:[/b]
There are different rarities of items with up to 4 affixes per item that improve its stats. There is a crafting system where you can add affixes to items and / or upgrade them to a certain level.

There are unique items that have stats that change your playstyle or require a specific character alignment to fully develop their potential.

[b]Developers:[/b]
Eleventh Hour Games does an awesome job. The devs are very responsive. They discuss many aspects of the game with the community. They take criticism and suggestions very seriously and react to the player’s opinion.

There is a very good [url=https://forum.lastepochgame.com/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bcd43769917a08a0cdb7e9f530ab435ca08260d5.png] early access forecast [/url]. They adhere to their deadlines and release patches and updates very regularly. Admittedly EHG delayed the release of LE. But this was for a good reason and was well accepted in the community.

You can feel the spirit and that the devs work on this project with much blood, sweat and tears.

I have no doubt that LE will become a very good ARPG. It’s not mainstream. It is for those people that miss complexity in the Genre and want to dive into a game.

899770,Last Epoch,"Hello, 

credentials: 78hrs in Last Epoch, 3000+ hrs in PoE and other top down ARPG's.

My main comparison will be PoE as its the bench mark for the genre but by most means both games are not perfect.

Pros;
- Less Complex that PoE
- Fluid progression
- Easy to understand Game mechanics
- Easy to understand Endgame mapping system 
- Good Graphics
- Good immersion
- Good Music

Cons; 
This is a big one for me but if all you need is the then play the game but i will be doping it. 
- Meta Builds

Explanation: the game developers have selected a couple of abilities from each class that are viable for a beginner player then a several more skill viable once you have an established account e.g. have access to certain unique(s) that change a build from zero to hero. 

My experience is a Sentinel main class with Forge Guard Specialisation sub-class, using the ""Forge Strike"" as my main skill manual casting it.  I use Smite, Sigils of Hope, Ring of Shields, and a controversial shield bash which gets swapped out depending on the end game boss i'm fighting (for the guaranteed stun and block). 

However despite spending 13hrs with about 2hrs of intermediate break so about 11hrs and 39 attempts at killing a boss, the developers show to me that the game is better to play with the meta top 5 to 10 builds for beginners then if you want to play end game pick from the other meta builds once you have obtained the unique from your first build. 

This shows just like PoE despite having 1,000,000 build variants 5 to 10 are given love, then a had-full more. Don't get me wrong I understand the a very good game will require the illusion of diversity, but this game only offers surface level diversity. 

that why on one hand I would recommend the game if you have £30 to spend, but on the other hand you have PoE 2 and Diablo 4 just around the corner, which have promised to improve on these systems. 

thanks for taking the time to read.

(Review character limit !@#$)

This game is a top down looter/hack and slash ARPG, this review is aimed at those familiar with such games and there will be comparison with Path of Exile and Diablo, as both are THE genre, currently.

So I wont bother explaining basic stuff but rather introduce the plate briefly,
then dive into the ""meat and potatoes"" of the game.

My point of view is someone who has over 1k hours in PoE, 300 in the Diablo franchise, and about 50 into this one 
(Steam hours are misleading, as I have played the game on other accounts as well) Rookie numbers, some might say, and rightly so.

In that case, feel free to add words or provide counter argument to mine. I will also try to keep this review updated as the game continues to develop and grow.

[b]THE PLATE[/b]

First of all I would like to start by saying that the game is absolutely [b]worth[/b] its current price tag (30 euros) in its [b]current[/b] state: Early Access, version 8.1

The game has easily 50-100 hours of pure gameplay content, before any future ""seasons/leagues"" that have already been foreshadowed by the devs, and which will be set in time periods [b]between[/b] the already existing ""leagues"" of its main competitor, PoE.

I feel this is an important topic that needs to be adressed, as these types of games are usually played in ""bursts"" of content updates, alongside other players, in an ""asymmetrical"" competition/cooperation marathon.

There is also currently NO multiplayer but its been scheduled to be included within 2021. The only current form of social features are global/personal chat and friend list. There are also plans to include PvP, but frankly, these games are never balanced or designed around that, so its just an extra side feature.

[b]HARD COMPARISON WITH ESTABLISHED PATH OF EXILE SYSTEMS[/b]

This is the only part of my review where PoE will be mentioned directly.

This is by no means a ""PoE hate rant"", I just want to highlight that there is a very clear difference in systems and design philosophy, permeating through the entirety of the game. Obviously, at the time of writing, and most likely a while longer, this early access title is hardly near the content of one of the most notoriously complex games on the market that is approaching nearly a decade of constant updates.

First of all, you do not need to download a lootfilter or watch several video guides totaling hours to understand and enjoy the majority of the game as a new player. 

This game has learned from both the successes and missteps of the genre, as I feel all games must. It strikes a nice balance between the overwhelming complexity of PoE and the baffling simplicity (that is close to insulting intelligence) of Diablo 3.

Damage numbers! Seeing the constant rise of numbers you deal while progressing through the game is a nostalgic feeling I constantly miss during my PoE playtime.

In the case of lootfilters the game has an excellent and easy way to setup multiple personalized ones, IN GAME. If you really want, you can still download and import a ready one. 
In the case of understanding deep game mechanics, the game has an in game encyclopedia providing even detailed mathematical equations/formulas.

There is also a clear abhorrent of menus-within-menus and constant tedious micro management like constant use of vendor recipes or drag-dropping and switching mechanics like watchstones, scarabs, sextants. 

And designed to avoid clicking and wasting the players time as much as possible like constant re-rolls.

It also features a [b]deterministic crafting system[/b], frankly, the steam review limit is not enough for me to write about that alone.

So unlike Path of Exile, the overwhelming majority of gaming time is meant to be spend [b]ingame[/b], killing/looting stuff rather than constantly alt-tabbing to several browser pages, using external third party apps, crawling throughout tens of stash tabs and calculating percentages to create ""efficiency"".

Also, there are no real-money micro-transactions that provide quality of life stuff, like extra stash tabs or premium stuff that enable or simplify basic gaming concepts like guilds, trading and visual clarity.

And regarding quality of life

Oh 
my 
god

The game is packed with those

If you come from Path of Exile, your wrist will constantly thank you as you play this game.
No flask piano or constantly holding/casting certain abilities (the devs are clearly against that, in terms of design and communication with players)

No unidentified items, no portal scrolls. (portal is a hotkey and items are meant to be constantly upgraded, even during leveling)

Vacuuming ""currency/craft materials"" and autostashing such loot with the click of a button, even outside a stash menu.
As well as a sorting button, both in inventory and stashes.

Its hilarious that this counts as a feature in 2021... but there is even a training dummy and death recap screen!

[b]VISUALS & SOUND[/b]

The game frequently changes tone and setting due to its ""time traveling"" theme. This creates a nice  frequent change of pace.

One moment you are an ancient colorful valley filled with dinosaurs, the other you are in a medieval abandoned town or a post apocalyptic distant future cave complex as humanity has retreated from the surface, seeking refuge down below.

Usually those locations are in the exact same locations set in different time eras and often you can't help but stop and admire visuals and background ""noise"". 

Game speed and visual clarity is at a comfortable place where you can understand whats going on the screen at all times and thats the most important thing in such fast paced games.

The animations especially for the most recent class (Rogue) are very snappy and precise, enemies have good telegraphs and very dangerous moves have very clear areas of effect.

The voice acting and sound design is, in my opinion, the weakest part of the game.

Its not always the case in the entirety of the game but I feel often the voice acting aproaches ""porn quality"".

The music can also be improved vastly, boss themes are reused too much and tracks have small durations, resulting in a repeating, boring ambience.

[b]STRUCTURE & LAST THOUGHTS[/b]

5 classes to choose from, 3 sub-classes to each one.

The level cap is 100, at around 25-30 you choose the subclass, the current ""endgame"" starts at lvl 50-60.

I strongly suggest that you just dive in, you don't need any outside information or build guide for even your first character.

Respeccing is easy and rather cheap, and [b]the only permanent option currently is the master class.[/b]

The game is a joy to play in both Softcore and Hardcore (permadeath) mode.

It does a wonderful job with pacing and introducing mechanics.

It does not insult your intelligence by making you use 1 or 2 abilities for hours, within minutes you will have plenty of choices and most importantly, you will be able to easily switch out and try new stuff on the fly without any significant costs or requirements.

There are obviously passive and skill trees but the game rewards correct movement/positioning and cooldown/resource management more than min maxing and game knowledge.

Managing such aspects and creating synergies such as ""your dash now create shadow clones that mimic your abilities"" is the bread & butter of the game.

899770,Last Epoch,"Like the lovechild of Diablo and Path of Exile that has the best features of both, Last Epoch is everything I'm looking for in an Arpg.  From the diverse classes, to the unique boss attacks and patterns, to the robust filter--Last Epoch gets all the small details right. However, I have to say it's the intuitive crafting systems for both skills and items that's the real winner. I never liked crafting in other games because it was always buried beneath a byzantine system of checks and balances. Here, they handle crafting as a more WYSIWYG affair. You know what you're getting and, with the items, you know the success probability of it being crafted without a hitch. No more mixing recipes or putting runes in a certain order--do you want to add damage, or speed, or cheaper mana cost. Then by the effing gods that's what you need to find and that's what you craft onto your item. Period.

Once multiplayer is added and the story to completion is added, I literally think this has the foundation to blow 95% of the other Arpg's out of the water--including Grim Dawn and PoE. The barrier for entry is low, but the path to mastery is still long and exciting.

899770,Last Epoch,"So, approaching this as a POE player. There's a lot to like, for one, crafting. In the eternal words of Todd Howard, it just works. It's RNG, yes, but it's RNG in a way that flavors the player. Instead of getting something incredible or something useless, you get something good, or something great. They're adding onto this too, with legendary items becoming a take on the unique system that really shows that the devs are listening, and giving players ways to use build enabling items. 

The combat is weighty, with lots of follow-through and some degree of intentional clunk. This is not path of exile with tailwind and reduced action speed, and it definitely takes some getting used to. But, its fun, and fast. Build variety is immense. The game may not have the enormous skill trees of POE but by focusing on not being a one button game, it enables a lot of variety, and the crafting system means if you want to try something, you can easily make the gear to enable it. Plus, respeccing a character is very easy, meaning changing builds is a cakewalk. 

Endgame wise, it is lacking. The developers are continuely putting effort into this, adding new dungeons and the like, opting for a different system than just reskinned rifts or maps from POE, but with a monolith of fate system that serves that goal as well, albeit one that is outdated at this point, although the devs have spoken on their intentions to update that somewhere down the line. 

The devs get criticism for being slow, especially with regards to multiplayer, which has been coming soon for over a year now, but they're taking their time to get it right. They're open and transparent about it, and if multiplayer is make or break for you, when it comes out, it will be in a working fun state. 

All in all, right now this is a fun replayable game with a lot of variety, and most importantly, good bones that has potential to be the next genre defining arpg.

899770,Last Epoch,"Last Epoch has the pacing and difficulty of Diablo 2, with learnings from newer games in the genre such as Path of Exile, Diablo 3, Grim Dawn, etc. Their philosophy steers clear of many of the shortcomings of games like Diablo 3 (gear sets bring the primary focus, 500% damage increases dominating everything, 1 build to rule them all, etc.), and emphasizes build diversity and experimentation without overly harsh penalties for trying something new.

Skill trees and power creep issues currently dominate the 'meta builds' for many classes, but they are making adjustments as patches come through. That doesn't mean it's impossible to play your own unique build, just that there is probably a much easier version of your class that you could play instead. Still, the community continues to experiment and try out interesting new combinations on a regular basis. I'm hopeful that the new subclasses and 'old' class reworks will allow for rebalancing to effectively smooth out the power curve.

End-game needs a massive rework, and is mostly what I would consider 'legacy' at this point. The developers have continued to add new forms of content to the end-game, but have not had the chance to tweak the 'old grind' to match. This leads to your first many hours after the campaign being a slog through slow paced and easily cleared content. Once you clear that though, there are more challenging pieces of content ahead. Randomized modifiers need adjustment, but the overall feel is positive.

Many people continue to wait for the multiplayer patch which has been slated to come out this year. If you're someone who likes to play ARPGs with your friends I would recommend waiting for that patch to come. If you're someone who is willing to learn and play around until multiplayer comes out, there's tons of content and fun experimentation to be had.

Overall, I would rate Last Epoch one of the best modern ARPGs on the market with the potential to be the best once the balance/rework patches and end-game progression tweaks come.

899770,Last Epoch,"I recommend the game to any ARPG fan, but it's a ""mild"" recommendation for now. The game has a lot in it, and definitely worth playing, but as I reached the endgame, some things started to bother me more and more. Below, I'll talk about three biggest issues I have with the game, but please keep in mind, as an Early Access game, things might change; I hope they'll change. 

[h1]Map Variety[/h1]
Last Epoch has no procedural map generation. In the endgame, the ""Monolith""s you choose will often feature the same subset of maps, along with same subset of enemy archetypes. You'll face similar enemies on the same maps over and over in other words. Sometimes, you get to play on the same map that you've just finished. 

In my opinion, in ARPGs, a map is a canvas, and having a different canvas' each time keeps things fresh by putting you under an illusion that keeps your mind away from the idea of you doing a repetitive task over and over. This is certainly not the case in this game. 

A proper procedural map generation is urgently needed in short. Without it, I get burnt out rather fast, and it could be the same case for you as well. Other aspects of the game has been keeping me from feeling the burnout so far, but I'm afraid I'll buckle before reaching 100+ hours just because of this reason alone. I've started making other characters to keep myself interested further.

[h1]Endgame: Monoliths, Echoes[/h1]
I like the base endgame, you select a monolith (storyline) that is available to you, and essentially design your own maps as you progress through echoes (maps). After each echo, you are given two options to pick from, which adds a modifier to the enemies, and may last a few echoes, stacking the difficulty up. I really like it. However...

At the end of the monoliths, you get to choose one blessing among three, and these blessings are drawn from their own pool, and has a power rating attached to them. They could be simple drop rate boosts, to a vital stat improvements that'll enhance your build. You need to complete 3 quest echoes, and while the first few monoliths are easy, the later ones require you to maybe go through 30 echoes in order to finish a monolith, or even more as encountering a quest echo is chance based.

The problem with this is, if you were after these blessings, you only get a chance after a long patience, and are at the mercy of the RNGesus to get a blessing you want with a good roll. If we could improve our blessings somehow; like incrementally raising their power roll for each completion, it wouldn't be a big issue for me as the long wait would yield something rewarding. But right now, the reward for completing a monolith could be extremely unsatisfying.

I hear you asking; is the game about loot, or is it about blessings? Well, blessings are part loot in essence, but let me stop being a smartass for a second. It is of course about the loot, further enhancing your character at the core. And the next part is dedicated to the itemization & crafting, specificly in the endgame.

[h1]Itemization & Crafting[/h1]
At first, the game might look like the complete opposite of the PoE, especially crafting. You use affix shards to add up to four affixes you want to an item, or improve their tiers up to tier five. You have support runes and glyphs that you can use to do different stuff, like removing an affix, randomizing affix values on an item within their tiers, and so on. However, with each crafting done on an item, you add instability to it, and higher instability may cause a fracture during crafting, at which point, the item cannot be worked further on.

When you get to the endgame, you realize that there is another rarity for items: ""Exalted"". The affix tiers go up to T7, but you can only craft up to T5. Exalted items are rare items that feature these higher tier affixes on them, and you can only get them as drops. This makes crafting more of a supplement; before this tier; it's a pre-determined risk & reward to progress your character further to the max, but with this tier, getting to the max is entirely at the mercy of RNGesus.

Some affixes are extremely hard to come by. From my experience, the class-specific affixes found on class relic items are extremely rare, for example. If you fracture (damage) an item while trying to add these, or shatter (salvage) an item in order to try and get your affix shards back and get nothing, it's extremely annoying. 

To put my experience in crafting for this game in PoE terms, you have ""orbs of annulment"" in the form of a rune, but the affix removed is one at random. Then you have ""exalted orbs"" in the form of affix shards, but the added affix is pre-determined, and the same affix shards can be used till you reach tier 5. Then you have ""divine orbs"" in the form of another rune that randomize the values within their tiers. However, every craft action will add some sort of instability, and the higher instability the item has, the higher chance a fracture may occur. Fracture is similar to ""corrupt""; cannot work on the item any further, and you may lose some affix tiers in the process if it is anything but a minor fracture.

Lets say you want to craft a good item. Due to the added instability, trying to craft an all affixes @T5 item from the ground up from a white item is highly improbable; the higher quality items, will have much less instability on them for the affix tiers they've got, and you'll have a better chance to craft the item through those. If you want a specific T6/T7 affix, you'll definitely need it drop anyway. So you seek an item with the affixes you can work with as a base, and try to add the affixes you want, remove the ones you don't want, or improve existing ones up to T5. 

If you are unlucky, a fracture occurs. You can use glyphs (crafting supplements) to have a chance to reduce the added instability, or mitigate the damage of the fractures. A minor fracture locks the items, major / destructive fractures lower the tier of some affixes in addition to locking them. 

During crafting, if the affix you want gets removed, or de-leveled, or if the item gets fractured before you are done with the affix you really want, the item is essentially bricked. And I've bricked way too many items without any wins in between as RNGesus told me to fuck off even with a 1% fracture chance. Yeah, I'm mad...

I really hope that the devs will add very rare crafting supplements that'll protect your item when you are working on it, or something like a very rare ""magic glue"" to put the fractured item back together, because finding a good base is a big hassle, and when you do find one, seeing it fracture is extremely annoying, especially if the fracture occured on a very low percentage, and/or on the last step of the crafting.

In short, crafting is still as dependant on RNGesus as any other ARPG out there, and you [i]will[/i] brick good items. There is a risk involved in crafting, and you'll experience extremely unsatisfying results, and reliefs here and there after a successful craft. Just because I have some negative views on the matter due to my bad luck (streak) doesn't mean you'll definitely have a similar experience.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I've listed (cried about) the points that I don't like very much about the game but could be improved. If some of the things I mentioned bother you, you might want to think twice; I want to highly recommend the game, but these things make it a ""mild"" recommendation for me. 

The developers seem to be listening to feedback, and not entirely disconnected from their playerbase or from their game like some other devs (*cough*PoE*cough*) are. As a game still in Early Access, nothing is set in stone. 

If you are in-love with ARPG as a genre, get it. It'll keep you busy for at least 20-30 hours even if you are not that into ARPG as a genre, in my opinion. A solid entry to the genre, I hope it won't get bloated over time.

899770,Last Epoch,"Normally I wouldn't recommend an Early Access game, but this one is far cheaper than the quality would warrant, and thus, worthy of an exception. Last Epoch already offers solid ARPG gameplay with lots of great core systems. 

The crafting and endgame systems in particular are incredible. It's a breath of fresh air after having dealt with Path of Exile's increasingly grindy and bloated nonsense over the years. I love that rare items only have 2 suffixes and 2 prefixes, which limits the top end power of rare items. Last Epoch allows you to craft in a semi-deterministic manner without the risk of completely breaking your item. You can pretty much guarantee that you get the mods you want on your items, but getting the highest tiers of those mods is subject to randomness with diminishing returns.

The endgame lets you quickly jump into somewhat short maps with a single objective, while building a web of modifiers on them that increase difficulty and reward for the next few maps, and simultaneously fill up a stability bar that lets you engage a boss and move on to the next tier of endgame maps. Much like the crafting, the system is relatively simple, but powerful and satisfying. The difficulty starts out fairly easy, but can scale all the way up to level 100(the character max level) and beyond, so there is content to challenge even the strongest character builds.

In terms of complexity Last Epoch hits the sweet spot between Diablo 3 and Path of Exile. There is great depth to the builds and skill customization, but it's reasonably streamlined, so you can go in blind and experiment on your own. You don't have to spend thousands of hours doing tedious research to create a functional character and get to the endgame. The gameplay is slower and more controlled than Path of Exile, without feeling sluggish. You can actually see what the monsters and bosses are doing, and move out of the way of dangerous attacks. It is fair, and challenging, and you will probably die a few times while learning certain encounters, but you can always just try again without having to arbitrarily farm some randomly dropped item to access the boss again.

Last Epoch has some incredible quality of life features that puts other games in the genre to shame. The in-game loot filter editor is both powerful and intuitive, so you can decide which items you want shown for each individual character. Skill and passive respeccs are very accessible so you can experiment with different builds. Almost any question you could have about game mechanics can be looked up in-game through a nice game guide menu. The tooltips of skills will tell you which item stats you can use to scale their power. There is a target dummy in town so you can test your build's damage numbers.

Last Epoch is still in a fairly early stage of development, but it has already come a long way, and at this rate it is on pace to become a true competitor and rival to both Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2.

899770,Last Epoch,"There have been recent review bombs because of multiplayer ""launch"" issues. Basically, the developers spent a long time working on making their single-player game multiplayer, and launch got hammered by 3-4x their expected player numbers, so the servers had massive issues. I personally don't think people should review games based on server issues that are in the process of being fixed in a game that's still in beta, but I digress. 

At the time of writing this I have 30 some odd hours on steam, but maybe 100-200 with their standalone launcher throughout the past few years. I've watched this game grow from the most barebones, amateur looking RPG, to a super polished, promising soon-to-be competitor to the loot-based ARPG behemoths (PoE, d4). 

Last Epoch is an uncut gem. I've watched the passionate developers work based on community feedback and vision for years now. I cannot wait to see where this game is in a year or two at this trajectory, because the 0.9 multiplayer launch has already far exceeded my expectations. I don't think it's in a position to compete with PoE and D4 at the moment, but as it grows and gets better and better it definitely will. This is a developer team to watch closely, and It would be dumb for GGG and Blizzard to not take a look at how they've taken outdated systems from other ARPGs and made them a lot better. 

This game as is pre-launch is already a 7/10. As they flesh out end game, add their 3 launch classes, and stick to their philosophy on game design and working with the community to make a good game, I can easily foresee it being a 9/10, and I expect that it will end up sharing the top few spots in viewer numbers with PoE in the ARPG genre.",recent bomb multiplayer launch issue basically developer spent long working single multiplayer launch hammered 3 4x expected number server massive issue personally game based issue process fixed beta digress writing 30 odd hour maybe 100 200 standalone launcher throughout past year watched grow barebones amateur super polished promising soon competitor loot based arpg behemoth poe d4 last epoch uncut gem watched passionate developer based community feedback vision year wait trajectory 0 9 multiplayer launch already far exceeded expectation position compete poe d4 moment grows get definitely developer watch closely dumb ggg blizzard look taken outdated system arpgs pre launch already 7 10 flesh add 3 launch class stick philosophy design working community good easily foresee 9 10 expect sharing top spot viewer number poe arpg genre,0,0.9371
899770,Last Epoch,"BETA RELEASE REVIEW

It's a fun ARPG, in the genre of Diablo mixed with a part of Grim Dawn and a part of Path of Exile.  Currently there are 4 classes, with the Rogue class still in it's initial phase of development without a timeframe for release yet.  You still have the opportunity to play as Acolyte, Primalist, Mage, and Sentinel.  These are the typical base classes you find in these games, with each one having three Mastery choices.

Many of the builds currently stress damage mitigation and health, with most of the character builds being fleshed out to their highest efficiency way before you reach cap level.  So basically, between level 50-75 you'll most likely have your skills maxed and already have either bis gear or near it.  That leaves little incentive to continue on to cap level 100 for an occasional passive point to reward your effort.  There isn't an endgame currently either, making it even less desirable to continue on with the character.  You'll probably get more enjoyment by starting a new character with a new build you want to try out.  Hoping to see this being fixed way before full release.

For the storyline and quests, it's quite intriguing I have to say.  Not to give too much of it away, but you'll be sort of a time traveler, opening portals to different eras (or epochs as in the game title) from the infancy of humanity to the year 2281, The Ruined Era or Last Epoch.  This is where your story begins.

I have had a few bugs so far while playing, nothing too serious, but it could of been.  When breaking tables and furniture with your weapons there's chance that money or even gear will drop.  On a few occasions I've had my drops either floating in the air or outside the play area without any way for me to recover them.  Luckily the weapons and armor were not Unique or Set items, and the amount of gold was negligible.

Another issue that has happened twice so far, when entering an area or trying to speak to a npc, the game suddenly would just freeze as the camera view changed.  I was left with no other choice but to alt tab out and do a manual exit of the game.  Nothing too serious so far, and it is still in beta after all.

I still only scratched the surface of the game to date, but plan to continue on playing throughout the beta phase and hopefully see a completed released version of the game in the near future.  It's definitely worth buying into if you're a fan of the ARPG genre, and I do have a good feeling about this one.

I've played: 
22 years of D2,
2000+ hours of PoE,
1000+ hours of Grim Dawn,
300+ hours in Wolcen and more.

This is easily the best title in the genre.
I'm 25h into the game so far, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. Unlike similar games, going through the beginning stages of the game does not feel like a grind. Leveling and developing a build feels exciting and is part of the experience, rather than something to get through.

The crafting system is gold. It doesn't rely on pure luck like PoE, so you're not going to spend tons of materials on crafting something just to end up with nothing useful and no materials.
There is some luck involved, but often times you can choose what stats you'll be adding to an item. It's simple enough to get into as a Newby, but complex enough to be engaging and exciting as you become more experienced.

The skills are awesome.
I went full lightning mage.
I feel like a thunder god!
Every skill has a skill tree and can be changed and augmented in a ton of different ways. I also like that the game encourages you to use more than 1 ability as a primary ability, without nerfing the usability of any of the skills. My current set up has a lightning nova skill for AoEing big packs, chain lightning as a single target DPS skill - chaining multiple times on a single target and adding a ton of shock stacks, a teleport skill that triggers lightning nova, a static charge skill that passively triggers Chain lightnings, and fireward which gives me ward (think temporary energy shield), plus a myriad of damage and defensive buffs for several seconds.

899770,Last Epoch,"If you've played other ARPG's, such as Diablo 2, or Diablo 3, or Path of Exile, and already know you enjoy that style of game, I am confident that you will enjoy this game. 

When I think about how to compare ARPG's, there are three elements that I consider. First is the difficulty/complexity of the game, the second is how open-ended the classes/characters are, and the third is how engaging the crafting/gearing system is.

Each element of this list can be represented as a spectrum. The first spectrum is about complexity/difficulty. I would put PoE and D2 at the high complexity/difficulty end of the spectrum, and Diablo 3 and Minecraft Dungeons at the other end. Last Epoch is on the complex end of the spectrum, but much closer to the middle than PoE.

The second spectrum is regarding how much guidance/limitations you have on your character. Path of Exile would be right at the end of the spectrum correlating to no guidance and no limitations. At the other end would be Minecraft Dungeons, with tonnes of guidance and a lot of limitations. Diablo 3 is close to that end of the spectrum too. Last Epoch again falls close to the center of this spectrum. It has guidance, and limitations to your character, but there are many more options for each character you play as opposed to D3 where your power seems completely tied to a small number of Sets, and the decisions you make as far as what abilities you use and what sort of damage you deal are all made for you. Last Epoch feels like you CAN play anything, although some things are probably more optimal than others. It also gives that great feeling of finding a unique item, and think to yourself, damn, this would be super strong with X class/ability, now I want to make a character  to use it.

This is leading into the third spectrum about how engaging the gearing/crafting system is. Again, the simple and unengaging end of the spectrum is seen in games like Minecraft Dungeons, and Diablo 3. The opposite end would represent very engaging and very complex gearing/crafting, and as usual Path of Exile holds the title there. The trend for Last Epoch continues, and it places somewhere between the center of the spectrum and PoE. It's a much more linear crafting system than PoE, but it's still a relevant crafting system that feels rewarding to interact with. It allows you to do all the things you need to do to items, and I'm sure that it will be developed further as the game grows.

Another notable feature in Last Epoch is that it has some wonderful quality of life features that other games (Path of Exile mostly) are lacking. Inventory sorting with a button, separate storage for crafting supplies, auto pick up gold, one click pick up all nearby crafting shards, loot filter in the game itself with awesome customization, and probably some more stuff that I can't think of at the moment.

TL;DR BELOW -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a great investment of a game if you know that you enjoy ARPG's already. It has more complexity than Diablo III, but it's quite a bit easier to grasp than Path of Exile. It has more guidance for your classes, giving you spells that correlate to your class, but you can specialize and change how the class feels way more than you can in Diablo III.

899770,Last Epoch,"*Editing review on 25.12.2021 after playing some hours on new patch*

Alright i think after over 100 hours its time to put down my review on this game :) First disclaimer, i am Path of Exile veteran (multiple thousands of hour sank into that game - something like 10k at this point, playing since beta pretty much) so since i have most experience in a genre with PoE there will be lot of comparisons. 

So i purchased this game almost year ago, i believe it was 2 big patches ago (third is coming in 2 weeks with some amazing new content :)). I am gonna talk about good things first: 

- Combat and visual clarity. Combat feels pretty fluid most of the time, what makes me happy the most unlike in PoE you actually have very good visual clarity, when you die you always know what did you die to and why (most of the time it is because you fucked up). Bosses are very well designed and all have unique mechanics that are well telegraphed and are easy to get used to. Amazing thing that was added in last big update is Shade of Orobyss which is endgame encounter that have different combination of skills from huge pool of possible combinations every time you meet it. It is pretty exciting and fun and increases repeatability of that boss encounter. 

- Graphics and performance. Graphic is pretty good, game looks visually nice. Its not as good as some other games in genre, but its good enough and skills and skill effects feel really satisfying on all builds i have played so far :) Performance is solid, i have decent enough rig and game was running pretty smooth almost all the time. Exception to that are moments, where i am really deep into monolith with some really tanky mods on monsters which are making them clutter into huge groups, seems like game engine cant handle that too well. 

- Crafting system and chase items. With last big patch we got slight rework of crafting system and whole new tier of items added (legendary items). New crafting system feels way better, adds more deterministic options for high tier crafting, while keeping that right amount of rng that makes it ""risky"". Legendary items are whole new level of chase items and they are awesome. You basically get your unique item and slap more affixes onto it, which makes some extremely rare drops extremely exciting. Great idea and job well done, eventho powerlevel of some extremely rare things is beyond ridiculous :) 

- Endgame systems: So far game has 3 endgame systems (that is definitly subject to change in future) that is arena, monolith and recently added dungeons. Arena and monolith are both  endlessly scaling systems (which is great for players such as myself who like to push their characters and see how far they ll go) and both are pretty fun to interact with (i prefer monoliths and pushing corruption more atm). Latest addition is dungeon which adds some new mechanics and options for future development that are really exciting and has probably toughest endgame encounter in highest tier of the dung. Pretty well executed and they promised adding more dungs over time, so i am really excited for future :) 

- Great devs and community. Devs of this game show real promise. I am on their discord and they do dev stream weekly, where one of their team plays a game and talks to viewers, answers their questions about everything game related which is really great. They have active members on a team that react to the stuff on the discord aswell. Community itself is very helpful and non-toxic enviroment. So far i havent seen any elitism or toxicity on discord, nor in game global chat. As it usually is with these small indies studios in begining, devs are really in touch with their community so far and hopefully that wont change for a long time :)

Cons:

Okay, its really hard to evaluate cons of this game, because so far all of the things that i am ""missing"" (namely trading, MP) in this game will be added eventually as it is still early access game. When i will think of something i will put it up here :)

- Seems like game engine is having similar problem to PoE, when you have too many mobs on screen it begins drop fps pretty rapidly. My rig is pretty good and even handles PoE on solid fps, this game runs smoothly for 99% of the time, but when i am pushing really deep corruption on my top chars i get to the instances, where mobs are insanely tanky and i cant clear them fast enough, so they start to stack up on the screen to the point i loose big chunk of my fps. 

Verdict:

Game is great, if you like games like diablo/path of exile/grim daw, just buy it, even in its early access state its already serious competitor to those giants and from what we have seen it is only gonna get exponentially better.",editing 25 12 2021 hour new patch alright 100 hour disclaimer path exile veteran multiple thousand sank 10k beta pretty genre poe comparison purchased ago believe 2 big patch ago third coming 2 week amazing new content gon na talk good thing combat visual clarity combat feel pretty fluid make happy unlike poe good visual clarity die die fucked boss designed unique mechanic telegraphed easy amazing last big shade orobyss endgame encounter different combination skill huge pool possible combination meet pretty exciting fun increase repeatability bos encounter graphic performance graphic pretty good look visually nice good game genre good skill skill effect satisfying build far performance solid decent rig running pretty smooth exception moment deep monolith tanky mod monster clutter huge group engine cant handle crafting chase item last big patch slight rework crafting new tier item legendary item new crafting feel add deterministic option high tier crafting keeping rng make risky legendary item new chase item awesome basically unique slap affix onto make extremely rare drop extremely exciting great idea eventho powerlevel extremely rare thing ridiculous endgame system far 3 endgame system definitly subject future arena monolith recently dungeon arena monolith endlessly scaling system great player push character far pretty fun interact prefer monolith pushing corruption atm latest addition dungeon add new mechanic option future development exciting probably toughest endgame encounter highest tier dung pretty executed promised adding dung excited future great community real promise discord stream weekly play talk viewer answer question related great active member react stuff discord aswell community helpful non toxic enviroment far havent elitism toxicity discord global chat usually small indie studio begining touch community far hopefully wont long con okay hard evaluate con far thing missing namely trading mp eventually early access engine similar problem poe mob screen begin drop fps pretty rapidly rig pretty good handle poe solid fps run smoothly 99 pushing deep corruption top char instance mob insanely tanky cant clear fast stack screen loose big chunk fps verdict great game diablo path exile grim daw early access state already serious competitor giant gon na exponentially,0,0.9983
899770,Last Epoch,"From a Path of Exile perspective, this looks like a simpler but more polished version of it.

- The crafting is simpler, but way more accessible and easy to get into it.
- The skill system is simpler, but way easier to understand and create your own build.
- There is a item filter builder in game, which is also easy to understand and create your own (no need to rely on external tools)
- There is a dictionary/guide in game, that you can easily search for terms that you still don't understand.
- The visuals/graphics are awesome.
- Bosses have well telegraphed moves that rewards players that engage with its mechanics, instead of just building to burst the boss from full to zero in two seconds.
- Slow gameplay, ""rare"" monsters have unique moves and defensive layers that are easy to understand.

(e.g. you find a magic bow with 2 prefixes, t3 phys dmg and t3 increased bow dmg, you could easily get those to t5(max craftable) and be set with a really nice phys bow until you find a new base)
 - performance, I can't stress this enough coming from PoE. No longer do I have fps loss while interacting with certain mechanics (looking at you delirium and legion) and most importantly, I haven't encountered a single crash.
 - boss fights, this game has reminded me of soul games, all boss attacks are telegraphed and most importantly you actually know what killed you, what dmg type and what kind of mistake you have made.
 - loot filter, easy to understand and tweak for your needs. helps that all items drop identified.
 - looting, damn have I been spoiled, picking up all the little crafting materials in a click, vacuuming the gold that drops. This is MASSIVE pro compared to PoE. I have missed the vacuum type looting for little things since Diablo.

Cons:
 - no multiplayer, this is quite a bummer. Might be a deal breaker for you.
 - global chat is very bad, just like PoE. Be cautious and turn it off right away.
 - lacks endgame, you're stuck doing echoes until the end of times (kinda the point of the game) but it gets boring real fast. Your entire endgame is -> open echo -> kill boss/wave type activity -> repeat. Don't get me wrong, they can improve a lot here but it still is lacking a lot.
 - endgame mob density, this is something that can be tweaked right now, theres little to no monsters that you fight, sometimes you see like 20 in a pack sometimes 5, very inconsistent.

Overall this game is worth it, cons are eventually going to improve. The game is currently going under its Beta phase so we will get there. If you like ARPG games, this game is worth a shot, especially if you're tired of PoE.

Small note: if this game gets enough support and becomes a real competitor to PoE, both games will eventually improve at a faster pace!

899770,Last Epoch,"First things first, i love ARPG's, played Diablo 1,2,3,4 Grim dawn, Torchlight 1,2,3 over 1000 hours in POE. 

TLDR :: Last Epoch is as fun as the best ARPGs I have played. which are D2, POE, and T2. 

Only thing that i find extremely detrimental. online requirement. They have offline characters so this helps a lot. but if you dont have online access for some reason to log in, you cant play at all. THIS i would ask gets changed asap. make offline... truly offline. 

The game itself feels fun, I feel rewarded for playing. I feel rewarded for exploration. I feel suprised and find enjoyment while i go from zone to zone. Quests have rewards that are actually meaningful. (for the most part) Side quests give you actual points and item slots. 

I am admittedly early game, have not reached end game, have not completed a build and have not seen what the game has to offer in full but i am still having fun. I play minion builds most of the time and the game 100% hits on that fantasy. The Necromancer is the class i have played so far and i have built a full minion build that feels powerful yet not over powering. They get what makes minion builds powerful and what weaknesses they need to have. 

Loot
The loot is good. I admit i am still figuring it out but it seems simple enough to understand. I find that unfortunately i dont see many worth picking up as i go though. I see the potential but over all this is one area i feel it can suffer. Item bases are extremely interesting and i find them the most interesting out of most ARGS. They feel purpose built and finding new ones feels rewarding and you are semi excited for finding new ones. This game has loot that actually benefits minion builds VERY well. I feel the unique items are one of the strongest in the genre. As an example i found one that had 4 great affixes that was better than what i had. Also something with Weaver charges... No idea what that did. As i found out though as i killed mobs it would randomly add a new Affix and or buff one it already added. I dont recall an item that ""grew with me"" it made me excited to have it on and very excited to find another one at some point. No idea what the end game looks like but so far so good.

Crafting. 
Crafting is maybe the best ive seen so far in any ARPG. It has the ""crafting item currancy"" like POE has, but instead of the ENTIRE F$#$ing system being random (like POE) LE's crafting is a lot more targeted. you can adjust, empower, add, remove, and much more all specifically targeting what you need on an item. I feel this is the strength of the itemization of LE. Each item can only be upgraded so much so you are encouraged to find new ones, and the amount each item can be crafted seems to be random as well. Can find God tier loot with great crafting potential. Legendary's set and more all appear to have something to do with this i just havent gotten so far. It has A TON OF END GAME POTENTIAL. We shall see when i get there.

Character 
There are classes to chose from, each class has its own play style and skill selection. So no POE freedom of choice here. That said i dont feel this is bad persay. You know what you like to play it is not likely you will want to throw a fireball when summoning a skeleton. Stats are not... obvious though. For example Int does NOT give mana like you might think upon first glance. Attainment does? Odd choice honestly. Each character has 3 subclasses, you can chose one to master granting you a special ability. You can still chose from the first half of each tree in the non mastered subclasses though ( think) So far so good, lots of selections and enough freedom with out it being overwhelming. Skills are given based on points in each class/subclass. No attribute points from leveling though... just from gear i think. Characters are solid but not strong in my opinion. I personally would like to see a little more choice in the skill options in each tree. 

Skills
Skills are one of the most limiting areas. Each character has a handful of skills to chose from. 20 for Necromancer (as of now). You can only have 5 active. Abilities must be actively chosen to remain active. Aka cant summon something then switch it out. This is the down side. The upside is I havent found this an issue. Each skill can be switched out easily and quickly. Find out what you wanna use and no worries if you dont like it. You can just switch it out. The skills are learned by adding points into the character so you are not limiting your skill selection in this way. That said you get 5 skill specializations slots. This is where the LE skills SHINE in my opinion. You like summon skeleton? add it to your skill specialization and customize it even further by leveling it up. each level allows you to slot into its own skill small skill tree. This changing the function of the skill entirely or buffing aspects you like. 

Graphics and art design.
its a cut above many. The way the story is told allows for some REALLY fun environments and good environmental story telling.  i would say its not D4 levels of sophisticated but its damn close in my view. 

Story
So far its basic enough to follow and still go kill a bunch of stuff. however the story allows for some really neat mechanics. It also allows them to EASILY add more areas and expand upon the game later on. voice acting is good. 

 For now i will gladly continue playing this.  dont know how many may read this, but if you like ARPGS this is easily one of the best ones out in 2023.",thing love arpg diablo 1 2 3 4 grim dawn torchlight 1 2 3 1000 hour poe last epoch fun best arpgs d2 poe t2 extremely detrimental online requirement offline character help dont online access log cant ask get changed asap offline truly offline feel fun rewarded rewarded exploration suprised enjoyment zone zone quest reward meaningful side quest actual point slot admittedly early reached completed build offer fun minion build 100 hit fantasy necromancer class far built minion build feel powerful powering make minion build powerful weakness loot loot good admit figuring simple understand unfortunately dont worth picking potential suffer base extremely interesting interesting args purpose built finding new one feel rewarding semi excited finding new one loot benefit minion build unique item strongest genre example found 4 great affix weaver charge idea found killed mob randomly add new affix buff already dont recall grew excited excited idea look far good crafting crafting maybe best ive far arpg crafting currancy poe entire f ing random poe le crafting targeted adjust empower add remove specifically targeting strength itemization le upgraded encouraged new one crafted random god tier loot great crafting potential legendary set appear havent gotten far ton potential shall class chose class style skill selection poe freedom choice dont bad persay throw fireball summoning skeleton stats obvious example int mana glance attainment odd choice honestly 3 subclass chose master granting special chose half tree non mastered subclass far good lot selection freedom overwhelming skill given based point class subclass attribute point leveling gear character solid strong opinion personally choice skill option tree skill skill limiting area handful skill chose 20 necromancer 5 active ability actively chosen remain active aka cant summon switch side upside havent found issue skill switched easily quickly wan na worry dont switch skill learned adding point limiting skill selection 5 skill specialization slot le skill shine opinion summon skeleton add skill specialization customize leveling allows slot skill small skill tree changing function skill entirely buffing aspect graphic art design cut told allows fun environment good environmental telling d4 level sophisticated damn close view far basic follow kill bunch stuff allows neat mechanic allows easily add area expand voice acting good gladly continue dont read arpgs easily best one 2023,0,0.999

899770,Last Epoch,"I have played 30 hours (not counting AFK time, maybe 23-25 hours) I will edit my review over time. 

I am a Kickstarter backer, but I decided to give it some time to get fleshed out before I tried really playing it. 
I check in on the progress from time to time, but only sat down to play this past week.
It is a good game it seems, and it has potential; so, I will give it a thumbs up... for now...

The skill system is great, I like the diversity in each class to have 3 master classes PLUS you can still use a bit of each mastery class as long as you stay under the vertical 50% mark of each mastery, AND you have a lot of choices to flesh out some truly unique builds. 
The skills are numerous, and are complimented by the mastery system very well. Each skill has it's own passive tree and that blows my mind, Even more diverse than I had thought!

My biggest complaint is... it seems dull and drawn out. 
Currently I have not reached the end game, a lot of people say it really picks up the pace there, but what about the leveling / storyline part? that is sorely needing some *oomph*!  
In the beginning, I explored EVERYWHERE... but later I found myself running to quest markers just to get stuff done. and see if something exciting would occur... but not even the boss fights intrigued me, and it all just seemed so easy.. except for an occasional monster that had some odd combination of affixes to make it difficult. I wish I could describe my view on this lackluster gameplay better than this, but I just cannot pinpoint it exactly.
I hope the devs do something to breathe life into the gameplay in the early parts of the game... because I just closed the game due to lack of interest.
I know I will get flamed for this statement, but Wolcen was a game that kept me interested..yes it was busted, but I still enjoyed playing.. and the story kept me wanting for more.

899770,Last Epoch,"This game is easily shaping up to the one of the better ARPG's in recent times, especially if you are into the Single Player experience. Lots of classes, build options, item interactions and an engaging crafting system with a fairly balanced loot system.

You might notice this month (December), Last Epoch has gotten review bombed. This is boiling down to a few things.

[b]1.[/b] There has been a year-long update stall whilst the development team has been investigating MP. Contrary to what seems to be uneducated and popular belief, the game is [i]not[/i] abandoned. The dev team is active on their subreddit if you want more engagement. The reason this took so long is also related to the team not wanting to have a disaster MP launch like Wolcen and some other titles. What ever happened to the sentiment of [i]""Do it right, do it once""[/i]?

[b]Offline Singleplayer will still be available for those that want it.[/b]

[b]2.[/b] There is controversy over the team's stance on item trading between players. Essentially, they have come to the conclusion that attempting to balance a proper player economy is going to be difficult. Drop rates would have to be adjusted (see: nerfed), and you would end up in the PoE-like situation where people just go and buy all their gear rather than grind/farm. With a restricted system they can keep drop-tables as they currently are, knowing players will actually be playing the game to get loot. Better drop-rates and player satisfaction as a result is surely a good thing, but what do I know?

Either way, whether you want MP or not, once that releases in March then the other updates (remaining classes, items, zones, etc) can start coming through proper.

899770,Last Epoch,"I'm having fun, and looking forward to MP so I can play with the husband.  

As others have said, it's not overly complicated to build a build, which is magnificent news to me.  I loathe building builds, and want to spend my time playing rather than min maxing.  Could I have a better build?  Likely.  Does it matter all That much? Not really.  I'm able to progress while keeping my head attached, with the occasional zerg death because I'm impetuous sometimes.  Especially when it's getting late and I need sleep, but I don't want to because I just want to finish this One thing before going to bed . . . y'all are gamers.  You understand.

The only real beef I have is the zone resetting when I need to go sell.  I cleared it, it should remain clear until x amount of time passes, or I log out.  There should be an option to reset a zone, if someone truly wants to repeat the process.  I do not.  I have limited time to play anything these days (woe) and thus I want do overs like I want a hole in the head (I don't care for one, thank you).

PoE is fun as well, but I find myself simply using others' builds because I get overwhelmed with the choices.  For those who enjoy tinkering with builds I'm sure this is a blast.  For me it is not.

A surprisingly fresh experience and currently my favourite ARPG on the market! A perfect blend between Path of Exile, Grim Dawn and Diablo 3.

[h1]
A CHECKLIST
[/h1]

✔️ Playable on GeForceNOW. Thank you developers!
✔️ I like the aesthetics! Not as dark as Path, not comparable to Wolcen, but still great!
✔️ Spot on soundtrack and ambient sounds. A fresh mix between Diablo and Gray Dawn.
✔️ It has an acceptable story, which actually makes sense and starts to grow on you as you go.
✔️ Character skill customization is very well done! Similar to Grim Dawn, it offers a lot of flexibility and is not too complex.
✔️ A friendly, helpful and mature community.
✔️ A simple to understand stats/gear system, that offers non-obvious and creative ways to build your character.
✔️ Great inventory UI and management system!
✔️ Simple, yet fun crafting system.
✔️ You'll notice while playing that they've taken many flavorful game design decisions.
✔️ Devs are very responsive, take criticism and suggestions seriously and react to player's opinions (even in-game)!
❌ Not yet finished, but the developers are pushing updates regularly!
❌ The game, mechanics and physics are buggy sometimes, but they are working on them!
➖ Can't say it's too complex or highly difficult, but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing (for me at least).
➖ Some parts of the game are not yet developed. Only time will tell if they will add or subtract from the game's value.

MENTIONS
[/h1]

🕘 Release date: Apr, 2019
🕘 I've played it in: Mar, 2023
🕘 Honestly, it's fresh and fun! I'm going to confidently recommend this title to any ARPG fan out there, [u]right now[/u]!! It's definitely worth your time and money. While it's still in early access, it's similarly as polished as Valheim (as an example), and is highly playable in this state.

[h1]
GOOD TO KNOW
[/h1]

⚠️ In it's current state, there will be bugs, but they are easily over-lookable. You will have a lot of fun either way.
⚠️ Do not expect this game to be hard. It's kind of easy overall, but not too easy at the same time. I'd say it's perfect blend of Average difficulty (which is what I prefer nowadays).
⚠️ Community Rating at time of review: Very Positive

[h1]
EXTRA THOUGHTS
[/h1]

🔙 I've purchased this title early on ( @Jun, 2021) and tried it immediately for a few hours. Back then it was nowhere near as ready to be played as it is now. Years have passed and I was still skeptical towards it, but I gave it a shot anyway, due to it's growing popularity. 
I'm so happy for what its become. I'm very impressed. Unlike Wolcen, this title is in a muuuuch better current state already. It can only get better from hereon.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1]Honest Review from an Old Codger[/h1]

[b]First impressions and on the fence: [/b]

I am an older gamer and a father of 4 boys. Elden Ring was the first game for me in the ""Souls-Series"" that I have really played. I did buy Dark Souls 3 and try to play that once it released on Steam, and it took me nearly 3 hours to kill Gundyr; only to find myself constantly invaded, and relentlessly killed when I was trying to play with my youngest son, Griffin afterwards. Needlessly to say, I quickly put that game down and moved on with my life. Years later, my sons showed me Elden Ring and I fell in love with the trailer. My wife encouraged me to try it and be open; maybe this would be a better experience. Time would tell. My gamers of all age and creed, I have put in 1000 hours in and I have no intentions of stopping. 

 I told myself that I would give an honest review from my point of view if I ever played the game for 1000 hours.

[b]Arising as a Tarnished: [/b]

I can safely say that this game is one of the best games that I have ever played in my life; I have played many. I have experienced such a range of emotions of this game, and no matter how many times I failed at a boss or a mechanic, I always knew that I could better myself if I applied myself; a nice lesson learned in life that transcends quite well into the gaming universes. Once I was able to get my noodle around the mechanics of this game, I fell in love and I could not put it down; I still cannot. You just have to be patient with yourself and believe in yourself. That is one of the many cornerstones of life that leads to success and in these Souls games, it is no different. You can quite literally play the game however you want. Any build you can think of, any style you desire, you can do it here.  Your limits are only set on your imagination and will power.  I have created many different kinds of builds for my complete playthroughs and I never get bored beating the games and repeating the content as a different character from the hit MOBA: League of Legends. 

[b]Support beyond the Fog[/b]:

As an older gamer, and father of 4 boys, my time is limited, and it is always an opportunity cost when learning how to play a new game. The community that surrounds Elden Ring are amazing as well, which was very strange at first. I did not expect a game, that is heavily singleplayer, to have an immense amount of care, and support from a community. From this community, the amount of resources of knowledge and guidance they give, often reminds me of my first time playing Star Wars Galaxies, EverQuest and the original World of Warcraft.  From wikis to video playthroughs, and everything in between, anything you could possibly want to know, and answers to the questions that you did not think you could have, the community has your back. Keep this in mind if you are ever stuck in this game, or on the fence about this game. The resources are there for you, the support from the community is there for you both in and out of game. Shout out to Fextralife, Fightincowboy, Giggathiccas, Onion Samurai, Titus Actual, YMAH (the goat), and Steelovsky for helping me in all aspects of the game. If you are ever struggling, please look any of those up on how to better yourselves in PvE or the PvP Aspects of the game. 

[b]A Seamless Land, that is as vast as the oceans[/b]

When I reached the 25 hours mark, I told my wife that this game reminded me a lot of Nintendo's 1998 hit classic ""Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"". That world space was so vast for its time, it was like nothing that the world of gaming has ever seen before.  Seamlessly wondering around, adventuring around, didn't matter if you got lost or hit a dead end, I was so engaged back then to explore and find what wonders and secrets held, low and behold, Elden Ring delivered that same experience that I had in my youth. That was so captivating for me and it really left an impression on me of what it means to explore in a game and actually enjoy yourself. It has been literally decades since any game has been able to deliver that experience again and trust me, I have bought nearly all those AAA open world games that have sucked in comparison on delivering a wholesome experience. 

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]

When I buy a game, I invest my hard earned money AND my limited time in it. I expect to have a good time with my family and friends that also play that game. I took a leap of faith with this game; especially after my first experience with a FROMSOFT game was quite miserable (LOL not anymore, I have nearly 100% Darksouls III and absolutely love the Dark Souls games, yes including DS II). Needless to say, this game has not only surpassed my expectations, but it has been quite sometime (I would say 5 years) that I have thoroughly enjoyed myself playing a game. Gamer-Rot is a hard experience to endure and live through as a passionate gamer, and Elden Ring got me out of it. Elden Ring has paved the road for me and my sons to spend more quality time together. Thank you Elden Ring.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"This being my first FromSoftware game, I was a bit nervous about the difficulty as I'm not usually a fan of hard content (or very good at it), but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't as daunting as I'd thought it'd be, and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games.

[h1][u]The World[/u][/h1]
I can't remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game's open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming. I spent something like 50 hours exploring Limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls.

If I had trouble with a boss or an area, I'd just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on, and there's plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss. 

Creature summons were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.

[h1][u]The Gameplay[/u][/h1]
My first playthrough ended up being something like 300 hours long, though plenty of those hours were spent doing random things like climbing hard-to-reach places to enjoy the view or leaving fellow players a message!

I also spent plenty of time stubbornly dying to enemies I wasn't quite yet ready to take on, and there were two specific bosses that I had a really hard time with, but finally beating them felt SO satisfying, and it was worth all the rage I'd felt when dying repeatedly to them.

[h1][u]The Multiplayer[/u][/h1]
I asked for help from some friends at times, and there are a lot of funny moments to be had when playing with others. It's also not that difficult to find a random player to summon if you need help with a boss or dungeon. 

When you're in a boss arena, you can't be invaded, so if you're worried about that, you just have to limit summoning other players to when you're fighting bosses.

Though honestly, the invading wasn't as scary as I'd expected, especially when you have the option of asking a hunter for help. I have some great memories from when me and my friend were invaded, times where we got absolutely decimated but also close calls that made us whoop or sigh in relief!

[h1][u]Ending Thoughts[/u][/h1]
I loved the npc's, although some of the quests felt like they ended too suddenly :( Also, I don't care what anyone says, Fia's hugs are nice and warm.

Seeing my character in cutscenes, however few, felt very satisfying. Especially as I can't help but dress up for that purpose alone lol.

The only bad experience I really had with the game was towards the end. I absolutely hated a certain zone ([spoiler]Farum Azula, cough[/spoiler]), and it was the only zone I ended up trying to rush through. Moving around the environment was annoying especially because of the enemies. It's also the only location where my game crashed multiple times. 

I have to say the location boss was awesome though, as was every main boss honestly. 
The optional boss in the area was also one of my favorite designs and one of my most memorable experiences in the game.



Other than that, I had a few stutters here and there, but nothing too disrupting to my experience.

Even if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options if you're struggling, and there are plenty of playstyles you can give a go. 

Suffice to say, I'm super excited to see what the future dlc will bring and I [b][u]highly recommend[/u][/b] the game!

1245620,ELDEN RING,"Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:
- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.
- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world
- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign
- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.
- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.

There are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:
- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.
- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.
- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.
- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as ""respawn only"" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.
- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...
- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.
- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.

As with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.",medium performance issue 2 28 22 goty amazing dripping content fromsoft dark soul 4 dark soul 4 5 6 massive open world attempt pad game picking item open world pickup animation dragon age inquisition talking pick item horseback animation greatly speed looting open world summoning pool make summoned boss easier general overworld location pool location summon sign sooooo bonfire location fast travel anywhere map packed stuff rarely walking riding long period running dungeon bos camp single side location discover plus feeling discovery unlike improvement previous installment particular order standouts powerstancing babyyyyy favorite ds2 slottable weapon art taking weapon art ds3 tied weapon affinity allows switch scaling weapon bonfire committing specific element stat open world make accessible wall zone else stronger sekiro extremely pronounced statue marika runbacks boss nearly grueling statue respawn bonfire choose respawn usually outside bos fight room lengthy rest adjust build prevent grueling runback allow smash face bos minimal downtime dedicated button power attack risky usually counter low swinging attack add next poise breaking enemy heavy attacking attacking guard countering add move type make weapon totally different playstyle add replay value guard counter successfully blocking attack follow special heavy attack high poise damage allows critical hit make easier take skill riposte feel good love soul game disservice missing soul best accessible far crazy hard tutorial boss new ashen summoning bell give great support difficult area leave harder fight make rarely situation booting mean gon na brick walling bos dy,2,-0.5859

1245620,ELDEN RING,"I bought this game out of spite because one of my best friends convinced me for the 5th time in a row that ""Soulslike is for me"" even though I could barely be bothered to play up to the first boss in previous entries.  He's not wrong that the game seems perfect for me: a character customization heavy ARPG that actually makes the player work to [b]play better, not farm harder[/b], with mysterious lore, gritty aesthetic, and rogue-like punishment.  Yet time and time again, as much as I [b]want[/b] to be enamored by the game, I find myself too frustrated to justify spending time improving, and default to things that are more forgiving.  I am weak.

But when I walked out of the gates and saw The Lands In-Between for the first time my jaw hit the damn floor.  I immediately identified multiple places I wanted to explore, and I felt like there was nothing stopping me from doing it.  Of course, the first thing I investigated reassured me that many things could, in fact, stop me from doing it.

That's actually what I realized I needed from other Soulslikes.  I don't mind a linear path, but I don't like feeling trapped in the same mistake.  When I'm playing Elden Ring, if I can't figure something out, I don't feel like my entire experience is blocked.  I can walk away and go check out something nearby, maybe find a spell or new armor that gets me through the fight that was stopping me.  I'm [i]always[/i] progressing, even if I walk away.  That option solved my biggest problem with getting into the genre.

What KEPT me, was all the stuff I'd hoped to get out of the other games.  The characters are vague, but the details they share are just specific enough to cause a sense of wonder.  I actually feel like I'm a part of this huge world torn apart by a tremendous war.  I didn't feel important at the start...but I slowly started to say ""Wait you think I'm not tough after I took down [[redacted]]?!""  I actually felt like the world was reflecting my actions and I worked to earn my place as the difficulty rose, and it was fun doing it!

I felt this way when I was a kid and played The Legend of Zelda for the first time.   The storytelling is enough to get you interested in doing things/going places, but doesn't flood you with details.  Dungeons are fun to explore and you know you'll get something out of them.  There are clear rules to getting to the end, but your path there is mostly up to you.  It's wonderful!

Now to be clear, there are some issues I have.  The UI is pretty unintuitive, the important things are difficult to recognize as such, but honestly they're so small compared to the highs I really don't care.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]
Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph. 

[h1]GENRE:[/h1]
Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' game

[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]
Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats  (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes"" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops. 

'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.

Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.

[h1]GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:[/h1]
Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs (AMD FX 6300, RX 480) averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient). 

In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well. 
 
[h1]STORY:[/h1]
The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to ""order"". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)

[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]
•Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.

•Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.

•Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)

•You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.

•There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough

•The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.

•Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.

•Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.

[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]
•PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens. 

•Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully ""exit"" when you quit out until a while later.

•Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.

•There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.

•UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items

•Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a ""connection error"" and the game boots you back to single player. 

•Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.

•(Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.

•So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).

•'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power. 

•Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.

[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]
9.9/10; easy recommend

Elden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and can't wait for future DLC.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"My mother has always been a gamer. She played many various series throughout the decades, but her most recent interest was Elden Ring. I've personally never played any of the Souls games for my own reasons, nor did I have much interest, but my mom would tell me about her grand adventures exploring The Lands Between. She was always enthusiastic about it and I would listen, even if I had no idea about anything she was saying.

On April 7th, my mom had a stroke and I found her slumped in her chair. She was rushed to the hospital but, after five long days, she passed away. After the funeral and some time to grieve, I was going through her things and found Elden Ring on her computer. It dawned on me that she never finished this game she was so ecstatic about, so I decided I would complete it in her memory.

Elden Ring is a fantastic world of exploration and discovery. It allows the player to cheerfully change course as they discover the next distraction every few seconds. There's hardly any required order of activities to perform and you can serpentine across the world at your leisure.

The gameplay is challenging, but rewarding and exciting. Hitboxes are tight, animations are fluid, and everything controls well. Melee combat is weighty and the enemies react in a satisfying manner. Magic is powerful and varied in execution to keep things fresh. Just about everything is viable, so have fun with it. There's many small rewards to enhance your gameplay hidden around, so it pays to take your time and comb over areas you think you've completed.

Dueling against other players is also exciting. They're capable of everything you are, so you have to stay on your toes. Be ready to counter their actions and punish openings.

Difficulty is high, but not impossible. I spent enough time wandering early on that the first real boss fight was no issue at all. You can also level up and grind stats, if you want/need. Some fights are obviously going to be harder than others, but you can learn most of them and overcome anything the boss throws at you if you relax and read their inputs.

The story is interesting, but obtuse. Not enough is explained well in-game, and I relied on some abridged lore videos to better understand what's going on. I'll refrain from spoiling anything here though.

I played through the first half of the game on my own, offline. Then I decided to try online when a friend was continuously asking if he could join. Both are enjoyable experiences, but I would suggest offline/solo play if you're a slower and more thorough individual.

I enjoyed the time I spent in Elden Ring alone, with friends, confused, triumphant, and even despaired. It's an exhilarating experience that invaded my dreams and had me theorycrafting builds during my work hours. I'll enjoy many more hours in the near future when DLC arrives.

I hope my mother enjoyed watching me play and was satisfied with the story path and ending I chose. I will never forget the life she gave me and the struggles she faced along the way. There are so many things I never got to say, so many milestones in my life she will never get to see, and locations we never got to visit.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"Being my first souls game, I was convinced I would be wasting my money, and that the first boss I encountered would kick my ass. And I was proven right in no time, by the Grafted Scion. “But you were expected to be defeated by that one!”, you say. Worry not, the Tree Sentinel was also quick to put me back in my place once I had built the tiniest bit of confidence after beating the tutorial boss.

The game is fantastic. It got more and more rewarding as I progressed, and I was happy to beat the game a second and a third time, finding out new secrets during each playthrough. There’s no compliment I can come up with that hasn’t already been used to describe this game.

There are so many weapons with so many different builds to try. Bosses can be frustrating but there’s so much fun to be had. Even what is considered to be one of the toughest fights (looking at you, Malenia) is incredibly fair and fun. And the spectral horse you get is most likely the best horse I’ve ever ridden in any game, ever.

If I had anything to complain about, are the platforming sections. But after looking it up a bit, apparently FromSoftware never really knew how to do those, and they are so few and far between, that's hardly a reason not to buy the game.

I could also complain that I was unable to romance Boggart or Blaidd. They’re so cool.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1] Welcome To Elden Ring -A Dying Simulator- [/h1]

This game delivers the entire experience in a way I've never quite seen. I'm new to the souls-like genre, and FROMSOFTWARE games. Here are the thoughts: 

I've spent 200+ hours in this game as of writing this and I've barely left the starting area - Limgrave. My nightmares consist of Runebears, traversing the mist, and boss fights. I've been startled, pillaged, rekt, and absolutely confused many times, but I wouldn't change any of it. I remember the first time I saw a giant I had Attack on Titan flashbacks and began trying to summon my inner Captain Levi. It's just a blast. An absolute blast. The greatest feeling of accomplishment is when you start to beat bosses or new enemies on your first attempt. You can feel your ability, your reaction time, your muscle-memory coming more and more into play as you practice, and it creates a thrilling experience. Struggling with an enemy type for hours only to come back a few days later and realize how much stronger and faster you've gotten is a very rewarding experience.

I was a bit nervous about the difficulty as I'm not usually a fan of hard content (or very good at it), but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't as daunting as I'd thought it'd be, and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games.

I can't remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game's open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming. I spent something like 50 hours exploring Limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls.

If I had trouble with a boss or an area, I'd just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on, and there's plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss. Discover new dungeons, Cave, Hidden Item, Secret Spells, Underground, Mini bosses etc.. Summoning Spirit were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons art was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.

Even if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options In open world amazing quest, beautiful scenery that is pretty enough reason to try it. If you're struggling, and there are plenty of play-styles, magical spells build as well to play with.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"So, I came into this game as a person who hates the Souls-genre. I'm not that good at combat in video games as I typically like games where you can just hack or slash your way through everything. So when Elden Ring was announced and talked about pre-release, I was like ""Nah, i wont like it."". Fast-forward to when it released I was watching a few friends play it and it looked amazingly fun. So I was like... I gotta bite the bullet and try it.
Lo and behold it was the best decision ever! Elden Ring while a souls-game has a feature to it that actually made it a lot more comfortable for me to play than any other souls game: It was open world without a defined path you have to take. Sure, the grace sites tell you WHERE you should go, but you can generally ignore them. Also sure, you have to beat certain things in order to ""win"" the game, but you can like ignore that for a really long time and just explore. I had so much fun exploring the game and just messing around with magic that it really didnt feel like a souls game until like mid-game. That's when the bosses started to get really punishing for me. However, I only had to really call in my friend like three times? One of those times was just because it was like eleven at night and I was exhausted and just really wanted to get past the boss.
So, honestly, without going further into it and allowing you to explore on your own, YES get Elden Ring, even if you typically hate Souls games. This game is literally the souls-genre redone in a way that almost anyone can get into it. One last thing to mention before i peace out, but I have REALLY bad ADHD to the point where it's rare that a game actually keeps my attention. I was absolutely hooked from start to finish with this game.",hate soul genre good combat video game typically game hack slash elden ring announced talked pre release nah wont fast forward released watching friend looked amazingly fun ta bite bullet lo behold best decision elden ring soul comfortable soul open world defined path grace site tell generally ignore beat certain thing order win ignore long explore fun exploring messing magic didnt soul mid boss started punishing call friend three time time eleven night exhausted wanted past bos honestly allowing explore yes elden ring typically hate soul game literally soul genre redone last mention peace bad adhd rare keep attention hooked finish,2,0.9431

1245620,ELDEN RING,"After 98 hours I believe I have fully finished the game, completing all bosses and completing what I believe are all 6 endings to the game, although I'm convinced there's 7 and now confidently write my review on the game.

[b]For the sake of not wasting much of your time with this review i will start with the bad[/b]

- Weird FPS stuttering issue, I didn't really get this bad compared to most people seemingly but I did encounter it in a particularly foggy and snowy area of the game. Hopefully they can fix up these PC port issues quickly.

- The worst PvP invasion system out of all their titles. The only way you can invade is if someone has summoned help already, that means the invader has to always 2 v 1 at a minimum but in fact most of the time they are actually 3 v 1ing as the person being invaded will summon in additional help. I personally think this invading system is absolute garbage awful design and it's especially tragic with how well the rest of the game is designed and it really cuts deep with the potential this title had in regards to PvP.

- Bad summoning multiplayer system. I believe this game has a level scaling system if you play multiplayer with your friends and use a password so your high level character can help out a friend, however for absolutely no reason, this is not the universal multiplayer system and they did not extend this level scaling system to the random summons to help people or the random invading PvP. This means that I, with my level 165 character are destined to never be able to use multiplayer system to help out new players kill early game bosses even though they actually have a system in the game that I should be able to use in order to do this.

- An issue that almost all open world games have towards the end of the game. Copy and Paste enemies and bosses where unfortunately due to the scale of the game that variety of bosses and enemies gets thin, and you get bosses that are 2 or 3 man of previous bosses. Also due to the nature of an open world if you explore and happen to successfully grind through a difficult or area you're underleveled for, this will ultimately mean you have thus overleveled another area. I had this problem myself where I explored and facesmashed through a couple of massive hidden zones and thus overleveled probably 2 main zones I had to progress through later. Having said that in the last 2 or so zones and especially the last hidden zone of the game I seemed to be at the correct level for them so it seemed to equalise regardless towards the end of the game. 

- I believe the game actually tricks new players into a more difficult experience. At the start of the game you are given a direction of where to go through arrows on the map pointing you where to go. The arrows in Limgrave, and in Liurnia point you towards a major boss / zone that is actually substantially more difficult than the other major boss and Points of Interest in the zone. I believe for the sake of new players they should somehow adjust the arrows. I highly recommend new players, especially to the series as a whole explore zones to their maximum before actually following the arrows which seems counter-intuituve design.

[b]Now let's talk about the good parts[/b]

- There are a couple of systems in place that make it the most accessible From Software title for new players. The main system is the Spirit Ashes system that is basically an offline summoning system that summons an upgradable NPC or group of NPCs to help you. This system alone makes the game exceptionally accessible for new players to the series as these NPCs are frankly and I believe intentionally busted, if a player ever gets bored and wants to progress a frustrating part of the game they can pop one of these and fly through it.

- Another major plus to this game compared to previous titles is the sheer variety of builds, especially through the Ashes of War system that allows you transform any standard weapon to scale with any stat. This with the sheer variaty of weapons, armour etc. that are already in the game adds massive replay value to the game over time. Also the game has a built in easily accessible respec function. I'm already looking forward to trying new builds through new game+. The culmination of this variety in builds really solidifies Elden Ring as the Magnum Opus of the Souls combat system, which once again makes how bad the PvP is sting extra hard.

- Open World, Storytelling and Characters. I really enjoyed the Open World myself and believe it was a great evolution to the series that just requires some kinks sorting that I've discussed previously. You can actually see landmarks on the map without having visited them yet. Caves, Towers, Churches and especially the Ruins are all clearly visible on the map before you have visited them although there are also some hidden ones for the people like me that also like exploring.

Overall I found the world and zones themselves very varied and interesting going between zone to zone, so that's definitely a big plus of the Open World design. Whilst From Software isn't the pinnacle developer of graphics, From Software has always been phenomenal at environmental design and they carry on their form in Elden Ring.

- I enjoy the Elden Ring story more than other Souls titles. I found it had a much stronger foundation that you could more easily understand and follow, it made you want to explore the world more and interact the NPCs regularly. Elden Ring didn't leave a lot of the story vague, throughout the game it solidified the lore into quite an easy to understand package and I believe this is a plus personally.

In my opinion Elden Ring has the most interesting NPCs and also Quests out of all the titles. I love the secrets in From Software games and fortunately Elden Ring has a good few of them that were a treat to discover with all the NPCs. The NPC quests were quite long, fleshed out, interesting to the story and if you explored the game fully weren't really terribly difficult to miss. They also contributed a lot to a few of the endings which I found really cool.

[b]Middling things that can be positives and negatives[/b]

- The ambient soundtrack for the zones is the best out of all the From Software games, however I found a lot of the actual boss music quite hit and miss. Overall it was good enough for me to buy the Soundtrack so there's that I guess.

- They managed to make, in my humble opinion the worst 'poison swamp' area out of every souls game. Take that as you will. Hidetaka Miyazaki spared no expense in the creation of this area.

[b]Closing Notes[/b]

To summarise this review, I strongly believe this to overall be the best From Software title for a singleplayer experience and possibly the worst for a multiplayer experience. New players and Veterans alike can have an absolute blast due to the systems they have implemented. The sheer freedom in this game is incredible from the build variety to how you explore and progress through the game which gives this game a ton of replay value compared to previous titles and also gives Elden Ring the strongest combat in a souls game so far. The story is interesting and in my opinion more concrete than previous From Software games which made it very fun to learn about as you played through the game, the NPC quests are the most interesting so far. The PvP invasions had the potential to be the best in all Souls games due to the aforementioned build variety but they messed that up, hopefully they will change it. The multiplayer with randoms is unfortunately hindered for absolutely no reason. Hopefully they fix the performance issues, luckily I didn't really have any except a little bit in one zone.

Naturally this review is all my opinion, if you disagree that's cool. If you have performance issues that's unfortunate, hope they fix them.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"It will seem unfair, almost rude and insulting to play, at first. Every step of the way Elden Ring challenges what you think you know about action games, and video games in general. You're plopped into a world with little to no map markers. Zero quest log. Dialogue is spoken once to you by npcs, better remember what they say! And the world is completely open. It takes modern open world concepts that have been overused and some how makes them feel fresh. The reward of continuing on despite your many failures, is what makes Elden Ring so unique and enjoyable to play. 

Nobody in their right mind would release a game like this in 2022. But here we are. Elden Ring feels like it's from a different time period in gaming. Like it came straight out of the 1990's early 2k's but with the graphics and precision you would expect from a title in 2022. Without all the bloat and nonsense. Elden Ring doesn't waste your time when you play it. 

It's just a masterpiece. It's like the game we have all been waiting for. If you have been playing games since you can remember and loved Ocarina of Time, the Elder Scrolls and multiplayer games like Halo. There is something you will love in this game. The multiplayer alone is an exceptionally unique and wacky experience that I highly recommend.

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"Skyrim is the digital equivalent of crystal meth. Once you start playing it, you'll never stop. You might pause every so often, like a distracted magpie tempted by some shiny new gaming trinket, but you'll never truly stop. Deep in the bowels of Bethesda HQ, Todd Howard made an unholy pact with the forces of darkness that compels people to play his game incessantly. Even if they've already bought it 57 times on 39 different platforms. It's a form of collective madness, and there's no way to combat it. What's that? You have a job to go to? Well... who's going to return Meridia's Beacon? Kids to feed? That's nice and all, but someone really needs to reforge Gaulder's Amulet. And it might very well be your wedding anniversary this weekend, but this civil war isn't about to resolve itself, is it? Priorities people!

Skyrim's like Disneyworld. Everyone loves it. Little kids play Skyrim. (They shouldn't because it can be scary and gruesome, and you're an irresponsible parent for permitting it, but they do.) Doddering bed-wetters in retirement villages across the globe play Skyrim. (And they shouldn't either, because having a frostbite spider leap out of a shrubbery at you could very well provoke a heart attack or stroke.) It's a game that has multi-generational appeal. Todd Howard's monstrous ambition knows no limits, his target demographic being literally 'anyone with a pulse'.

Yes, Witcher 3 might have nicer graphics, some incredible quests, and more sophisticated swordplay. And, Horizon Zero Dawn might have a jaw-droppingly lush sci-fi/fantasy world, and a brilliant heroine. And, of course, Red Dead Redemption 2 has cowboys, colourful, believeable characters, and a story that grabs you by the throat like a rabid wolverine, refusing to let go until the very end. But they're not Skyrim. They don't have the eleven secret herbs and spices that make Todd Howard's particular brand of open-world witchcraft so finger-lickin' good.

Jeremy Soule's soundtrack helps. It's not often I'll pause after caving in the skull of an angry bear to sway gently in my chair like a mesmerised cobra, a look of glassy-eyed contentment plastered across my gormless visage, but listening to 'Distant Horizons' for the 482nd time will do it. The eye candy built into the Special Edition also induces moments of introspection. Sitting on horseback, overlooking a gorge in The Reach as the volumetric fog curls lazily about me, and godrays lance between the gnarled branches of stunted trees... it's like something out of a Boris Vallejo painting. The world of Skyrim is a character in itself, and it sucks you in like a quantum singularity made of dragons and stoic men with unnecessarily large beards.

If you're one of the last seven people on Earth who still hasn't played Skyrim... don't. Run far, far away, and don't look back. This is a game that will consume your every waking moment; worse, it will invade your dreams like a creeping phantasm. Your significant other will elbow you in the kidneys as you flail about the mattress, desperately attempting to escape the imaginary minions of Hermaeus Mora. When your kids won't stop pestering you, you'll suddenly turn on them and scream ""Fus Ro Dah!"", and they'll stare at you with that all-too-familiar mixture of pity and disdain. ""Don't be a sad freak, Dad. It's embarrassing.""

I have spent over 3,000 hours engrossed in this game -- time I could have spent bonding with my loved ones, working to further my career, or building a really cool treehouse. These are hours of my life I will never get back. Fleeting, irreplaceable seconds of existence forever lost to Alduin's fanged maw, and Todd Howard's malignant dreams of global dominion. And yet I regret none of it. Not one pointless, unproductive minute. And given the chance to do it all over again, I would. God help me, I would. It's too late for me. I'm a lost cause. But there is hope yet for you. Go. Save yourselves. Flee, you fools!

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"Game was and still is so cool, but what's more remarkable to me is how easy is to look for/install/use the mods this time.
I usually play the standard mode, sometimes due to my laziness, but this game has quite a few excellent mods, especially if you are looking for a nice immersion and realism, a couple of things that you couldn't find at the original skyrim. This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyable, even when you role-play warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pit.
Mods i use:
- Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition: this fixes most of the bugs of the game
- Campfire: Lets you build a campfire and different sorts of tents
- Vivid weathers: Over 500+ Weathers with different sounds and adjustable brightness, shadows, etc.
- Frostfall: Depending on how difficult you want it, you can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder faster
-  Wet and Cold: Same thing but mostly for NPCs. Also includes some other features like blurry screen when you look up while it's rainning or snowing.
-  Point the way: Since i'm looking for some realism i avoid fast travelling, this is why i got this mod, which shows me the way to every city at every crossroad.
- Lampposts of Skrim: Lamp posts on the main roads, but just what is necessary, not plenty of them.
- Waves: Now beaches with waves :D
- Better horses: Now horses go faster than you by foot, something that makes kind of sense.
- Less agressive animals: Just makes less agressive small animals like rats or crabs. Was kind of ridiculous to see a crab trying to fight imperial soldiers.
- Hunter's Reward - Better prices: Able to skin and sell pelts for a reasonable price in case you wanna play as a hunter.
- iNeed: To eat, to drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardable.
- Holidays: Skyrim has special days like our christmas and all that stuff
- Expanded Carriage Service: Carriage service in places where you couldn't find them before, like Morthal or Dawnstar.
- Rich merchants of Skyrim: Merchants have more money to buy, meaning that you don't need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff. (1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBH)
- Run for your lives: When a dragon attacks people run off instead of trying to smack the dragon.
- When vampires attack: Same with vampires
- The Paarthurnax Dilemma: Lets you spare his life. 
- Hold border banners: Banners from different holds are placed on their borders, pretty simple but cool enough for me.
- Immersive patrols SE: Since there's a civil war going on, it's weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war. With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around. Make other kind of patrols available, like the dawnguard.
- Practice Dummies: You can use them to improve your skill till level 30 out of 100. That means that you don't need to deal with badass foes with the skill ""i barely know how to hold the sword"".
- Mammoth Pelts: You can skin mammoths, something that i still don't get why it wasn't allowed in the original game.
- Dog followers are Huskies: Makes it cooler and makes sense too since Skyrim is the north.
- Whistle: Lets you whistle to the horse to make him come over, avoiding to search for the damn horse every time he flees from a battle.
- NPC's Run and Walk at your pace:  exactly what the mod says.
- Animal poverty: Animals don't drop gold. Like they have a bank account or something...
- Immersive armors: adds different kind of armors and shields. The more smithing perks you got the more armors will show up. (Showed in auxiliary armors)
- MamTuskPowderGrind: You can grind  mammoth tusk to make its powder, an ingredient that was so hard to find and wasn't allowed (don't know why) to make it out from the normal tusks.
- Fantasy Soundtrack Project: Replaces the original music OR adds its songs to the original music. Just necessary if after all these hundreds of hours you got tired of the original one.
- Enhaced blood textures: MORE BLOOD!
- Skyland: Landscape texture overhaul
- Static Mesh Improvement Mod: Better textures for interiors.
- Skyrim better roads: More and better textures for main roads.
- Verdant: Better textures for grass.
- Blacksmith forge water fix se: Makes the water from the blacksmith look real. Yeah... once you realize you need it.
- Realistic water two: Improves A LOT water textures and effects.
- Open cities Skyrim: No loading screen when you get into a city (this needs a patch to work with Ineed mod)
- Immersive Citizens: their behaviour and dialogues are more real. (needs a patch to work with Open cities)
BTW, i got them in this order and all of them work properly

Some of the mods are only available on nexusmods, which leads me to my final advise: Download the mod ""noble skyrim"". Improves SO MUCH the city textures and buildings. There's just one problem, it has been ported to special edition but still remains on original skyrim from nexus: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/? 
There are two options, wait till it's completely ported to SSE or download it manually from original skyrim and install it manually from Nexus Mod Manager as well. It won't show up on the list, but it will be there, so don't worry. There's a patch as well to work properly with SMIM mod (Static Meshes).

EDIT: I strongly recommend another mod that i just found out! it's called: Amazing Follower Tweaks SSE, and i found it on nexusmods. Short description: you can have more than 1 follower (which is nice since Campfire mod adds tents up to 4 people) and it's possible to tweak each follower as you wish, like creating different sets of outfits depending on if they are outside or inside a city, setting primary spells, weapons, THEY CAN EVEN RIDE HORSES NOW!! and some other stuff. Check it out here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4340/?

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]
Unless there is a mod exclusive to Skyrim Legendary Edition, go buy Skyrim Special Edition. SE is more stable than LE because it is 64-bit & DirectX 11 while LE is 32-bit & DirectX 9 [b][i](in layman's terms: You will experience fewer crashes on SE than on LE)[/i][/b]. And if you haven't played Skyrim yet, you have done well to avoid Todd Howard for 10 years (and counting). Amazing first time RPG experience & one of the biggest modding scenes to date leading to potentially thousands of hours of replayability.

[h1]GENRE:[/h1]
Open-world fantasy RPG

[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]
After the introductory cutscene, you are free to roam the map of Skyrim as you please. Visit various undiscovered map locations teeming with wild and dangerous enemies both human and non-human. Build the character and play style you want to: become a mage and harness the powers of destruction magic to burn your opponents alive or manipulate their minds with illusion magic; or become a fearsome warrior who travels the world in heavy armor and swings a mighty axe to decapitate everyone in sight; or let's be real and accept the reality that in every playthrough you will somehow, whether intentionally or not, end up playing a stealth archer build who abuses the vanilla sneak system and headshots enemies from a mile away without being detected.

Join various factions ranging from the honorable Companions of Whiterun to the mysterious Dark Brotherhood. Complete quests to obtain various riches ranging from special enchanted weapon artifacts to brand new player housing. Follow the main quest and find out what is the reason behind dragons returning to Skyrim and what how exactly you are involved with everything.

[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]
Skyrim SE was released in 2016 as a remaster of Skyrim LE with added graphical features including godrays, dynamic DOF, and environmental effects. There isn't any brand new vanilla content, but the land of Skyrim sure looks better in vanilla SE than in vanilla LE. The game has a big map filled with different landscapes from grassy plains to bustling Nordic cities and of course snowy mountains that seem to climb all the way to the stars. There is plenty of variety in the world of Skyrim: different weapons, armors, wildlife, enemy types, dungeon types etc. 

In terms of performance, [b]vanilla[/b] SE runs much better than LE and is practically crash free since it isn't restricted by a small memory block like LE (that is not to say that the game [i]won't[/i] crash if you mod it with 400 mods). 

In any event, if you don't like something about the graphics, the issue is easily fixable through modding (replacing textures, adding new visual effects, adding an ENB, etc.). 

[h1]STORY:[/h1]
In the beginning, you find yourself as a prisoner in classic Elder Scrolls fashion. For some reason, you are on a cart heading towards a chopping block where everyone in the cart, including yourself, is about to be executed. Your execution is rudely interrupted by a renegade dragon who mysteriously attacks everyone on sight, but fortunately it grants you freedom. After escaping, your story is up to you to make or discover.

Pursue the main quest and find out what that dragon was doing at the execution and what your role in these events is. Or choose to pursue other faction quests and enter the ranks of various guilds around Skyrim. Or ignore everything and just wander in a direction until you reach a new unvisited landmark and explore what lies ahead.

[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]
•Skyrim is reputable for having a big, open-world where one tagline for advertisement was ""if you see it, you can go to it"". In most cases, this is true (so long as you are within the map of Skyrim's borders). If you see a mountain in the distance, by all means you can probably jump your way up to it. Thus, there is a large amount of freedom in the game for you to go wherever and do whatever. It is highly likely that you will stumble upon something interesting while straying away from a main road or following a divergent path away from your intended destination.

•The non-radiant (non-repeatable) quests in Skyrim are pretty good. There are many stories for you to unravel and be a part of. If you are finding a questline to be a bit boring, you are (for the most part) free to leave and return to the quest at your own disposal in the future.

•You really are free to build the class/playstyle you want to; if you want to get better at Skill x, just do Skill x-related tasks and your levels will improve. Just consider not playing a stealth archer for once. Or don't.

•[b]Mods[/b]. Modding Skyrim becomes its own game once you enter the wormhole of modding. If you can imagine it, someone probably made a mod for it. Whether you want to retexture a city, revamp the game's perk system, add a custom follower, or change all dragons into Macho Man Randy Savage, there's a mod for nearly everything imaginable. Ask anyone who has modded the game and they will probably tell you ""I've spent more time modding the game than playing it at this point"". Most, if not all, mods are available in both LE and SE, and certain mods are still in the process of being converted from LE to SE if they haven't already been converted.

[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]
•In modern day standards, the combat of Skyrim is pretty awful, particularly the melee. Close-quarters melee combat doesn't feel impactful in that generally you swing a weapon at an enemy and unless it is a power attack, you won't really get a reaction out of them like a wince or a flinch. The melee feels very ""floaty"" and otherwise unimpressive.

•I think most players agree that the Civil War storyline overall isn't very interesting/is pretty buggy in the vanilla game.

•You will probably encounter various NPC's that share voice actors given that there are so many NPC's (usually given backstories) in the game and a limited amount of voice actors during the making of Skyrim. Although usually the important NPC's are uniquely voiced which is a plus.

•The modding process can be pretty overwhelming to newcomers. Veterans will tell you to test mods one at a time because if you should choose to install 10 mods at once and the game crashes to the desktop at launch, you have to go back and figure out which mod was the cause and why that mod specifically is the problem. You shouldn't expect all mods to be compatible with each other so oftentimes you have to decide which mods you want and which mods you don't need.

[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]
9/10

Skyrim is a timeless game that continues to live on because you can replay it forever, but differently each time as people continue to make mods for the game and you continue to add to your modlist and get sucked back in for one more playthrough.

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"2013, my first time playing Skyrim:

On my way to Bleak Falls Barrow, I was attacked by a group of vampires. I managed to stave them off, but I contracted vampirism without realizing it. About a week later, I came out of a dungeon only to be attacked by some peasants calling me a vampire. 

Confused, I went to Whiterun in search of a cure. However, as soon as I arrived, I was met by a volley of arrows being showered at me by the town guard. At this point, I had done some quests for the companions, so I made a run to Jorrvaskr in search of someone who still may be my friend. The guards chased me throughout the city, with several of them hot on my tail, I burst through the doors of Jorrvaskr and met the companions. I was never so happy to hear Njada Stonearm call me useless. This feeling of relief was short-lived, however, as a company of guards suddenly entered the room. My friends all drew their swords and came to my defense. After a lengthy battle, the guards all lay dead on the ground.

Before I could celebrate, all of the companions went outside. Wondering where they were going, I decided to follow them. As I stepped outside into the harsh sunlight, I witnessed a massacre. The companions were murdering every hostile NPC in Whiterun. Heimskr was the first to fall as Aela rammed her sword straight through his gullet. The rest of the townspeople fled in terror, but it was no use. Belethor, Adrianne, even Nazeem, they all were mercilessly slaughtered by the companions. 

As I walked through the blood-soaked streets, I found a single survivor: Brenuin, the town drunk and one of my only friends in Whiterun. He was hiding, crouched down next to the cow behind a house. I decided to sit down next to him, when I saw Farkas, axe in hand, coming into the pen. With a deep, gutteral voice, he says, ""Where are you?"" he turns the corner and sees Brenuin cowering behind the cow, ""Ha! Found you!"" he yells. 

Brenuin screams for mercy, but it's too late. Farkas's massive axe comes down on Brenuin's skull, splitting it in two, as the drunk falls on the floor in a puddle of his own blood. 

It was then I realized that I would be playing this game for years to come.",2013 skyrim bleak fall barrow attacked group vampire managed stave contracted vampirism realizing week dungeon attacked peasant calling vampire confused whiterun search cure soon arrived met volley arrow showered town guard quest companion jorrvaskr search someone friend guard chased throughout city hot tail burst door jorrvaskr met companion happy hear njada stonearm call useless feeling relief short lived company guard suddenly entered room friend drew sword defense lengthy battle guard lay dead ground celebrate companion outside wondering decided follow stepped outside harsh sunlight witnessed massacre companion murdering hostile whiterun heimskr fall aela rammed sword straight gullet rest townspeople fled terror belethor adrianne nazeem mercilessly slaughtered companion walked blood soaked street found single survivor brenuin town drunk friend whiterun hiding crouched next cow house decided sit next saw farkas axe hand coming pen deep gutteral voice say turn corner see brenuin cowering cow ha found yell brenuin scream mercy late farkas massive axe come brenuin skull splitting drunk fall floor puddle blood realized year,0,-0.7964

I put probably 1000+ hours into it, even without all the DLC's. Many different characters, roles, etc. I loved everything this game offered. Fast foward to now, Great PC, so I bought this. Basically non-stop playing with a few breaks here and there, plus sleep. Still the best RPG I've played to this date.

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"99% of gamers will know what Skyrim is, but this review will be for that 1% who have heard the name and are looking into it, but know nothing about it. 

Basically, Skyrim is the 5th instalment in the Elder Scrolls series. The game is set within a fictional world called Tamriel and in this particular title, you play within the province of Skyrim, the icy home of the Nords (Think ancient Norway). 

You start the game as a prisoner of the Empire (Roman-esque faction) on your way to be executed. You create your character by choosing your gender, selecting from one of several different races and customising your appearance. 

By chance, the return of the dragons (After being gone for a thousand years) occurs just before you're executed and you are able to escape. From this point onwards, the game opens up to you... You are free to do as you please. You can crack on with the main storyline revolving around the return of the dragons, or you can go seek out some of the staggering amount of side quests. You can even join up with factions, such as Assassins, thieves, warriors or mages. 

Throughout the game, you level up your skills. These range from combat abilities such as different schools of magic, archery etc. to production type skills such as blacksmithing or alchemy. 

It is a fantasy style world, full of Orcs, humanoid Lizards & Felines, Elves and so on. It is filled with mystery, magic, lore and captivating story. What you do, is up to you. There is an entire province (And more with the DLC) to explore. 

If you've somehow never played Skyrim and you're interesting in fantasy worlds, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go. It's been out for 12 years at this point and the game can feel a little outdated, but it's still a fantastic game with plenty to offer.",99 gamers skyrim 1 heard name basically skyrim 5th instalment elder scroll series set fictional world called tamriel particular title province skyrim icy home nords ancient norway prisoner empire roman esque faction executed create choosing gender selecting different race customising appearance chance return dragon thousand year occurs executed able escape onwards open please crack storyline revolving return dragon seek staggering side quest join faction assassin thief warrior mages throughout skill range combat ability different school magic archery production type skill blacksmithing alchemy fantasy style world orcs humanoid lizard feline elf filled mystery magic lore captivating entire province dlc explore somehow skyrim interesting fantasy world strongly recommend giving 12 year outdated fantastic plenty offer,1,0.9118

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"The Canadian winter of 2011: I remember it well.

I walked to the nearest mall (about 4 km away) in 1 foot of snow. The air pierced my skin; -23 degrees celcius the news said in the morning. I couldn't know for sure, I didn't have a cellphone to check the weather. Even if I did, 3G technology was too expensive to use. My iPod touch was the only device available to me and even then, WiFi was negligible. Not many stores hosted WiFi networks back then. I eventually made it to the mall.

I walked into the EB games; Xbox 360, Wii and PS3 games lined the walls. There was a small section that sold used games - useless to me. I was here for THE game. I was here for Skyrim. 

I found the game on a shelf. It called to me. Most would recall seeing the cover saying 'The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim' but all I saw was 'Play Me!'

Now, mind you, I had never played an Elder Scrolls game before. I had tried to pirate Morrowind as a 12 year old but failed numerous times. But now I was 18. I was a man. I was set to conquer the beast but little had I known how large the beast would be.

I placed the game box on the counter. The cashier, a middle aged man, told me how great my decision was. He was a chubby man, about 5' 10"". He lacked hair on the top of his head and his teeth were a little scraggly. But he was civil. I could tell he was an experienced gamer - a veteran of the hobby.

He placed 'the game' in the classical EB Games bag and I was on my way out of the store. By the time I got outside of the mall, night had fallen. Canadian winters are notorious for their short day span. I placed 'the treasure' inside my jacket and zipped it up tight. I could not allow the baby to suffer the same way I did. It needed warmth and care.

As soon as I got home, I popped the game into my Xbox 360. I didn't know what to expect. What is The Elder Scrolls? Why was the middle aged man so hyped about the game? I got my answer. As soon as I was being dragged in a cart to my execution, I understood why this was to be the game of games.

Now it is the year 2019. I am no longer the fresh-faced 18 year old. I have experienced life. I have been through hell. However, every time I launch this game, I am the wide-eyed 18 year old again: no obligations to anyone but myself. 

If you have never played this game in the past, don't bother. The graphics haven't aged well (although they were premium for the time). The user interface is still sleek, however. If you can get past the graphics, animation and combat; the stories in the game are unforgettable. I wish I could go back in time to the winter of 2011. I wish I could forget about this game so I could experience it again. 

Skyrim set the bar for what modern games should be. It not only deserves a 10/10 but it deserves a place in our history books. There is so much content to experience in the game that you could play it for YEARS and still not have experienced everything in it. Why do you think I bought the game again? For fun? 

I'm going back to finish the game once and for all.",canadian winter 2011 remember walked nearest mall 4 km 1 foot snow air pierced skin 23 degree celcius news morning cellphone check weather 3g technology expensive ipod touch device available wifi negligible store hosted wifi network eventually mall walked eb game xbox 360 wii ps3 game lined wall small section sold game useless skyrim found shelf called recall seeing cover saying elder scroll skyrim saw mind elder scroll tried pirate morrowind 12 old failed numerous time 18 man set conquer beast known large beast placed box counter cashier middle aged man told great decision chubby man 5 10 lacked hair top head teeth scraggly civil tell experienced gamer veteran hobby placed classical eb game bag store outside mall night fallen canadian winter notorious short span placed treasure inside jacket zipped tight allow suffer needed warmth care soon home popped xbox 360 expect elder scroll middle aged man hyped answer soon dragged cart execution understood game 2019 longer fresh faced 18 old experienced life hell launch wide eyed 18 old obligation past bother graphic aged premium user interface sleek past graphic animation combat story unforgettable wish winter 2011 wish forget skyrim set bar modern game deserves 10 10 deserves history book content year experienced bought fun finish,0,-0.0772
1888930,The Last of Us™ Part I,"At launch, the game was unplayable due to a heavy amount of bugs and VRAM issues. Naughty Dog promised patches, and after waiting a few months, I have no problems running the game bug-free on high settings. Shaders still need to be compiled with every new graphics driver version, but it takes 15 minutes for me instead of over 1 hour previously.

In its original state, the game lacked optimization for graphics cards with 8GB of VRAM. This has since been fixed. Texture streaming can now be lowered to mitigate excessive cache and allow for a better experience at the cost of textures loading in slower. Separately, VRAM usage can be reduced further by enabling DLSS if your card supports it.

As far as the actual content of the game goes, it's a 10 year old masterpiece of storytelling and immersion that is worth playing through again in its overhauled ""Part 1"" glory. Cutscenes are now rendered in real-time to stunning effect. Facial animations and lighting bask in realism as you become gripped with complex themes of love, loss, and survival. Woven inside of a post-apocalyptic narrative is nuanced stealth/action gameplay that can challenge any player with an array of difficulty settings. Newcomers to the franchise thanks to the HBO series are also in for a real treat.

1888930,The Last of Us™ Part I,"I simply wanna play the game.

This has been my favorite game of all time since it released on PS3 and I used to play it over and over and over again just because I loved it so much. The game itself is an amazing game but Iron Galaxy really take a shit on this game. Naughty Dog, if you care about your fans and one of your biggest games ever, you would fire Iron Galaxy and fix this port yourselves, because this is truly disgraceful.

I am 10hrs into the game at the time of writing this review to make sure it was just as bad as everyone is saying it is. It;s worse than I thought. I have had a total of 7 crashes, one of which required a full PC restart. The game somehow deleted my graphics driver from my computer causing me to have to spend an hour or two figuring out how to manually redownload it and the game changes my sensitivity back to default every time I open the game. (Btw 10hrs in and ive only just reached the Hotel because building shaders took about an hour and a few times it wasnt responding and I had to wait.)

I cannot say this loud enough. ***DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET*** Iron Galaxy took a massive shit on my favorite title and it should not be allowed to stay like this. If Naughty Dog appreciates their fans even a little bit, theyll do something about this because this is simply unacceptable.",simply wan na favorite released ps3 loved amazing iron galaxy shit naughty dog care fan biggest game fire iron galaxy fix port truly disgraceful 10hrs writing bad saying worse thought total 7 crash required pc restart somehow deleted graphic driver computer causing spend figuring manually redownload change sensitivity default open btw 10hrs ive reached hotel building shaders took time wasnt responding wait loud iron galaxy took massive shit favorite title allowed stay naughty dog appreciates fan bit theyll simply unacceptable,2,0.7351

1888930,The Last of Us™ Part I,"Alright, these are gonna be some harsh words that I´m about to say but I´ll say them anyway.
TLOU is an incredible game and I dont think that its necessary to explain why.
At this point everyone and their mothers have heard about the game so let´s skip that part.
I myself experienced TLOU shortly after release on the PS3 and have never heard about the game in any way possible.
When i got to play it, I was hooked on it so bad that i bought the game 3 more times.
Yes i bought the PS4 Remastered twice (Cause i lost the first copy) and after almost 10 years of waiting I bought it for the PC for the Full Price.... AGAIN, but now I´m finally able to play it... or am I?

Well release wasnt that pleasant but heres a short Rundown on how its state for me was on release, and how it is now.

For my Specs I´m running a Ryzen 5 2600 with 16 Gb of Ram, for the Gpu I´m having a RX5700XT (and yes its being bottlenecked by the Cpu) and im playing on a Full HD Monitor with only 60 hz cause my 144hz Monitor broke recently.
I also have FSR 2.0 activated on the ""Quality"" Setting.

Okay lets get started:
Release: The game was literally unplayable for me. Besides the extremely Long Shader Cache installation the game itself was horrible and in an absolute unacceptable state.
I had LOADING WINDOWS MID GAME. Even the Ps3 didnt have this (and yes I know the game is specifically coded for the ps3 and other Console Plattforms) but why did they decide to let the Worst Porting studio in the History of PC-Porting handle the biggest Trademark of their company. Well i had the game on all settings, Strict and Mixed (sometimes it didnt even care what my settings were and loaded low poly models instead) and it was just unplayable in every way so i decided to wait.

Patch 1.0.1.5: I mean... it fixed some stuff?
I still resorted to the widelyspread Oodle fix wich did increase my performance a bit and made it ""playable"" but not enjoyable. Still I managed to play for couple of hours wihtout wanting to rethink my choices in life.

Patch 1.0.1.6: Meh nothing changed really.
Small improvements and a tiny bit less stutter but nothing major really.

Patch 1.0.1.7: This Patch focused mainly on crashes but I never had any Issues with them really.

Patch 1.0.2.0: Okay now we´re talking.
There are some major improvements for stability and performance in general.
Also they fixed the high Vram usage which was just a display error.
It wasnt displaying the right amount of vram usage when changing graphic settings.
Also it reduced the overall Cpu usage which is always nice.

Patch 1.0.2.1: Wonderful.
They fixed an Issue where you had massive camera jitter which was just unbearable.
Small Patch but definitely an Improvement.
At this point I´m also halfway through the Game.

Patch 1.0.3.0: What happened???
This patch focused on mostly audio based issues and various issues across the board but it somehow managed to kinda tank the performance a bit. At this point im almost done with the game but I noticed that my ram was filling to the brim and suddenly dumps everything leaving my cpu to be overloade and my storage doing nothing,
This causes my game to be left at about 30-40 fps for couple of minutes until my ram has been build up again.

Patch 1.0.4.0: WOW.
I finished the game before the Patch released but I´m playing my NG+ save on this patch and ist awesome.
Finally something with not only Major improvements, I´d say they´re Gigantic Improvements.
-More Graphic Settings
-Optimized CPU and GPU Usage
-Much better Performance
-More acceptable Loading Times (Still faster then GTA V)
-Better Texture Streaming across the Board
-And a much more fluent Experience
All the annoying issues at the beginning were gone or mostly fixed.
There are still some major issues, such as the definite memory leak that is happening and I´m pretty sure they can get it much more optimized, but overall the game is moving in a playable and enjoyable state...

which is exactly what it should because i think TLOU is an experience everyone should take the chance to have this experience. And without ad oubt, this remke of the game IS the definitive edition.
Still as a long time fan since the beginning, I´m more then dissapointed in what stae the long awaited PC-Port arrived and i hope for Naughty Dog that the can make this Port to state that its meant to be played, because as it is, it is disrespecting towards themselves, their whole Fanbase (which isnt a small one) and the story that is being told inside the Game.
And thats that.

Edit: Patch 1.0.5 has been released a couple of hours ago. Ill try to play it as soon as the 50gb update has finished.
Its focusing on every major issue so im excited to see for myself how it played out.
Also I know there are a lot of grammar issues in my review so far, but i aint gonna fix them, so go ahead, sue me.
Alright the Patch did fix a lot of stuff but theres something weird about it.
At this point im now able to play the game on Medium-High Settings without FSR Upscaling, and im reaching around 50-60 fps much more stable.
It aint perfect, but its more then playable, its almost enjoyable.
They also fixed the overloading ram issue that set my ram back for about 2-4 gb in space which is a lot.
There are more graphic settings, better resource utilization etc. but there is no real performance bump...
Yes the game runs much more stable and the frametimes are much tighter then before, but real preformance improvements in terms of raw fps, there is no significant difference, but I feel like this is the first version that should have gone to retail.

(Edit 23.05) Okay I´ve noticed something really weird.
I´ve updated to the latest drivers and reset my shader cache after reinstalling the game once.
Im now able to play on Ultra without FSR?
Im confused, but whats even more confusing then that... well the fact that the game doesnt have any performance impact when changing settings.
The only thing that is affected is the Vram usage, but my resource utilisation was maxed bringing me to around 45-60 fps.
I´m not sure whats going on, but at least, in my opinion, its playable so...

(Edit 30.05 Patch 1.0.5.1)
This patch does focus on stability improvements, even though I did not notice any real performance difference, I did notice a much faster boot and loading time then before. (This may vary tho)
Not much else then that but better then nothing :)
I´ll be keeping on updating until this game is in an almost perfect state.

1888930,The Last of Us™ Part I,"5/22/23 - This game runs perfectly for me. I just bought it and played for 5 hours straight, not a single crash or any issues. I have a mid tier computer with an RTX2070 Super and i'm playing on ""high"" graphics with no problems. If you have been waiting to buy this game like I was, you might not need to wait any longer. Enjoy!

Update 5/26/23 - 15 hours played - I just finished the main game and never once crashed or had any issues. I'm in love with this game all over again and can't wait to keep playing it. Now it's time play through on Grounded+ (max difficulty), and play the Left Behind DLC. Cheers!

Update 5/29/23 - 30 Hours played - I am about half way through Grounded+ and I finally had my first crash last night. Nothing too major, just had to reboot the game. But I felt like I should update you. Godspeed!

Update 6/2/23 - 45 Hours played - This is my final update boys, my journey has come to an end. I have finished Grounded+ and Left Behind. I feel I have gotten everything I wanted out of this game and now I will probably uninstall it. Overall I am very satisfied. I will say this on my experience, I never ran into any performance issues other than the one time it crashed. My FPS was fine. Not sure exactly what it was, but it was acceptable to play the game. The computer did run a bit hot, but this is true for lots of games. To help out, when I played this game I generally didn't have any other applications running.

In spite of this, the PC port is a shame for Naughty Dog, Iron Galaxy, Mr. Druckmann, and anyone else who contributed to this port, and the main blame should rest with Sony who approved the release.
The game ran at around 25-40fps on low-medium settings, even though I played Resident Evil 4 Remake at 60fps on medium-high settings. In this situation, a positive review of this game would be disappointing to other companies that strive to give the PC community what they really deserve with their optimized port.

>> The funny thing is that Sony actually accuses Microsoft that if they acquire Activision-Blizzard, the Call of Duty port on the PlayStation would be a worse version of the game. Apparently, they are using the same strategy with this PC port, as their most iconic and popular game, to indirectly tell players to buy a PlayStation if they do not want to deal with such a port!

1888930,The Last of Us™ Part I,"This is a phenomenal game, both from a story and gameplay perspective. If the port's ever stabilized, I'll get around to writing a full review and I'll definitely thumb this up.

However the current state of things is god-awful. I'm fortunate enough to have a very powerful PC, so when it runs, it runs fairly well. The issue here is that it lacks stability. The game crashes nearly once every two hours or so, and while that's annoying, the most debilitating part of these crashes is that the game will often force you to verify files afterwards. Once you've verified files, you've got to recompile shaders, which can take upwards of 45 minutes! And, to top it off, the cherry on top is that the game will often then crash WHILE COMPILING SHADERS, forcing you to begin the entire arduous process all over again. 

See image here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2964269824

This is a completely broken port that shouldn't be purchased at the moment. Even after several patches it's still extremely difficult to keep the game running on my machine. I strongly recommend all players steer clear of this for several months to a year, as it should never have been released in this state in the first place.

1888930,The Last of Us™ Part I,"The Last of Us PC - Honest Review and Performance Test

-----------------

Back in the day, when it first came out, I absolutely loved The Last of Us. The storytelling and the atmosphere was and still is one of the best out there. When I heard it was also coming out on PC, I was of course over the moon.

Well... as many of you know, the launch was terrible and the game was clearly still not complete. I feel like this MUST be taken into consideration whenever anyone is commenting on this PC port. The bad performance and the glitches were not an ""accidental mistake"", it was an intentional decision by the publishers and the higher-ups to release the game at that state and hope people will still buy it and forget about it after a while.

Let me tell you guys, for a title this big and with a price even above some brand new titles, how they launched this game was totally unacceptable and that should not ever be ""forgotten"" by the fans and community.

-----------------

So, now to my experience. I haven't preordered this game or bought it any time close to launch. The version I bought it at and am currently running is v1.1.2. I do not recommend getting this game without it going on sale. The specs I have tested it on are:

- windows 11 22h2
- ryzen 5 5600x
- rtx 3060 (driver 537.13)
- 32gb ram (ddr4)

The Steam download is around 75gb. As soon as you launch the game, it will automatically start building the shaders. This means it will instantly max out your cpu until the shaders for the main game and the dlc are built. With these specs, it took around 20 minutes to finish and the cpu maxed out at around 70°c. There are people who have experienced system shutdowns because of high cpu temperatures. If you have such concerns, you can always edit your power plan or disable turbo boost on amd systems. I highly recommend waiting for the shaders to fully build before doing anything.

For the display and graphics settings, a quick google search for ""the last of us pc optimal settings"" will give you many websites with detailed explanations on what each setting does. For this test I have used the guide from a website called exputer and made some small tweaks. Some settings have little impact on the visuals but a big impact on the performance. With these settings the visuals look great and the performance is optimal as well.

In the first two hours of gameplay the game ran on average at around 80 fps with dlss balanced and vsync off. I haven't experienced major stutters or graphical glitches. The average total hardware utilisations were around:

- cpu 60%
- vram 8gb
- ram 16gb

However, not all scenes are the same. Some are lighter to run and some are heavier to run. I would consider the overall experience to be smooth and playable.

-----------------

If you happen to have the exact specs and drivers as I have, then I do recommend getting this game only on a sale. Although not guaranteed, you likely should not experience major problems.

Even though I had a great experience with the game performance, that does not make any other recent complaints invalid. Some systems are still clearly having problems, regardless of whether they have the recommended specs or not. This is certainly not their fault, but rather the game's fault. I absolutely do not recommend buying the game without checking whether you have any known issues with your hardware. With all things taken into consideration, I would not recommend this game to most people due to performance issues.

-----------------

Edit: After finishing the main game, here is some additional information about the performance.   

- Overall it was a smooth experience, however towards the end of the game there were sections where the frame rate dropped to low 40s and one section where the frame rate was in the low 30s. Other sections were smooth as mentioned before.
- There was one time in the early game where the game froze up and resulted in me having to restart the game.

Other than that I haven't experienced any new major issues.",last pc honest performance test loved last storytelling atmosphere best heard coming pc course moon launch terrible clearly complete taken consideration whenever commenting pc port bad performance glitch accidental mistake intentional decision publisher higher ups release state hope forget tell guy title big price brand new title launched totally unacceptable forgotten fan community preordered bought close launch version bought currently running v1 1 2 recommend sale spec tested window 11 22h2 ryzen 5 5600x rtx 3060 driver 537 13 32gb ram ddr4 download 75gb soon launch automatically building shaders mean instantly max cpu shaders dlc built spec took 20 minute finish cpu maxed 70 c experienced shutdown high cpu temperature concern power plan disable turbo boost amd system highly recommend waiting shaders fully build display graphic setting quick google search last pc optimal setting website detailed explanation test guide website called exputer small tweak setting impact visuals big impact performance setting visuals look great performance optimal hour ran average 80 fps dl balanced vsync experienced major stutter graphical glitch average total hardware utilisation cpu 60 vram 8gb ram 16gb scene lighter heavier consider smooth playable happen exact spec driver recommend sale guaranteed major problem great performance recent complaint invalid system clearly problem regardless recommended spec certainly fault rather fault recommend buying checking known issue hardware thing taken consideration recommend due performance issue finishing additional information performance smooth towards section frame rate dropped low 40 section frame rate low 30 section smooth mentioned early froze resulted restart experienced new major issue,3,0.9661

1888930,The Last of Us™ Part I,"**DISCLAIMER** The Crash Of Us 2023
I would recommend this game but only under a specific set of circumstances. If you have system settings that are the same, or less than mine PLEASE consider not purchasing this title until they have actually optimized this game for PC. As of right now it is a VERY unoptimized port of this game and is VERY graphically intensive. 

So after beating the game 1 1/2 times I believe I can finally make a review. The huge negative to this game is the system requirements to run it. The game is NOT optimized correctly. I have a pretty decent PC and at times struggled to keep even 30 FPS on medium to high settings. Although in many places I did get between 40-60 FPS
System:
GTX 2080 Super
Intel I9-9700K
1TB SSD
32 GB RAM
1920X1080 monitor (Resolution makes a huge difference)

That being said, if you do get the game PLEASE allow the game to complete it's compilation of shaders at the main menu before you start playing the game. If you do not allow the game to complete ""compiling shaders"" at the main menu, the game *will* crash and have HUGE visual errors. It took nearly 3 hours for me to compile shaders at the main menu, even with my PC. Mind you, this would be past the point of allowing a refund if for some reason I wanted to return the game so you are warned, once you buy it you basically cant try it out and return it. 

That being said, TLOU is a fantastic story driven shooter, stealth, looter, and horror game. I had patiently waited 10 years for this game to come to PC and was extremely happy when it finally released. The game-play and world building is vast, and terrifying in many regards. The melee combat is the most satisfying experience I've had since playing Mad Max and I LOVED the melee combat in that game. Progression is well paced *AND* once you beat the game you can start a New Game+ which allows you to keep all of your inventory and start the campaign over again which is super bad ass, I had no idea that'd be a thing. The shooting, crafting, and looting in this game are also fantastic and feel very rewarding. I often found myself double, triple, and quadruple checking everything and *STILL* missed many collectibles and one locked room on my game. 

I slugged through the visual errors, long loading times, frame dumps, and many, many crashes while playing the game. The game actually starting crashing significantly more during my New Game+ for some reason, as I had literally no crashes during the entirety of the main game after allowing it to compile shaders. So you are now warned. If your PC can handle the game it is worth it, just expect some issues, or do not purchase it.

The Last Of Us has always been one of my favourite games, if not my most favourite game for many years, but after purchasing the game for the third time (PS3, PS4, PC) I can honestly say, for the first time with this franchise, I am disheartened to play again, and I feel like I've been let down. 

Keeping in mind how long players have been waiting for the crossover from the Playstation to the PC, and the amount of hype and support that this game has received over the years, I am shocked that the fans have been mistreated so much with this port. The price (although I payed in a heartbeat), the load times, the performance (or lack thereof), all of it, was just disappointing to see. 

If you can somehow extend your own life by 50 years through devil worship or blood magic, you might make it long enough to see the installation of the shaders, and if you can resist the urge to touch your mouse, keyboard, or controller and let the frames settle in game, you might see just how beautiful this port looks... however, if you even sneeze in the wrong direction whilst playing this or somewhere in the vicinity of whoever is, I'm afraid you'll be looking at a slideshow of blurred, eye-watering, gut-wrenching horrors, and that's before you get to see any of the infected. 

I'm eagerly awaiting the day that this game is fixed, or I die.

1888930,The Last of Us™ Part I,"Edit after August 23rd patch. Seeing far less stutters with my 7900xt and 5800x3d combo. They seem to only occur during transitions from one level to another. It's finally decent after ""only"" 5 months following its release. There are still some areas of the game that are oddly taxing. At native 4k I'm sitting around 70 for the most part on ultra, so it seems decently optimized now finally. Great! Now that I've already played through it all...cool. The controls are a bit wonky. In the stealth slow walk mode you'll still be heard by certain infected therefore kinda negating the point of using it. If you hold forward while vaulting near an enemy you'll be heard but if you let off the key and the exact same vaulting animation plays you won't be heard, dumb stuff like that. Hated the crafting/weapon menu system on mouse and keyboard. I recommend it if its on sale, for 40 would be reasonable.

Old review before August 23rd patch. 

It's barely what I'd call playable now. It's plagued with shader compilation stutters even on a 20GB 7900xt. Looking down a hallway at a section of the game that's entirely indoors shouldn't use 14GB of VRAM. No excuses. The game looks gorgeous when it's not stuttering all over the place. Also had a weird sound bug that would cause distorted audio since my windows audio was set to 44.1 instead of 48Khz. Garbage port turned barely serviceable, but with a game of this reputation and caliber it should have received the best development possible. Just play it on ps5 or the ps4 remastered version, or wait another 6 months and have a high tier graphics card to barely hit 60 without FSR.",august 23rd patch seeing far stutter 7900xt 5800x3d combo occur transition finally decent 5 month following release area oddly taxing native 4k sitting 70 ultra decently optimized finally great already cool control bit wonky stealth slow walk mode heard certain infected kinda negating hold forward vaulting near enemy heard key exact vaulting animation play heard dumb stuff hated crafting weapon menu mouse keyboard recommend sale 40 reasonable old august 23rd patch barely call playable plagued shader compilation stutter 20gb 7900xt hallway section entirely indoors 14gb vram excuse look gorgeous stuttering weird sound bug cause distorted audio window audio set 44 1 48khz garbage port turned barely serviceable reputation caliber received best development possible ps5 ps4 remastered version wait 6 month high tier graphic card barely 60 fsr,1,-0.128

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Been here since day 1, and I am someone who came from the PS4 version of the game. This has been quite the journey from its horrendous launch to where we are today. Ever since launch I have enjoyed the game, though I do acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable how this game launched, and no video game should launch how Cyberpunk 2077 did. I'd say that this game has been ""playable"" since its 1.3 updates, but it wasn't in a state where I could fully recommended this game to others due to it still being in a worst state than early day Skyrim or the likes. Now here we are, the 1.5 relaunch update has brought us the ""next gen"" update to the game. Whatever you want to actually call this update, it brings the soft overhaul to the game in terms of stability and actual feature and mechanics rebalance to make the game far better in its design, and thus making it feel better to play, along with its far improved stability. The game is now at a state where I could fully recommend it.

The game is still far from being perfect, as certain play styles far outclass other play styles in terms of combat, especially melee combat, as its still pretty stiff and a bit of a button masher at times. Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really. 

There is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.

I really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now.",1 someone ps4 version journey horrendous launch today launch enjoyed acknowledge completely unacceptable launched video launch cyberpunk 2077 playable 1 3 update state fully recommended others due worst state early skyrim like 1 5 relaunch brought next gen whatever call brings soft overhaul term stability actual mechanic rebalance far design along far improved stability state fully recommend far perfect certain style far outclass style term combat especially melee combat pretty stiff bit button masher time content feel weirdly distributed map area far dense term content others complaint nitpicking character genuine role combat stealth area feel good great mechanically execution traversing world chore given different vehicle type large number fast travel location general movement speed ground thanks terrible stamen along basic parkour access decent variation quest mix combat detective stealth retrieval multiple style depending skill tree spec change approach stealthy gun blazing fist swingin allows driving alright 1 5 incredible feel control 1 5 given new type driving option large variety car motorbike obtain good option good good selection vehicle campaign genuinely far perfect fun unsure jumping coming highly recommend fun far acceptable state,1,0.9804

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"I remember hearing about Cyberpunk 2077 around when it was announced. I was interested because I could tell that it would be a tough game to run - performance wise, and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Then when it came out... It was everywhere, and everyone said it sucked. It was a broken mess of a game that wasn't even finished, so I vowed to myself that I would never buy such a hunk of garbage. 

2 years later... 
I'm bored, it's a Saturday. I'm on Netflix wondering what to watch; I had watched A Silent Voice & Breaking Bad a few days earlier, they were both great in their own ways. Then, on the main screen of Netflix I see: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. I think to myself, oh it's going to just be an advertisement by one of my favorite animation studios (Studio Trigger) that got paid to make this. I was wrong, the story swept me in like a storm and I was 200% engaged in all 10 episodes. 

1 day later...
I can't stop thinking about that show, the characters, and even more that was in it. I look on YouTube to people playing some Cyberpunk 2077. ""It looks decent and actually pretty fun now,"" I said to myself. I saw on YouTube that you could get Rebecca's shotgun, David's jacket, etc. in Cyberpunk 2077 and I thought that was dope. I want this game now.

2 days later...
I see everywhere how the player count has increased to 50,000 concurrent players on Steam; just crazy, and the game was on sale at the time, right after patch/update 1.6, so at 10:15 P.M. I bought the game and sold some Counter Strike cases to pay for tax. I let it download and got on the game after I was done with everything I had to do the next day. 

Present day... 
This game is insane, I love everything about it, the details put into the game, and the constant care that CD Projekt Red has given it after the game's launch up to today & onward. They fixed their game, and made a true piece of art. I've played a lot of story-driven games in my day, but none come close to the absolute experience that this game has given me: emotionally, mentally, etc. I love this game and trust me when I say that the game is fixed now & it is my favorite game of 2022 so far. (even though it came out in 2020, patch 1.5 - 1.6 has made it a new game with all of the features and bug fixes that they've added) Also, they got over 105,000 concurrent players just a day and a half later!

Some thoughts:
This game has too much to do other than the main story and (at the time of writing this...) I've sunk almost 40 hours into it already after only 7 days. It is an open-world experience to level the fun and quality of games like: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto: V, and much more. This game is amazing and I 100% recommend buying it. 

P.S.
Also watch the anime, even if you don't like anime that much, but you like this game...

I crashed like twice but didn't have a problem after I got the new game ready drivers. I'm literally making this review as a reminder. Had a blast so far but jesus guys, update your nvidia drivers.

ULTRA EDIT:
[h1]A Flawed but Fun Experience[/h1]

I might as well actually review this game in its current state considering the attention this got, while I have not finished it I feel I have experienced enough of the core mechanics to formulate an accurate opinion at least on the gameplay. 

It is a Witcher 3 reskin with a cyberpunk setting, considering that Witcher 3 was amazing (and I still have yet to get through it entirely) it does translate. Narratively this game excels, the dialogue is well written and acted and the characters are hard to not fall in love with. Walking around the world is exhilarating although unengaging, it is lacking interactivity. That being said the gameplay itself is a lot of fun. The guns pack a huge punch, very satisfying to use. The melee with katanas specifically is fun but broken, I did a body and reflex melee build and was able to behead TONS of foes before they even had time to react. The game is unfortunately plagued with bugs, less severe bugs especially after the recent hotfix but there are a myriad of small immersion raping bugs that pop up here and there Bethesda style. 

Ultimately I invest in player agency/good writing and fun gameplay at the end of the day, the graphics are important but less so. The decision-making of Witcher is here and that's really what I like the most HOWEVER this game was clearly not ready and considering recent events with the dev I will be hard pressed to trust them again. This is an incredibly bad launch. 

All of that being said, if you're the type that is a fan of Deus Ex, Dishonored, or Fallout: New Vegas you will love this game warts and all just for the godlike quest design those and this game offer. Plenty of skill check dialogue to be found. Suffice to say that I have had a good amount of ""That actually worked?!?"" moments so far which is a really hard feeling to nail down with games like this, you usually only get that out of CRPGs like Age of Decadence or Divinity, etc. At the same time I do not judge anyone that refunds this game or waits for a more stable version to come out because CD PROJEKT RED really dropped the ball and should not have released the game in this state. 

In conclusion, this game is mostly what I expected it to be and it is a shame that people expected this game to be the second coming of Jesus. I was banking on the decision making and quest design and this game delivers on those fronts. Everything else though, it does fail here and there but, in my opinion, not enough to make the game genuinely bad. If I had to give it a score out of ten it would be a solid 8/10. Hopefully CD PROJEKT RED can iron out all of these problems in a timely manner and elevate its standing.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"This game is an interesting one to review, given the conversation around it. As someone who played it two years after release, here are my thoughts on what the game is like in its current state, without any hype or rage attached to it. In short: I was pleasantly surprised. Like, a lot.

I picked this game up for cheap with low expectations. I expected something flawed but fun in a mindless way like Far Cry but I couldn't have been any more wrong. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game made with genuine love and care, with impressive attention to detail. The game was much more immersive and RPG-like than I thought it'd be, and the characters and story were top-notch. It reminded me a lot of Deus Ex and Fallout: New Vegas.

I think this game deserves special praise for being a AAA open world with zero padding. That is, you can ignore all of the side content and railroad through the main quest and finish the game in 10 hours if you really want to. The side quests are also extremely good though, and I was drawn to doing them solely because I found the characters and world fascinating. I think Night City deserves praise as an open world that feels hand-crafted and intrinsically interesting; nothing in it felt like mindless copied-and-pasted content to me.

Of course, your mileage may vary. This game is not GTA or The Elder Scrolls, and I think a lot of the disappointment that people have with this game even now comes from this fact. The driving isn't great, the pedestrian AI is basic, and you can't go into every single building. But I think that's fine. The game is a story-focused RPG and Night City is just there as the pretty backdrop in between missions. The real meat of this game is the narrative and characters.

For years I'd been hearing about how CDPR didn't ""deliver on their promises"" but after playing through the whole thing, I can't really say I feel that way. I had a blast and my only true gripe with the game is that it's unfortunately still riddled with bugs. You won't encounter anything game-breaking, but it is worth mentioning, so keep that in mind. Regardless of that though, I was still pleasantly surprised, and this is probably my favorite game I played this year.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"I know what you're thinking. Like me, you probably see this on a sale, and think it's gone down in price, it was a hot topic a while ago, and maybe you should take advantage of the opportunity that you see before you and pick it up while you have the chance. It's been out for a while, and they've probably cleared out most of the bugs by now, and it's *probably* a pretty good game at this point. 

It is. Kind of. You'll probably be able to make it through the main story, and a few of the most important side quests relatively bug free. The story is great. I think it's partially worth it on story alone. But because of that, you'll be longing for more. You'll keep seeing it in your steam library a month or two later, and feel guilty that you haven't picked it back up again. But you'll know that as soon as you do, you will continually be disappointed.

It feels unfinished outside of the main story. There's content there, but it gets repetitive really quickly. There are tons of opportunities to buy new vehicles, and do more side gigs. But half of the time spent playing the game outside of the main story arc is spent searching through articles and forum posts about how to get an event to trigger that you missed, or to hack your way around an issue here or there. Mission events that are totally out of your control like waiting for a phone call just don't happen. And the worst part is, yes, you can get it to work. You can *technically* play everything that exists in the game in its current state. But eventually the workarounds will become too cumbersome. You'll let it sit on your recently played list for a while, until the next sale, when you can replace it with something better.

[i]I am writing this review on November 22nd, 2021 after the 1.31 patch[/i]

This game didn't have a good start, did it? But for the biggest part, it's all fixed now. 
There are still some bugs, but in most cases they are just visual.
To be honest they are quite ridiculously funny. Imagine driving alongside a character and then you witness the character start spinning to 360 degrees its limbs around like it was possessed by some demon.
In a way CP2077 became family for me, you know? You somewhat hate some of your relatives but you still love them in another way, right? Well that's CP2077 for me.
[i]What do we know? CP2077 is just too ahead of it's time, in the future when we will have implants real life, the entire world will be buggy and glitchy. This game is just immersive![/i]


It took me some few good hours to learn to love the game, and i would say, i am very happy i didn't give up on it.

[b]For the sake of not wasting much of your time with this review i will start with the bad[/b]

As i said above, as far as bugs go, it's pretty stable and i didn't really encounter anything that was major.
Obviously, people are different so this is purely my opinion, but i don't like how the car driving feels in this game, it feels too.. stiff and unnatural, it might be just me because i am used to old-school car driving, let's say GTA 3/NFS (anything before NFS 5 - Porsche). 
Driving a bike on the other hand is amazing, it's what i use most of the times.

- Another thing that is somewhat annoying, the waypointing system is somewhat bad, the routes you get aren't the most efficient ones, and often your objective isn't appearing on the 'floor' it really is, so you end up searching for something and then realize it might be in some hidden basement or something.
- The UI seems to be a bit cluttered and confusing and it takes a bit to get used to, or maybe i am just getting old, but i feel like there's no point in over-complicating things.
- The overall mechanics or however you want to call them feel somewhat mediocre, but it's fine by me, the game compensates with other stuff.
- You cannot edit your facial/body features/tattoos. Once you press that goddamn button. That's how you'll be stuck for life. 

One more thing, and this probably was my biggest 'oof' about the game was that the assault rifles are pretty awful.
Pistols? Good! Revolvers? Great! Sniper Rifles and Melee Weapons? Amazing!, but the assault rifles are just bad and inefficient. Even shotguns are decent. 

[b]But what about the good parts?[/b]

While this section might have less of these bulletpoints, they're the pillar of this game, the ultimate moneyshot.

The world is so big you will feel like frog in the Ural mountains, you will feel so small.It's quite an interesting feeling that i could never get from any game before, for me this thing made the game so much more immersive.
It's a beautiful game with purely astonishing views, amazing world details and such, but the size of it all, too. 
So many streets, alleys, not to mention if you go climbing like a goat on all the buildings.  
In my opinion, if you're into walking simulators, this alone could be worth your eddies (i.e. money).

The story is more than decent, it avoids some of the most boring cliches, although, it's not anything mindblowing.
Friendships and relationships come and go in odd ways, depending on how you make your decisions, i think it's pretty rare to actually feel like your decisions really affect people in games. To feel like you're actually influence someone real.
Often when i had to make decisions i was encountering dillemas such as 'Hm, c'mon, this dude is a decent fella, i shouldn't be a dick to him', and well, i usually don't overthink that kind of stuff in a game, lol.

The game is a modder's paradise if you're into that, the internet is full of tutorials and content, they aren't very finicky to install, however, updates usually tend to mess with them.

Did i mention side gigs? There's plenty of them, but also random events happening around as you walk, such as groups of gang members commiting dumb stuff. Obviously you can go past them, but would you? After this game will suck you in, you won't be able to stop sinking hours in it.
While we're on this subject, my advice would be to not rush into the story (I kinda did and i am not very happy about it), and enjoy some of these side stuff first, besides leveling up and getting cool stuff which will aid you in the main missions later, it's also the best way to get to know the game.

There's so many references and easter eggs, some subtle, some not so subtle, especially if you're from Eastern Europe.

You can play the game any way you want. You can go the boring route, non-lethal and stealthy, or you can go in guns blazing, and not leave one single cell in an enemy's body alive. Of course, a combination between all of these options is also a possibility, but i like to keep it simple.
I do wish it was more fun to play in stealth. While i usually am not the stealthy kind of gamer, i can and do appreciate a game with good stealth. CP2077 doesn't have a good nor bad stealth, it's just.. average, i guess?
(With this, i mean purely by how it feels for me to play it in stealth. You do get to be very creative in stealth, you have interesting ways to mess with the enemies and distract them, but the 'satisfaction' just isn't there for me)

Ultimately, it's a game that will suck you in, you will have fun for hours, the world is purely amazing, you'll feel like 'Woah' all the time. 

[b]Closing notes and random useless blabbering[/b]

I initially bought this game on pre-order, i was angry about the delays, before i got the chance to play it at the release, my PC died. Now after 1 year i finally get to play it (I know it's better that i didn't play it at launch, but it's about the principle).
I am happy with my purchase, and for the price i paid (one night out in the city [spoiler]I might have an alcohol problem though[/spoiler]), i had and still have a lot of fun, even if i already saw 2 endings, i am not letting my grip of it, i don't even remember when i was so caught in a game that i played it without a break until the sun was rising.
Probably i will go for full completion. 60h in this game passed so fast, and there's still plenty of juice in this baby.

As far as the developers go... I know they got a lot of poo thrown at them, but they're people and they make mistakes, and they weren't lazy. I would say things went wrong because of the team leading/resource management, but that's another subject and quite irrelevant. 
Point is.. their hearts are in the right place, and they fixed a majority of issues, and they still are working on the game.
Maybe i am being too soft about the situation, but it is what it is, i can't say i am not disappointed because it's not how i expected the game to be after how it was marketed pre-release, but i also like to believe i have some common sense and ability to make the best out of situations.

Edit:
After putting around 150h in this game, i must say, there were few more bugs i encountered, but nothing major, except, i once fell through the map and the game reloaded from the last checkpoint.

At the time of writing this review, i've done a 100% corpo playthrough on very hard as well as a melee run on normal sprinting thru to obtain the secret ending.

I experienced minimal graphical bugs while playing. I did not experience any bugs that disrupted my game experience any more than having to reload my game and one instance i will mention below.

Pros:

True evolution of the bread crumb story system. Those familiar with the concept of save scumming will be happy to know that an extra 20-30 hours or multiple unique playthroughs can be squeezed out just by simply trying all of the text options or trying a different combat approach. Different combat and pacifist approaches can lead to entire new quest chains or missed opportunities. Without going into too much detail, multiple friends and I have had majorly different outcomes playing the same class in the same style/build as well as found tertiary outcomes in subsequent playthroughs. Can't stress how good this aspect is enough.

Side content for days. While the main story itself is only 15-20 hours, the side content is easily double if not triple that. Between cyberpsychos/gigs/police/side kick story quests/flavor text quests it can actually be quite overwhelming when you begin the game. For the full experience I highly recommend completing all of the sidekick story quests as they give the opportunity to experience the most endings as well as inject the most girth into the primary story. Easily the highlight of the game. This is obvious when comparing my two playthroughs, in the 100% one I had a complete feeling of understanding. the directions things were going were carried by these side quests, all of the motivations and history are there. In my rushed playthrough, it simply felt like a series of conversations with johnny silverhand and taking turns swapping bodies. completely different experiences. I just felt like I was rushing around doing errands for johnny by pushing only the main story.

Night City. It's the best city video games have blessed us with to date. Yes, despite the ""crowd AI'' not being amazing. Yes, despite there not being ""1k+ routines."" Yes, I played RDR2 and GTAV and yada yada yada. Night City is alive and you can hear it breathing. This is amplified 10x when you acquire the double jump or rocket jump legs. The verticality they promised was delivered in spades. EVERYTHING is climbable. Give it a shot. Look around.

Endings. 6 of them bitches. SIX. 1 is hilarious (in a morbid way). 1 was the appropriate ending(IMO). 1 was out of a shitty AAA blockbuster movie. 1 is what gamers want. 1 is trippy. 1 is sad.

Make a save at the point of no return and give em all a shot. They're worth it.

Cons:

Loot. If you played Witcher 3, it's the same song and dance. Massive amounts of useless scaled loot where everywhere you look you see slight 1% dps upgrades to already existing items. Add onto that you have a weight/stash system and it just becomes a chore by the end game. If you are a packrat like me, invest into the body perk for 60 extra carrying capacity for peace of mind. The exception to this con are the ""iconic weapons'' that are unlocked after completing certain criteria. Unique and useful, I found ""skippy"" to be the best weapon in the entire game. Look out for him and the other icons :)

Lifepaths. Thankfully on my first playthrough I chose corpo. I feel like I had ample chat options that really fell into line with the core story path and made me feel initially that lifepaths weren't as bad as people made them out to be. After experiencing nomad and corpo both to completion I can say that this section really does feel unfinished. There needs to be more content before coming into night city as a nomad and building up the relationship with jackie in the prologue. Again, rushed. Sad. One of my most anticipated features.

AI. This is as of the day 1 version of the game. The combat AI is.....bad. It is only saved by the fact that you can use guns and snipe people from the shadows from a distance. After having played a full melee and ranged playthrough, melee is in a rough spot. Don't take this to mean that melee is more difficult, it simply means that the AI is so bad that they clump up and spin in circles or glitch through walls to 1 shot you with a shotgun and you will end up getting gangbanged every time. Cop AI is....missing. If you commit a crime and get 4 stars just let them kill you or drive away far enough, they will simply give up. There are no correction routines for driving AI. Simply park your car on the road to create an infinite traffic jam.No crash reactions. No crash animations. You can hit a wall at 200 mph and be fine. They make no attempts to course correct or avoid collision, same with the crowd AI. If you double jump in public people will just...huddle near you..scared for their life? Again, AI feels missing.

Limited romance options. For all the controversy and hype this topic got it ended up so god damn bland. I know its a weird thing to complain about but I can walk around and see vulgarity at every corner and you're telling me theres no brain dance station to plug into?  there's 1 brothel in all of night city? only 2 joytoys? Again I understand how minor this is. Just confusing. Most of the primary romance options in this game only ""swing"" one way, based on the ""gender"" you chose at the beginning of the game. So if you went in with ideas of who you wanted to fuck, you may be very dissapointed (if you care at all.)

Braindance sequences in the primary story. Thought they were too specific with requiring you to wait for chat dialogue to finish. rewind/fast forward is too slow and not snappy to your inputs. you can end up just looking around aimlessly looking for 1 piece to scan at a specific timestamp. Not very interesting overall and I believe they could have been better served as a cutscene. Overall boring.
I had one graphical bug that came at a very unfortunate moment during the prologue. A pistol went thru a key members head during a pivotal scene and really ruined the mood. This was the only instance of immersion breaking i experienced from bugs other than typical day 1 shenanigans.

No Mini-games. Not even gwent? cmon.

Conclusion:

Without going into story specific details, this is one of the most enjoyable RPGs i've played in my life. The amount of variables you have to play with in the beautiful world of night city is actually crazy. When I read reviewers saying that they hated johnny silverhand because he was an asshole or that they didnt really understand the story and that it all felt rushed, I feel bad. Or I read on reddit that the game was too buggy to enjoy and there were too many dropped/cut features to be a ""good game"", I feel bad. We played different games. I got an 80-100 hour open world RPG set in a cyberpunk universe with characters that had personality, a story that had me wondering about the possibilities so much that I immediately started a second playthrough. A city that was handcrafted top to bottom with views so nice I was constantly snapshotting and posting them on discord. A soundtrack that had me wanting to sit in cars to finish tracks. I got a game that I am disappointed having finished.

Waitin to slurp up that DLC.

- Police appear out of nowhere.
- Police are amazingly easy to escape. You can walk a block away and lose them.
- Civilian NPC's appear and disappear when you're not looking.
- The A.I. is alot my artificial then intelligent. The only reaction they ever have is to duck or completely disappear in thin air. 
- The A.I. is basically on rails; they will not drive or walk around anything you put in front of them, they'll just stop and sit there for eternity.
- The world doesn't actually feel alive (no random encounters). NPC enemies spawn in the exact same place every single time without fail.
- Bars and food are exactly the same vendor with a different coat of paint. No matter where you go you can't sit down and eat something, or sit and enjoy a virtual drink (unless it's a talking-scene tied to a quest).
- You can't interact with shop keepers beyond buying something or receiving maybe two lines of chit-chat. You can't rob them. You can't kill them. You can't get quests from them. They won't even react if you lob a grenade at them.
- The ""car chases"" are on rails and there's only 3-4 prescripted car chases in the game.
- Only 2% of ""choices"" your character makes in dialogue has any effect on the story. The rest are just alternate dialogue to give the appearance of choice and replayability. 
- Character starting paths (Street kid, Nomad, Corpo) have little to no affect beyond the first 20 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changes.
- Player characters have no reflection unless you use the specific mirror located in your apartment. 
- You can't alter the look of your character after the initial character creation. Not even a haircut.
- Can't customize your apartment in any way, shape, or form.
- There's almost no reason to ever go back to your apartment after being there the first time.
- Vehicles can't be customized; no new paints, liveries, or body-pieces.
- There are 4 mini-games total: Hacking, shooting-range, boxing, and car racing. There are only two shooting-range quests, only 6 boxing matches, and only 4 races. That's it as far as mini-games go.

I don't want to cause static, but did those gonk corpos push the release of the game before it was ready? Yeah, probably. Did they want our scratch? Yeah, definitely. Did they flatline the game? Almost. If it wasn't for the love and dedication of the developers of CD PROJEKT RED (and yeah, they might be corpos), then the vidiot would definitely be zeroed.

There were a lot of kickers who had issues upon release that stirred up a lot of heat. And yeah, there were some issues, but when you can just hide behind a handle and spam away on the net without a care in the world, the complaints stacked up and didn't give the vidiot its due justice. When you want to create the best, there is some gonks out there who will tear you down.

Sure, there were a few netrunners too who threatened the corpos, but little good that did them. Didn't slow down the developers. They kept pouring time and energy into the game. Fixin' it up and making it flash.

The developers broke their corpo leash and kept giving to us. Listening to the us chooms instead of those NetNerds who squat their mom's basements. That is why I nominated Cyberpunk 2077 for the Labor of Love in the 2022 Steam Awards. The developers care. A lot. And they continue to prove it by releasing new content, fixes, and polishin' the vidiot like a diamond.

2073850,THE FINALS,"[h2] ""Ok! I'm stealing the cashou----wooahhhhhhh the building's going down!"" [/h2]

While not something I would usually go for, THE FINALS has left an impression. 

I initially overlooked it as just another F2P that will die in a couple months (which it could) with silly cosmetics and an overall aesthetic that makes no sense. However, devoid of any good PvP shooters in life since COD2 and CS 1.6 (I'm trying to get into 2 ok) and occasional flirts with other COD games, and Battlefield, etc. I gave it a second look...

Something about the collasping casinos, explosions, coins everywhere, and the sheer destructive over the top tone of it as well as a bit of homage to Squid Games (a series I enjoyed) I thought -- eh, what the heck -- and started installing.

Now I'm glad I've had my brother and cousin to play with as being a party of 3 has shown me how fun the co-op, competitive experience can be. So, with some hours solo and some in party I do enjoy the tight team tactics a lot more than throwing my lot in with randoms and giving it a go; however there have been some fun surprises a long the way.

First, the game is pretty fast and I like that. Lots of opportunity for mobility in the form of jumps, dashes, grappling hooks, and pads that shoot you into the sky. There are ziplines and ladders everywhere. The maps are a parkour free for all and that adds a fun layer to things for sure. 

But where it all comes alive is in the destructiveness around the game. With all that mobility and speed it's amazing how, despite some balancing issues, there can be so many creative and fun counters. Blow up buildings, re-engineering the battlefield to flavor close quarter combat or ranged flanks, building a nest of rubble perfect for your mines and grenades to funnel into and vaporise your foes in a shower of golden coins...

Anyways, I got lightly hooked and am having a lot of fun. You just play: there's a good pace to the rounds, it can get silly and explosive, or extremely sweaty and tactical, it all depends on your mode and mix of parties. 

Physics are pretty awesome with lots of little surprises like mines colliding in mid air and sticking together, throwing knives whipping past you and burying themselves in the cashbox you're holding, cranes toppling, bridges disintegrating around you, and more to be discovered no doubt. Needless to say, it's achieved that easy to learn (kill, get money, win) but difficult to master (many, many 'mechanics' that can be utilised for success) learning curve.

I'll most likely never be some Diamond ranked master but the cool thing is, I don't mind at all. There's fun to be had! 

We'll see how it goes, but I'm also appreciating that it's pretty simple in terms of: you play and unlock your gadgets and guns and the only microtransactions are the clothing and stuff that have no impact on gameplay; they keep it pretty clean and separated. 

All in all, whatever happens with THE FINALS, it is fun and I hope developers interested in competitive and PvP style shooters can take the good stuff and learn from it and run with it and bring us some renewal in the genre.

Thanks for reading and hope you have an awesome day!

2073850,THE FINALS,"I have played the beta, and am now playing for the release.  But all together, I wish their was more modes and that you could earn more rewards or atleast could spend VRs to get a crate or something to get cosmetics but with the lack of modes and stuff to earn.  One thing that has kept me busy is going for achievements.  I'm at 30 and will be at 40 within a few days.  

But the gameplay has something for everyone atleast.  You can go and support your team as if your a pocket mercy and just heal and use gadgets for damage or even try to be a ninja and use cloak or dash and the sword.  But the 1 thing that I feel like really makes the gameplay good for everyone is how it challenges people.  Not every fight is good or skillful, your able to get rocket launchered, die to a guy sniping from far away baiting people, you can be shot in the back by 3 guys and not be able to do anything.  But I wen't from wiffing and dying to being able to get kills with every class and win 1v3's and hold cashouts solo.  

To me the best games are the ones that can include stuff for everyone, has stuff to earn, and that can challenge you.  To me this game has plenty of options of classes weapons to fight with and a lot of challenging and good fights and matches.  I believe that more cosmetics and items to earn will come in the future so I have hope for the game and will keep playing it through.

2073850,THE FINALS,"[h1][b]A Team-Based Shooter with Non-Stop Destruction…[/b][/h1]
» If there’s one genre that lends itself to boom or bust, it's the online shooter. For every success like Call of Duty, Halo, or Apex Legends, it seems like there are at least a dozen other games that have come and gone with barely a spark before they fizzle. With so many good competitive shooters in play, what makes one stand out? After dozens of hours, I’m beginning to see how [b]The Finals[/b] answers those questions: with an excellent gameshow-infused style and a brilliantly destructible playground.

[h1]Gamemodes[/h1]
» There are currently two main modes: the first, Quick Cash, has each team vying to collect a vault of coins and deposit it at a designated spot on the map, which tends to result in the bloody convergence of all three squads at those points. This effectively keeps the action going, and because taking over the deposit doesn’t reset its progress, rounds move steadily and avoid momentum-killing stalemates altogether.

Meanwhile, the Bank It mode focuses a bit more on direct PvP battles, but they also tend to be more scattered. Here, each player carries coins in their virtual pockets, all of which is gathered either from vaults around the map or by eliminating enemies. The on-the-fly strategizing of going for kills one second and then needing to deposit your loot before it all goes to waste the next is exciting, and it’s pretty fun to eliminate someone right in front of the bank so you can deposit all their coins yourself.

Individually, both modes are well-designed and generally very fun. The fact that The Finals is limited to just those two options, however, is a red flag. If the player base starts to grow tired of these game types and there aren’t any other options, there is a real possibility of people moving on before too long. While I didn’t find that to be an issue during my time playing, that does present a potential concern for the long-term health of this community that I hope is addressed with new modes in future updates.

Once you’ve played a few matches you’ll unlock tournaments, and this is where the competitive attitude of The Finals really shines. The primary tournament mode puts you and seven other teams in a bracket playing modified versions of Cashout. Two games of four teams each run simultaneously, with the top two squads from each game advancing to the second round. The top two teams from that game then face off in a direct 3v3 match to determine the overall winner. It does a great job mixing the high-stakes nature of actual competition with rounds that are fast and satisfying enough to elicit that “just one more game” feeling after each tournament. There’s a ranked version, where players can move up in leagues based on their performance.

[h1]Builds and Equipment[/h1]
» You can choose from three different weight classes for your character, and they all play very differently from each other. The Light build, for example, focuses on mobility, trading stopping power for a grappling hook to quickly get to high or far places. The Medium, meanwhile, is an all-rounder and has abilities that focus on support, such as its healing beam. Finally, there’s the Heavy, which could have been taken straight from Rainbow Six: Siege, as it alternates between controlling the battlefield with heavy weapons and smashing through walls like the Juggernaut.

There’s a solid variety of equipment for you to choose from before each match, and they can have a major impact on the battlefield if used properly. There are standard choices, like frag grenades and deployable cover, and those are tried and true options that do what you’d expect – but they hardly stand out when you can instead drop jump pads that launch you high into the air, or goo grenades that can seal large spaces with an expanding foam. Some options are universal, like the pyro grenades, while others are restricted to specific classes like the Medium builds’ defibrillator that instantly revives downed teammates.

[h1]Progression[/h1]
» Each character archetype also has a litany of cosmetics that can be unlocked through XP progression or by spending real-world money. There’s a pretty solid assortment to choose from right out of the gate, though the amount of time it takes to unlock good-looking items (without taking out your wallet) requires major retuning. After 20 hours, the best I could afford was some fanny packs and tights on one character, which makes getting the whole squad glammed up feel like a pipe dream.

That slow progression is also true of VRs, the in-game “cash” you earn for playing that’s used to unlock non-cosmetic things like different abilities, weapons, and gadgets. I get that there needs to be a balance between giving you everything too soon, which can take away the joy of progression, and making it take too long to earn things, but right now The Finals skews a bit too much towards the latter. It’s hard to experiment with builds when all the pieces for each character are locked behind dozens of hours of matches.

[h1]Destruction[/h1]
» The destructibility of each stage is the real star of The Finals. Sure, you can enter a room from the door or window. But taking the less obvious path of crashing right through the ceiling is a thrilling way to get the drop on unsuspecting teams, and you haven’t played The Finals until you’ve stolen the vault by blowing a hole in an upper floor and had it drop right in front of you. By the end of a tense match, the battlefield is often littered with debris from entire buildings beginning to collapse.

There’s a lot more to that system than some cool rubble and an ad hoc door, too, as the strategic impact is huge. One map is high atop skyscrapers connected by sky bridges, and I sat in stunned silence the first time I saw a team destroy the section where a bridge met a building, causing the entire thing to collapse to the ground below. Split-second judgment calls when buildings fall around you about whether to jump off or ride the debris down can make or break firefights and create unforgettable moments – like when my entire team was dead in the final seconds of a match, and the only thing that stopped another team from stealing the bank for the win was the amount of rubble they had to dig through to reach it.

[h1]Teamwork[/h1]
» There will always be an element of luck in the quality of teammates you are matched with, which is a big part of why The Finals (as with most team-based shooters) is better across the board with people you know. It’s so much fun to coordinate an assault with friends or to seize the bank and then protect it with mines and defensive structures. It’s also a huge advantage to work together. A flamethrower wielding Heavy supported by a healing beam from a Medium can wipe an entire team, and the strategic element of choosing complementary builds and kits is very engaging. When someone dies, they leave an action figure behind that can be used to revive them, and scooping one up so you can find a safe place to bring them back is as useful as it is hilarious.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
» The Finals does a great job standing out from the competitive shooter crowd thanks to its fast-paced action, excellent environmental destruction, and gameshow-meets-squad shooter vibes. The way flying through the battlefield with a grappling hook or hulk-smashing through buildings mixes with its strict, objective-based modes is a breath of fresh air. It’s a concern that there are only two of those modes total right now, and it definitely feels like both in-game balance and the overall reward economy need some adjustments. But those are small critiques relative to the outrageous fun and breathtaking spectacle of buildings crumbling around you.

2073850,THE FINALS,"[h1] The Finals [/h1]

[h2] Overview [/h2]
So its been a chaotic launch with some issues that are real issues and others that are literally fabricated by the community. Whether that be due to people spreading misinformation or just in general people not understanding. Below I will address the issues on launch and the misconceptions then we will finish off with the things I personally like about this release.

[h2] Movement [/h2]
Having played closed beta 2 and open beta myself running max FOV I can personally say absolutely nothing has changed since the betas at max FOV however having not tried the lower FOV settings (because why would I?) I cannot say that its an issue personally or a placebo effect however the developers have already addressed the issue in the discord and are actively investing the potential issue. However personally it boggles my mind why you wouldn't automatically set the FOV to max for situational awareness anyway.... (edit: this has been fixed it was due to the animations being affected by fov patch 1.30 fixed this)

[h2] Performance (Issues?) [/h2]
Even since the betas people have been complaining about performance issues I will try give you a quick overview on my system and how it handles this game so below are my specifications and settings.....

[h3] System specifications [/h3]
CPU: Ryzen 5 3600 (watercooled 120mm rad)
RAM: 32Gb of corsair platinum RGB DDR4 OC@2866 mhz
GPU: RTX 3060 ti LHR 8Gb (TDP limited to 96% Due to heat and not bringing any perf after 96%)
Game storage device used:WD 500 GB m.2 Drive running on SATA 6Gb

[h3] settings and achieved performance [/h3]
So I'm a sucker for frames like most people and understanding this is a modern title I decided to use everything on minimum settings, DLSS (performance), 1080p, Vsync off, ray tracing static/off and no AA. performance wise this consistently achieves 90-120fps which is to be expected on a mid tier build like mine on a modern title, especially when the graphics look this damn good at min settings. HOWEVER.... I have friends that have older/lower end hardware that may have not been looked into during the optimisation stages despite the min specification is a 1050 ti and sky-lake intel cpus I don't think it handles older hardware too well I think its mainly CPU based as my 3600 is pegged at 80-85% so please leave your feedback if you are running and older system in the comments on performance. alot of the performance complaints I've heard is from people with MUCH more powerful systems than mine that are aged by this point most of them think they can max new games on a 3080 ti and achieve over 100 fps is crazy to me lmao.... 

[h2] Beta Cosmetics and rank [/h2]
I really didn't want to address this because its just a bit silly really but some people believed that their rank and all items would transfer to the release despite the fact that when the beta was out (all 3) It clearly said ""permanent"" underneath the cosmetics you would retain their is literally a pinned message in the finals discord chat explaining what cosmetics you would retain (Given IF you unlocked them during beta). Rank wise ask yourself this... what beta have I played in the last 10 years that has retained my rank and unlock data? virtually NONE its just not the way things are done at all... in all my years of playing test versions of games I've only retained cosmetics and its usually a calling card that says beta or dog tag etc something small.

[h2] Random bans [/h2]
So day 1 had some false bans happening there are many theories as to why it happened and its really hard to put a specific pin on the donkeys butt so I am not even gunna give you my perspective on what could be happening there, the devs are working on it as fast as conceivable but if you are banned make a support ticket and I am sure they are happy to help out as soon as possible. (edit:this has now been fixed and everybody has been unbanned)

[h2] Conclusion and my perspective [/h2]
So there is alot to unpack... personally I LOVE this title with a passion and defos will sink alot of hours into it, it brings me back to the days when game studios had passion to make their games and where not rushed by money hungry publishers and investors yes its got a few hiccups here and there but you cannot judge at this stage especially with the state of some ""AAA"" titles made by multi billion £ companies nowadays give them some time to iron out the bugs and it will be near perfect FPS game. I don't need to remind you but battlefield 4 was abysmal at release.... i mean LEAPS and BOUNDS worse than its current state and its one of the most popular titles from the franchise THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO MADE THAT GAME they will manage and prevail especially without greedy money bags EA breathing down their necks...",final h2 overview h2 chaotic launch issue real issue others literally fabricated community due spreading misinformation general understanding address issue launch misconception finish thing personally release h2 movement h2 closed beta 2 open beta running max fov personally changed beta max fov tried lower fov setting issue personally placebo effect developer already addressed issue discord actively investing potential issue personally boggles mind automatically set fov max situational awareness anyway fixed due animation affected fov patch 1 30 fixed h2 performance issue h2 beta complaining performance issue quick overview handle specification setting h3 specification h3 cpu ryzen 5 3600 watercooled 120mm rad ram 32gb corsair platinum rgb ddr4 oc 2866 mhz gpu rtx 3060 ti lhr 8gb tdp limited 96 due heat bringing perf 96 storage device wd 500 gb 2 drive running sata 6gb h3 setting achieved performance h3 sucker frame understanding modern title decided minimum setting dl performance 1080p vsync ray tracing static aa performance wise consistently achieves 90 120fps expected mid tier build mine modern title especially graphic look damn good min setting friend older lower hardware looked optimisation stage despite min specification 1050 ti sky lake intel cpu handle older hardware mainly cpu based 3600 pegged 80 85 please leave feedback running older comment performance alot performance complaint heard powerful system mine aged max new game 3080 ti achieve 100 fps crazy lmao h2 beta cosmetic rank h2 address bit silly believed rank item transfer release despite beta 3 clearly permanent underneath cosmetic retain literally pinned message final discord chat explaining cosmetic retain given unlocked beta rank wise ask beta last 10 year retained rank unlock data virtually thing year test version game retained cosmetic usually calling card say beta dog tag small h2 random ban h2 1 false ban happening theory happened hard specific pin donkey butt gunna perspective happening working fast conceivable banned support ticket happy help soon possible fixed everybody unbanned h2 conclusion perspective h2 alot unpack personally love title passion defos sink alot hour brings day studio passion game rushed hungry publisher investor yes hiccup judge stage especially state aaa title multi billion company nowadays iron bug near perfect fps remind battlefield 4 abysmal release leap bound worse state popular title franchise manage prevail especially greedy bag ea breathing neck,0,0.8685

This was what I had been thinking all my time playing The Finals. While it feels so different from other online FPS games on the market, it achieves being actual fun at the same time. It's just like how Apex Legends re-invented the Battle Royale genre back in 2019. I don't remember having so much fun with an online shooter since Apex. So after almost 5 years, The Finals has been such a refreshing experience for me. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3112373064

My favorite thing about The Finals is the endless possibilities of how a match could unfold. Every situation can be tackled in an infinite number of ways using strategies and playstyles because the developers have designed every aspect of the game so well. There are crazy hidden mechanics, and the movement is very fluid. The game feel is amazing. Various traversal options for every character add to the feel as well. 

My only complaint about the game is that even though the overall game feel is great, the gun responsiveness of enemies is a bit weak. You don't feel much that you are shooting at a human. Some visual and sound effects on that would improve this. Graphically, it is the best online FPS game I have ever seen after Battlefront II.  6 years later no online multiplayer game has ever topped that graphic insanity. Yet the game has great optimization considering the game has limitless real-time explosions and I would say the servers are pretty good. The multiplayer aspect also works very well. Strategizing with your friends various options with different classes and equipment is a whole other level of fun. Maps are very well designed giving players many options to act from and they are all very different, all of which look breathtaking. 

Although some people mindlessly reviewed bombed it, it's nice to see that the game is receiving recognition. In an era where shitty games like Fortnite or Call of Duty are highly played, I'm glad someone still understands what quality games are. The game deserves to be supported for years and years, and I intend to keep playing it for a long time to come. There are many praises to be told about the game. But I really want to keep playing it with my friends. So I'll just wrap it up here. The Finals is an outstanding piece of work. I highly recommend it.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.

What I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.

First, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*
- What does this mean?
If you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.

Second, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different
- What does this mean?
There are two types of subscriptions. 
The first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.
The second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. 
There are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. 

Third, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character
- What does this mean?
Every character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.

Overall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out.",look good great trial probably heard word mouth good thing telling new player maybe important version expansion ffxiv square enix directly future expansion mean sale expansion participate go future expansion square frustrating wrong waste double check bought mogstation seeing version type subscription entry standard subscription different type subscription entry subscription 12 99 usd 30 day long get per sever total 8 character subscribing move standard subscription standard subscription starting 14 99 usd 8 charcters per sever total 40 standard subscription option purchase multiple month save long especially addition extra retainer fee completely optional form inventory management third wow class create swap class changing weapon meaning new class come class requires create new big draw swapping character real pain yes grinding involved class square wow reading name change race change cheaper remember wow name 10 usd fantasia completely makeover changing race gender nearly else save name 10 usd bought pack 3 5 save good thing top head help new reading hope fun trying,1,0.989

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"So I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hours.
Update: 06/22/2017 accumulated about 235 hours and I have payed a month of my Subscription :). I am reupdating this for the Summer Sale for people who want to try this game and also for the StormBlood DLC update. 
Updated 5.5:  09/06/2021 up to date with Shadowbringers

Positive:
-Completly Noob Friendly
-Tons of Content with two DLC's (Heavensward 60)>(Stormblood 70)>(Shadowbringers 80)
-Chocobo,Chocobo and Chocobo racing.
-The brilliant soundtrack is very unique and captivating.
-Multiple classes that this MMO is unique with is having 1 character and being able to switch classes
- The one major thing that also makes this unique, is that in FFXIV, there is no rush in this game. You can be what you want to be and you are not forced to do anything else.

Community:The community is amazing in certain perspectives that is actually more better than most MMO's. What makes this community so unique is just the cycle of players that are willing to help new players. Yes this is normal in all MMO's but in FFXIV we aren't forced to help new players but instead we choose to. That;s what makes this community so nice. Not all Communities are perfect or imperfect but the majority of this one is decently kind.

Heavily Story Reliant: Most MMO's always fail to captivate the player of the story in general. FFXIV is very unique in it's own standpoint that the developers actually put so much development and depth into this story that just makes you enjoy it . Also being that this is probably the longest story in all Final Fantasy Genres. This is probably the only MMO that can potentially make you cry just from the story. That is how good it is.

Dungeons/Trials/24 man raid/ Hardcore raids:

Dungeons: Pretty generic even in this MMO that there isn't really much to say about honestly. Maps are very unique in it's own sense even the mobs and bosses with their unique skills. Though each map will have it's soundtrack included.
Trials: Trials are Bosses that you will face during the Main story or a side quest. You will be with a party of 8 facing this trial. Every Trial is unique with it's own soundtrack. Though trials are not difficult, there are Trials:Extreme which increases the difficulties making it twice as hard.
Alliance raids: 24 man raids are pretty much 24 players clearing a dungeon with multiple bosses. It's not difficult but you will die a lot. These 24 man raids also consists of the Nier raid in the most recent Shadowbringers update. 
Savage raids:These are your hardcore raids. They are about equivalent to Mythic raids in WoW. But, you are in a party of 8 of what you do is important. Everyone has to work together and synchronize too be able clear this content. The amount of time varies but in the most extreme hardcore raiders it can take them a 5-7 days to clear but for normal players it can take them 2-3 weeks.  There is also a 48 man savage content that released in the Eureka content.
Ultimate raids: Thought savage was hard? There are currently 3 Ultimate raids. Ultimate raids make's savage content look like a joke. These are for the hardcore players that want to take it too the next level. Ultimate fights can last for about 15-18 minutes. Each passing second or minute, there is always a new mechanic that is very unique. This type of content take up to possibly more than 60+ hours. Being it can take you more than 1-3 months just to clear 1 ultimate. Though yes it's hard. But that is what makes this so much fun. The reward is that you will get a ultimate title and a unique ultimate weapon. But it's worth it.

Graphics: Even with a Low end PC you can still run this game smoothly. For Medium-High End PC. A lot of people tend to not like this aesthetic of graphics because of the anime type graphics but it really seems to fit.

Free Companies: Aka guilds- Finding a very dedicated FC that is willing to work with their own community is fun. Being able to host events and sometimes do raids and obtaining benefits makes FC's worth going to. Joining a FC or getting into the community can help you not get bored but can significantly make your FFXIV experience better.

Enternal Bondings:  So this is basically a Marriage system that can help boost the XP gain of two of the couples are together in this game and a Chocobo and YES there are actual relationships between players but don't try to take it serious as a relationship game.

Housing: You can have you're own house or a FC house that are limited in each server.  There are even crafters that can craft housing items or just be able to have you're own garden. You have your own section of an area where you would run into other players that could be your neighbor or another FC.

Golden Saucer: Pretty much a land of Mini-games that has good decent amount of games to play like Chocobo Racing or Card games. People actually seem to enjoy this content that they sometimes live in it. They have unique glamours or mounts as rewards.

Gear: Gears can be obtained from doing raids, dungeons or crafting. Every gear in this game unique. There are people who actually farm gear just for glamour that just looks really cool too be being very gorgeous or just very funny.

Eureka: Pretty much Legendary weapons or armor that have their own signature look and stats that can be used for endgame content. This usually takes about 1-3 weeks to be able to obtain 1 weapon but can vary on the time.  They are very grindy content.

Classes: You will have a single character with multiple classes to change into.So this means you do not need to make another character. There are 10 DPS, 4 Tanks, 3Healers, 7 Crafters, and 3 Gathers. Each job is very unique in terms of playstyle. You can be good with a specific class. But you will see a huge difference in terms of skill of the class you play too someone who plays the same class as you. This means even though you know your class. You haven't mastered it being there are rotations.

Leveling: Leveling: Leveling can completely vary on the methods that players use. But it can probably take about 1- 3 weeks or maybe less to max a DPS/Healer/Tank class. For Crafters and Gathers it can take probably a few hours to 2 weeks that can vary. Leveling doesn't feel slow or fast. It's just very moderate.

Crafters/gathering: Probably the most unique and yet rewarding content. There are tons of crafting recipes and gathering. Compared to other MMO's where Crafting and gathering are just sub-classes. In this game they can be a main class for players. Each crafter's are unique. Culinarian makes food for buffs even raids. Carpenter's can make housing materials. These are classes that can make you money and gear and being a crafter and gather is like playing a different game too where you can put infinite hours into this.

Negatives:
Monthly Payment: This is a subscription based MMO. But one thing in mind is that, if you do buy the steam version, you can purchase subscription with steam credits But this is how the game is still alive and healthy.

The story length: You will feel beyond rushed. The story is good and it's amazing. But too other players they want to reach the endgame content. If you are the type of player that only wants to play endgame and do raids. Then this is probably the biggest.

Conclusion:
You are not forced to follow a linear path in this game. You can be what you want to be is what makes this game feel so alive. You can be a hardcore player or a casual but you are not forced. This game is started to become more mainstream now and it's always great to have new players. To be honest this game feels like WoW when it became popular when Wrath of the Litch King was released.(Not a hate rant). This game feels like it has more content than GW2 endgame. Both are amazing MMO's but, Final Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that filled the void of my heart from what an MMO should be.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I feel like I can write at least a small review with 5 thousand hours in the game so here we go. 

Tldr: It's great, the best mmo in my opinion out there. Good music, dungeons, story and awesome community. Rocky start but starts to get better after the first expansion.

Alright so let's start with the base and go up. A Real Reborn, the base game you get is easily the longest and grueling at times. Quests that make you go fetch things from A to B, talk to this person etc. However, it still has some good points. 
    -The experience you get from doing the main story quests can keep you up to date for dungeon requirements. Some even give you gear so you don't need to throw your gil (In game currency) at the Market Board (player shop). 
   -Before the first dungeon you get the choice of having a tutorial on the basics of your current role (Tank, Healer or DPS.). Each training focuses on the general tasks your role does. The rewards you get are gear that lasts until lvl 20 and a ring that grants you XP until lvl 25 or lvl 30.
   -When you reach lvl 20-ish it starts to open up its world by having you travel around the continent. This is where you get some world building lore, the struggles of each nation, how the events prior to your arrival transpired and affected them along with some politics. 
   -It's beginner raids are new player friendly. Instead of having 8 people you have 4 which can be a good thing. 

There are other good points out there but I will let you decide on them. Now, with ARR done, let's give a look at what is to come. Spoiler free of course. 
   The first expansion, Heavensward, introduces new things to the fray like mechanics, locations and it starts the addition of flying in each zone with whatever mount you want! Aside from those it features an engaging soundtrack that changes with each phase making the fights more fun and epic. Worthy of the title you have been bestowed upon back in A Real Reborn. What it also brings are 3 new classes: Dark Knight, Astrologian and Machinist. All three are accessible once you start the Heavensward expansion but start at a lower level than its entry level. 
  -Dark Knight: A tank class that is seen edgy due to its use of ""inner darkness of your soul"" but a fun one and useful. 
  - Astrologian: You use the stars and tarot cards to heal and buff your allies. Another fun class, especially if you enjoy multitasking. 
  -Machinist: A ranged physical dps that uses guns and turrets. It's fairly simple to play as and can get powerful later on. 
Heavensward is seen as one of the best of the currently 3 expansions because of its story and I am inclined to agree. After finishing A Real Reborn, Heavensward will leave you very satisfied with how the game evolved. But it does not end there.

With Heavensward out of the way, Stormblood! Like before, it adds new mechanics and music along with two new areas, both having zones that you can enable flying in. With it comes 2 new classes this time, both DPS. 
  -Red Mage: Your fencer mage that uses both black and white magic to fight and support their allies. Heal and bring back your allies like a semi-healer in battles or focus on dealing damage while looking stylish! It's part of their persona. 
  -Samurai: Your sword wielding fighter from the Far East, which some of you might laugh at because of its name. Simple in gameplay but once you reach a higher level and learn its gimmicks you can see yourself dishing out large amounts of damage.
Stormblood is considered the good-ish one of the trio. I see it as an expansion that deviates a bit from the action of Heavensward and goes deeper in terms of other topics. 

And now, the latest expansion. Shadowbringers!
This expansion was one that left many players with their mouth agaped, sat at the edge of their seat and with their heart clenched. I shall leave the reasons to you! Minor advice: Buckle up. Things go to another level. As before, new zones with unlockable flying.
 Shadowbringers also brings to the fold 2 new classes: Gunbreaker and Dancer. A tank and a DPS. 
  -Gunbreaker: The small brother of Warrior that focuses on swift movements and big damage. It's skills are designed for fast gameplay, the player having 3 sets of combos: One for gathering ""Cartridges"" followed by a combo that uses a cartridge and another one that uses the 2nd combo. Confused? So was I but it comes around. A good description would be: Devil May Cry but tab target style. 
  -Dancer: It does what its name implies. With a combo that is half dependent on RNG, the dancer swoops in with its buff by performing steps with their Dance Partner, increasing both of their damage as the timer goes down. At later levels you can buff the party members around yourself, also increasing their damage. With their Dance Partner they can buff and heal each other and those around them. 


Now for another part of this review. You have noticed that I have mentioned repeatedly that you can fly, yes? Well that is because I have been saving words for this segment!
 
World Building! 

Each expansion gives the players new elements to the lore behind the universe of FFXIV. From the customs of each area and its people to civilizations long past to heroes of eld and gods once worshiped. The game introduces this through its story and many other quests. 

Questing! 

From Heanvensward and onward there is a trend that has been established with how the Main Quests work. It's pacing can be like this: First quest with the entry level is the introduction of the expansion followed by the next level being a dungeon you go in. The next quest can involve a solo instance where you fight along side NPC's in a revisited dungeon or a specially made area for it. And then another dungeon or trial. The cycle repeats like this to keep the player engaged and not go through another ARR slogfest.

Music!

The music is by far the best in my opinion. The composer, Masayoshi Soken, has a clear grasp on what to implement in this category so the player can enjoy doing the content. From slow motifs to full on pieces in which make you question yourself if you are in a battle of life or death or at an opera/concert. Many fall in love with the music in it and choose to do content because of it! Myself included. 

Community!
It has been said a lot of times that the community of FFXIV is really welcoming and well mannered. I stand to agree to that but I won't let it be sugarcoated that much. We have problems like many other MMO's and games that have you play with real people have. If I would be correct to assume, the reason behind this big point that has been brought so many times is because we choose to be kind because the developers are also kind. It's a paying forward sort of deal. At least that is how I see it.


And that is all I can think of. If you have read this far, thank you for your time! I hope this review will be at least helpful in getting an image on how the game is like and if you want to try it.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Played WoW for 16 years or so. Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop. Dont regret a single minute of it. Cant wait to start the actual expansions though. Already recommended to all of my friends that play WoW.


!!Update!! 

100 Hours more played later. Im completely addicted. Still have yet to hit the first expansion. Just content everywhere I look. I cant remember the last time I genuinely woke up or got home from work and was excited about actually sitting down continuing an adventure on a game or just to have pure fun and enjoyment. One of best communities I have had the pleasure of starting to be a part of as well. Experience is still amazing for me so far. And I know its just going to get better and better. Cant wait!

!!Update!!
Well i am currently sitting at 340 hours or so played now. Nothing has change I am loving this. I actually just hit the first expansion Heavensward and good lord they were not kidding. Dont get me wrong i didnt mind a realm reborn... but wow just wow did they step it up in the first expansion. the cut scenes the first new Main city i am obssessed and in love with and the music that comes along with it. Most of the cast from ARR has new voice actors and damn they are good. I just scratched the surface of Heavensward and with it already shocking me how good this is getting I cant even imagine Stormblood or Shadowbringers. I can honestly say even heavensward has put WoW shadowlands to shame in all terms of story especially and cut scenes even landscape and music its just overall beautiful and being the big game of thrones fan I am the dragons and all that feel to it is just great. Its definitely not a suprise why they add heavensward into the free trial because they know after you touch that expansion you wont want to stop! :) 

Overall Take it from Me a WoW 16 year vet even with a WoW tattoo irl on my arm i lived breathed and slept WoW. I have yet to even miss a single patch or anything. Even with 9.1 that just came out yesterday while sitting here playing this now. I dont even question myself for a single second about going back anytime soon or resubbing. I am having an overall amazing experience so far and it has been keeping me completely busy and satisfied. I can honestly say this is the very first game in my life that has kept me away from World of Warcraft and for me thats a huge statement and win.

415 hours in or so. I should of easily been at Stormblood by now but i just keep getting side tracked into doing everything else in the game. Been leveling the Dark Knight up to 60 now and Finishing heavensward on him. Amazing class. Super fun story for the class as well. Machinest was my main until I recently started going Dark Knight crazy. The instant dungeon ques for tank are also a plus! And damn the Dark Knight gear just looks so good especially swinging around the big two hander feels so good as well. I should be hitting Stormblood soon though for sure as long as I dont get side tracked anymore. But honestly Im still genuinely happy and just having a blast playing this game honestly the longer it takes me to get to the other expansions the better. It is nothing like WoW where its just a strict grind fest as fast as you can to end game. Nah. Its just completely enjoy the game and have fun and do whatever you want and take your time!. Good stuff.

!!Update!!
Finally Finished Heavensward and Ill put this as simply and quick as I can. Amazing Story. Amazing Music. Just hooks you in and makes you connect with every character in the story it felt like I was just watching and getting to know every character like a full season of a show that just hooks you in. Some cutscenes were just an overall thrill and joy and by the end was hitting me in my feels haha. Simply just landed a spot in my top 10 stories of video games that I have experienced in my life.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I play MMOs. It's my thing. It's what I like to do. I've tried many. Most disappoint me. This one did not, as you can probably tell by my ever-increasing total playtime. 

The game most comparative to [b]Final Fantasy 14[/b] (FF14), to many people's annoyance, is [b]World of Warcraft[/b] (WoW). They are both 'theme park' style MMOs, and they both use simple, action-based, 'TAB-targeting' combat. The similarities are vast, I can assure you, but they are also obvious. I can split hairs, talk about WoW's reactive, fast paced style versus FF14's slow, prepared style, but to anyone who has played both at the higher levels, it's fairly self-evident. The games are very similar as massively multiplayer online role-playing games, with simple mechanics and easy-to-enter natures (as well as raised cost-of-entries).

I think one of the only things I can offer to the discussion involving this game is my perspective. I have experienced as many aspects of this game as I can. I played the story attentively, I watched every cutscene, I leveled a healer, tank and a dps to 80 (the current max), and I gathered and crafted for way too long. 

This is a [i]weird[/i] game. The community is strange, in that they are as helpful as they are awkward. People will gladly help you for nothing, then ask that you visit them in their home (which is often just a hot tub next to a bed). They have odd customs, like saying 'o7' at the start of dungeons (which is supposed to be a salute). Everyone cares how they look, but doesn't care what you think about how they look. Playing songs in the plazas, erotic roleplay in the alleys, and bots asking you to buy gil are common sights. 

The story is set into whats called the Main Scenario, split by expansion. You have to play through [b]all the present and past story[/b] to catch up. This is [i]incredibly[/i] time consuming. If you play like I did over the last year, it is unlikely you can get to Shadowbringers (the current expansion) within one month of game time. Luckily, [b]the free trial is extremely good now[/b]. They recently changed it to be that you can play through the initial release content (A Realm Reborn), all for free, forever. 

Speaking of [b]A Realm Reborn[/b] (ARR), it's painfully average. The story is as well paced as paint drying, and because of the way item/level scaling works, there is no meaningful challenges. Granted, there aren't [i]supposed[/i] to be, but it is disappointing. The plot comes to a grinding halt a number of times, and sometimes there isn't even a plot, just you doing weird, forgettable jobs for weird, forgettable people. If you tried this game and left because of how slow ARR is, I can't blame you. It's a slog. But if you stick around, [b]the last arc[/b] of ARR was relatively enjoyable, finally arriving at some of the crazy style Final Fantasy is more known for. 

After ARR, (and after you pay for the game), comes [b]Heavensward[/b] (HW), the Wrath of the Lich King of this game. I cannot express to you how surprised I was by the sharp quality increase here. It's remarkable. The story picks up in a new kingdom, dropping most of the old characters for a story about an oncoming dragon war, set in a genuinely interesting nation. The first time I truly took notice of the music in FF14 was when I entered this expansion, it's phenomenal, and consistently so throughout. The quests become stripped of tedious 'Slay 10 _', and are paced very well, keeping a feeling of tension as you progress that was never present in ARR. If you've ever heard someone say 'stick around FF14, it gets good', this is why. Unfortunately, it is followed by...

[b]Stormblood[/b] (SB). If Heavensward is like WotLK, then Stormblood is like Warlords of Draenor. Everything I just praised HW for took several steps back during this story. Old characters are brought to the light screaming and kicking, some given literal rewrites to force them to fit in, and newer characters struggle to make an impact. The music fails to keep me engaged as well, matching equally uninteresting environments Plots are jump-started, then the brakes are cut as they tumble down a hill. While the questing is still better than ARR, it's not by much anymore. The truly cool moments are so few and far between a deep, deep ocean of truly unfulfilling questing. It's really unfortunate, I really liked a few of the characters they introduce here, and 2 of the zones they introduce are among the best the game has, with a small plot about a rebellion I truly enjoyed. Those aspects are just mashed inside of a larger, more boring plot about a different rebellion.

Fortunately for me, [b]Shadowbringers[/b] (ShB) was everything I hoped for. If HW is WotLK, and SB is WoD, than Shadowbringers is, I guess, kind of like Legion. Honestly, the WoW expansion comparisons start to break down here. If you are looking into this game, at some point you probably heard that Shadowbringers is good. You probably also have some healthy skepticism and some tempered expectations. I'm here to assure you that Shadowbringers is not so good that it's worth playing through all of what I just described, AND a $60+ price tag. But it's pretty close. This expansions reworks a lot of old characters and plots into a surprisingly touching and insightful story, making one of the most trite and lifeless antagonistic forces in the game into strangely sympathetic villains. The themes through the story are strong, and conveyed in honestly intuitive ways. [b]The music[/b] is unbelievably good. One or two areas have some weaker themes, but the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5qx583Uys]dungeons[/url] and raids have absolutely stunning scores. The area designs are lacking, in my opinion, but they are easy to traverse, and, well, it's very subjective. 

A few closing remarks, organized in no particular order.

The [b]class design and feel[/b] is pretty good. Each class feels very distinct, and the meta is tight, with, and I know this is hard to believe, every class performing well. It's very well balanced on the PvE side.

The [b]PvP[/b] in this game is, and this is being generous, [i]awful[/i]. It's poorly balanced, it's map design is shoddy, and it's not very rewarding in terms of character progression, if at all. It can be fun in short doses because it is chaotic, but playing it anymore than that is frustrating. 

The [b]fashion[/b] in FF14 is one of the main aspects of the players who stick around. It's easy to track down what you want, and there is a wide variety of styles to pursue.

The [b]cash shop[/b], also known as the Mogstation, is quite prevalent. Not in the sense that you are forced to visit it, or that you have to to get an advantage, just that many, many people use it. Premium costumes and emotes are frequent, as well as sales. It doesn't bother me much, but I mention it because it can be annoying to see someone wearing a cool set, only to discover it cost them $12. 

The [b]account management[/b] is awful. The website to manage your subscription and account details is ancient, slow, and prone to problems. The [b]customer support[/b] as well is slow, but I have found them to be at the very least helpful and patient. Also...

The [b]Steam version[/b] of this game is prone to account issues. I recommend the stand-alone version (which actually goes on sale more often). It's too late for me in this regard.


All and all, I find Final Fantasy XIV a rewarding way to waste my time. I often find myself just standing in places, talking with my friends and/or strangers I happen to meet in-game.

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is an MMO game base on the series with the same name. It features elements from all the entries and creates a huge world filled with lots of things to do. What set it apart from other MMO’s is that it looks visually appealing, that its system is easy to learn but hard to master and that it has a lot of versatility when it comes to its players. It is a fluid system with a good amount of room to explore and take it easy.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The gameplay features common elements of what an MMO would have. Players do quests in order to gain exp and level up, once they do they are able to queue up for dungeons, trials(bosses) and raids which they can battle together with friends or with other players through the party finder, which works like a charm.

Each player is required to choose a class, then at lv 30, that class will become a job. Job is a more specialized class. Depending on the class the player chooses, gameplay will vary and while it would be impossible to mention all of them in a review, I will give some examples. Classes are divided into three roles:

[h1] Healers [/h1]

Their job is to keep their fellow peers alive through the art of healing. They can range from the classic white mage with lots of healing spells, to a more offensive approach with the scholar who has damaging spells. Players can also opt to get a mix of both with astrologian, which depends on the high skill of the player and some RGN but features the higher arrange of abilities.

[h1] DPS (Damage dealers) [/h1]

They are the ones who kill the monsters. DPS is the role with more classes in the game and they feature different types of jobs such as black mages, which enjoy lots of damaging spells but lack utility, to bards who can buff their whole party with beneficial effects while keeping up damage or ninjas, who mix different kinds of abilities to generate powerful ninjutsu.

[h1] Tanks [/h1]

The heart of the party, they always must protect their fragile party members and be the shield that guards the realm of men. Like their description says, they keep everyone out of harm's way by provoking monster, rushing to deploy barriers or just being a pain for bosses to get rid of in general. Tanks will redirect all the damage towards them so that the healers and dps’s can do their jobs without preoccupying about dying.


Is the mix of all these roles that create a functioning party, and with the finder, you are always guaranteed to get a good balance of all of them. Each of these roles is equally important as they are pieces of a greater whole. The healers keep everyone alive, the DPS kills the enemies and the tanks keep the other two out of harm's way. No matter which role you choose, you will always be important for your party.

Speaking of side activities, there is another type of roles I haven’t mentioned yet. These are the disciples of the hand and the disciples of the hand. In these fields, players can find classes ranging from blacksmiths to fishermen or even culinarian! These jobs tend to break the normal pace of the game and offer a more relaxing environment. They might sound boring at first, but players often find themselves lost in them for hours. Once you get going, you just want to do more, and they are beneficial to yourself and your other classes.

If you are a culinarian, for example, you can make your own food which allows you to get bonus exp modifiers. If you are a blacksmith or an armorer, you can craft your own weapons and armors to use in your other classes. If you are a fisherman, you can sell the fish for lots of money on the player market and well, who doesn’t love fishing in a game?

[h1] Story [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a game that takes its story very personal and treats it with the utmost care. It does start pretty boring and dull but catches up fast and it can feel like watching a series or a movie. The richest stories are in the expansions, unfortunately, but these are quite enjoyable, filled with lots of believable characters, conflicts, development and more.

 Reading all of it or catching up to the latest expansions can be quite daunting, so if you are not into spending a lot of time reading/watching cutscenes, you can always skip them and rewatch them later at an inn’s room. There are also plenty of summaries only that are well written and consist of thirty to an hour reading material per expansion (game+2 expansions= 3 hours of reading total) so feel free to skip it if you do find it boring or exhausting to sit through. Do however note that the story is one of the strongest points of the game.

[h1] Some Notes [/h1]

The game runs well on any system that meets the requirements. Some areas might decrease your fps depending on your settings and the sheer amount of player characters that are present in the zone but fret not, this is not a big issue by any means. Duties can be bothersome when you are at a party with friends but are overall enjoyable. Probably the easiest MMO to get into has a UI that the player can adjust to fit their playstyle or needs and the game lacks any sort of pay to win or in-game advantage bought with real money, only shortcuts for those that simply don’t have a lot of time.

[h1] What Makes It Special [/h1]

What makes Final Fantasy XIV special is that it is well balanced when it comes to all the classes and jobs. That it looks more realistic when compared to its peers and that it features a dynamic, fluent system with that is easy to use but hard to master. By sharing all classes across one character, the player will never need to go back to the start of the game in they decide that maybe that class they picked, in the beginning, wasn’t the one for them. 

The game makes an effort to make fights different from one another. Players can find themselves fighting in Rubik's cube, getting devours by a Cerberus and fighting the beast from its stomach or even getting split from their bodies and have to move across a labyrinth of AOE’s in order to go back into them and continue the fight. There is always something new in waiting for the player in the next encounter. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a fantastic MMO, it is filled with great amounts of content and different ice breakers to teach new players how to play and hold their hands until they can go by themselves into the wild worlds of Eorzea. There are a bunch of side activities to break the normal pace of the game and have some fun if you are ever tired from questing, and each dungeon or trial keep adding new mechanics, keeping the game entertaining and making you wonder what you will encounter in your next adventure. I recommend this game to those that haven’t experienced an MMO, and to those that have as well.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I'm incredibly happy to see the injection of new players after WoW shat the bed with Shadowlands and 9.1. I played WoW for nearly a decade of my life and through every expansion to endgame, and I have to say that Blizzard doesn't hold a candle to ANYTHING Square Enix has pushed out for FFXIV. Allow me to explain, starting with the cons of FFXIV:

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
[*] Buying the game can be frustrating. There are two methods: through Steam or through Square Enix's websites. If you buy it on one platform you cannot use it on the other. [strike]I [b] HIGHLY [/b] recommend looking something up to walk you through it.[/strike] Square Enix has updated their website and the Mogstation to make it easier to purchase the game and the expansions through their client. I recommend taking this route rather than through Steam.
[/list]

[h1] The Middling [/h1]
Now, this isn't necessarily a negative, but some might think so.
[list]
[*] This is a story-driven game. It can be difficult to play with friends to go through quests since many of the main story quests will have you go into an instance by yourself. There are hundreds of hours of main story quests (it's thicc af), and almost all of it is good; however, some expansions are better than others and each have their own theme and build off of each other. ARR (vanilla) is arguably the worst, but begins to pick up about halfway through, and the rest of the expansions are excellent with Shadowbringers being one of the best narratives I've seen in an MMORPG. The newest expansion, Endwalker, has surpassed Shadowbringers in terms of story quality in my opinion.
[*] You can skip entire portions of story quests by purchasing story skips from the Mogstation. If you have disposable income and don't really care for the story, then you can buy these. You can also purchase cosmetics, orchestration rolls, housing items, and emotes via the cash-shop in the Mogstation. I personally never look at these because there is an abundance of content in the game already.
[*] Add-ons are against the terms of service since PC players and console players are playing together and add-ons that affect the game's code create unfair gameplay between the two. However, the game functions just fine without them.
[*] Buying the current expansion also unlocks all of the expansions before it. However, the same rules apply as it does setting up your account. You have to buy the base game [b]and[/b] the expansion on the same platform otherwise it won't work.
[/list]

[h1] The Good/Excellent [/h1]
As previously stated, I've played WoW for years, and the following game mechanics and features completely outstrip WoW in terms of functionality and enjoyment.
[list]
[*] [b] Your character can be every single class and profession (in FFXIV terms, jobs) and you can switch between them with literally a click of your mouse. [/b] This game respects your time immensely. Tired of playing the Archer/Bard? No problem! Switch on over to your Gladiator/Paladin and nothing changes except your class. Not only that, but classes receive something called an Armory Bonus that increases experience gained up to your maximum leveled class.
[*] Classes are all unique and morph into specialized classes. Class categories share a small pool of general abilities, like basic defensives or casting modifiers.
[*] There are daily quests, mostly in the form of Beast Tribe dailies. You can do 12 of these a day, and they reward you with unique currency that you can spend at the factions along with reputation. It might sound like a small amount of dailies, but the reputation gain is proportional. And better yet, flying isn't gated behind getting reputation with these factions (thank god). The reason this is a pro is due to the fact that it holds no bearing on anything else in the game and nothing is locked behind it (other than faction-specific mounts and pets and whatnot).
[*] The subscription is cheaper than WoW, and they give you veteran rewards every few months that you're subscribed.
[*] Chocobo racing and Gold Saucer nonsense. Be sure the play the mini and jumbo Cactpot (I call the jumbo Cactpot the Cuckedpot though because you'll never win the jackpot).
[*] The UI is entirely customizable down to the colors of enemy and friendly health bars. No need for an add-on or anything to change stuff around.
[*] Random drops exist, but that's not really the focus of the gear game, especially at end game content. Many duties (FFXIV's equivalent to dungeons and raids) will reward you with both random drops and tokens or currency to trade in for [b] specific [/b] pieces of gear. This means you don't have to grind the same raid or trial for the specific drop for weeks, and instead just buy an equivalent piece instead.
[*] Gearing up a class at endgame is incredibly fast so that you can get into the meat and potatoes of the hardcore raiding content.
[*] The duties are all unique and bosses rarely repeat mechanics from other duties. Most of the duties don't have artificial difficulty scalers, like arbitrarily more health or damage. Instead, bosses rely on complex and interesting mechanics. Savage, Extreme, Unreal, and Ultimate boss fights will also scale with health and damage and will require a certain DPS check, but when you're doing these you know what you're in for and what is required.
[*] Duties have their own unique soundtrack, and many bosses also have unique soundtracks and battle music. Honestly, most of it is top tier music.
[*] Almost all previous content is brought forward into the new expansion or content patch. Dungeons from ARR still reward currency that is usable at max level. Some unique content from previous expansions are expanded on and given new activities to do. Gear/stat scaling is applied in a remarkably balanced way. Square Enix routinely patches current and past content, all the way back to 2.0 (ARR vanilla).
[*] The game is pretty. Gear sets are unique to each dungeon, trial, or raid, and many have dyeable versions that can be crafted (I'm looking at you, WoW, with your reskinned gear sets from every dungeon in an expansion). Most harder difficulty content of the same duty rewards equipment that looks completely different from the previous difficulty, or they follow a certain theme. Regardless, the equipment will look different and rarely is it recolored.
[*] Raids and trials aren't long endeavors that take hours upon hours to complete, or even days. Almost all of them can be completed in less than an hour, and if you're there for more than an hour then you're doing something very very wrong.
[*] The crafting in this game is just [i] chef kiss.[/i] The same materials are used more or less throughout the whole game and can be farmed very easily. Not only that, but the game incentivizes you to use the crafting abilities to make high-quality craftables. In fact, it gives you the option to craft it quickly or take your time to really get that good good. There are also a few different types of crafting activities that involve items that are classified as collectables and reward special currency for nifty mounts, minions (pets), and cosmetics.
[*] The list goes on, but go see for yourself. The free trial includes ARR and the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions to the amount of time played. There are, however, some restrictions regarding social functions and in-game marketboard stuff.
[/list]

[h1] The Verdict: 9/10 [/h1]

It also respects your time.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Edit: TL:DR 
Best MMORPG I've ever played, definitely worth checking out. One character, ALL content including classes, jobs etc. BASE GAME AND FIRST EXPANSION ARE NOW FREE TO PLAY, with some restrictions. 

BTW. I have made some updates to this review to reflect patches.

I gave up WoW (or World of Warcraft) For this game. Why? You only need one character to play every class. [strike]The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs.[/strike] (Edit: They changed this feature not too long ago to make all classes self contained. They still level up into Jobs but you are no longer required to have a sub class to unlock the Job.) 

You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 95% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF! You don't have to be in a guild or part of a clique. The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive (on some realms...like Molboro!). 

Dungeons are part of a finder in game. There is also a personal/free company housing system that allows you to have a space to show off and decorate in. As of Shadowbringers, dungeons in end game can now be done with a Trust system where you run with NPCs. There was also an update to squadrons that let you do up to heavensward with a handpicked NPC group.

The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing. The (original) opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words. Square has really outdone themselves with this title and I can't wait to see how they wow me with FFXV!

Edit: As per a commented question, The sub options come in 30/90/180 day increments and can be set up as recurring (thanks Pasty858). 180 days is roughly $78.
As a further Edit: The sub is required to access the game and comes in two types, one that allows only one character per realm (all that is really needed) and one that lets you have up to 8 (I think) characters per realm (for the altoholics). The 1 character per realm Sub is less expensive.

Also, anyone who would like to share in the recruit a friend benefits, message me.

SO! Its been a while since I've played. after logging over 200 hours that weren't counted on here, and doing everything short of Savage content, I have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again. But this game. The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming. It was amazing! 

Edit as of Dec 12, 2020
I'm now playing on the Ps4 as well as Pc, have logged another 1000 hours and am almost endgame again, I was not thrilled with Stormblood but Shadowbringers is amazing so far!


If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month ([strike]or 14day[/strike] trial now goes up to heavensward content, see below) trial period!

A note to anyone new, the free trial is now available all the way up through level 60 and the first expansion Heavensward! I'm not sure how long the trial lasts, but it free to anyone and now is the best time to jump in! Exp has been increased, Main Storyline Quests have been optimized and new Jobs have been added.

I would like to add a note, now that I have finished MSQ for Shadowbringers, please don't level skip. If you do, please at least go back and learn basics. If you're not interested in the story, fine but don't let that stop you from being the best you can be at your chosen role.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Edit: Still good 4 years later.

For a long time, I avoided FF14 even as word continued on that it was one of the best MMO's  currently out there. This only increased with the release of the Shadowbringers Expansion, which I heard nothing but good things about. Still, this was not enough. Knowing how I operate in MMO's, starting one would be a colossal time investment for months, and possibly years depending upon how much I enjoyed it. I ended up giving FF14 a try when I saw how many of my oldest friends were either playing it or planning to. They let you do a free trial up to level 35, so I figured... why not? If I make it that far and like it, then perhaps this may be worth buying.

Even so, I wasn't quite prepared for how much I was about to be consumed by this game. FF14 is easily the best MMO i've played since WoW's Wrath of the Lich King expansion more than 10 years ago. I found it to be more enjoyable than EVE and Guild Wars 2, and far superior to WoW's current expansion Battle for Azeroth. After over a year of enduring that mess, it was refreshing to play FF14 and find an MMO that I actually could enjoy without excessive RNG and obnoxious busywork.

Ok, so reviewing an MMO in its entirety is utterly mad and i'd be here for hours, so instead I'm going to try to highlight a few key points.

First and foremost, FF14 puts some serious investment into its storylines. While it might officially be an MMO, FF14 is also probably the largest JRPG ever made. Expect dozens of hours of cutscenes and story events, with me having about 300 hours played when I finished all current story content. Now I didn't spend all 300 of those hours only doing story content, but that should give you a pretty decent idea of how large the story is. If you are familiar with this franchise then you have a pretty good idea of what to expect, and longtime fans will see many familiar names among this game's characters and boss fights. On the other hand the story is a bit mediocre early on and only really gets going in the first expansion Heavensward. Technically you can skip all the cutscenes (and rewatch them in an Inn or your house), and even buy a skip all the way to Shadowbringers if you really want to, but I'd recommend against it considering how much of a role story and character development play in this game. The story might be a bit bland and lengthy in its early stages, but it becomes one of the better parts of this game.

Moving on to gameplay, FF14 has a large number of different classes, or ""jobs"", that you can play as. You get your typical MMO setup of tanks, healers, melee, and ranged each with their own distinct play style, strengths, and weaknesses. Crafting and gathering in FF14 is much more developed than in most MMO's with each of them being different classes in their own right. But unlike most MMO's, FF14 allows you to play all of these different classes on a single character. This is a major selling point for someone like me with major alt problems in other MMO's (12 120's in WoW, for example). FF14 ensures that you are able to play all of the classes and their own storylines while at the same time not forcing you to build a new character from scratch for each different class.

As for group content, there are plenty of opportunities for PvE and PvP. When it comes to PvP, i'll admit that my experience is somewhat limited. However from what I have seen of PvP in FF14 it is a bit clunky, does not seem to be particularly popular, and is one of the few areas where WoW clearly beats FF14... for now. As for PvE, FF14 is very strong indeed. There are a large number of Dungeons (4 player runs), Trials (8 player boss fights), Raids (8 players), and Alliance Raids (24 players). FF14's version of LFG, the ""Duty Finder"", is simple to use and allows you to queue up for any content you have unlocked - though you may want an organized group for the high difficulty content. Worth mentioning are the ""roulettes"" which let you select a category (such as Trials, Level 80 Dungeons, or Alliance Raids) to queue for and obtain a daily reward based upon your class level. FF14 does have level scaling that reduces your level to fit whatever PvE content you find yourself in, though it is possible to turn this off for your own private groups. 

Like what WoW used to have when it was still good, FF14 has a token/badge system where you collect currencies from doing 50+ PvE content that you can use to buy gear, materials, and other goodies. There is also nothing like the Titanforging or weekly chest RNG BS like what is in current (8.2.5) WoW. Current content raids work a little differently in FF14 too, with you being limited in the amount of gear items you can get per week. On the one hand this slows down gearing a bit, but on the other you are free to run the current raids as many times as you want until you get the gear drop you are after, at least on normal difficulty. In the light of having to wait months before getting crucial gear upgrades in WoW due to only getting one chance a week, I like how FF14 does it.

As for the community, I haven't been on forums or around hardcore players since I have not joined a proper raid guild yet (or Free Company as they are called in FF14). However, from what I have seen FF14 players are far more friendly and far less toxic than many other game communities. I've completed over 500 dungeons so far and I can probably count on one hand the number of times i've dealt with jackasses in those dungeons. People tend to be friendly, helpful, more relaxed, and more forgiving of errors - especially if you are new and have the ""sprout"" icon. I think FF14 might have stronger rule enforcement for bad behavior, but I am not completely sure about that. I don't even see much swearing, which is kind of a shock for an online game. In any event, I very much like the peaceful community this game has.

Ok I better wrap this up before this review goes on forever.

And yet there are so many other neat things to mention. Gold Saucer and all its minigames, Player owned housing and all the customization that comes with it, the massive amount of special items to collect, and on the list goes. FF14 is an MMO after all, so having an insane amount of content to spend time with is to be expected. There are so many opportunities to play this game in the manner of your choosing. :D

So... If my opinion on this game isn't obvious to you by know, I don't know what to tell you. :o

One last note though... like many other MMO's, [url=https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/friend_recruit/]FF14 has a ""Recruit a Friend"" feature[/url] where a new player who has yet to buy their first month of subscription can get a code from a current subscriber and get rewards for both of them that increase the longer the new person sticks with the game. If FF14 sounds like something you may be interested in, feel free to leave a comment on this review asking for one of these codes and i'll reply with one. :D

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"After Shadowbringers:

If you are into MMORPGs, this game has the best polish and production value of any MMO, and that includes above World of Warcraft.

If you're into combat in MMORPGs:  This game has the most insane adrenaline pumping boss fights you'll ever fight.

If you're into story in MMORPGs:  There is simply no other game.  In most MMOs, the story is part of the game.  In this one, it is the game, and everything you do surrounds the beautiful tale they tell.  Unlike some games *cough* WoW *cough* where characters just play their stereotypes, this game has expert-level writing with characters that behave out of character, with characters who don't follow stereotypes, and with interesting and often twisted back stories.

If you're into end-game content:  This game doesn't have the best top tier content, but because it is so polished and hand crafted it doesn't even matter because the limited content is much more engaging and a thrilling experience that is far more memorable than the ""choose your gear grind"" of other games.

If you're into PVP, it exists.  That's all that can be said about it.  The content loosely follows a story but only loose and it's not that refined nor is it updated very often, and suffers from a lack of population.

If you are into crafting / gathering, this game has the best themepark MMO crafting system on the market.  The only MMO that does it better is Eve Online, only because it is a full simulation.  This is not a simulation of supply chains or spreadsheets.  This game is more about simulating getting down and dirty.  Mass produce a ton of low quality items or strive for high quality at the cost of time and materials.  Everything from crafting to gathering has mini games attached to it where you have to maximize your chance to gather an item and/or make it high quality.    

If you're looking for a community, this one is all about love and laughs.  This is because the game has a built in mentor system where veterans can teach newbies, who have clovers over their heads to tell the party that they are relatively new to the game and haven't completed the main storyline.  The game has a vibrant fan community with reddits and Discords as well, and the attitudes are almost always positive.  People are usually forgiving of mistakes in dungeons and boss fights and won't try to start fights.

If you ever wanted to try a game you thought you'd never see yourself playing, this is the game for you.  No, the style of this game is not for everyone.  The lack of PVP and the lack of end game content variety is something at face value people would not want.  But just keep this in mind.  This game contains hundreds of hours of main storyline quests, and that's not including the side quest chains, normal quests, unlock quests, Special dungeons and higher difficulty modes for boss fights.  Even getting to the end game is an accomplishment for one who has never started.  It is also the best time to do it.  For your money you will get these hundreds of hours of story which will take you perhaps 2-4 months to complete even if you play every day.  This game transcends its weaknesses because of things like this, the sheer polish of everything that is done.  PVP can be forgiven because the PVE fights get very hectic at higher levels and on higher difficulties.  Lack of end game content can be forgiven because of those intense fights as well and because the game is so incredibly long to begin with.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"This is my review fresh off playing patch-hell post Shadowbringers, the third big expansion available for Final Fantasy XIV.

[u] My review is not aimed at the typical person who is interested in this game already[/u]. 

[b]If you are being harassed by some friend, spouse or group to join in, this review is for you.[/b] 
I should also mention this is the first game of it’s kind I’ve played.

Most people call this title a MMO, but secretly, Final Fantasy XIV is a gigantic single player JRPG with massively multiplayer elements, which has a slope of endurance required to show its true colors, potential, and best qualities.
As a custom made Warrior of Light, you will embark in continent-spanning adventures, meeting a big cast of friends and foes, as you search for your place in this world, ripe with war, history and sights.

By far the biggest issue is that you WILL feel overwhelmed and confused for a while, more if this is your first entry in the franchise. Several references and callbacks will be lost on you, but that's second to the big issue. 

Getting used to everything there is to do in its side activities alone can be a gauntlet, so if your friends care about you, demand they give you a hand. Some mechanics and gameplay elements are easy to pick up and learn, some are either so overwhelming or convoluted I have not bothered after a curious look. While the community and game extensively have documented everything, getting handholded by someone else is, in my opinion, ideal for the first few hours. 

The third problem is this game genuinely takes time to actually be worth playing. There is no nice way of putting it, while there has been some retroactive changes, the first chapter, Realm Reborn, is a very poor first impression which only the promise of better things making it tolerable. Several quests aren’t fun, most of the characters are not interesting and the few who eventually become your most trusted companions dont start true development until later.

[u] If you’re not already reconsidering, keep reading[/u] .

Most of the game main story quests focus on exploring giant regions, doing favors to different factions and groups to further your goals, and meeting all sorts of walks of life. Some regions have rather poor design, making it easy to be lost or be painful to navigate on foot or mount, as well as less than pleasant visuals or annoying paths. Generally however most are well realized, and starting with the second expansion the new areas are mostly good.

The quests are an assortment of your usual kill thing or collect stuff, but some notably take a bigger focus on the ongoing narrative, like helping soldiers after a battle or simply checking on the mental state of an ally. While some quests do have the sin of making you go back and forth between long distances, very few are confusing or not clear on what to do, so most of the time you’re focused on the going-on instead. Notably some quests have dungeons, raids and trials attached, which have the best and worst content in the game.

Some are difficult but fair for blind play, requiring everyone in the party to work together, some have complete slap in the face design that you’ll be asking what were they thinking. This is again a good spot to demand a friend to be with you.

This leads me to the presentation and overall story, that as I said, starts rather barren and slowly builds up. 

It’s Stormblood where the game starts to truly improve, even with caveats. The new villains are overall a wasted potential, with some great moments undermined or underutilized. The few who will remain relevant long term do get a better development but this comes post-patch. However, many of the dungeons begin experimenting, the cast begins to shine and become people worth caring about, and the music is genuinely fantastic.

Here at last, in Shadowbringers, the overwhelming praise is vindicated- the cast is extremely well developed and written, the antagonists and neutrals are deep, complex and nuanced, all the bosses and battles are epic in scale and a good challenge, the score is outstanding and hours of quests, dungeons, trials, and a slew of issues get paid off in an excellent climax that is a rollercoaster of emotions.

However, the ending does bring the question post-clarity if the amount of effort to get here is worth it, which is why again I implore that if you are being dragged to this game, have those dragging you beside you.

FFXIV can be great a adventure with a gigantic amount of content in the main story, let alone side content, that ranges from insane minigames in a casino, to hilariously self aware questlines, in a captivatingly massive, yet intimate journey.
It can also be a slow, frustrating, confusing, tedious game with constant “what were they thinking” moments, some gameplay related, some story related, with a community that ranges from welcoming, fun and friendly to obnoxiously insufferable and a waste of oxygen to the planet.

In short, if you can get an equal amount of investment from whoever is making you play to stick with you, this game is worth the try and it can be a great experience in retrospect, but in the moment you’ll occasionally want to choke the life out of him.",fresh patch hell post shadowbringers third big expansion available final fantasy xiv aimed typical interested already harassed friend spouse group join mention kind call title secretly final fantasy xiv gigantic single jrpg massively multiplayer element slope endurance required true color potential best quality custom warrior light embark continent spanning adventure meeting big cast friend foe search world ripe war history sight far biggest issue overwhelmed confused entry franchise reference callback lost big issue side activity alone gauntlet friend care demand hand mechanic element easy pick learn overwhelming convoluted bothered curious look community extensively documented handholded someone else opinion ideal hour third problem genuinely take worth nice putting retroactive change chapter realm reborn poor impression promise thing tolerable quest fun character interesting eventually trusted companion dont true development already reconsidering reading quest focus exploring giant region favor different faction group goal meeting sort walk life region rather poor design easy lost painful navigate foot mount pleasant visuals annoying path generally realized starting expansion new area mostly good quest assortment usual kill collect stuff notably bigger focus ongoing narrative helping soldier battle simply checking mental state ally quest sin forth long distance confusing clear focused notably quest dungeon raid trial attached best worst content difficult fair blind requiring party complete slap face design asking good spot demand friend lead presentation start rather barren slowly build stormblood start truly improve caveat new villain wasted potential great moment undermined underutilized remain relevant long term development come post patch dungeon experimenting cast begin shine worth caring music genuinely fantastic last shadowbringers overwhelming praise vindicated cast extremely developed written antagonist neutral deep complex nuanced boss battle epic scale good challenge score outstanding hour quest dungeon trial slew issue paid excellent climax rollercoaster emotion ending bring question post clarity effort worth implore dragged dragging beside ffxiv great adventure gigantic content alone side content range insane minigames casino hilariously self aware questlines captivatingly massive intimate journey slow frustrating confusing tedious constant moment related related community range welcoming fun friendly obnoxiously insufferable waste oxygen planet short equal investment whoever stick worth great retrospect moment occasionally choke life,2,0.996

A Realm Reborn currently is a stretch to get through and can be tough for new players to enjoy but there is a patch (5.3 a major patch to the game) coming in soon which will make ARR way better to go through

[i]This review was written based on version 3.0[/i]

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Consistent, large patches about every 3 months.
[*]Gorgeous graphics engine. 
[*]Deep crafting system.
[*]Probably the best storytelling in an MMO I've ever seen (but it does take 30+ hour to really get into the meat of it)
[*]One of the most friendly gaming communities around.
[*]Cross-platform play with the PS3 and PS4, excellent controller support for PC.
[*]Possible to play casually and still enjoy/experience the game with hardcore friends.
[*]Hildebrand - Game doesn't take itself too seriously and just has fun.
[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Game doesn't reinvent the MMO wheel. It is a pretty standard ""theme park"" MMO. That being said, it is extremely polished and everything in the game is executed very well.
[*]Subscription model, I was almost tempted to put this in the Pros column. One of the few games to do this model well in a sea of F2P MMOs.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Tens of hours of monotonous fetch quests sprinkled throughout the game. Usual MMO fare.
[*]Long PvP queues, slightly unbalanced. (Not enough people play PvP)
[*]Endgame content can be very grindy at times. (Ex: Relic Weapons, and ""Run the same 2 dungeons over and over to get currency to buy gear"".)
[*]Gil sellers - I realize this happens in pretty much every MMO. This didn't make the list because it happens, it is strictly on the list because of advertising chat spam. On an average day you will see a lot of messages (unless you're like me and are so fed up with it you go /away). Expect the spam to be cranked up to 11 whenever a large piece of content is released. I really feel SE could implement better countermeasures with respect to advertising. It does seem worse than in many of it's other AAA MMO competitors. On a side note, I'm told the JP servers are practically gil seller free. I've never tested this myself however. Overall, not a huge con, but an annoyance none the less.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Back in my high school & college days of the late 1970's and early 80's, I had spent many hundreds of hours, sitting around tables with a bunch of friends, playing paper & pencil Role Playing Games (RPG), like Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).

But I had to give up RPG games as I continued my education and pursued a working career. The time required as a Game Master/scenario designer was just too time consuming and my other worldly responsibilities took priority.

Many years later in 2016, I was invited by a friend to join them playing the grand daddy of all Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG) World of Warcraft (WoW), so I started reading up on MMORPG games.

Little was I prepared for how huge the online communities were in MMORPGs, with MILLIONS of players, creating characters, joining their friends online, & losing themselves in the online worlds of these games.

Nearly all MMORPG have integrated central story lines, continuous character progression, & hundreds (if not thousands) of separate side-quest objectives to play, all without the need of a Game Master, the game developers handle all those time-consuming chores. All players need do is play the game.

At first, I started playing just WoW, but soon I succumbed to the allure of another huge MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (FFXIV: ARR).

As the name implies, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is part of a franchise of numerous Final Fantasy video games. Unlike most of this franchise, which are standalone single player RPGs, the 2002 Final Fantasy XI & 2013 Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn are both MMORPGs.

Contrasting the vintage 2004 WoW game mechanics & graphics to that of the decade newer FFXIV: ARR, there is no real comparison for many new players of which of the two MMO games to play. Between the game’s beautiful graphics, music, & writing, FFXIV: ARR completely immerses players in the expansive world, characters, & story of its mythical land of “Eorzea”.

Within the first months of entry into FFXIV: ARR, I had recruited my wife & many of our friends to play the game as well. It became nearly a nightly ritual to login, form a party of friends in game and take on some quest, dungeon, or trial.

In the next 2 years, even more of our friends would join, helping us form an in-game “Free Company”, together clearing all the game’s original 50th level endgame content. But far from being the proverbial “game over” you would expect, the game developers had spent those years creating even more content, in the form of many add-on patches & full game expansions, like Heavensward, Stormblood, & Shadowbringers.

Although this additional content continued to entertain us, this is where my cautionary tale begins. One must remember that MMO game developers are businesses, with the responsibility of maintaining game servers, in-game support, creating new content, growing their player base, and most of all, making a profit.

No MMORPG are truly free-to-play (F2P) for the reasons stated in the paragraph above. Different MMO game developers use various methods to pay their bills.

Some company’s MMO games are F2P, that are free to download, install, and play, but count on micro-transactions of an in-game store to sell digital character outfits, emotes, pets, & mounts. As long as players continue to buy a sufficient amount of these items, the MMO game will stay afloat.

Other MMO games opt for a Buy-to-Play (B2P) model, where players buy the base game and optionally pay for additional Down Loadable Content (DLC) & game expansions. Once again, the MMO game will only continue online if it stays profitable.

But one of the oldest styles of MMO game monetization is subscription. Where players are required in some MMO games, and optionally in others, to pay a monthly subscription fee, usually $10.00 to $15.00 per player/month, to play that MMO game, or gives players some advantages in-game that makes the game much more fun or advantageous to play.

You might be asking yourself this, “why is he explaining all these different MMO game monetization methods for a review of a single MMO game?” The answer is simple, FFXIV: ARR uses all the above to keep itself profitable. Players buy the base game, pay for all expansions, make real money micro-transactions for in-game items on the “MogStation” store, and MUST pay a monthly subscription in order to play.

So, one day while discussing with a friend our Free Company’s next duty in FFXIV: ARR, they said they were going to take a break from playing and try some other MMO game instead. When I pressed them further for a reason, they admitted that the constant cost of playing FFXIV: ARR was becoming a little too much for the few times a month they got to play it.

A little shocked by this news, I then reviewed my own cost of playing FFXIV: ARR over the last 3 years... Purchasing the game & all expansions for Christine, myself, & gifting some to friends, check… Throw in all those “MogStation” store micro-transactions over the years, yikes… Add in all the monthly subscription fees for us & a few we also gifted, OMG… The total tally for us playing FFXIV: ARR for 3 years was over $5,000.00!

In the final analysis, is FFXIV: ARR fun and worth playing, hell yes! It is a beautifully realized fantasy RPG and fully immersive MMO game experience, full of the standard Final Fantasy swordplay, magic, Chocobos, and sentient crystals, that you can share with family/friends, giving players many hundreds of hours of blissful play. Can it be expensive to play, you bet it can(!), especially if you are not watching your cost closely.

My major take-away for this review of this amazing MMO game follows. Pay ONLY for what you need to play FFXIV: ARR. Buy add-ons items & expansions when you NEED them and not one minute earlier. Subscribe when you & your friends have an abundance of time to play it & let your sub lapse when you do not. These measures should help you save a fair amount of money & enjoy the game even more.

For those of you reading this that might still be hesitant because of the possible cost of playing this MMO game, I have some good news for you! FFXIV: ARR does offer a Free Trial membership with no expiration time, that allows players to create characters of all classes and play a lot of the game up to the 60th level, including the entire Heavensward expansion.

There are quite a few limitations with this Free Trial membership. But, you DO get an awful lot of content included and without having to pay a penny. So much so, I always recommend new FFXIV: ARR players to start with the Free Trial membership at first. Then, if you like what you see, buy it & pay the sub a month at a time.

Even with taking all this into consideration, I do highly recommend players try Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. But, paraphrasing that ""drink"" part of those beer commercials we see on U.S. television, remember to ""play (& pay) responsibly.”",high school college day late 1970 early 80 spent hundred hour sitting table bunch friend paper pencil role game dungeon dragon game continued education pursued working career required master scenario designer consuming worldly responsibility took priority year 2016 invited friend join grand daddy massively multiplayer online role game mmorpg world warcraft wow started reading mmorpg game prepared huge online community mmorpgs million player creating character joining friend online losing online world game nearly mmorpg integrated central line continuous progression hundred thousand separate side objective master developer handle consuming chore player started wow soon succumbed allure huge mmorpg final fantasy xiv realm reborn ffxiv arr name implies final fantasy xiv realm reborn franchise numerous final fantasy video game unlike franchise standalone single rpgs 2002 final fantasy xi 2013 final fantasy xiv realm reborn mmorpgs contrasting vintage 2004 wow mechanic graphic decade newer ffxiv arr real comparison new player game beautiful graphic music writing ffxiv arr completely immerses player expansive world character mythical land eorzea month entry ffxiv arr recruited wife friend became nearly nightly ritual login form party friend dungeon trial next 2 year friend join helping form company clearing original 50th endgame content far proverbial expect developer spent year creating content form add patch expansion heavensward stormblood shadowbringers additional content continued entertain cautionary tale begin remember developer business responsibility maintaining server support creating new content growing base profit mmorpg truly f2p reason stated paragraph different developer various method pay bill company game f2p download install count micro transaction store digital outfit emotes pet mount long player continue sufficient item stay afloat game opt b2p model player base optionally pay additional loadable content dlc expansion continue online stay profitable oldest style monetization subscription player required game optionally others pay monthly subscription fee usually 10 00 15 00 per give player advantage make fun advantageous asking explaining different monetization method single answer simple ffxiv arr us profitable player base pay expansion real micro transaction item mogstation store pay monthly subscription order discussing friend company next duty ffxiv arr break pressed admitted constant cost ffxiv arr time shocked news reviewed cost ffxiv arr last 3 year purchasing expansion christine gifting friend check throw mogstation store micro transaction year yikes add monthly subscription fee gifted omg total tally ffxiv arr 3 year 5 000 00 final analysis ffxiv arr fun worth hell yes beautifully realized fantasy fully immersive standard final fantasy swordplay magic chocobos sentient crystal share family friend giving player hundred hour blissful expensive bet especially watching cost closely major amazing follows pay ffxiv arr add ons item expansion minute earlier subscribe friend abundance sub lapse measure help save fair enjoy reading hesitant possible cost good news ffxiv arr offer trial membership expiration allows player create character class 60th including entire heavensward expansion limitation trial membership awful content included pay penny recommend new ffxiv arr player trial membership pay sub taking consideration highly recommend player final fantasy xiv realm reborn paraphrasing drink beer commercial television remember pay responsibly,2,0.9988

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I've never been an MMO player. Briefly played Tera - liked it but found progression slow - and briefly WoW - disliked the combat, just felt like button mashing. I also played Mabinogi for a short while and really disliked the game's mechanics. One day I felt the urge to play one and I knew a friend was planning to start this so I bought it but neither of us started. 9 days ago a friend of mine was looking for people who wanted to start and I decided that if it was in my steam list I may as well try it out. I am now 95.9 hours in according to steam and I love it. I've just hit level 50 and got my Paladin armour and I'm still looking at all the content coming up. As I speak server is going down to patch even more content into the game. So here's the detailed review:

[b]Story[/b]

The story is a good one as far as MMOs go (based on my limited experience). I'd equate it to WoW in some ways as FFXIV builds off of an already established lore but is still extremely easy for new players to get into. I don't want to say much about it but Square Enix really put work into making a good story. It teeters a bit at times, especially around the middle (lv30-40 is a bit slow) but it's very enjoyable if you get into it.

[b]Classes[/b]

Combat classes are fairly traditional: tank, support, ranged DPS and melee DPS. Still within these wider definitions, each individual class is fairly unique. To add to this you are not restricted to the classes that you pick at the beginning of the game. You will unlock the ability to train any and all classses as you wish which allows for a lot of flexibility. But ""Oh, the grind ¬¬"" you say. Nope, all classes trained beyond the first receive exp gain bonuses which really speeds up the process. This is alongside the quick levelling options which I'll discuss in a later section. 

There's more though! All combat classses have a progression called a ""Job"" which is earned by reaching a certain point in the story, getting a class to lv30 and the corresponding second class to lv15, and then finishing the job quest. It's actually really easy to do and it encourages you to try a different role.

All combat classes are unique and don't overlap much at all which is great.

As for crafting classes, there's a fair few of them and I have limited experience of them right now but crafting itself isn't just sit there and wait for things to appear. There's an active process and is fairly enjoyable. Just like the combat classes, new skills are unlocked and it becomes a sort of strategic minigame. Quick synthesis for bulk items is available as well so you don't have to do it for each item.

Still I can see crafting becoming tedious. repetitive and boring at some point but that's no different from any other mmo. Also, unlike the combat classes, the crafting classes aren't really unique.

[b]Combat[/b]

The combat system is targetted, which honestly I was sceptical about when first going in as I'm not a big fan of targetted combat but it grows on you. This is mostly to do with how the game feels since you really have to think about movement, positioning, skill orders, skill timing etc. from more or less the beginning of the game. This is a big deal and playing the first 20 or so levels in WoW feels boring and just mashing buttons in a certain order. The 2.5sec global cooldown adds to the strategic element of it too. You have more time to think and decide what move would be appropriate, but you also have a longer window to be punished for choosing the wrong skill. I honestly think this is way more fun and interesting compared to other games with a much smaller global cooldown.

Another important point is that this game is very controller friendly. It's on the PS3/PS4 with cross platform support so that would be why. I personally play with a controller and it feels very smooth. I don't feel too overwhelmed with skills and I've unlocked all of them for my job with 3 cross skills in use as well (I have 2 full hotbars but it's very easy to switch between them). It's down to preference in the end but the option is really nice to have.

[b]Levelling[/b]

There are so many different ways to level it's crazy. Though the main story quest is compulsory, there are loads of side quests available.

If you think quests are repetitive you can switch over to doing FATES which are events that spawn that give gil (money) and experience to everyone that completes them based on the level of participation.

If that's boring there are many different dungeons to do with solid exp gain on all of them. Duty roullete will give you bonus exp once a day so deffo worth doing that.

No? Then you can do levequests which are contracts to do certain things in certain places which you can get by using one of your levequest allowances (which refill regularly). Levequests are available to crafting classes too and are considered the fastest ways to level them.

Still not enough? Then Guildhests might be for you. These are very similar to levequests but you're put into a duty (instance) with a party and asked to do it as a group. There's a daily bonus on guildhest roullete as well so that's good.

Also, the first time you do a certain dungeon, levequest or guildhest you'll be granted bonus exp which is always a definite plus.

Still too slow? Not enough content? Too repetitive? Well if you're that hard to please then I guess I should tell you that there are these things called logs which grant bonus exp for doing certain things. A hunting log will ask you to kill x number of y, while a crafting log will give you the list of everything you can craft. The king of all these is the challenge log which refreshes weekly and gives you a lot of exp for completing tasks like ""complete 3 dungeons"" or ""complete 5 levequests"".

Honestly there are so many different ways to level that players can pick something that suits them and though some can get repetitive they're fun for the most part.

[b]Endgame[/b]

You only need to google the game to see the amount of post lv50 content. The game's been out for about a year and there are things constantly being added. The first expansion is coming out soon so keep an eye out for that. Most people will tell you that lv50 is just the beginning, and they're probably right. I'm only just getting into the endgame and I look forward to everything coming up.

[b]Price[/b]

Well. This is the one major downside I see to the game. It's very expensive. Though nothing new for an mmo, it is a pretty heavy financial commitment compared to most other steam games out there. Especially considering you can get Tera, Mabinogi, and loads of other mmos for free now. You can buy gametime online from other sellers for a bit cheaper but it's still expensive. I suggest playing the trial to give you a better understanding of whether you'll enjoy it. I highly suggest it and will be playing it, but I can appreciate that a few years ago I could never afford to play a game like this.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

I honestly think this is the first mmo to seriously impress me with its ability to keep you interested. It doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it leave you with nothing to do. Bosses are often really cool and have interesting mechanics, even from an early point in the game. I really do feel that besides the price this game is practically perfect.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Yes its pretty good.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I started playing this game sometime last year after really just wanting something different to play. I was craving an MMO but I was so over WoW's formula at the time and really wanted to take a different approach - read some quests, enjoy some fresh lore and a fresh world. In my 6-7 years of playing WoW I never read quests, roleplayed, etc until Classic came out and I played with a friend of mine - we decided to play it how we wanted, and didn't want to be meta-slaves of sorts. The reason I'm mentioning this will make more sense later.

When starting FF14 I just wanted to come in with an open mind; the graphics were kind of jarring (compared to what I'm used to) and I could understand why people sort of didn't like the aesthetic of the game. That being said; I pushed on and just decided ""well, it's free and I'm bored so why not"". I also had a friend who SWORE by the game - so I had a lot of patience going in I think. Furthermore; the combat seemed slow (with a very long global cooldown) and limited spells but again; I was like lvl 5 - my expectations weren't very high.

As I went through my starting area and got accustomed with the UI/combat I was reading the quests and watching the cut-scenes and already I found myself getting interested/invested in characters such as Y'shtola or Urianger. While I would be lying if I said I knew what was going on; my friend re-assured me that if I paid attention it'd all pay off.

Little down the line; I got through the slug-fest which was ARR Post Patch(es) but during this time I honestly didn't mind it that much. Looking back (and watching my other friends play through it) I don't miss it, but at the time my friend reassured me that Heavensward and the following expansions are a night & day situation and that once this is over it's only up and up. On top of that; through the cutscenes toward the end of post patch ARR I had the sense that something big was happening in the plot - and I was right, and God was it epic. 

I then jumped into Heavensward, which was as promised; amazing (and totally a night and day experience). The story takes a huge jump and you can tell that the game was really starting to develop into a larger plot. I started playing a Ninja as I heard they were one of the most difficult classes in the game (and because I started as a Gladiator combat was quite slow) which I was very keen on. 

A few friends and I started an FC (equivalent of a guild in WoW) and a lot of them were either first time MMO players or just very casual. I told them I wanted to do some hard content as I heard FF14 Raiding content is super fun and challening. We jumped into the Trials first; Titan, Ifrit, Leviathan, etc all on minilvl + no echo and holy f*** at this point I was already having fun but the raids REALLY sold me. We also jumped into our first multi-fight raid (Raids are multi instanced fights rather than trials which are generally just 1 fight). We started on Coils of Bahamut minilvl and no echo and again; an amazing experience. Raiding in FF14 has been some of my favourite MMO moments across 8-9 years of playing the genre and I think that says a lot. We spent about 3-4 months playing together pretty much 10-12 hours a day (when we could and when we weren't working etc) and it was just like being young at High School again; which was surprising cause a game couldn't do that for me for a long long time - not even WoW anymore. 

After what felt like a 3-4 month non stop gaming session me and my FC took a break (a few stayed and played) but after 1-2 months we all came back and I completed Stormblood. 

Stormblood was great; the characters were awesome and some of my favourite moments (at this point in time) were actually from this expansion. I felt some of the hits in the story hit a bit harder than in Heavensward (except for one which I wont spoil which literally brought me to tears!) so it's safe to say I enjoyed this expansion. And now it was finally time for Shadowbringers.

Shadowbringers was just absolutely stupid in terms of Storytelling. The ups and downs, the twists, the character development, the attachment you feel to the characters around you, the story beats, EVERYTHING. Without spoiling anything by the time I finished Shadowbringers I was convinced without a shadow of a doubt that this story (despite never playing any other Final Fantasy games) was the best story-game I had EVER played. Specifically the finale of Shadowbringers in one of the last boss fights; it got to the cutscenes and I was on discord with my friend yelling like ""OH SHIT - LETS GO"" and the music kicks in and just absolutely unbelievable. 

Endwalker was more of the same; unbelievable story-telling and just amazing music, the scenery, the pacing, I could go on and on. 

This review now is getting long so I'll wrap it up; overall this game is amazing.
Here are some pro's and cons:

Pros:
- HUGE main story; 200-350 hours roughly of content 
- Simple but fun combat 
- No need to roll ALT characters (can have every job/class on once character and swap them as you play)
- Every raid/trial being relevant content (the amount of content is INSANE)
- Great art style (jarring to begin with for some; but just forget about it and embrace it for what it is)
- Friendly community (much less elitest than other MMO's I've played - but these people still exist)
- Great company - you can tell they LOVE the game (compared to other companies...) 
- Amazing additional content; housing/gambling/roleplaying/new-story-plus/achievements/transmog/etc 
- Every role/job is needed - META does exist but is not as punishing as other games, play whatever you want!
- SO MUCH SH** TO DO
- Great profession system 
- No DPS meters etc / no toxicity when it comes to raiding as can result in being banned (can be both a good and bad thing as discussed in many youtube videos/threads online) 
- Free trial is like so much content it's retarded 

Cons: 
- For people who don't enjoy story; there is a slight barrier to entry considering content is locked behind main story quests
- Combat is slow to start (long GCD's of 2.5 seconds) 
- A lot of user interface stuff (it gets introduced slowly; but can be overwhelming)
- Post A Realm Reborn can be suffering at the best of times 
- Not a lot of addon support (as mentioned in Pros) 
- SO MUCH SH** TO DO 
- Some people will tell you ""you have to play the game this way"" etc, just ignore them - they exist in every game.

I honestly can't think of many bad things to say the game apart from the stuff above. If you are thinking of playing a new MMO and want something fresh - honestly save yourself the time and don't try LOTR/Albion/whatever just play this game - it's unbelievably good and you will not regret it.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"[h1]An update +400 hours later[/h1]

I find myself going back to FFXIV more simply because it respects my time more these days given I have less hours to play video games. 

There has been a big influx of players coming to FFXIV and I am very excited as I hope Blizzard is paying attention and SE is getting more feedback of what people want. 

This review still holds very true to how I feel for both games and as a ""refugee"" though I don't consider myself one anymore.

The only thing I'll add to this now is anyone looking to try it out, stop listening to the echo chambers of MMO players, do what you want, and I hope you have fun if you do try.

[h1] The Story Of a WoW Refugee [/h1]

If you're reading this you're probably coming from another MMORPG and just feel burnt out. I was a WoW refugee myself, feeling the burn out and the grind of BoA and just couldn't do it anymore then the skies parted and Square Enix extended a hand to help bring me out of the darkness.

FFXIV Online is a savior to those looking to play an MMORPG with lots to do, things to learn/explore, and just a great community.

Let's break it down

[h1] The Good [/h1]
[list]
    [*] The base game A Realm Reborn (and it's post questline 7th astral) will keep you REALLY busy. No need to buy expansions when just learning
    [*] FFXIV will teach you your role. You're supposed to feel weak at the beginning, you're just starting out, but as you progress you will learn more and more. It's really intuitive
    [*] Runs on a lot of different machines. Seriously you don't need the powerful machine to play this enjoyably but if you have one it looks really pretty
    [*] The community. This alone can sell this game, people in this game just want to chill and have a good time. It's all about learning and progressing so everyone is super friendly since they're in the same boat
    [*] No shortage of things to do. Whether you're in to PvP, PvE, gathering materials, crafting things, collecting cute pets, etc this game has NO SHORTAGE of things to go and do
    [*] Both Keyboard/Mouse AND gamepad support (AND YES THE GAMEPAD SUPPORT IS GOOD). I use game pad when doing collecting jobs to just chill and have some fun but you can easily flip between the both if you prefer
    [*] CUSTOMIZE THE HUD. To your hearts content. Everyone plays different and you can customize your hud for YOUR play style 
    [*] 1 Character to rule them all. NO NEED FOR ALTS FOR DIFFERENT JOBS! Seriously your character and it's job arent locked. Make that cute character and then flip back and forth between what role you wanna do!
    [*] Play the way YOU want. (This has been said so many times it's annoying now)
[/list]

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
    [*] The amount of stuff can be off putting in the beginning. They throw a lot at you right off the bat and learning to prioritize what to do can be stressful for newer players
    [*] THE ODD ASSHOLE. 1/100 players may be a jerk from time to time but don't worry too much about them, the community shuns them
    [*] No cross data server yet, hopefully coming. That being said cross world on the same data center is a thing so it's not too bad
[/list]

[h1] The Ugly [/h1]
[i] These are neither good nor bad things so take them how you will and are my opinion.[/i]
[list]
    [*] Managing your versions/subscription from Mogstation with Steam isn't intuitive and they have a bunch of different sites which can be confusing which one does what right off the bat. 
    [*] Market board and how to sell stuff is a bit weird to get used to in later game
    [*] I've had a lot of green leafs ask ""how do i get mount"" / ""how do i <insert thing>"". They're things you learn by trial and error but SE should look in to helping ease that for newer players.
    [*] Can become repetitive in late / end game. I know it's a game to be played how you like but take a lesson from me and mix it up, if you're constantly doing the same thing you'll get burnt out.
    [*] There's a bit of a time gap between major content patches in expansions. There's always something to do but the major content patches can take a few months each time.
    [*] By the end of Stormblood you'll be sick of cut scenes. 
[/list]


[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]
Final Fantasy XIV Online is a decent well rounded MMORPG welcoming to both experienced and newer MMORPG players with no shortage of things to do. Whether you're a Role Player, someone who likes to chop down trees for materials, or want to smack enemies with big awesome abilities Final Fantasy XIV Online has something to offer for everyone.

The base game also comes with 30 days of game time [i](you get 15 more days for free if you hit level 30 within 30 days)[/i] and with a decent entry price why not check it out.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,it's ok,ok,2,0.296
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"With over 11,500 hours played since Realm Reborn, I'll throw in my 2 cents.

I started this game off with the free trial with no expectations, knowledge of the game, or the online community other than the server Balmung was 'the' RP hotspot. Being an RPer myself, I was curious to see what it's like but I had no plans to play past the trial period at that time.

The Pros:
- Beautiful Graphics, great soundtrack.
- PvE is chocked full of simple and fun game mechanics, and even more challenging elements offered to the 'hardcore raiders'
- Lots of different things to do accommodating your interests, goals and play styles. (IE: alternate classes, or gathering and crafting professions)
- Glamour prism system is great for the creative folk that wanna dress up their characters.
- Fun mini games at the Gold Saucer
- Great story content (if you enjoy watching cut-scenes and want to follow the craziness unraveling with every patch)
- Standard leveling is not as grindy as most MMOs I've played in the past.
- One of the Best RP communities I've seen for an MMO (see: Hydaelyn Roleplayers)
- Lalafells

CONS:
- With the game's popularity rising, so too does the odds of being matched with random people with WoW-tier toxicity.
- Player housing is -very- limited, but there is a timeout that make them available for people that wanna try their luck (good luck though) Only downside is the previous owner loses their home, logging in before the timer resets prevents this however.
Which is great for the folk on extended breaks, but frustrating for the folk that want a house.
- End game grinds are grindy
- No world PvP elements (but that could be another 'pro' for some folk)

If you can get past the cons, (needless to say that I did) Final Fantasy XIV can make for a very fun, unique and interesting experience. 

And I happily recommend this over any other MMO currently in today's market.

 - The long written part! -

Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is the completely reworked and almost entirely remade version of Square Enix's latest MMO. Initially it came out, just as Final Fantasy XIV, on the 22nd of September 2010. Unfortunately, it was absolutely terrible, and is still regarded as one of the worst MMO's in recent years, if not ever. The UI was particularly bad, but the problems were pretty much onmipresent. Graphcis were gorgeous but ridiculously unoptimised, bad gameplay mechanics, etc. However! This is NOT that game! I can't stress this enough!

In December 2010, Naoki Yoshida was brought in as the new Director and producer, to try and make the game better. While some of these changes did start to make the game more playable, Square Enix, feeling (rightly so, some would say) very ashamed about this initial release (which I will call 1.0 from now on), and also worried about the damage it would do to the Final Fantasy brand, deciced to close down this game and completely rebuild it from the ground up. The servers for 1.0 closed on November the 11th 2012. 

The rerelease, called A Realm Reborn (the current game!), launched on August 27th 2013, with a PS3 version coming out on the same day. With the transition to the new game, Square implemented lots of cool in game lore explanations for the upcoming dramatic changes, and it is now a part of the game's story (which I think is really cool).

ARR is a fantastic MMO in nearly every aspect. It does, of course, have it's problems, but I have yet to find an MMO which doesn't (not even WoW). I have been playing MMO's since Everquest, and would say ARR is now my favourite of them all, from WoW to EQ to SWTOR to EVE, etc. I feel they have gotten the formula just right.

For the purchase on Steam you get the game itself, along with a month of playtime, so I would definitely recommend this if you think it might be for you (there is also a trial on the Square Enix website, but this would mean you don't have to reinstall if youstick with it!). 

In terms of gameplay, it follows what I think would be fairly described as a rough following of the Western style MMO formula, with some key differences:

 - Classes are not ""one-per-character"". On your character you can switch between and unlock every single combat, gathering and crafting class within the game, and even use some of the skills you have unlocked cross-class. It's actively encouraged to do this, and having more than one character is not really of any use, unless you just wish to have characters of different races, or something like that.

- Great matchmaking system for instanced content, all instanced content can be tackled using player made groups, or with the ingame matchmaking. It has (for me at least) always been efficient and works well to build groups for all content that needs it.

- Levelling feels reasonably varied. There are lots of different ways to level, from simple mob grinding (not recommended!), Main Story Quests, side quests, Levequests (repeatable minor tasks), dungeons, exploring, FATE's (random area specific objectives), etc. If you start to feel tired of levelling your ""main"" class, you can switch and level some of your crafting classes, or a different combat one, etc.

- Storyline makes the game feel like a true Final Fantasy game, the Main Story Quests (of which there are many) contain the games main story (although there are plenty of side stories within the games guilds, etc), which, without giving any spoilers, is very enjoyable and definitely held my interest far more than anything like this in any MMO's I have seen, with the exception of maybe SWTOR. Definitely feels like a more story oriented game, which I love. I feel your character has a much more grounded place in the game world!

- Combat, combat is somewhat similar to WoW in the most basic sense, abilities come on a bar, and are used in whichever way you want to fight enemies, heal allies, etc. The global tick rate (global cooldown) is longer than WoW, so if you are used to WoW, you might find it a bit slow to begin with. The abilites in game feel varied and are unlocked at a steady rate, letting you get slowly used to the class you play until you reach endgame. 

- UI, the UI is reasonably good. It provides all of the information you need, but is probably the one point I feel needs the most work. Once you get used to it, it's completely fine, but can be a bit confusing to begin with. It can sometimes feel like there are a lot of menus to click through, but the improvement from 1.0 is so huge, and it does do the job, that I feel it can be overlooked a bit. 

- Game World, the world is beautiful and full of diverse environment. The world is very large, and definitely worth exploring. One issue, is that (mainly at least) because the game is currently supported on PS3 (though this may change in the future), a lot of the world is accessed through loading screens. If you are expecting a WoW-esque free world with no loading screens, you may be dissapointed. To me, it's not a massive deal, but I know for some it could be a problem. The loading screens are not long and I don't feel it detracts much from the overall experience. It is also something that has been mentioned by the devs which could change in the future. For me, the quality of the world is enough to let me look past this problem, but for you it may be different.

- Crafting/Gathering, for me, ARR has one of the best crafting systems I have seen in an MMO. Crafting is done with individual classes representing the different professions, for example Armorsmithing, Cooking, Leatherworking, etc. Gathering is done in a similar fashion with regard to classes, Miner, Botanist and Fisher. The crafting system is very satisying, useful to the actual game experience (not just a money sink, or waste of time), and very complex at the higher levels, with apporpriate levels of reward! The crafting and gathering classes can all be acquired, just like the combat classes, making for a character which is very diverse and can (technically, if you have enough time!) do everything in the game without the need for alts.

- Updates, the game recieves frequent, and large updates. There have been big chunks of content added on a regular schedule, which I would say, puts other MMO's, especially WoW, to shame. The updates come frequently and add lots of content, making it worth the monthly fee, and meaning you never run out of things to do.

Overall I would give this game a 9/10. I think that with a few improvements to the UI and world loading, aswell as minor things like balancing, this could easily be the best MMO that currently exists, and I would heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre.

[h1][u]FF14 Con:[/u][/h1]
[i]Gonna do cons first as that's more important for a should I buy imo[/i]
[b]SLOW AS ****[/b][i]like watching paint dry slow, seriously seriously slow[/i]: 
This con needs it's own subsection as it's slow in so many aspects.
[olist]
[*] Slow/ bland early quest progression - After starting the game as a new player you will spend approx 30-40m doing run to character A for tedious dialogue, now run to character B for some more tedious dialogue and if you are really really lucky you will get to run to character C for..... you guessed it more tedious dialogue. Eventually Character C will send you off for the inevitable kill X amount of adorable critters quest because. hey who likes critters am I right, it's not like Eorzea has P.E.T.A or anything. I know that you are a new low level day 1 adventurer and can hardly be expected to go kill a legendary dragon first day on the job but ""please can you take this note to my mate who is upstairs in the pub"" is a bit rediculous. [i] This changes abit more at late game but not much [/i]
[*] Slow combat - One of the biggest complaints you will hear from anyone about FF14 is the combat. Early level it is excruciatingly tedious. Auto attack speed and damage is roughly to normal, however alot of you moves share a GC and it's set to around 2.5 seconds this is a very long time especially at early level when you only really have a hand full of moves all of which will likely share the same GC. It is worth noting that this becomes less of a bore as you level and get more moves but for a new level 1 player this can be a deal breaker.
[*] Slow Leveling - Leveling in the game can feel like a grindy chore and it's something that alot of people complain about, the game has quests like you would expect from a traditional mmo but honestly most of your Exp will come from a mix of Fates(Public quests) Leves (like quests but not quests, it's a weird pre realm reborn system that hung around) and instances. This isn't exactly a bad thing as personally I would rather run dungeons than kill 10 boars and run back to someone but Exp gain is quiet slow(buy food in the first town and eat it, food increases EXP gain by like 3%, no one tell you this and alot of people miss out on extra EXP  early game) early game theres only like 3 different dungeons so running them repeatedly gets old fast. 

This is more of a gripe than a con but meh, Recently some jack*** dev(clearly someone in the cinematics team) decided that they worked so hard on the main scenario cutscenes. so players should not be able to skip them. This dev is an ***hole and everyone hates him/her.
Also houses cost your soul, ingame and IRL, not even kidding like ridiculously expensive, but alot of people band together and by a guild hall so meh.
[/olist]
Con over now to the pro's, seriously the only real issue is the slowness.

[h1][u]FF14 Pro's:[/u][/h1]
[b]Current Content[/b]
FF14 has some incredible content most of it is end game, like alot of it. I remember playing pre expansions(so just realm reborn) hitting 50 and saying to my friend ""So what's left?"" We looked about and immediatly found out that the game pretty much starts at end game, here is a list and brief info about some of the content:
[olist]
[*] Primals - Although you fight some of the primals (GFs/Summons) through the main storyline, some of them can only be attempted at end game, also you can attempt them on harder difficulties which honestly completely changes the fight and gives loot, primal skinnned gear :).
[*] Classes/Crafting - So orignal day 1 combat classes are split into 2 groups Disciple of War, Disciple of Magic. theses classes evolve once you hit 30. If you feel like you aren't enjoying your current class you can go to the trainer for one of the other classes and they will give you a quest to change class. You won't loose your level in the current class so 1 character can have a max level for all classes if you want to put the time in. Crafting is apparently really fun and an entire game to itself. I've not done it as it's never been my thing in MMO's but apparently it's very good and there are character classes specifically for crafting.
[*] One Character, ALL OF THE THINGS - the game has a multi class system which lets you swap class based on the weapon you use, these cannot be changed mid combat or whilst in a dungeon/instance/raid, however outside of that as long as you've done the class quest to unlock it you're free to switch anytime you like.
[*] Raids - The raids a fun and one of the biggest things going for FF14 is that the instances and raids feel epic, they have interesting mechanics the environments have a feel of grandeur, Good King Moogle Mog is the most epic box fight music you could get, and the general feel while instancing is awesome. 
[*] Chocobo raising - you can dye your chocobo and train it for chocobo racing,
[*] Mini games - This MMO loves it's mini games like seriously loves them, they added a version of the golden saucer from ff7 to the game and they also added a version of the tera master card game. It's pretty fun.
[*] Querky Quests - I complained before about the early level questing being dull but the end game quest are awesome espesially when you start to realise they aren't really there for leveling more for a fun side story. There are alot of really querky and fun quest lines out there so find them and enjoy the oddness.
[*] Outfits and costumes - You can either glamour a single item of gear at a time using a consumable item each time you want to glamour the gear, or you can use the consumable and add the gear piece to your waredrobe, this destorys the gear but makes it accessable to use whenever and doesn't cost to apply.

The game does have PVP, I've never done it tho.
[/olist]
[b]Story[/b]
The Story in FF14 is split 3 ways:
[olist]
[*] Main Story - It's a true final fantasy game, the story line is very enjoyable if story is important to you then you'll love it.That's all I'll say as I don't want to spoil anything. Also dont worry about skipping cutscenes for general story stuff if you wish to save time, you can retire to your character room at the inn and watch them all at once if you like, ok now that's all I'll say on the main story line.
[*] Class Story - Each Class has it's own Story quests cutscenes etc, they are fun introduce some cool characters over all a nice addition to leveling.
[*] Querky Quest - Some of the quest lines are like their own little miniture adventure for example the detetive quest line which probably has the most notoriety. Again I don't want to spoil anything so I'll say no more, but they will probably give you giggle or two.
[/olist]
[b]New Content[/b]
Dev support for this game has been great, probably because it's making square enix so much money that they are actually funneling it back into development.... I know right a company that realises if you want your MMO to do well you've got to add more content, It's quiet refreshing. We get quiet alot of ingame events and things also new story progression which basically covers a build up to the next expansion. 
[b]Community[/b]
The community is amazing, Don't get me wrong like all games some people are toxic but overall the community in FF14 is great. There's a novice global chat that new players are auto added to which high level can opt into being a mentor etc, if you have any question people tend to reply real quick and are genuinely pretty decent in helping others.

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
I would recommend buying FF14 if you enjoy MMO's for the challenging PVE end game content and community aspects, then FF14 is the mmo for you, if you prefer quick in out dungeon runs for loot and lots PVP arenas, I recommend playing WoW.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I was very skeptic to play Final Fantasy XIV at first. Coming from Phantasy Star Online 2 back in 2015, FFXIV looked slow, stiff, and overall not challenging to play. The subscription model made it even harder to justify playing it, as I had always seen monthly subscriptions as a way to milk players' money as much as possible. When I was gifted the game by a friend (there was no free trial back then), I decided to give it a try just to confirm my thoughts. I could not have been more wrong.

Disclaimer: as of writing this, I have around 500 hours of playtime on the standalone version. I've played through two of the first expansions and I'm halfway through Shadowbringers.

As someone who usually ignores stories in video games as they tend to not conform to my standards, I was blown away by how captivating this game's narrative is. It's incredibly refreshing to come across an MMO that not only has a good story, but *knows* it has a good story. FFXIV has no problem throwing you 10 quests in a row where you don't fight a single enemy, because it knows the story alone is enough to keep you interested, and it is absolutely right. Every sentence was crafted to enhance your immersion in the world through character development that goes way beyond what I've come to expect from JRPGs, and story beats that hit you like a truck when you least expect them. If you care in any way about story-driven video games, you cannot miss this game.

The combat, at first, is slow. You'll be pressing the same three buttons over and over for a good couple of hours when you first start this game. While I considered it a problem as an MMO veteran when first starting out, it makes sense as an introduction to non-MMO players, or even people not used to games in general. That said, the game quickly develops on your class' toolkit giving you action after action until you have two hotbars of skills that are all universally useful in the right situations. Some of the more fast-paced classes (Ninja, Astrologian) feel like playing Dance Dance Revolution as a kid, all while dodging whatever the gigantic f*****g monster you're fighting throws at you. I've not yet done end-game raid content, but from what I've seen of my guild mates they expand on this even further.

If you don't play this game, it's completely understandable to be flustered by the payment model. Paying for a game, expansions and a monthly subscription on top of that rings a siren in the ears of any sane consumer, but this is different. Final Fantasy XIV does NOT pull any tricks to keep you subscribed. You get a good game with a huge amount of content and that's *it*. If you play for the story, you can subscribe while there's story content and simply stop paying until the next patch. If you play for raids and end-game content, you can pause your sub once you're tired or feel like playing other games.

Three years ago, a japanese player asked YoshiP (the game's director, Naoki Yoshida) how to stay motivated to keep playing in between patches, when content naturally dries out for a little while. His response was the following:

""It's alright not to play it everyday. Since it's just a game, you can stop forcing yourself if it's hard on you to keep that up. Rather, it'll just pile up unnecessary stress if you limit yourself into playing just that one game since there are so many other games out there. So, do come back and play it to your heart's content when the major patch kicks in, then stop it to play other games before you got burnt out, and then come back for another major patch. This will actually make me happier, and in the end, I think this is the best solution I can answer for keeping your motivation up for the game."" (source: /u/elevenmile on /r/ffxiv)

Reading this response is what made me realize what kind of experience I was paying for. In PSO2, to play end game content you *have* to log in at certain times of the day where such content is available, otherwise you miss out completely. After playing for years I grew resentful of the game because it felt more like a job than an enjoyment for me, yet I couldn't quit because I'd be behind if I did. In Final Fantasy XIV, you're experiencing the world on your own terms. No pressure, no time gated content, no manipulative tricks to keep you subscribed. If you don't feel like playing, just don't. The developers very clearly respect the player's time and it shows in game.

I can't force you to play this game, but I hope my thoughts helped you decide for yourself. Even if you ultimately decide to not play it, I recommend you watch Noclip's FINAL FANTASY XIV Documentary on YouTube. The development cycle of FFXIV and how it went from a financial disaster to SquareEnix's biggest hit is a great story.

[b]Buy this game if:[/b]

+ You're familiar with the franchise and you enjoy building two characters by (also) tailoring their equipment and skills;
+ You're not familiar with the franchise and you're not looking for an isometric hack 'n' slash type game;
+ You're interested into knowing more about Norse (and ancient Greek) mythology;

[b]Don't buy the game if:[/b]

- you don't want to play an open world game which revolves around topics such as: parenthood, hard childhood and abandon along with violent scenes and gameplay;
- you enjoy fighting hordes of enemies instead of enganging smaller groups of foes;
- you aren't into items and skills' optimization;
- you've loved the cinematic QTE boss kills from GOW 3 as in this game they'll be almost absent;

Verdict: 9

Time required to finish the main game: 15/20 hrs (depending on which difficulty setting you've decided to play)
Time required to complete it at 100%: 40-45 hours (my case)

Longer version:

1 - where does GOW start from?

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2906705146

Kratos, after the events of the previous chapter of the serie has become a [u]wifeless dad living in Midgard [/u], which is the Earth of the Norse cosmology. One day, his and his son's life revolving around gathering and hunting into forests abruptly changes.


Here's another spoiler free example:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2906705862


2 - here's why the game has been so unforgettable:

a) [b] Character development[/b] - Kratos has reached another level of complexity and maturity, both from his physical and emotional standpoint. Think of him as a veteran who came home after being deployed for too long while being left alone with his own regrets,remorse and traumas;
b) [b] Fatherhood and trauma[/b] - Kratos himself isn't the only protagonist as his son plays a key role both for him into combat;
c)[b] Norse lore[/b] - Storytelling has multiple ways of unraveling itself: via main/side characters, their own thoughts, fears,through panels, paintings, tapestries, cinematics and written notes, always making the narration fluid and diversified;
d) [b]side activites[/b]  -  missions very often lead to remarkable rewards and well thought cinematics and dialogues;
e) [b] immersion [/b] - all the few side characters are all well written and deep rooted into the sotry and lore; it's easy to relate even to the most evil ones given how well the acting and the voice acting has been curated;
f) [b] scenery and navigation[/b] - the world is amazing, epic yet never reduntant, the backtracking is never dull as there are well placed fast travel points;

1817070,Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered,"Had no intention of touching this game but I got a free copy of it so I gave it a spin, If I knew this game was as good as it was I'd have bought it years ago. I played on Amazing difficulty and did 100% in the main story and all DLCs.

Pros:
- The movement system is incredibly well made, the physics are damn near flawless and it's so intuitive that after a few days you don't even have to think about swinging and zipping around the city.
- The skill tree actually expands your gameplay incredibly well, you unlock so many new features that you can weave into your own unique fighting style and it's endless fun.
- The combat system is *basically* flawless. This game rewards players who don't button mash, but it's not a mindless combo memorisation game either. 
- The gadgets are actually very, very, very good. They don't interrupt your combat at all, they enhance it greatly. 
- Stealth is very fun in this game, just try it, it's very rewarding and not too time consuming.
- It's not a Ubisoft game, so the side quests are actually pretty good, especially in the DLC.

Cons:
- The spidey-sense/dodging mechanic is SOMETIMES flawed. It works super well early game, but sometimes it's misleading. 
- Only about 4-6 suit abilities out of 20+ have any actual use in-game. 
- Sometimes buildings and physical structures get in the way of a takedown, it's not game breaking, but frustrating when my stealth gets ruined because of a stubborn fence.
- Missing a dodge that JUST popped up and getting gangbanged down to 1hp was not fun. Silver Lining DLC Outposts :|
- Screwball Challenges got very annoying in the DLC

Advice:
- Take your time learning the combat properly, you won't finish the game by button mashing.
- Use your gadgets from early game
- Don't rely on spidey-sense completely, pay attention to your surroundings and learn crowd control.
- If you want to go for 100%, do the crimes as they pop up from the beginning. In the main story each section of Manhattan has 20 crimes each split between 4 factions, do them asap.
- Try new things constantly, don't get stuck in your comfort zone with combat.

TL;DR: Play it.

2072450,Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth,"It pains me to do this, but I do not support what Sega has done. I want everyone to be aware of a few things. There are 3 difficulty levels and all 3 difficultly levels are locked behind NG+, so there is no way to change the difficulty without paying for NG+, and beating the game. The way that Sega has chosen to deal with this is scummy. In the US NG+ is $20, so if you purchased the base game, and you want to be able change the difficulty well you have to pony up $90 or buy the deluxe edition for $84.99 (this is your cheapest option). My interpretation of this is that the deluxe version is the base game since it is ""feature complete"" while the actual base version is the up-sell where they up-sell you NG+ to make the most profit off of you. Of course there is the $109 version which I personally didn't want to deal with that version because I don't care about the optional DLC. Depending on what you want you are either stuck with $90 (this is including NG+), $84.99 or the $109 version, this is why imo I believe the $84.99 version is the ""base"" version.

If you don't care about NG+, difficulty or achievements locked behind the NG+ mode, and you want to buy this game then by all means purchase the $69.99 version. If you have any doubt that you may buy NG+ in the future save yourself the money and just pay the $84.99. Why can't these corporations and CEO's just release a feature complete game like BG3 without all of the greedy monetization. 

Had Sega not pulled this scam move, I would have purchased the $69.99 version, but I also would have been more inclined to buy the optional DLC packs. Now, I want nothing to do with the DLC packs, other than the NG+ mode. They have taken enough of my money.

Only ~10 hours in but I'm having a hell of a lot more fun than I did with 7, especially the Hawaii map. Everything is much more fleshed out. Gotta say, whatever game Kiryu finds himself in, his combat is always the most satisfying. His different fighting styles from 0 and Kiwami make a triumphant return in turn based, and RGG adapted into the new combat spectacularly. The styles fill different roles, and his job by far is the most versatile in the game, bar none. Ichiban's job is, as usual, middle of the road. He's got good attacks and fine support abilities, nothing too out of the ordinary. If you somehow liked LAD's combat, this is an upgrade.

2072450,Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth,"finished the game, my original opinion stands, its really fun.

the new UI is really good, although in my opinion i kind of miss that ""jrpg schizo"" feel that LAD had, but i dont think that really matters considering the many other upgrades. the sound of the new UI is really nice as well, i wouldnt call it better than LAD, id call it on par.

i miss some of the old minigames from LAD, such as the theatre, dragon kart, or even property management, but IW does its own thing and i personally think it came out really good either way. dragon kart shouldve stayed in IW, thats all im saying.

really love the new system for the turn based, its no longer wait for AI to move out of enemys way and do a skill to murder half everyone, its more engaging now which i personally really love. kiryu breaking the turn based system skill is also really dope, but i wouldve really liked it if the hype meter would fill up quicker for Kiryu than everyone else considering that skill, but its fine, I hope in yakuza 9 Ichiban gains a similar skill, if a yakuza 9 happens.

a few things i dont like about IW though is the fact you cannot go back to yokohama or kamuro as Ichiban period. Ichiban can only explore hawaii, Kiryu yokohama and kamuro, and thats it. whilst it makes sense considering the story, limiting the use of my goat Ichi Bum in yokohama just kinda sucks. im aware you play as him for a bit in yokohama before leaving for hawaii, but you cannot EVER do that again unless you buy the dlc and start new game +. oh right, and also the fact new game + and difficulties are locked behind a damn DLC, like, come on sega. that just kinda sucks. also jobs feel kind of ""useless"" in this game, with the exception of a few skills to inherit to the main jobs. i never had this feeling of just wanting to stay as the main job everyone had in LAD, i was always switching, but IW makes the main jobs so damn powerful and actually good, i feel like its just straight up worthless to switch unless you want an electric skill on Nanba or something similar.
- update - i dont like the fact kiryu has NO ""side stories"". i understand kiryus supposed to be the side kind of important character that RGG is sending off yap yap, but at the same time, if you give him two cities to explore but no side missions at ALL its kind of.. weird? i dont realy like that, but I guess the bucket list was good enough to be fair, i just really wish there was more content in kamuro.

a few things i do like is the fact you arent getting repeats of the same skill, but just more powerful. like with Ichi Bhums first hero bat skill, it just grows more powerful and you arent gonna get it again but with an EXTREME tag. also, the fact those ""LOW, MEDIUM, HARD, EXTREME"" tags sometimes just straight up lie is hilarious to me. you can use IchachBumms lowest MP skill and still kill a guy if you are strong enough and have a high level bat equipped, which if you dont, youre probably not finishing the game.
- update - the side missions in hawaii are awesome, theyre all really good period. the bucket list for kiryu and the bucket what-ever its called with date and the life missions are just really good. i hope in y9 if kiryu comes back we see him actually happy.

the ending and finale is peak but kinda weak on ichis side thats about it

2072450,Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth,"So after 60.5 hours I finally beat the main story so I figured I would write a review now that Ive experienced a great deal of the content. This review may contain trailer spoilers, but I dont want to talk about other main story spoilers because its best to experience it for yourself.

If you're reading this, you've likely already played some or all of the previous mainline Yakuza games, and as this is a sequal to Yakuza: Like a Dragon/7. I will assume you have already played that. 

Story: I dont know if I would say this story is better than 7's, I would say they are hitting on different themes. In this game, Kiryu has been diagnosed with cancer and have only a short time remaining, and this is brought up multiple times through dialogue and story beats. Coupled with Ichiban's story of going to Hawaii to reunite with his long lost mother, and an interwoven crime drama makes for a interesting, albeit slow, story line. For about the first half of the game, Kiryu and Ichiban are together, but at around chapter 7-8 the two split up. With Ichiban and company staying in Hawaii, and Kiryu and his gang staying in Ijincho until premium adventure, with different chapters dedicated to the other party, like Yakuza 0 did. I have to admit that In terms of story, It was well done, though while writing this, I feel like there are some things that were sort of core to the story not being answered or left generally vague for both of the main protagonists. Again, Im going to avoid spoilers, but I think those that have beaten the game can understand where I am coming from.

Combat: The bread and butter of most Yakuza games, but especially the turn based ones. To sum it up, Yakuza 7 walked so that Yakuza 8 could run. Most every complain from 7's combat has been completely fixed. 

In Yakuza 7, you carried over certain job skills permenently after getting certain jobs to certain ranks. Most of these were useless and just clocked up your menu. Now, there is a similar system. Instead of carrying over EVER skill permanently, your allotted a certain number of slots based on your personality attributes, so instead of having 30+ dead skills in your menu youll never use, now you can have (I believe) 10 skills of your choice, so that covers multiple attributes, weapon types, and buffs that you can have on your characters at your discretion. This also adds to Ichibans personality wheel, instead of just leveling these up to meet certain conditions for questions/money making minigames, or the ambiguous resistance to status ailments like in 7, we now get a concrete benefit by increasing the amount of skills that can be carried over across jobs

One main change from Yakuza 7 is how the jobs work. In 7, most of your main stats were tied to your job. You would gain stats from your character leveling, but they were a fraction of the job. This led to events where if you were level 30 in your main job, and you switch to another job thats level 1, not only would you see your stats tank drastically (losing several hundred life, majority of strength, defence, ect) you would essentially be left with a character with few useful stills at that point in the game and need to be carried by the rest of the team until they get somewhat decent stats. Now the opposite is true, most stats come from your character level, not your job, so switching jobs as you wish is much less debilitating.

The actual combat itself has also been improved. In 7, there were multiple issues, such as enemies being ragdolled down an alleyway and further hits just keep knocking them further back, causing allies to have to run further and waste time. Another issue was the lack of player control of the characters, or the inability for characters other than Ichiban to pick up items on the ground, or even just a lack of follow up attack options, with 7 only allowing AI teamates to occassionally kick enemies while they are down. All of these issues have been fixed, in most cases. charaters other than the main are capable of picking up objects and using them in battle, which is great because these items can have elements/attributes tied to them. Players are capable of moving within a circle allowing for better positioning of skills or opportune attack. My favorite aspect is the follow on attack which leads to some interesting events. For instance, a back attack (which are guaranteed crits) that knocks the enemy into other enemies, causing a bowling ball effect, damaging  everyone they crash into. Or you can kick them into an ally, causing that alley to add an additional hit. AND then another ally can kick the enemy while they are down for additional damage. It makes for an interesting gameplay loop that never got old for the 60+ hours it took me to beat the campaign. I do find the dungeons somewhat lackluster, mainly because they are all procedural generated and all look the same, but the combat makes up for it.

Minigames/Side Content: If you know anything about Yakuza, you know there is a massive amount of side content, and this game is absolutely no different. You want a Psudo-Pokemon capturing and battling system that somehow plays and runs better than Actual pokemon? You have it. You want to play something akin to animal crossing but dont really want to play for a year switching time zones and staying up late just to catch that bug you missed last Winter? Theres a mode for that. You heard about the dreaded Mahjong meme about people who had no idea how to play getting addicted to it and wanted to give it a try, that game, and more are here. Ranging from darts, poker, karaoke, shogi, mahjong, blackjack, pokemon, animal crossing, golf, batting and more, there is almost certainly something in this game that you will enjoy and find yourself playing for hours.

Ultimately, I feel this game is a love letter to the series that came before. Learning from the previous games missteps and correcting most of them, I found myself playing this game for hours at a time and genuinely losing track of time, which was  first for me, as I usually get bored or need breaks after playing just an hour or two. However this game had me playing for 3-5 hours straight on the lower end. I wouldn't be surprised if this game was a game of the year contender, just based on its polish and its addictive nature, but that will depend on the rest of the games released this year. However, after beating this game, I look to the next mainline game in the series. With any luck it will be released in 3-4 years, considering how well this game is slated to do, and I genuinely cannot wait to continue with this cast of characters.",60 5 hour finally beat figured write ive experienced great deal content contain trailer spoiler dont talk spoiler best reading already previous mainline yakuza game sequal yakuza dragon 7 assume already dont 7 hitting different theme kiryu diagnosed cancer short remaining brought multiple time dialogue beat coupled ichiban hawaii reunite long lost mother interwoven crime drama make interesting albeit slow line half kiryu ichiban chapter 7 8 split ichiban company staying hawaii kiryu gang staying ijincho premium adventure different chapter dedicated party yakuza 0 admit term writing thing sort core answered left generally vague protagonist im avoid spoiler beaten understand coming combat bread butter yakuza game especially turn based one sum yakuza 7 walked yakuza 8 complain 7 combat completely fixed yakuza 7 carried certain skill permenently certain job certain rank useless clocked menu similar carrying skill permanently allotted certain number slot based personality attribute 30 dead skill menu youll believe 10 skill choice cover multiple attribute weapon type buff character discretion add ichibans personality wheel leveling meet certain condition question minigames ambiguous resistance status ailment 7 concrete benefit increasing skill carried across job yakuza 7 job 7 stats tied gain stats leveling fraction led event 30 switch thats 1 stats tank drastically losing hundred life majority strength defence ect essentially left useful still carried rest somewhat decent stats opposite true stats switching job wish debilitating actual combat improved 7 multiple issue enemy ragdolled alleyway hit knocking causing ally waste issue lack control character inability character ichiban pick item ground lack follow attack option 7 allowing ai teamates occassionally kick enemy issue fixed case charaters capable picking object battle great item element attribute tied player capable moving circle allowing positioning skill opportune attack favorite aspect follow attack lead interesting event instance attack guaranteed crits knock enemy enemy causing bowling ball effect damaging crash kick ally causing alley add additional ally kick enemy additional damage make interesting loop old 60 hour took beat campaign dungeon somewhat lackluster mainly procedural generated look combat make minigames side content yakuza massive side content different psudo pokemon capturing battling somehow play run actual pokemon akin animal crossing dont switching zone staying late catch bug missed last winter there mode heard dreaded mahjong meme idea addicted wanted ranging dart poker karaoke shogi mahjong blackjack pokemon animal crossing golf batting certainly enjoy hour ultimately love letter series learning previous game misstep correcting found hour genuinely losing track usually bored break 3 5 hour straight lower surprised contender based polish addictive nature depend rest game released beating look next mainline series luck released 3 4 year considering slated genuinely wait continue cast character,0,-0.9746

Everyone, who bought any edition above standard - you're the part of the problem. Because of your whims, they encouraged to add more and more predatory monetizations in future. If people don't buy it - no reason trying to sell it. For one time in your life - think about gaming community, not only about what you want.

I'm huge LaD fan, but I despise all simps, who throw in positive reviews 30 min in game, dickriding RGG and Sega. I wanna be upset about community and a bit am, but at the same time knew, people will buy this shit (DLCs).

Wanna get what you want, 'cause you can afford it ? Bitch, please, knock yourself out. But expect paid save slots like in Metal Gear Survive, paid blood spatter, which is basically paid graphic option (https://store.steampowered.com/app/201272/Total_War_Shogun_2__Blood_Pack_DLC/), etc. Maybe we should pay for Subtitles and Colorblind/accessibility options ? There will be consequences after customers encourage selling such things.

I grew up with Sega games and their console. Love those times, cherish these memories and games, related to them. But I totally hate, what this company has become.

I'm on the fence what to think about RGG Studio, because have no idea on their stance regarding this practice. But still, I don't like the fact, they're part of Sega.

Oh, and like last several times - Pre Order wasn't available in several ""poor"" countries, so Sega can make poor pay even more if they wanted that ""juicy"" p/o DLC.

Fuck this shit.

EDIT: Finished the game, it's wonderful. There's one very questionable moment in story, that is cringeworthy, weird af or idk how to call it. But maybe they gonna play around it in next game. Still, I was shocked how dumb it is. And yeah, it's about Kiryu.
I wish they would work more with OST and Dungeons, but that's not gonna happen.

Slogan of this game is ""I'm not crying - you're crying"".

Very funny thing: they didnt ""tie"" 100% aka Platinum trophy to DLC achievements, meaning you can get it now (they MAY patch it or may not).
What this mean is that, at least half of the folks, who grabbed this goddamn product of satan, i.e. Master Vacation Bundle (NG+ dlc), paid just to get Platinum. Some of them for sure. Therefore Sega fckd both parties - who paid and who didnt.

The game already has 70$ price tag and SEGA any way put NG+, True Final dungeon and some jobs/classes behind Deluxe edition and Pre-order bonuses and it also has some day 1 DLC's. You even won't be able to get 100% achievements without Deluxe edition. So to experience the full game you need to pay 85$. Also there is already a ton of day 1 DLC which also can save you time on EXP/money grind. And as a cherry on a cake - DRM Denuvo. I hope, I don't need to write an essay why is it bad thing.

SEGA really inspired CoD's and other games idea, where it is normal to cut content from the release game and sell separately, and now wants to normalise it in it's own games.

976730,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,"[b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years.
[b][u] Long version: [/u] [/b]
[h1] Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary: [/h1] The very first halo with remastered visuals but the same gameplay. 20 years old now, the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. 
Overall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of ""this cave is not a natural formation"".[/i][/b]

[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. 
In summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]

[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.
The gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. 
I give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me. [/i][/b]

[h1] Halo 3 ODST: [/h1] Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.
The PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. 
This is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]

[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. 
The artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. 
This game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]

[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. 
The change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change ""different"". 
The port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. 
Overall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]

[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]
Each game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.
There are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) 
There are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.
As for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.
The game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.
Although the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.
You can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.
If you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. 
An alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.

Overall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. 
EDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D

[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] 
Forge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.
Just a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.
Theatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. 

[h1] Modding: [/h1]
As if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.
Goes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.

[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]

No onto my REVIEW!
I absolutely love the Halo series. I suck at the game, all my friends are so much better, but that doesn't stop my love for the series. I remember the days of old, OG Xbox, sleeping over at my best friends house every weekend to beat Halo 1 CO-OP. Then Halo 2 came out, and we would beat Halo 1 then 2 CO-OP over night. Then Xbox 360 came out with Halo 3. So then we played Halo 1, 2 and 3 CO-OP. Sadly I have to move away before ODST came out, but by then the 360 was out of course, and we could play Xbox Live with voice chat. The new coming era of online gaming kept me and my best friend playing halo together for years to come, even with an entire country now between us. This is the beautiful story that so many of us share with Halo. Friendships and Needlers. 
The game works as it should, and now playing it on a pretty beefy PC in 1440p, it looks amazing! Just how your brain tries to think you remembered it, without any polygons.

Cons
- I have noticed a sound delay every now and again
- A few graphical glitches every now and again, not really regular
- The fact they exchanged the original Halo Reach XP and levelling system with ""seasons"" 
     - Can no longer just buy what you want, you need to play 4 million mp matches just to 
       unlock the helmet you want then repeat that for the matching chest piece in the next 
       season
     - Can no longer get experience from the campaign (Edit: This has since been updated so 
       you can ear medals from campaign but you still can't directly earn xp) 
     - The maximum experience able to be collected is to low for the later levels. I think the max 
        should be lifted fro everyone, or slowly go up depending on what level you are
- How long it takes to level up is just stupid. It was good for the first few levels then it feels like there is a massive jump in time.
- A few audio glitches here and then. (For me anyway you need to be facing the sound to hear it, even if its over comms

976730,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,"Okay, I love the Halo series to death. It has given me so much joy and fun over the years... I've poured thousands upon thousands of hours in to the franchise as a whole and some individual titles, like Halo CE and 3, are among my favorite games ever. I played all of the titles in this collection at or near release on their original platforms.

All that to say: this collection needs work. As I write this review, I am nearing 500 hours on the steam version alone, not to mention the Xbox One version of MCC. There are several main issues with this version of MCC that will impact your enjoyment to varying degrees, depending on what modes you like more or what you find important in a PC port. Let me list them out, starting with a big one:

-Abysmal matchmaking system. This game has no ability to replace lost players on your team mid-game, and quitting is rampant. You can and will find yourself on the giving and receiving end of lopsided games, frequently. Teams are supposedly balanced (even in social gamemodes) to try and prevent this but in practice games where the majority of people playing are meaningfully contributing and having fun are very rare. AFK players, smurfs and assorted fun-sucking players are a big problem too. Ranked modes have low population, and therefore will match you with people way farther above or below your skill, but can in my experience lead to marginally more balanced and/or fun games than social, which is unexpected. You can still have fun in MM, but I would strongly recommend bringing friends along and not getting too invested in it as a competitive game.

-Technical issues are steadily being fixed but are still numerous and range from annoying to game breaking. Disconnects and crashes are a big source of frustration, especially in matchmaking and tragically are also a problem in coop campaign and Firefight modes. Xbox Live functionality is fickle, and windows generally has tons of obscure bugs and frustrations associated with it, but that's not exactly the game's fault. I will also warn that those who care about accurate and detailed game stats and achievements (which this games has tons of) are going to have a bad time. Halo MCC is notorious for glitched achievements, leaderboards and general statistics. Part of it is the game being buggy, and the other is the Halo Waypoint backend stuff that 343i uses to manage player stats is incredibly unreliable. I'm currently at 638/700 achievements and also care about stats, so it's a huge sore point for me.

-No in-game player blocking or reporting. Are you kidding?

-Hit registration, in some of the games in the collection, frankly sucks.

So this sounds really awful, right? Why is this game recommended? Well, to put it simply, a shoddy port of a great game is still worthwhile. I'm not a fan of Halo 4, but every other game in this collection, IMO, is goddamn amazing. Such a blast to play with friends, tight gunplay, creative level designs and fun weapon sandboxes and game mechanics abound. If you are new to Halo or have played the games before, I would totally recommend getting this collection and experiencing these formerly (for the most part) console-bound FPS masterpieces with a surprising amount of PC-centric upgrades that bring the games (when MCC isn't acting up) above and beyond.

The second reason I recommend this game, and perhaps even the most important one is that once 343i delivers a fully functional custom game browser (which they are in the process of doing) and official mod tools are released the game can realize it's true potential: a community-driven, highly customizable, moddable social FPS with tons of content, tight mechanics and a great way to make some friends on the internet

976730,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,"In many ways, a great game, but with some problems. This review can basically be summed up with ""All in-game = amazing, out-of-game = awful"".
[h1] The Good [/h1]
[list]
[*] Gameplay is pretty much as good as it was 10 years ago, nice change from most shooters and is legendary.

[*] Graphics retain the original style while being nice and sharp. Nothing groundbreaking but it's nice to have a game that isn't post-processed to shit by tonnes of effects. 

[*] A lot of content, especially if you paid £7. Tonnes of gamemodes, maps, great campaign.

[*] Soundtrack so good I kept listening to it for 10 years and now there's finally a game to go with it again

[*] Strong playerbase and will be strong for a long time

[*] Some great options for a PC game, great fov changes and fps stuff etc

[*] Mod support I think, but hasn't taken off too much just yet.

[*] Great set of achievements, done properly for once with steam

[/list]
[h1] The Neutral [/h1]
[list]

[*]Nice control scheme, but rebinding is very limited.

[*] Runs well, but no real fine tuning you can do sadly

[*] Due to PC, balance is a bit skewed compared to console. Open maps are just DMRs rinsing you across the map whenever you peak. Can get a bit tiring but nothing major if that's the way the devs wanna go.

[/list]
[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
[*] Originals had what everyone agrees was best halo customisation. Customisation went from 9/10 to 2/10, mainly from progression.

[*] Progression SUCKS, you level up every so often and unlock preset armour parts and stuff in a limited order. No more hype for buying a really cool piece of armour or armour effect and finally getting it. Everyone now looks the exact same and there is no choice over progression AT ALL. Along with that they removed all the cool ranks, now it has a generic system of level from tier 1 to tier 11 with boring sounding ranks and AWFUL icons (more on that later)

[*] Menu SUCKS compared to Reach's, which had possibly the best menu of all time. It is considerably harder to use, with a far worse style, not fitting Reach's vibes at all. It is all designed in the 343 Halo 4+ generic blue way, which isn't bad compared to most games but a crime to replace the original menu with.

[*] Service record, post game stats, icons, medals (more on that), all Halo 4+, and they are at most a 2/10 compared to the perfection of Reach's. Soulless super clean cartoony pictures compared to the gritty and much nicer colour pallette of the original. Ruins the tone of the game in the menus.

[*] Missing a lot of small features from the original. Forge, theatre are gonna be here for sure, but just so many tiny things that were great have been removed. [b]MAP VOTING PLEASE[/b]

[*] Kept the ruined-maps from infection, where 343 (?) made gutted versions of classic maps because they didn't like camping. Camping still exists, but maps are ruined with stupid colours and bits cut off. Could all be solved by including originals in pool and having voting but there is no logic to some of their changes.

[*] Minor technical issues: Sound is pretty ruined sometimes with crackling, and some people have input delay. Matchmaking can take ages sometimes etc

[*] Netcode is dodgy, so many trade kills which can really ruin games, like griffball with every single person having neutral KD

[*] Mentioned earlier, MAP VOTING is so needed and it is a crime to remove from reach, the game which really revolutionised map voting for gaming as a whole. There are great maps from the original which I haven't been able to play yet, while some bad maps have come up countless times. [b] MAP VOTING PLEASE [/b]

[/list]
[h1] Overall [/h1]
In game is great, could do with some fixes but is super fun. Progression, menu and customisation ALL [b]ruined[/b], couple of technical issues. These aren't just niche opinions, I have talked to 10s of people about this game, and not a single person likes the menu changes, icon, rank, progression changes etc.
However the gameplay, content and price are still worth it. Newcomers might be able to ignore the issues I mentioned. I love this game but it's so frustrating to see it come so close to perfection.

...
Permission granted.[/i][/h3]

Finally, the highly praised [i]Halo[/i] franchise has released some of its best entries on PC, neatly assembled in one juicy collection. As someone who grew up only listening to how [i]Halo[/i] is great and Master Chief is a super-chad, after playing it, I can say, without a doubt, both statements are correct.

While the title does say [i]The Master Chief Collection[/i], we also get two spin-offs: [i]ODST[/i] and [i]Reach[/i], with the latter being my personal favourite in terms of story. Many seem to dislike it because of how bland Noble Team is. Personally, that never bothered me. They never were the focal point of the story. It was always the planet itself, Reach. Noble Team is nothing more than a surrogate pair of eyes for us to witness humanities struggle against overwhelming odds first-hand and the horrors enacted by the Covenant upon the inhabitants of Reach. As for [i]ODST[/i], it was ok. It takes place during [i]Halo 2[/i], but nothing from its story was particularly memorable. Some quirky moments and funny dialogue, but nothing more than that.

Still, the title clearly says - [i]The Master Chief Collection[/i], so let's get back to his escapades. I may get some flak for this, but [i]Halo: Combat Evolved[/i] has the worst story, if you can even call it that. There was barely anything. It felt more like a concept. Don't get me wrong, [i]Halo 4[/i] is right next to it, but I still consider [i]Halo: Combat Evolved[/i] worse. But then...BAM! [i]Halo 2[/i]. We get more lore about this universe, more epic cutscenes, more chad one-liners, and characters actually have some personality. And it is here that Master Chief actually became a chad, with subsequent entries continuing to expand the legend that is [i]Sierra-117[/i]. So, even with a few blemishes, [b]I immensely enjoyed this sci-fi space epic[/b]; From witnessing the glassing of Reach, helping a friend go out with a bang, to detonating a nuke above Earth like a true chad, there was never a lack of memorable moments.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2676858881

But what about the gameplay?

Well, it's simply fantastic, and this much is true for every [i]Halo[/i] game. Each entry improves upon its predecessor, refining the gameplay, but at the same time, staying true to that familiar gameplay loop set in stone by [i]Halo: Combat Evolved[/i]. Personally, I have [i]Halo 3[/i] as my top pick. It's the culmination of Bungie's trilogy, and its greatness and epicness during gameplay are still unrivalled by any previous or subsequent [i]Halo[/i] games.

But, where are my manners; I have yet to speak about the gunplay itself. So let's fix that, shall we - [b][i]it's an FPS game where you shoot, throw grenades and drive vehicles.[/i][/b] But the driving controls are unusual. Rather than driving, I dunno, like in 99.9% of games, with movement keys, [i]Bungie[/i] said: ""We don't do that here"", and instead, your mouse is the steering wheel. Tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be drifting on the surface of halo rings like the great Colin McRae.

Each new entry does try to up the ante, spicing up the gameplay, just ever so slightly. [i]Halo 2[/i] has Chief [b]dual wield[/b] smaller weapons, which he seemingly forgot how to do in [i]Halo 4[/i] after his cryo-sleep. With [i]Halo 3[/i] came [b]one-time use equipment[/b]; Useless overall, but they do look neat in the promotional CGI trailer. However, soon after, an unfathomable evil shook the very heavens, as long and fierce wars were waged over its place in the Halo-verse, with many brave souls lost in the process. Just speaking its name aloud invokes thousand years of bad luck upon your no scope 360 trick shots. I am, of course, talking about [b]sprinting.[/b] This putrid thing first reared its ugly head in [i]Halo: Reach[/i], but only as an [b]armour ability[/b]. It wasn't until [i]Halo 4[/i] that [b]it[/b] finally infected Master Chief, becoming his innate ability. Truly a sad day for [i]Halo[/i] fans all over the galaxy. But then again, he was often seen sprinting in cutscenes...

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2643717100

Sprinting polemics aside, I love how [i]Halo[/i] effortlessly creates a heterogeneous battlefield. Encounters pit you against a group comprised of unique enemy units, each with different strengths, weaknesses and mannerisms. We have [b][i]bird boys, smol boys, wort boys, bug boys, hairy boys, chunky boys, etc.[/i][/b] And while headshots mean instant death, some enemy units must be first stripped bare; hairy boys have armour, wort boys have shields, etc. Do note - each protection is weaker against different ammo. For example, wort boy shields are strong against human bullets but weak to plasma-based weapons. But, I will let you in on a little secret - [b][i]All enemies and shields are weak to rockets to the face.[/i][/b]

While massacring half of the known universe is fun, sometimes we need to stop, take a breath and admire the scenery. And this is where [i]Halo [b]got me[/b]. Halo[/i] isn't like that hot chick who doesn't know she's hot. [i]Halo[/i] knows and wants your gaze. So, while [i]Halo: Combat Evolved[/i] has inner beauty and [i]Halo 4[/i] is entirely flat, the others were a succulent journey for the senses; From the Covenant and its many species, the mysterious biomes of the halo rings and the burning cities of Reach, all the way to Johnson and his clean-shaven chin that accentuates his magnificent moustache, the [i]Halo[/i] universe is beaming with beauty to behold.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2676656284

Yet, visual beauty can't work solo. Its age-old accomplice - music, plays a vital role in immersing the player within the games universe. Sadly, this is where a crucial issue occurred, as how does one rate [b][i]perfection[/i][/b]? 
Also, Keith David...Mmmm, you can be my Arbiter any day ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). 

But, besides Keith David making my knees weak with his stern, thick and firm voice, sound effects in [i]Halo[/i] play a crucial role in perceiving one's surroundings. Being informed about various things during the chaotic fights is paramount for success - possible grenade explosion, what weapons the enemy is firing, etc. All produce distinct sound effects, which in turn help you avoid and instead inflict death upon the enemy.

But before we say farewell, I want to make something clear - I didn't partake in multiplay shenanigans, as I don't care for it. Thus, I can't provide insight into that part of the collection. But if that is what interests you, I highly suggest you read [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zionyx/recommended/976730/]the review from Zionyx[/url].

And with that said, I think it's pretty clear how I feel about [i]Halo[/i]. Thus, I'll finish by answering three quintessential questions any buyer may ponder about:

Where is [i]Halo? -[b]On Steam[/b][/i]. 
Who is [i]Halo? -[b]The big green dude[/b][/i]. 
Why is [i]Halo? -[b]Yes[/b][/i].

976730,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,"[h1][i]The best of an iconic franchise.[/i][/h1]

[h2][i]-[u]Overview[/u]-[/i][/h2]
[i]Halo: The Master Chief Collection (MCC)[/i] contains some excellent games, some great games, and an okay game.  All of these are high quality AAA experiences whose combined value far exceeds the price tag of the [i]MCC[/i] by virtue of their quality storytelling, considerable replay value and enjoyable gameplay.  Unfortunately, the [i]MCC[/i] has suffered various networking issues since launch, which still come and go.

All titles featured in the [i]MCC[/i] have been updated to use the same menus, settings, controls, and other features, in order to create a smooth, consistent experience.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2285444109
[h2][i]-[u]Gameplay[/u]-[/i][/h2]
Across the six entries contained in the [i]MCC[/i], various gameplay details and mechanics are added, changed and removed.  Consistent across all entries, however, is the distinctive [i]Halo[/i] gameplay feel, which can be described as somewhat old-fashioned, with many weapons fired only from the hip, no sprint function (in most titles), floaty gravity and no parkour/traversal system.  It is, however, smooth, precise and enjoyable.  Nothing else plays quite like [i]Halo[/i].

While mouse & keyboard works well enough with these games, they were designed with gamepad in mind, and, as such, it's what I recommend using.

[h2][i]-[u]Visuals & Audio[/u]-[/i][/h2]
Featuring six games released between 2001-2012, the visual experience understandably varies, though the first and second games have been remastered (in 2011 and 2014, respectively) to bring them in line with later titles.  All of the featured titles had impressive visuals at their time of release, and all can still deliver a beautiful view or breathtaking display of scale.  Similar can be said of the audio design, barring, arguably, that of [i]Halo 4[/i].

Soundtracks, meanwhile, do not suffer the effects of age as graphics do, and remain as excellent as they did on the day of their release. [i]Halo's[/i] beautiful music is as iconic as the franchise itself.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2294594715
[h2][i]-[u]Technical Issues:[/u]-[/i][/h2]
Numerous players have reported issues with connectivity since the [i]MCC's[/i] release, whether it be lag in co-op play, difficulty in matchmaking or failure to load into levels in co-op.  While patches have released over time, these gremlins still make themselves known to some, at times.  Having played through all of the games in the collection in co-op, I can testify to the latter of the aforementioned issues, though, thankfully, it has been rare.

[h2][i]-[u]The Games – A Brief Summary[/u]-[/i][/h2]

[h3]Halo: CE:[/h3]
The one that started it all; [i]CE[/i] is now a 19 year-old game, and even with the remaster in 2011, it feels it.  While still very playable and featuring a decent story and great atmosphere, this one feels a little rough.

Though its gameplay represents a significant step-up from that of its predecessor, [i]Halo 2[/i] is starting to feel a little dated as well, when compared to later titles.  It does, however, feature some of the best graphics in the [i]MCC[/i] due to its excellent 2014 remaster, and it remains my favourite of the franchise due to its level design, music and story.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096374054/recommended/1064271/

This is the big one; it concludes the story of [i]Halo CE & Halo 2[/i], while featuring excellent gameplay, level design and story elements, as well as a beloved competitive multiplayer component.  As it's still running its 2007 graphics, it isn't the best looking game in the [i]MCC[/i], but it holds up fairly well.

The first spinoff title, [i]ODST[/i] pairs [i]Halo 3's[/i] excellent gameplay with new characters and a darker, more grounded atmosphere that sets it apart from previous titles.  This game is shorter and smaller in scale than the main [i]Halo[/i] entries, but should not be overlooked; it has everything it needs to be a great game.  In addition, it adds a new PvE game mode called [i]Firefight[/i] in place of competitive multiplayer.

Set shortly before [i]Halo CE[/i], [i]Reach[/i] follows in [i]ODST's[/i] footsteps with a new lineup of characters and a more somber atmosphere.  While [i]Reach's[/i] characters and story weren't as well-received as those of earlier titles, its gameplay experience is one of the best in the franchise, as it maintains the distinctive [i]Halo[/i] feel while refining and adding meaningful features to the experience.  The same treatment is given to the [i]Firefight[/i] mode first featured in [i]ODST[/i], adding a highly enjoyable game mode that offers plenty of replay value.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096374054/recommended/1064273/

In my view, this is by far the weakest entry in the [i]MCC[/i], and a poor [i]Halo[/i] title in general.  While it passes as a generic sci-fi shooter, much of what made the series special was lost in the making of [i]Halo 4[/i].  Nice graphics reveal a rather bland visual design, gameplay balance suffers, and story explores regions that should, arguably, have been left to imagination.

[h2][i]-[u]Summary[/u]-[/i][/h2]
While some of the games featured in the [i]MCC[/i] are showing their age, and all feel rather primitive to play compared to the latest, fast-paced FPS titles, there's nothing else quite like this franchise.  It's one I've loved since I first played [i]Halo 2[/i] on the original Xbox back in 2004, and playing the whole series again in 2020 has only reaffirmed my love for the franchise. I will continue to play these games for the foreseeable future, such is their quality and replay value.

Its a First Person Shooter with a lot of emphasis on gameplay and lore. 
Reach is the prequel to the main series of 1-4. Playing through the classic 1 and 2, you can expect some of the gameplay aspects and design are old school but are being updated as the series continues.. The story and lore itself for the series is still one of the best(along with dead space)  All games will you give a great experience of at least 10-15 hours each(except ODST) in the world of Halo for first time players. MP is still fun for those who prefer the old school game modes and should provide more hours which will have sustainable players up until Halo infinite.

I have not experienced and single player issues with the campaign and co-op is quite fun to play with family and friends. So even if you stick with just the base game it is still fun to do so with other people

- Several GREAT games for a decent price

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"TLDR: DO NOT BUY BASE SIMS 4!! Buy it HEAVILY DISCOUNTED bundled with one of the major expansions (Seasons or Pets), and MOD THE SHIT OUT OF IT!!


Base Sims 4 is nearly unplayable due to the lack of content, repetitive and easily manipulative emotions system, and an overall feeling of restriction. Which is damaging in a game series that is designed around player freedom. There are also so many irritating qualities to it that make it seem like it wasn't fine tweaked enough. Why is every single Sim such a social butterfly that I cannot get them to stop talking to each other for five seconds? Why do they take so long to eat? Why are the lots so small and so empty? Why is nearly nothing from Sims 3, and heck, even Sims 2 brought over?? (Horses, Cars, pools, restaurants, grocery stores, fun recreational activities, ect.)

With that being said, there is some classic Sim Fun to be had with this game, if you are able to get it for a heavily discounted price and get it bundled with one of the major expansions (I would recommend either Pets or Seasons). I would also highly recommend downloading a plethora of Mods, because they fix a vast majority of the systems in base Sims 4 that make it more enjoyable. If Mods are not your thing, then I would think twice about purchasing this game. **This is one of the easiest games to Mod fyi**

Mod Recommendations (Like seriously, don't even play base Sims 4 before downloading these Mods)

Sims 4 Mod Manager by Raxdiam (Not necessary, but a very convenient and easy way to keep track of your mods. Very user friendly, will do 100% of the work for you)

Meaningful Stories by roBurky (A mod pack that effectively revamps the mood and emotions systems of Sims 4. This makes the systems feel waaay more fleshed out and realistic, and significantly less manipulatable)

Better Romance by simler90 (Adds more rules and checks into how Sims romance one another. In base Sims 4, you are basically always guaranteed to succeed in romance. There is quite literally no way to fail. This Mod expands heavily upon it, making it so that the traits Sims have will impact whether or not they will accept any advances.)

Wonderful Whims by TURBODRIVER (Goes great with Better Romance with no compatibility issues that I'm aware of. Adds in an Attractiveness system, first Impressions, Personality Archetypes, and even a Menstrual Cycle and Birth Control system. With this, you are more equipped to design your Sims overall sexuality and sexual lives. Hugely rewarding, and designed perfectly that it will seem like it is a natural part of the game.)

There is also a shit load of CC (Custom Content) out there like clothes, hair, buildings, Sims, ect. ""Mod The Sims"" is the best place to find all of this. Don't spend money on any of the Stuff Packs, because most of that stuff included in them you'll find for free made by someone online.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"Before this review, I feel like it's important to say that I have more than 23.7 hours in this game. A LOT more. I've got that much alone on PS4, and 500+ hours on my original origin account, which I can sadly no longer access to check the exact number. I got this game 9 years ago, full price retail, and have played it on and off since the age of 9. I've played this game to death over the years, and that's why it hurts me to leave a negative review. You can still have fun with it, and I will explain that, but it's flaws are just too plentiful for me to leave a positive review.

It would be easy to say that this game used to be great, but that... would be a blatant lie. The game was barren when it released. Key features from past games were missing, like toddlers and POOLS. How were we supposed to kill our sims now? Give them a long and happy life until a natural death? Hardly! Along with that, the map screens didn't even have colour; they were pure white, sterile places. Maybe it was supposed to be stylistic, but... I can't help but think about how much cheaper it must have been.

Slowly, over the years, we started to get more DLC packs of various tiers. It didn't start out too egregious, I wouldn't say. Sure, Luxury Party Stuff was lacklustre, but we had things like Outdoor Retreat to keep us going! Though, it was hard not to note how quickly EA had jumped to make DLC whilst the core game was missing such basic features. That isn't even to say how the community at large took the closed-world and lack of colour and pattern customisation. I'll tell you how they took it; badly. They took it badly.

With all this DLC, there was a problem.

IT. DIDN'T. STOP.

Now, it's normal for a Sims game to have a large amount of DLC. But this? It became staggering. As of this review, all of the DLC for this game will run you over $800.

OVER. EIGHT. HUNDRED. DOLLARS.

I'll let that sink in.

Have you ever wondered how this game is free? That's how. It's not like this DLC is truly optional. Some of it is, sure! But would you like your life simulator to have weather? A normal amount of clothes? More than THREE PLACES TO LIVE, ONE OF THEM BEING AN EMPTY FIELD? Then you'd best pony up! It's hard to fully express how empty this game feels without DLC. And EA knows it feels that empty, and that they can keep milking us for every last cent.

At this point, you may have noticed something, or you may have not. And that's the fact that I said I've been playing this game for nine years. And that means the game has been out for nine years now. Since 2014. This game is almost a decade old. This is an issue. A big issue. When this game first released, it prided itself on it's intelligent autonomous sims. They can multitask; like watching television AND eating at the same time! Wowzers! But with this much time having passed, you'd be hard pressed to find somebody confident to call these sims anything above 'serviceable, I guess'. Your sims will wash their plates in the bathroom! Your sims will grab water if you leave them alone for two seconds and drink until they experience bladder failure! Your sims will start a fight with their spouse, seemingly just for kicks! Your sims will stop moving until you reset them with a cheat code! Your sims will be left with an undeletable action in their queue until you, again, use a cheat code! You get the picture. This game is a mess, with problems that could be wiped clean in a theoretical Sims 5. So why don't they?

Because EA have created a live-service single-player game, and they'd be stupid to give it up.

This live-service model, piling DLC upon DLC onto the game? It's managed to cause even more issues than the game had to begin with. Each new download comes with new bugs unique in nature. Oops, there go your textures! Oops, your sims are now all autonomously screaming at each other! Oops, your Sims are BUILDING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR OWN CHILDREN! These are the kinds of things you'll have to get used to, and this only gets worse each time they add DLC. There are problems in this game that have become support beams by this point; fix those bugs, and everything will fall apart. So they just... don't! The Sims 4 is fundamentally broken, and they won't throw the game out and start fresh, because the horse they're beating still isn't dead. Just bleeding and shambling.

This greed helped lead to the point we've reached today. Even with the uproar against My First Pet Stuff (A DLC for a DLC), it seemed enough people were content to buy such a tiny stuff pack because we got a whole new category for things just like it.

Kits. Dear lord, kits. These things aren't popular with the community, and it's clear to see why. Such meagre amounts of items might seem doable at $5 a pop, but they're adding up, and quick. Filled with lacklustre designs that only work well as a base for custom content, they're the peak of EA's lazy contributions to this game.

I mentioned custom content, so I suppose that's a horse out the stable now. Yeah, custom content is amazing. And that's because EA has no hand in it. Well, I should give them a little credit; the native mod support is an honestly nice touch! There's your first positive, EA.

Custom content is a general term for items created by the community. Clothes, furniture, accessories, you name it! With multiple dedicated sites to download it, and fan made tools that make creation easy, it's great! And by easy, I mean easy. I was making Pokemon shirts for my games at age 12. Just takes a little research. All these items come in two main styles; one more realistic (Alpha) and one to match the game's items (Maxis Match). Build up a good folder filled with gigabytes of fashion and get to work living your life in Create-A-Sim; don't forgot to buy a new SD card to fit it all in. You'll need it.

It's not just custom content that the community makes. There's also good old fashioned script mods. These have all sorts of functions; they can fix some in-game issues, add entirely new game mechanics, give you features that you always wanted (controllable pets comes to mind), and more. (More including the... infamous Wicked Whims and Extreme Violence mods. Ah, timeless classics). All these mods help breathe new life into the game and show how passionate this community can be, no matter how downtrodden by the source material.

These mods help to show how this game is actually fun at it's core. You might have read all this ragging and be baffled by my heel-turn, but it's true. Why else would I have put in all those hours? That core gameplay loop of letting your sims lead their lives is damn fun, and I can't help but enjoy it; even with everything EA is doing.

I think that others could enjoy it too if they started playing today. There is something here, at the heart of it. It's just coated in a decade of bloat and greed.

(This segment is a replacement for an old one that caused me issues, that I'm removing to keep this review safe. I think you can tell by the comments below and the tone of this review what that was, and you can take that as you wish.)

Anyway, EA can do one, and you should give Sims 4 a chance, if you like.

They even charge for seasons like snow etc. It's EA so makes sense, This game is the literal embodiment of slicing up the game and selling the pieces back to consumers.  Or a 1000 piece jigsaw but charging you after 10 pieces have been put together. They don't even give loyal or franchise veterans anything for free.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"This is my favorite game that I can't recommend. I love this game, as my playtime will tell, and I will continue to pour more hours into this game. I'm not giving a negative review because of the game's ""fun factor."" It's very destressing, it's chill, its difficulty is all in the hands of the players. The modding scene is great, and the creative possibilities are infinite. On paper, the Sims 4 seems like the dream game. A perfect game that even people who have literally never touched a game before in their life can pick up and play. In reality, EA has erected a massive series of walls that you have to scale to reach that state, and this is the crux of the review. The ultimate problem is, and is the whole reason I'm giving this a negative review, is recommending people to buy this game because of the aforementioned walls. To say that they have become untenable is an understatement. They are nigh insurmountable at this point.

The first wall, and this is the point where most people stop at, is the pricing. It being free-to-play as of October 18th does not save this from being HORRIDLY expensive through DLC cost. The base Sims 4 with no expansions or packs, makes the game EXTREMELY limited in scope as to what you can do. Want to be a spellcaster? Want to attend university? Have cats or dogs?  Have changing seasons in the weather? Form clubs? Get famous? Have a job? That's ALL locked behind DLC that is either the same price as the base game, or, get this, DOUBLE the price of the base game. All those things I listed? Those are SEPARATE DLCs! If you were to not get them on sale, it would run you a couple HUNDRED already! And this just getting started. On the store page, as I'm typing this right now, it lists 56 different DLC, and to buy them all in one fell swoop costs just short of a THOUSAND  dollars. Nobody in their right mind should make that investment, and I can't be of the mind to tell someone to spend that much on a single game.

Now, to play Devil's Advocate for a moment, this is only as bad if you buy it when it isn't on sale, which the game goes on quite frequently. Deep sales, in fact! Up to 75% a lot of things, which bring down the price for everything by a couple hundred dollars. In fact, with the Summer Sale that's coming up as of the time of writing this review, this game will most likely get significant price slashes. However, to counter that point, the asking price is still SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. The prices become more manageable, but it is still a SIGNIFICANT investment. More of an investment than, frankly, I think this game deserves. And considering how Sims 3 with everything still costs such an outrageous amount, it would seem that those prices aren't going anywhere for the time being. 

If a high asking price was all that kept people away, I suppose you could argue the point that not recommending a game you like because of pricing is silly. That if you put hundreds of hours in like I have, the price is ""worth it."" Perhaps that argument would have grounds and I would entertain it, if not for the fact that the game in of itself just fundamentally DOES NOT WORK with everything combined. These are the other walls, and this can become overwhelming for the inexperienced. Even if you buy everything and you jump in, the Sims 4 is a strange program that seemingly randomly decides to brick itself every so often, without you even really being the cause of it. There are so many bugs and glitches that have no fixes for it, merely ways to temporarily relieve of you of it, much like ibuprofen for a headache. And they aren't the silly, funny glitches  seen in Skyrim. 

For example, randomly, the game will begin to run under 30 frames after exiting build mode, and you solve it by merely pausing the game and unpausing it. Not a terrible bug but it's pretty much the epitome of the problems I have with this game: everything is just player made solutions rather than an official bug fix. It will happen again, and instead of just fixing it, EA just tells you what you can do to help yourself with it. You'll be doing this often, spending hours looking up some obscure error, through no fault of your own, because either Sims 4 randomly decides to brick your Resources.cfg after update and makes it impossible for you to play with CC of any kinds, or your anti virus somehow marks this entire game as potential ransomware, or the Sims 4 randomly just corrupt your save file and you're trying to figure out how to fix that. And that's just on the meta side of everything.

File headaches aside, the game itself just acts wonky as well, adding its own walls to scale. A cursory glance at the reviews for the DLCs illustrate the absolute nightmares that spawn with these additions, but I'll share some of the errors I've had on my end. I've had multiple instances where I tell a Sim to fulfill their hygiene need and their immediate first instinct is to...run out and clean a solar panel? In place of just taking a shower in one of the MULTIPLE showers that exist in that house? I tell them to fulfill their energy need, thinking they'll go to bed, and they'll either randomly decide to back float in the pool, or drink an incredibly irresponsible amount of coffee, like a third shift worker going off of only three hours of sleep.  Fixed all of this by manually telling them what to do. I've also had moments where I couldn't wash laundry because the game bugged out my washer and dryer, where the prompts for washing never came up. Only the prompts for putting the dirty laundry in and taking the dirty laundry out. Fixed by selling the set and then buying another. I've also had my weather permanently glitch itself into never changing at all. Where it snows all through winter and all through spring, causing me to have to buy a weather changing device in game and use it. Sims will randomly drop whatever they are doing to do some unrelated task, such as stop cooking to randomly mold some hunk of clay sitting in some corner of the room. Sometimes, my Sims will also stand still with the ""chat with (sim)"" action in the queue, but then never actually chat with that person,, for whatever reason, causing them to bug ouit and need them to be reset. The list goes on and on, and I think you've gotten the point already.

Again, these are fixed by just manually selecting actions, using console commands, and removing the bugged items in question. I know what you're thinking. Why are you complaining about bugs that have an in game solution? The issue is, again, that this is just player solutions for problems that aren't being fixed. You're paying hundreds of dollars for this game and the DLC. You'd expect a level of polish to behind this, but there isn't. Players shouldn't have to actively fight against a game they bought, only to find a bunch of band-aid, player made solutions a because the FEATURES IN GAME THEY PAID HUNDREDS FOR DOESN'T WORK AND EA DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO FIX THEM. 

It's all the same hackneyed excuse of ""there being so much in this game"" and sounding like they are some small game dev studio. All of this frustration after the ludicrous pay wall is just simply unforgivable, and to recommend people this game knowing the hours worth of troubleshooting and fixing I've had to do is like to encourage self destructive tendencies. I made the investment, I bought the steam edition to make a review. I sunk a lot both in time and money, and have got to a point where I can say I enjoy this game, perhaps through Sunken Cost reasoning and Stockholm Syndrome. But it required me having to scale multiple walls and slaying multiple beasts to get there, and that's just simply not a journey for everyone. I cannot look at someone and genuinely tell them to make the same investments I have, nor do I think EA should benefit from having people do so.

- Highly satisfying gunplay and melee combat: both have realistic handling, good weight behind hits and solid feedback from hits taken by both enemies and yourself.

- Compelling exploration that rewards meticulous looting and going off the beaten path. Many Easter eggs, secrets and optional areas are scattered throughout.

- Exceptional visuals / art direction that feature meticulously-designed environments consistently, despite the world’s large scale and high location density.

- Good variety of gameplay that alternates exploration, puzzle-solving, combat and story-related content (lore etc.), so that none of them become repetitive.

- Excellent optimization for the graphics it delivers. I managed to run maxed settings, constant 60 FPS on a four-years-old machine in 1440p.

- Dommy robo mommy.

[td]
- Underwhelming, predictable story that uses way too many stale tropes, alongside a cringeworthy, unremarkable, one-sided protagonist.

- Difficulty curve becomes too forgiving after early game due to high power creep of weapons, abilities and passive perks compared to the threats you’ll encounter.

- Even if weapons and abilities are well-diversified, only a few of them truly prove to be ‘the best’, leaving many others as redundant or simply worse alternatives.

- The stealth system is a gimmick that you’ll never use at any point; it doesn’t reward you in any way for taking this difficult approach, and has no ‘raison d'être’.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
In an alternate timeline, the USSR has become a technological powerhouse after WW2, with breakthroughs in fields such as nanotechnology, AI and energy manipulation that far surpass those of our present-day world. Affirming itself as the leading world power, it builds the utopian symbol-city of Chelomey, and nears the launch of Kollektiv 2.0, a worldwide neural network merging man and machine to an unprecedented degree. Agent P-3, the protagonist, attends the ceremony, but things take a horribly wrong turn.

The narrative shines the most in its indirect form, through the visual clues and remains from events transpired before, while it proves mediocre in both lore files, dialogues and cutscenes. The worst offender is your musclehead alter-ego, which not only has the intellectual capacity of a broken treadmill, but is also a ceaseless discharge of cringe, with puns and lines that make Leon from RE4 seem like Socrates. The events are predictable, moral dilemmas get sidetracked, and the classic rushed exposition dump near the end comes as the last nail in this atomic coffin.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
The world is divided between linear and open-world areas, the latter becoming available only several hours later. The sprawl of facilities, complexes and residential areas comprising the freely roamed, although a few may be inaccessible until a specific story point is reached. In both instances, minutely exploring with the aid of your Scanner tool to highlight loot and other important things, will be paramount to accumulate crafting supplies, blueprints and useful consumables, while also discovering files and secret areas from time to time. 

It’s satisfying and enjoyable to traverse the world by foot or car - no fast travel so make sure you search accurately. Save points are placed regularly, allowing you to use them unlimited times. The main difference between closed and open-world areas is the enemy presence, much more massive outside, featuring reinforcements and an alarm level system, although your foes can be temporarily disabled by destroying a certain facility.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2944133332

[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]
With firearms, improvised melee tools and polymer-based powers at his disposal, P-3 is a living arsenal. Your limited, upgradable inventory can hold a generous amount of ammo, weapons and consumables to keep you alive in a fight, while powers and abilities only have cooldowns, no other resource than time is required. Energy is used instead to power certain weapons, and is gained passively, with consumables or by striking foes in melee. A dodge system allows you to avoid melee and ranged hits, while defensive upgrades and medkits do the rest. 

Enemies range from simple humanoid bots to mechanical horrors with many weapons and moves, and dangerous mutants worthy of STALKER’s Zone. Mini and proper bosses are uncommon sights, giving you fights that won’t prove too tough especially later on, due to your arsenal becoming way too powerful, same for your skills, granting you simply too many advantages for these fights to be as ‘epic’ as they should be. Unless you get caught in an insta-kill QTE - those are crap.

[h3]Character Progression & Crafting System[/h3]
AI-powered fridges, sometimes considerably more horny than expected, will be at your service to craft all sorts of consumables, ammo and upgrade both your weapons and P-3’s abilities -provided you have the needed materials, blueprints and XP, all looted from the world and enemies. These upgrades will add secondary fire modes to guns, improve their stats, specialize them to damage other robots or organics, and upgrade all of your abilities to be stronger, faster, and last longer.

In general, provided you loot thoroughly, you will never run out of anything and be in far excess of materials to make all the ammo, health kits and other stuff you may need. It has to be noted that scrapping weapons or abilities returns 100% of their materials, so that you can try different ones and spice up the gameplay, a good choice that however hinders the replay value, since you can “have it all” in the same playthrough this way.

668580,Atomic Heart,"Definitely not what I expected. I thought this was gonna be some serious sci-fi hardcore survivor game based around a story, but instead got a sci-fi fever dream. Atomic Heart seems to take inspiration from a lot of familiar titles like Fallout for it's world design, a mix of Bioshock and Dead Island for its game play and freaking Looney Tunes for it's story.  This game's story is probably the most psychotic thing I've had to experience in the past 10 years. 

The gameplay is a tier above basic FPS, allowing you to use as many weapons as you can carry with 3 alternate special powers that try to work in tandem with one another. The games default difficulty could be hard enough to justify all that, I typically just used my best one and had so much ammo for every gun I settled for just blasting. 

My biggest gripe with this game overall was it's dialogue in English. Specifically in English, cause there are parts of this game where the translation feels like it was totally 1 to 1 with its original language, creating these very rushed feeling cut scenes with dialogue cutting itself off, almost as if 2 people couldn't talk at the same time. It was just awkward overall. As for the dialogue content, I think a lot of people will be split on this but the main character in English and some other characters are very colorful I'd say. A lot of what the main character says or does is very wacky and his glove companion don't really seem to mesh well with him. It's like if a high ranking officer in the military acted like a neurodivergent teen that watches My Little Pony on his adventures with his milquetoast robot butler. On the other hand, I think the main character made more fun, he's just largely immature. 

Also the PC version was insanely smooth for a Denuvo user, only thing that was suspicious was how long the loading elevators were. But I kept 144 in the open world very consistently with no stuttering. I even tried to get a whole village to attack me and it barely dropped.

668580,Atomic Heart,"Atomic Heart is a FPS with action-RPG elements taking place in a technologically advanced alternative Soviet Union, in the 1950's where robots will start killing humans.

The game has an ultra immersive universe, the intro will immediately immerse you in the game with its incredible artistic direction and its more than convincing graphics. The music is excellent, it's a mix of Russian music, electro and metal making the universe even more immersive in this world full of technology and robots.

The story is also very good, you will want to go on to understand what is going on, there is a lot of lore on terminals that you will find throughout the adventure. The cinematics are also very good despite a rather average lip-sync if you don't play in Russian. The character is also very pleasant to play with a humor similar to that of Wolfenstein/Fallout.

As for the gameplay, the fights are pretty cool, your glove gives you access to different powers in addition to your weapons. You will be able to modify all your weaponry as well as these powers throughout the adventure in secure areas by finding loot. The bosses are also very pleasant to face, with excellent music made by Mick Gordon (Doom, Wolfenstein..). There are also the puzzles that I personally loved to do, they are not numerous and are renewed in each zone which makes them all very enjoyable.

One of the only negative point for me is the ""open world"" which could have been avoided. You will be at some point in the game in quite open areas (like in metro exodus) where you can find plans of sights or magazines to improve your weapons. The problem is that the driving of the vehicles is quite bad and that there are too many enemies in my opinion, fortunately this represents 15% of the game which is not too disturbing.

In conclusion, Atomic heart is a very good FPS like we haven't had in a long time, it knows how to innovate in its universe as well as in its gameplay and has its own identity. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a very good single player FPS with a good story and an excellent universe, you will spend a very cool twenty hours. And yes for once the game is well optimized.

It's not bad, but not great either.

It suits my taste, but there is a big but:

The open world isn't really open and is also full of enemies, which just gets annoying at some point.
The story feels patched together and is rushed through very quickly towards the end.
The entire scene feels somehow lifeless without being empty.
Although it is graphically implemented first-class.

I won't play the game a second time even though it was a lot of fun at times. And unfortunately I'm not interested in the DLC either.

And second, it’s a great “Bioshock-spinoff “, with many new elements, original ideas, diverse environments, high production value and an awesome Russian music based soundtrack. It’s also pretty long, lots to discover, many many secrets if you take your time. Absolutely enjoyed every moment of it. Ugggh, but alright, yeah, at the time of my writing, I admit that there are still many bugs present, like the shaders sometimes weird out, achievements got strange counting (but are working meanwhile nevertheless), sometimes text repeats and so on. But in my over 100h playtime I never encountered a really game-breaking bug, so I just want to be lenient. The game is awesome enough to just overlook those letdowns, just give it a chance. Long story short, yep, I know, it isn’t perfect, but what they did here is a kind of memorable, highly impressive milestone for a new company. Just let it sink in, and I think you’ll not get disappointed ;)

2-  the exploration in open areas is ruined by a simple design choice , to put it simply , any robot you will kill in open areas will respawn within 1 min cause of the repair pods that you can't disable , so you can't basically explore at your own pace , you'll have a constant feeling of just rushing the open areas and disliking spending time in them.

668580,Atomic Heart,"Atomic Heart is perhaps the most unique game I've played in a really long time. I can say with certainty that even though I might have played games where some of the features Atomic heart includes are present, nowhere were they implemented in a way that Atomic Heart has done so. That's not to say that the game is perfect, far from it in fact, but in this case I think saying ""imperfection has a beauty of its own"" is the right way to describe how I felt after finishing it.

At first I'd like to say that the story is a complete fustercluck. There is no other way of putting it. The characters all sound a bit off (especially the player character) and the dialogue simply isn't the best. Even though I don't think many would aproach Atomic Heart and expect it to be a storytelling masterpiece, it's still an important fact to be made aware of. 

Even though the game has been advertised as an open world game, I don't really think of it as such. And that's not necessarily a bad thing per se. The way I would describe this world is that it's a one giant linear level with optional detours with certain stages where after a certain point the player gets locked out of the place where he can't go back to anymore. At the start I was very confused by this progression but with a little bit of hindsight I appreciate it for what it is. It's just that the advertised description didn't really do this game justice. It's not necessary to make every game into an open world and I think the way Atomic Heart's world has been handled is both unique and effective.

Now to the combat. I cannot describe in words how good, polished, satisfying and rewarding it feels. Even though a lot of the enemies are what could be considered a bullet sponge at first, it all comes together near the end of the game when you have your entire arsenal and are let loose to cause as much havoc and carnage as possible. The way the robots react, the way your special abilities and weapons work together to slowly tear those robots apart, especially when upgraded, it's simply majestic (that also applies to the bossfigths which are also really great even if a little on the simple side in some cases). And all of that is accompanied by an amazing soundtrack. All the people who worked on it have done an amazing job creating something unique, fitting to the aesthetic of Atomic Heart and also sometimes nostalgic for those that remember some of the original classics that were remixed (I'm not one of those people, but I can only imagine what it must feel like to hear a song you've been listening to as a kid on a radio in this game completely remixed while ripping your enemies to pieces).

Let's talk about the visuals. Atomic heart looks pretty good grapics-wise, but the art style completely surpases the level of detail in my opinion. Sure, it might feel a bit schizophrenic the way it shifts constantly to a new theme and visual style all the time, but I found it actually quite fitting for the setting - the utopian Soviet Union. It's simply something that hasn't been done before and we don't really have anything to compare it to other than the real world history of the USSR, where, funnily enough, megalomania, utopian visions and plans for the future were quite common among the elite, not unlike those found in Atomic Heart (albeit with a more realistic visual style). I simply found it incredibly interesting to be interpreted in this way and thorouhgly enjoyed the art style/styles. Oh and let me just mention that the game runs like a dream so you can enjoy all of what is throws at you without worrying about awful fps drops, stutters or crashes (unlike many Unreal engine releases lately).

The final verdict is incredibly straight forward. If you'd like to play a game with great combat, great graphics and awesome soundtrack and you don't care as much about the story, Atomic Heart is a no-brainer. The best way to apporach it is to not compare it to what's already out there. It's not a ""Russian Bioshock"", or ""Russian Fallout"" like many would describe it, it's not even an open world game or an RPG in my humble opinion, it's its own thing and I love it for that.

668580,Atomic Heart,"[h1]Basically a Russian version of BioShock, except with a more predictable story and that the protagonist never shuts the F up… oh, and the big booty twins, a badass grandma and a horny fridge[/h1]
Gameplay Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMJxcNG5q8A
 
✔️ [b]Great gunplay[/b]: hitting a defective robot using a bat with circular saws attached to it, or with a good old kalash, is truly satisfying. You’ get a resource, called Neuropolymer, from defeated enemies that you can use to upgrade your skills and character upgrades

✔️ [b]Big open world to explore[/b]: There are tons of buildings, bodies, chests and hidden bunkers for you to loot, and they are packed with with new weapons, gun attachments and other resources that you can use to upgrade your gear.

✔️ [b]The enemies and bosses are awesome[/b]: The enemy variety is pretty big, you’ll encounter all sorts of weird Soviet Union technology and experiments, from spider-like drones to flower mutants. Most of the bosses are great and unique, and they are tough to beat at Armageddon difficulty (hard), like the infamous twins. 

✔️ [b]The game is absolutely gorgeous[/b]; The world combines elements of 1950s Soviet architecture and design with advanced technology and sci-fi elements. It’s a shame that ray tracing isn’t in the game yet, but it will come soon.

✔️ [b]Amazing soundtrack[/b]; It is a mix of electronic and orchestral music, some songs are composed by THE Mick Gordon (mainly boss themes). There are also Phonk song like Komarova, which is very catchy.

✔️ [b]Very well-optimized[/b]: buttery smooth 60 FPS at 1080p, no issues to report.

❌ [b]Predictable story and a blabbermouth protagonist[/b]: The story is very predictable and it is similar to the first BioShock. As for the protagonist, It’s not that he is cringe, the voice actor did a good job even though he does say some stupid lines every once in a while, it’s that he and his AI-glove companion never shut the f up, they talk like all the damn time.

Overall, Atomic Heart's visuals, gunplay, explorations and enemies are a major part of what makes the game so distinctive and awesome, which is why I highly recommend it. If only they had an option to set the chat frequency to “Minimal” like in Forspoken.

668580,Atomic Heart,"TLDR; 
Wait for it to go on sale or get it on gamepass, just don't pay full price. Very repetitive, a lot of highs, a lot of lows, messy pacing, but enough interesting things to keep you going. Paints both communism and capitalism as bad if you cared about that. There's actually quite a bit of robot girls.

Beat the game on normal in a little over 13 hours. See literally no reason to replay unless I want to just look at stuff. You can easily extend this time by really exploring the overworld. If you find value or enjoyment in the overworld gameplay loop, then you'll probably enjoy going through it. I however, did not find value.

The good:
- The music is definitely the highlight. At its best its really good and exciting, at its worst its still interesting. Which is better than forgettable imo
- Very well optimized. I had very steady frames and only encountered a single glitch that required a restart. But that only happened once and I was jumping in a spot I wan't meant to.
- Great setting and visuals
- Story is decent, nothing mindblowing. There are a few things that don't make sense, but there is still setup and payoff within the narrative
- I felt the difficulty was fine throughout. I was never on autopilot when in combat and would still find myself making mistakes and dying. There are certain perks that are a must have and you definitely feel the progression. I found myself wanting to avoid combat near the start, but not at all near the end.
- I liked every side character/robot. There was a certain red robot that I wish had more screen time. It was fun whenever I saw it. I've seen that some people HATED this character, but I personally like it. 
- There is a mission/dungeon with what I thought was a 10/10 subplot in the readable records and audio recordings.
- Very small and isolated moments throughout the I absolutely loved. Like some character interaction or world building moments. 


The bad:
- Probably the biggest issue: pacing pacing pacing. It made no sense. They tried to do what Bioshock Infinite did with seeing columbia all nice and pretty and happy before things go wrong, except not as well both thematically and in execution. You sit through what is basically an interactive cut scene with really on-the-nose exposition and a lot of NPCs going ""wow, it sure is amazing that we have such amazing science in [city name] thanks to [name] and their [invention] that recently came out."" After this you, you arrive in the open world to go to the first mission/dungeon. I then spent 4 hours on this first mission. Then back to the open world for 10 minutes to get to the next story mission. Then another 2-3 hours on that. Then everything gets shorter on average afterwards. The first half of the game has so many puzzles that you would think it was a puzzle game first before a FPS, but then the last half of the game has literally no puzzles so idk. Its a mess.
- The game has an ""open world"" tag, but is only ""open world"" in that there is an overworld that you can explore (kinda). However, there isn't really anything to do other than collect weapon blueprints and kill robots. The overworld only stands as a set piece to get from story mission to story mission. I spent maybe an 1.5 hours total in the overworld, and I was really trying to find interesting things to do. There was a point in which I wanted to travel to get an upgrade for a weapon only to find that the entire section of the map was cut off and I had to progress through the story to open it. There wasn't even any indication that it opened when it did. And by the time it did, I didn't need the upgrade. The combat cycle for the overworld can just be ignored. There are sometimes just too many enemies in a given location. Like, you will scan the area and there's 30 things on your screen with lines connecting them and then they just keep adding more and more as you progress through the story. 
- There are lines of dialog that are just bad. Not even like ""oh that could have been better"". More like ""I wish i didn't have to listen to that"". You kinda get used to it though. Or maybe it just improved a bit over the course of the game
- Voice acting is good, but the direction is often terrible. The MC will say a line and deliver it well, but in a tone and inflection that does not fit the situation at all. I found this happening a lot. I'm told the Russian VA is the best option.
- Unbelievably repetitive. Very little enemy variety. Only (one)? dead soldier model. You will spend hours collecting things to put into other things to open doors and then open some variation of three lock types on a door to again collect things to open another door and then talk to an unmoving dead body. Each time you fight some amount of the 6 or so enemy types. (eidt:I looked this up, there are 9 normal types. 3 have variants. The rest are boss types. You see one type way more than the rest). The game also tries to be cute with it by having the MC say something sarcastic like ""Wow, another lock on the door. Who would have seen that coming?"", or ""Yeah, of course I have to go collect more capsules. What else could it have possibly been?"". As though that makes this type of game design excusable. 
- The first boss fight blew my mind away. Like probably the best moment of the game. Then all other boss fights are boring.


EDIT:
lmao people got heated in the comments, which is fine. At the end of the day, it is a negative review for something they may have enjoyed. In regards to my point on the price of the game; It's not a matter of being able to afford it, but rather that the game is simply not worth full price. If you are ok with paying $60 for 10-12 hours of content, go for it. If you can find it cheaper, you should probably do that instead. If the asking price was lower, it would arguably decrease quality expectations and the game's issues would be more excusable.

668580,Atomic Heart,"First let me say this, unlike any other big 2023 AAA game, this one is actually optimised and runs really well with very few bugs. In a way feels like a game from the past, and it is a good thing.

Second, considering how much of development hell this game went through it is actually shocking how good it is. Throughout the game can definitely see how some parts and mechanics of the game have changed, which does give it a bit of an disjointed feeling, where the game doesn't really know what it actually wants to be.
The beginning almost feels like survival horror with stealth elements, but by midpoint of the game you can rampage like its Doom (especially with the combat soundtrack), then you have the puzzle areas (polygons), very linear story, the semi-open world, drivable car,  [spoiler] 55 thousand different [/spoiler] lock-picking mini-games, the famous 6 hour cut-scene (if you know, you know), pervert fridge etc. But in the end it does manage to hold it all together, even if the seams are showing.

[b] Gameplay [/b] - it is really enjoyable, combat is great, enemies actually visibly react to your attacks and can see the damage you are doing. Only real complaint is that sometimes, especially on higher difficulties, enemies can become bullet sponges, which can get annoying and feels lazy for ""higher"" difficulty measurement. The respawning enemies were really annoying at first brought back the bad memories of Far Cry 2. But once I realised that if you shoot down enough repair drones, the enemies will stop respawning for at least 5-10 minutes it became just an inconvenience instead of massive annoyance. 

[b] Soundtrack [/b] - it really took me by surprise, it is much better than it has any right to be. Makes me sad that the Soundtrack DLC does not actually include all of the tracks that we hear in game. As some tracks, especially from the puzzle sections (Polygons as they are called in the game) are extremely catchy. 

[b] Story [/b] - While playing the game really thought the story would be the weakest point of the game, and in a way it is, but it does its job and it does it well, and towards the end of the game, even gets really interesting. Characters in the game are okay, but this is where it feels the most like the story had to change multiple times during development and because of this it just feels like some characters just get barely any time or proper explanation, which can make them quite forgettable. But what really saves the story for me, it is the lore and world building that has been done here, yes there is a lot of reading of PC terminals, but it just adds so much to this game world, which makes me wish that we see more of Atomic Heart in the future (be it Story DLCs or a sequel) . 

[b] Voice Acting [/b] - (EN) it is passable, the original language is better, but unfortunately subtitles bug out sometimes and since there is a lot of dialogue during combat sequences, too easy to miss out important information. 

Overall a really good and satisfying game. And I think that is the main point, this game is a [b]game[/b], that does not take itself too seriously. It took a lot of ideas from other games, but all of those ideas were meshed really well and by the end made me wish for more story content.",unlike big 2023 aaa optimised run bug feel past good considering development hell shocking good throughout definitely part mechanic changed bit disjointed feeling want beginning feel survival horror stealth element midpoint rampage doom especially combat soundtrack puzzle area polygon linear semi open world drivable car spoiler 55 thousand different spoiler lock picking mini game famous 6 cut scene pervert fridge manage hold seam showing enjoyable combat great enemy visibly react attack damage real complaint especially higher difficulty enemy bullet sponge annoying feel lazy higher difficulty measurement respawning enemy annoying brought bad memory far cry 2 realised shoot repair drone enemy respawning 5 10 minute became inconvenience massive annoyance soundtrack took surprise make sad soundtrack dlc include track hear track especially puzzle section polygon called extremely catchy thought weakest towards get interesting character okay feel multiple time development feel character barely proper explanation forgettable save lore world building yes reading pc terminal add world make wish atomic heart future dlcs sequel voice acting en passable original language unfortunately subtitle bug dialogue combat sequence easy miss important information good satisfying seriously took idea game idea meshed wish content,0,-0.9904

Atomic heart is action FPS semi open-world game where you play as russian dude slapping robots.

Pros (+):
+ Performance is buttery smooth. almost all maxed and still run on 144 FPS.
+ Graphic is very great, not to mention great aesthetic too.
+ RPG system where you can upgrade and customize your weapon.
+ Melee has the ""weight"" feeling on it. Making satisfying slash.
+ Interesting story and world building.
+ Grandma with Rocket Launcher.

Grey (?):
? Alot of ""camera"" everywhere. alerting nearby enemy to you when spotted.
? Ammo management on guns.
? No running. Probably later on in game.. maybe??
? No photo mode.
? English dub is cheesy. Dude likes to jokes alot.

Cons (-):
- Fight is frustrating with alot of enemy surrounding you.
- Very slow climbing speed.
- No saving everywhere. Only auto save and save spot.
- No FoV slider. edit: FoV added

The game is totally worth full price knowing the game is not made by AAA studio but has quality of it.

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"MTG is hands down one of the greatest card games ever created(but it hasn't been doing so well lately.) I installed the Steam version just long enough to give a review for those that happen to find this, but I have probably around 1K hours in MTG Arena played lifetime. I had even more hours in Magic Online, and a zillion times that IRL, haha! Regardless I'll stick to just talking about MTG Arena since that is what I am reviewing here:

I've been playing since Beta and used to be a regular PT grinder. While the glory days are long behind us MTG Arena gives us a simple way to play from home or our mobile devices. The smooth looking playing field, and things all happen easily and automatically. Despite this I really can't recommend MTG Arena as it's way too predatory, expensive, grindy, and somewhat rigged. (I explain this towards the end.)

-Unbelievably expensive if you aren't already a top tier player who has at least a few hours a day to grind out a draft or two(assuming you even like drafting, which luckily I do.) I can't imagine what a new player is expected to dole out to attempt to enjoy anything here without being slaughtered by those who play all day or spent thousands.
-Grinding out ""win"" quests takes forever for a menial gold reward.
-Modern crossover sets aren't as interesting as older sets that take place in the MTG universe. A crutch and a constant cash grab are now a permanent part of the game. Not every cross over will be interesting or mesh at all with the previous one.
-The game suffers from brutal power-creep and the more modern value-creep. This is what basically killed standard.
-Getting a high rank just means you get a few extra free booster packs at the end of the month. Big whoop!
-Best of one is a lame way to play the game, and basically overly rewards playing aggro and going first. Most formats are best of one.
-No social engagement at all. Every opponent is just some random screen name with an avatar and a pet you've seen 100 times. Where is ""the gathering"" part!?
-Can't play any custom rule sets or any way you want. For example once Pauper is gone, it's gone until they decide to bring it back.

Now the final issue: The ""rigged"" factor.

A lot of people complain by saying it's ""rigged"" but they never exactly explain HOW it's rigged. It's mostly just people who recognize something is very off with MTG Arena compared to Magic Online or IRL magic. This is interesting, because the other online Magic the Gathering game doesn't have this issue! Magic Online is very old and plays like old accounting software where the economy is ruined(I mean run) by bots. (Don't play MODO either, it sucks in a whole other way, although it is a zillion times less expensive.)

The problem here is understanding how it's ""rigged"" and why this manifests itself in such a way. To understand this we must understand how MTG Arena works:

(Note: Every claim here is substantiated by Wizards themselves via Twitter etc.)

-You must understand how EOMM match making works. A 50% win/loss ratio is scientifically proven to cause higher consistent player retention and therefore create more possible revenue. Also consider increased time played increases the sunken cost fallacy of time spent on the game which therefore causes players to stick to just the game they spent the most money on. EOMM basically works on the same principle that the ""near miss"" trick that carnival games use, or those ""snip the wire, or stack the blocks"" arcade type games. Near misses cause retention to try one more time since you were ""oh so close!""
-If you win a lot it will try to adjust your win rate by making you go second more often. On my quest for rank 1 mythic, when I finally achieved this I was going first around ~36% of the time.
-It tracks ""deck strength"" and tries to match you up against a deck of similar ""strength"", but this is very subjective and once you get ""bubbled"" as ""Good against Mono Red"" you'll NEVER play against that deck again. You never want to get ""bubbled"" as ""Bad against X"" since that's where you will get matched up with and you will need to adjust to cover your weakness. The best decks therefore either have low ""apparent"" deck strength, but high ""actual"" deck strength, or are adaptable to various scenarios. (For example, it doesn't consider your sideboard for upfront deck strength so ""wishing"" for cards in your sideboard gets around the deck based portion of the upfront deck strength calculation. Just keep in mind you will still get ""bubbled"" ""good against deck X"" if you beat the same deck over and over.)
-When playing draft make sure to also consider which cards the game considers ""high deck strength cards"" probably based on that cards win rate across all draft decks it's in. So a somewhat powerful rare/mythic creature that is splashable in your deck may not be worth taking since your deck strength will increase significantly which will in turn increase the average power level of decks you'll be matched up against(and they will also likely have just as many rares or mythic rares as you do!) Since you can't guarantee you will draw that card every game to combat this, it often times makes it not worth it to take! Instead consider a common or uncommon that is also powerful, but keeps your draft deck as ""low deck strength"" as possible. You also have to consider how often other people draft a card and actually win with it. There are a lot of undervalued rare/mythic cards that are good, but people never play them and don't actually win with them; therefore, they actually have low deck strength. Abusing this knowledge leads to much easier and consistent wins... which leads me to my final section of this review:

Now you know the rules(and so do I.) How to use all this to your advantage:

-Make sure you build decks that go second well and mulligan well once you're deep in going second almost every game territory. Consistency becomes key! If your opponent always goes first but has to mulligan it's no longer a default ""~60%-~40%"" in their favor! For draft this means defensive cards for the early game, and card draw becomes more valuable for the decks you play. As well as cards that can ""turn around"" a game!
-Consider whether a card is worth taking not only for how good it is, but consider how much it will increase your upfront deck strength value. No reason to take a card that you'll draw a few games to be forced to play against better decks EVERY game!
-In constructed including certain ""hoser/hate"" cards can altogether stop certain match-ups from appearing. This is insanely effective if they are main deck, but you can be tricky and get them from outside the game(wishes) since the upfront deck strength does not see cards in your sideboard. You can then alter your sideboard once those decks stop appearing and focus on the match ups you are now seeing!
-Keep track of which decks you play, and what ""bubbles"" MTG Arena has likely marked on those decks. Does your mono white deck stop mono red? Make sure to note it likely has ""Good against red/mono red decks"" meaning you can focus alterations to it towards other decks.
-Regardless of all this in best of one aggro is still king. A smooth well balanced ""secretly"" low deck strength aggro deck will always come out a winner over every other deck archetype.

Finally, always remember:

-Skill still matters. I can't tell you how many games people ""should"" have won, but they just screw it all up and lose. Every draft of MTG Arena I win at least one game where I should of been dead years ago, but they just keep making mistakes until I win(even in the higher ranks.)

I hope this review was worth your time to read! Go on and adventure forth! I recommend playing Magic the Gathering in real life with friends as that is the best way to play the game, and feel free to play the format or way YOU want!

i have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online 
Tactics, and now Arena. 
MTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years
Magic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..
Magic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)

MTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years. It may have just arrived on steam but it has been a beta then stand alone client for years (i was accepted into the beta 3/2018 and beta wrapped up 9/25/2019 to give an idea) They are releasing sets and keeping in line with standard releases, they offer a ton of formats and you can earn your cards and decks. i have earned thousands of cards and hundreds and hundreds of packs for free, 1-2 packs per day is easy, and yes it takes time but each month the ladder resets and you work your way up in ranked or you can just play another format or unranked to earn gold/xp,coins which translate into packs, save your gold for drafts and open packs and pick cards or just buy a ton of packs and earn them for free with exp! Also every 6 packs you open you get a choose your own blank rare gold wild card, and every 30 packs a mythic wildcard , also you get blank commons and uncommons in packs and by playing.  and PS there is a ton of people playing all the time, you never have to wait long for a match or even a draft to kick off.

(New Account info and Instructions)
New Accounts have to play and complete 5 mini matches to unlock 12 free cards and 5 free starter decks, then upon completion you will enter into the client and see color challenges..skip that, click on the mail icon (top right) to claim 21 free packs (as of writing) from different recent sets, then click the home button (top right) to get out of the color challenge screen to the actual deck builder and match entry

Here is a list of codes that will give you a ton of packs, cards and cosmetics, the packs, also count toward your free rare and mythic wildcard count you get by opening every 6 packs. by opening these you should have enough to craft your own starter decks and even pick quite a few blank rare mythic and common uncommon wild cards ( i just tried to make a new account and i got 69 free packs total that translated to 18 common 25 uncommon 12 rare and 4 mythic wildcards and a ton of actual rares mythics and hundreds of other cards (your mileage may vary depending on how many wildcards you find in the packs as well)

I see a lot of reviews on here complaining about Pay 2 Win features. As a person who has put as much time as I did while spending ZERO dollars, I can say wholeheartedly that you can absolutely enjoy this game without spending a dime.

There are two in-game currencies in MTGA; gems, and gold.  If you do the daily quests at the bottom of the home page you can start accruing gold through meeting the requirements in any game mode. You can use the gold to buy draft tokens, the top tier draft costing 10,000 gold.  Each draft adds the cards you draft to your collection, and you get pack and gem rewards depending on how many wins you get before three losses.

Grind the gold, save your gems, and when you have enough, spend the gems on the season pass.  It becomes exponentially easier to get gold, cards, and gems after unlocking the season pass.  From there you can keep the cycle up. Make fun decks, try different game modes, keep it interesting.

And when wasn’t Magic expensive / pay to win?! Paper Magic was never free! This game gives you the opportunity to do everything FOR FREE! So enough with the complaints!

Final Pros / Cons:
+Steam version initially runs very well compared to my old installs. Less loading, less glitchy.
+F2P model isn’t that difficult to grind around.
+New card sets come out quarterly, keeping the gameplay fresh and the meta changing.
+TONS of redemption codes available to get a head start as a new player. Just google MTGA card codes and you can get a head start on building your decks.
+Tutorial and beginner friendly modes like explorer help the learning curve. 
+Flashy visuals and cool sound effects.

-Only 1v1 matches.
-No chat function, just emote wheel (which is pretty much just as toxic as chat).
-Sore losers roping (running the timer down when losing to drag out a game).
-Fair share of toxicity in the community… but what game doesn’t have that nowadays.

Overall this is the best digital version of Magic in my opinion. I find tons of enjoyment in the game without paying a cent. Just make sure to READ THE CARDS as you play!

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"To preface, I have probably another 1000 hours in Arena from the several years it wasn't on steam. As it sits now, it in an easy way to get into Magic for free, and with enough grinding, you can avoid paying any money on it at all.

Major Cons are:
1. No Trading
2. New Developers dont care to optimize the game so it gets laggy and crashes on occasion.
3. Can't just buy the cards you want, you have to spend money on wildcards, which means a $0.30 rare on paper might cost you a few bucks if you want to just buy a deck outright.
4. Most of the good dual lands are rare/mythic which makes building decks with multiple colors grindy or expensive.
5. Difficult to get started against other players and win without spending to get a good starter deck, but there are still good budget options. YouTube helps with finding budget options.
6. Not great for playtesting eternal formats since there are only full sets going back to about 2016-2017 (The number of sets is increasingly slowly though).
7. STILL NO 3+ PLAYER MODES, WIZARDS. WHEN CAN WE GET 4 PLAYERS IN A GAME??

Pros:
1. Common and Uncommon wildcards are plentiful and I have never run out, making the bulk of decks easy to build.
2. Gold is easy to grind by just playing the game.
3. The cards you own can be put in multiple decks at once, unlike MTG Online.
4. If you do spend money, a $50 card on paper only ever costs as much as a wildcard, which can make expensive cards cheap, making wildcards a double-edged sword.
5. Play newly released cards early on arena, which is nice.
6. Unique formats to arena can be fun (i.e. Alchemy, Historic, etc) and give some variety compared to paper Magic.
7. Deckbuilder is pretty intuitive and makes finding cards that fit a theme pretty easy. Also supports importing decklists, which is very useful when you want to netdeck.

While MtG as a whole has gotten bad over the years I’ll talk exclusively about Arena itself. Where to begin… this game is brutal to new players unless you fork over a lot of money. WotC has made it clear they want to milk you as much as they can and if you don’t comply you’ll be stuck trying to slowly piece together a good deck. This isn’t as bad if you play Historic but if you like Standard you’ll be caught in a bind. The in game “economy” is laughably bad, especially when compared to another game, YuGiOh Master Duel. If you get a crappy Mythic or Rare card you’re stuck with it and it just takes up space. The formats themselves are pretty meh. Standard is Standard, Historic is the extended format but it’s been sullied by Alchemy existing and keeping card changes permanent. Crashes happen a lot and I’ve lost games because of said crashes putting me behind my opponent. Overall MtG Arena is just a bad, pay-to-win mess that should be overhauled to make the player experience better.

Not Magic: The Gathering. That's a great game. But you should play cube and proxy cards so you're not burning money for the oppressive glutenous tyrants that work at Hazbro.
THEY CONTROL WHAT YOU DRAW AND WHO YOU PLAY AGAINST. So they control your win rate.
Sometimes it feels like MTG Arena controls these things in a way to give you the least satisfying way possible, which is quite likely as a tactic to proc you for more dopamine, and encourage you to spend money (Any penny you spend on this game is a waste). You'll lose 6 times in a row to getting land-screwed and get all your spells brutally countered or all your creatures removed, and then you'll win 4 games in a row from an opponent conceding before you get the chance to do anything or from simply playing against someone so bad, I seriously wonder if they're a bot planted to give people free wins.
Plus there's the fact that every format is becoming worse and worse so even if MTG Arena wasn't rigged and made to be unfun by the matchmakers, it would still be unfun because the game is simply not balanced, and it's in shambles.
Also, fun story: January of 2022, I played a bunch and made it to mythic tier. That's the only time I've made it past platinum, and the only other time I made it to platinum was in Janurary, where upon being 2 wins away from diamond teir, I kid you not, I lost 20 games in a row, 40% of which were land screws, another 40% were problems with the autotapper, timeouts, or connection errors, and the last 20% were just insane match-ups. So I was brought all the way back down to the bottom of platinum tier. Amazing.
This game will simply make you feel bad about yourself, get angry, get into a toxic Dopamine cycles. Hopefully you're lucky enough to have a good playgroup for magic who isn't toxic. This game is about the gathering, after all, about the community. For that same reason, it would be good if we as a player base actually stood up against this kinda BS happening to our game.",ruin life magic gathering great cube proxy card burning oppressive glutenous tyrant hazbro control draw control win rate feel mtg arena control thing satisfying possible tactic proc dopamine encourage spend penny spend waste lose 6 time row land screwed spell brutally countered creature removed win 4 game row opponent conceding chance simply someone bad seriously wonder bot planted win plus format worse worse mtg arena rigged unfun matchmaker unfun simply balanced shamble fun january 2022 bunch mythic tier past platinum platinum janurary 2 win diamond teir kid lost 20 game row 40 land screw 40 problem autotapper timeouts connection error last 20 insane ups brought bottom platinum tier amazing simply bad angry toxic dopamine cycle hopefully lucky good playgroup magic toxic gathering community good base stood kinda b happening,0,-0.0772
2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"TL;DR? ------ do I recommend MTG:Arena Yes; in-person would be(read is) better but this will do, indeed, this will do.  ------ TL;DR?

-
-

For individuals new to the game, the potential expense can be overwhelming, particularly if one is not already highly skilled or able to dedicate extensive time to grinding out drafts. While drafting can be enjoyable, it may deter newcomers who are hesitant to immediately invest a significant amount of money.

The process of completing quests for modest rewards can become tiresome and time-consuming, yielding a gradual sense of progression. Additionally, the introduction of newer crossover sets may not captivate players as much as the older sets that focused more on the rich lore of the MTG universe. Regrettably, the frequent implementation of crossovers can give the impression of a cash grab, sometimes conflicting with the cohesion of previous sets.

One glaring issue is the phenomenon of power and value creep, which has led to imbalances within the standard format. Achieving a high rank at the end of the month only rewards a few additional booster packs, which may not be perceived as satisfying given the effort invested.

Primarily centering on best-of-one matches, the game can disappoint individuals who prefer lengthier, more strategic gameplay. This format tends to favor aggressive decks and going first, thus limiting the array of playstyles and strategies that can be explored.

Moreover, the absence of social interaction in MTG:Arena can foster a sense of isolation, as interactions are limited to interactions with random screen names and encountering repetitive avatars and pets. The absence of custom rule sets or alternative game modes further stifles the potential for diverse experiences. Once a mode like Pauper is removed, players must wait for its reintroduction.

Lastly, there exists a controversy among players surrounding the ""rigged"" factor, with claims made regarding the system being rigged without clear explanation or justification. This issue appears to be unique to MTG Arena compared to other platforms like Magic Online. The matchmaking system in MTG Arena aims to maintain a 50% win/loss ratio, potentially contributing to player retention but may feel artificially manipulated. Moreover, imbalances can be experienced when going first or second, and deck matchups are determined based on subjective deck strength, leading to repetitive matchups or unfavorable pairings.

Despite its drawbacks, skill remains an essential factor in achieving success within MTG:Arena. Capitalizing on opponent mistakes can result in victories, even at higher ranks. In conclusion, I would suggest exploring alternative methods of playing Magic the Gathering, such as in-person gatherings with friends, if possible.

It is my belief that MTG:Arena fails to fully encapsulate the essence of ""the gathering"" in its online format. While the game possesses its merits, it predominantly appeals to individuals seeking a digital MTG experience, rather than offering the wealth of possibilities that the game truly encompasses.

In summary, MTG Arena offers a satisfactory means of enjoying Magic the Gathering in a digital format, albeit with some drawbacks. There is a perception of a pay-to-win aspect, the absence of trading features, and performance issues to contend with. However, the game still provides an accessible entry point into the captivating world of Magic and can be enjoyed without necessitating monetary investments.",tl dr recommend mtg arena yes read indeed tl dr individual new potential expense overwhelming particularly already highly skilled able dedicate extensive grinding draft drafting enjoyable deter newcomer hesitant immediately invest significant process completing quest modest reward tiresome consuming yielding gradual sense progression additionally introduction newer crossover set captivate player older set focused rich lore mtg universe regrettably frequent implementation crossover impression cash grab conflicting cohesion previous set glaring issue phenomenon power value creep led imbalance standard format achieving high rank reward additional booster pack perceived satisfying given effort invested primarily centering best match disappoint individual prefer lengthier strategic format tends favor aggressive deck limiting array playstyles strategy explored moreover absence social interaction mtg arena foster sense isolation interaction limited interaction random screen name encountering repetitive avatar pet absence custom rule set alternative mode stifle potential diverse experience mode pauper removed player wait reintroduction lastly exists controversy player surrounding rigged factor claim regarding rigged clear explanation justification issue appears unique mtg arena compared platform magic online matchmaking mtg arena aim maintain 50 win loss ratio potentially contributing retention artificially manipulated moreover imbalance experienced deck matchup determined based subjective deck strength leading repetitive matchup unfavorable pairing despite drawback skill remains essential factor achieving success mtg arena capitalizing opponent mistake result victory higher rank conclusion suggest exploring alternative method magic gathering gathering friend possible belief mtg arena fails fully encapsulate essence gathering online format posse merit predominantly appeal individual seeking digital mtg rather offering wealth possibility truly encompasses summary mtg arena offer satisfactory mean enjoying magic gathering digital format albeit drawback perception pay win aspect absence trading feature performance issue contend provides accessible entry captivating world magic enjoyed necessitating monetary investment,3,0.9926

440,Team Fortress 2,"Well..

Ok, Ill admit, unlike other high profile folk that have more hours then me.. I have just under 2000 hours but have been playing this game for well over 10 years.. To be exact March 8th 2009. (as my badge says)

I may be a no one in the community, but I have been supporting this game since I first played. The game I would always come back to and call ""home"".

I, over the years have made friends, enemies, servers.. Learnt different modes, meta, styles, languages.. I have been through multiple events like, The Sniper vs. Spy Update, Classless Update, the big 119th updates update (no joke..) Solider vs Demoman, Scream Fortresses, Christmas updates! You get the point..

There is no sparkle to this game anymore, I cannot jump on a 118 ping New York server, late at night waiting for the Americans to get back online in the evening, me and Banksy taking on 2Fort as Demoman to kill all soliders so that the Demoman could have his own weapon? (Spolier: Solider won, welcome to the Gunboats..) Then finding out TF2 came onto Mac and people that had it, got the ear buds, that sold well.. 

To be fair, I could go on and tell my war stories, but that feeling when the family gets a new puppy and you get shut out as no one is interested in you anymore? This is exactly whats happening with TF2 (dev side).. I always check steam stats and there is always over 50k people playing, always top 10 on the chart but something is missing..

As part of the community, us loyal people that cherish this game, we are the backbone to this beautiful creation. You don't see Blizzard (well not all the time) not maintaining their beautiful creation and of course World of Warcraft is older then this.. Maybe because of the paid subscription, but I am sure that TF2 alone use to get more money as a free to play game at one point. (Jeeze I had to pay for TF2 over 10 years ago..)

I mean ok, fair play, you have a new game coming out.. whooptie doo.. Send all the cavalry towards that.. Yet instead to the people who grew up with TF2, old players and new players. People who have spent hundreds and even thousands of dollars for now a game which to me is dying.. Not the people's fault, but your own selves..
Jumping into a casual game (YOUR servers) to be greeted by not one sniper but three sniper ""bots"" that have their own way-points, spamming ""good shot mate"", aim botting, auto spamming chat so no one can see whats written as a wall of blank appears and calling no when someone votes them a ban. When there is 3 or more of them they win the no vote anyway..

When making your own stuff glitch gets patched.. finding glitches in the items_game text file gets patched.. Oh yeah I forgot that's your profits going down the drain.. But don't worry as bots and hackers are not, so were forget about it.. the game.. the people, who truly love and support this game..

Excuse the rant but for a game that still, to me at this dire moment, is still rocking the steam charts, this should be dealt with within a matter of days or weeks.. There are no new updates like the Solider vs Demoman.. The love for this game from you, just has vanished.. 

I will carry on playing as I still love this game and class this as home. But for now, don't expect me to dedicate my time or spend money on anything till this ""bot"" situation and other stupid stuff is dealt with.. and hopefully soon. With new updates that sparkle in my eyes.. And a new bloody weapon for the Demoman as I deemed the solider win was unfair. 
 
Do I recommend it to others? Oh yes, yes I do. But at the moment with the bot situation, other stupid stuff and the game at the moment being ""devless"". No.
But still download it, go onto the community servers, find a mode, map, server and enjoy. I will give it a thumbs up but really should be a thumbs down at this point of the games life.

**New Players** the first initiate is daunting, but play for fun, learn who the characters are and the history about them. I did and it got me 2000 hours, 10 years of play and a game I could call home. There are also comics about the game to if you like to read.

Good luck and thank you for the read.",ok ill admit unlike high profile folk hour 2000 hour 10 year exact march 8th 2009 badge say community supporting call home year friend enemy server learnt different mode meta style language multiple event sniper v spy classless big 119th update joke solider v demoman scream fortress christmas update sparkle anymore 118 ping new york late night waiting american online evening banksy taking 2fort demoman kill soliders demoman weapon spolier solider welcome gunboat finding tf2 onto mac ear bud sold fair tell war story feeling family get new puppy shut interested anymore exactly whats happening tf2 side check stats 50k top 10 chart missing community loyal cherish backbone beautiful creation blizzard maintaining beautiful creation course world warcraft older maybe paid subscription tf2 alone jeeze pay tf2 10 year ago ok fair new coming whooptie doo send cavalry towards grew tf2 old player new player spent hundred thousand dollar dying fault self jumping casual server greeted sniper three sniper bot point spamming good shot mate aim botting auto spamming chat whats written wall blank appears calling someone vote ban 3 win vote anyway stuff glitch get patched finding glitch items_game text file get patched oh yeah forgot profit drain worry bot hacker forget truly love support excuse rant dire moment rocking chart dealt matter day week new update solider v demoman love vanished carry love class home expect dedicate spend till bot situation stupid stuff dealt hopefully soon new update sparkle eye new bloody weapon demoman deemed solider win unfair recommend others oh yes yes moment bot situation stupid stuff moment devless download onto community server mode map enjoy thumb thumb game life new player initiate daunting fun learn character history 2000 hour 10 year call home comic read good luck thank read,1,0.9931

As someone who used to play tf2 at its ""prime"" , It's still the same game if you think about it (except all the bots n cheaters apocalypse thats going on) but overall , same good old tf2 that makes me laugh.

As an fps shooter game i'd say its very good , each class is unique enough by itself to make the game x10 intresting. And well , thats the reason I have 3k+ hours on it .

Just give the game a try its free , and really damn good .

440,Team Fortress 2,"In a land a long, long time ago, Team Fortress 2 would be a critically acclaimed first person shooter. Boasting its colorful characters against the dreary palette of the Badlands, this game offered to many a wonderful experience. Later updates would add cosmetics, weapons, and a ton of other things to sink your teeth into. Some of those updates are not as well viewed by the community as others, like the addition of crazier and crazier hats. In recent years, the community has felt somewhat negatively towards the team of developers and their updates for this game. Though, there is something important to remember...

We first saw those deranged mercenaries nearly a decade ago! This game has been alive and kicking for a long time, and I doubt that you will soon see a day where these mercs aren't defying laws of physics, common sense, and sometimes all laws in general. You won't find many other games with a soviet in love with a 300 pound minigun that he just lugs around like it's nothing. Nor will you find a quick-witted, caffeine-fueled Bostonian who dances around the battlefield, dodging rockets and bullets like a madman. This game is very outlandish, and incredibly enjoyable. Even after years and years of pushing a payload down a track to blow up the enemies... people want to come back, because although there's some basis and objectives for the game modes, you never play the same game twice. Every match is a total surprise. Even competitively, the 9 classes and variety in what you can play with, it will give you a new experience nearly every time you play.

Years of pushing a cart filled to the brim with explosives is a hard task. Thankfully, there are new faces, hats to wear, weapons to try, and a new experience to be had every single day.",land long long ago fortress 2 critically acclaimed shooter boasting colorful character dreary palette badlands offered wonderful update add cosmetic weapon ton thing sink teeth update viewed community others addition crazier crazier hat recent year community somewhat negatively towards developer update important remember saw deranged mercenary nearly decade ago alive kicking long doubt soon mercs defying law physic common sense law general game soviet love 300 pound minigun lug quick witted caffeine fueled bostonian dance battlefield dodging rocket bullet madman outlandish incredibly enjoyable year year pushing payload track blow enemy basis objective mode twice total surprise competitively 9 class variety new nearly year pushing cart filled brim explosive hard task thankfully new face hat wear weapon new single,1,0.6115

1151340,Fallout 76,"The game itself is real good. Could be good, that is, if it wasnt literally strangulating you on your very step with LIMITS on every breath.
1. It's a buy to play game, where you feel like in worst f2p if you dont subscribe to premium account, you will be ultimately drown in crafting meterials, which overflow your meager storage chest and overencumber you almost instantly.
2. You want to sell your junk, but there's a LIMIT on cash you can get per day shared between all vendors in game.
3. You constantly find a lot of legendary eq, which weights tons, but useless for you. You can sell them for lottery scrips for a (small) chance to win something more useful, and guess what? There is a LIMIT on those scrips you can get per day, so the burden drastically increases every day, if you play at least semi-actively.
4. There is a LIMIT on what you can build in your camp, but at least it increases with your leveling, so it's acceptable. But. You can build a good big house, with an underground personal vault... and all you can store there is one aforementioned meager chest. No, you can build tens of different-looking storage chests, but they all share that same meager storage space.
5. Cherry on top: there's a LIMIT on money you can keep on your character. And it is so small that no one will sell you something decent for money, nor there is a point for you to sell anything to another player. Everything nice comes via barter only on third-party internet resources. Should I mention that cash LIMIT overflows real fast?
6. There are other limits, like on total scrips or gold amount, but those can be managed, and not a problem to me at least for now.
7. There is no way by intended game means to transfer valuables between your characters. Yes, there are workarounds to do so, but they are unsafe, or require to use help from OTHER PLAYERS.
Got real tired from constant overencumberment. I'm wasting more time to figure how to keep my loot than actually playing.

this is one of the most underwhelming multiplayer experiences I've played, but then
there's so much stuff to explore and see and find and collect, but then

they keep bringing content like new, interesting enemies and the board game thingy, but then
it's so absolutely riddled with glitches and poor performance and technical issues, but then
you meet nice people and sometimes have wholesome interactions, but then
cheating is rampant and PvP is horribly broken, but then
C.A.M.P. building and decorating is so much fun, but then
just about everything in the game is broken in one way or the other.

1151340,Fallout 76,"A few days ago I received an email from Bethesda customer service. It said that my Fallout 76 account had been suspended for cheating. They pasted in a couple of paragraphs from the code of conduct that said no use of third party cheating software was allowed.

I have never used any third party software to cheat. I have never cheated or manipulated the game in any way. I have done nothing against the code of conduct that I agreed to.

I tried to contact Bethesda or ZeniMax Media support. I found that there is no phone number to call. There is no online chat. There is no support forum. The only way to contact them is through email, which they only respond to about once a day.

I found that the only way to contest the ban was to submit a ticket to customer service.

When I tried to log on to my Bethesda account, It would not accept my password. I clicked on the “I forgot my password” link, which did nothing. I was not able to reset my password until the next day.

When I finally got into my account I tried to submit a ticket to customer service to dispute the false accusation of cheating. I used the drop-down menu to choose “My account was hacked or suspended” for the subject field. I had to fill out an online form that had required fields. Many of the drop-down menus that I had to choose from did not fit the problem I was having and there was no way to choose other options. One of the required fields was “date of account creation” which I did not remember. The form would not submit until I filled out the required field. I had to put in information I know was not right just to submit the ticket. I put in the comment field that the date of account creation was wrong because I could not remember when it was created.

I was frustrated and confused. Why would Bethesda accuse me of cheating when I had done nothing of the sort? I have been a huge Bethesda fan for years. I played Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4, and now Fallout 76.

I waited patiently for Bethesda to resolve the problem that was obviously an error. I was sure that they would see the error and reinstate my Fallout 76 account.

The first response I received from Bethesda support was an email telling me how to log on to my Bethesda account to find the date of account creation. This was the only thing in the ticket that they saw. They did not read the subject which said “My account was hacked or suspended”. I followed the instructions that they gave. It did not lead to information of when my account was created.

I responded by saying that my problem was not that I could not remember when my account was created but that it was hacked or suspended.

The second response from Bethesda support was a question asking me if there was another email I use because they said my email address on file was not associated with a suspended account.

At this point I thought they were joking. I asked as much. There is clearly a ticket on my account that says “Account permanently suspended for cheating.” I gave them the ticket number. I pasted in a copy of the email they sent me saying my account was closed for cheating. I also included a screen shot of me trying to log into my Fallout 76 account and getting a message that says “Account not verified”.

It is like the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.

Finally, I received an email stating the following.

“After a thorough review of your account, it has been determined that the account did in fact violate our Code of Conduct.  We regret to inform you that your appeal for an account ban reversal is denied due to the evidence within our system for Cheating / Exploitation enabled via a third-party program.   This account is no longer eligible to participate in Fallout 76 due to the offenses on this account.
 
Due to the extent and scale of the violation, it has been decided that this account will remain  ineligible to participate in Fallout 76 permanently. This decision was not made lightly, and it is final.”

I maintain that I have never cheated. They never gave me a chance to defend myself. They never provided the evidence that I cheated. It seems as if they don't care if I am innocent or not.

All I want to do is tell my story and find if there are other people who have been banned by Bethesda for no reason.

Update 12/01/2023

To the community,
Thank you for sharing your stories. The journey was enlightening and bizarre.

To the people who bought the game to spite my review,
Have fun with that.

To all other trolls and haters,
Check out the YouTube video:


Internet Historian: The Fall of 76
(Steam went berserk when I tried to put in the link)

Then go purchase the game for $60 and play it.

1151340,Fallout 76,"I became a big fan of Fallout 4 after my grandson talked me into getting the game. I delayed on Fallout 76 for the price to drop and to insure PVP wasn't an issue (not a fan). And I have to say there are a lot of positive things with Fallout 76. I also waited for them to do major updates etc. I do enjoy the mission...lengthy though they be. I'm a slow player (almost 70 years old).  Having to move around servers for camp emplacement is a pain but I understand why....so..not too bad. Building isn't quite as much as in Fallout 4 though you can do a lot as you choose. I do wish combat was more along the Farcry 4,5 type....where you had the chance to truly sneak into a camp and remove the baddies. But overall if you are a Fallout  fan you should enjoy this game. Graphics are good, they corrected a crashing issue, continue to add content and changes and supports different styles of play. I don't pay extra for 'Fallout 1st' (monthly fee) which gives you some nice benefits,...and while I could afford it...well I haven't paid a monthly subscription since my wow days. Like most games some of the missions are tedious but there are lots of events, dailies etc to mix up game play. So I do recommend it being an overall Fallout fan.

1151340,Fallout 76,"This is a great game. But I'm giving it a negative review for one reason:

Not because it was a hot mess on release and it took Bethesda a year and a half to fix it with the Wastelanders update.

Not because Bethesda insisted on only selling it for their own launcher in order to make as much money as possible (the Steam Store takes a cut).

Not because of the Atomic Store, in which you can buy insanely overpriced cosmetics through micro-transactions (in a $40 game, yeah..)

[i]Not even[/i] because the Atomic Store also offers Repair and Scrap kits (i.e. [u]NOT[/u] cosmetics) despite Pete Hines repeatedly promising players that the micro-transactions would be limited to cosmetic items.

But because since release players have been requesting unlimited stash space for junk, and Bethesda have ignored this for more than a year only to offer a monthly subscription allowing you to pay $15 dollars a month [i]for unlimited junk space[/i]. 

Since release the excuse for not giving players unlimited stash space for junk has been that it was not technically possible, that it would crash servers. Fallout 1st proves that that was bullsh*t.

EDIT (~60h): I see a lot of people in the comments misunderstand the review. I'm not asking for unlimited stash space. I'm only asking for unlimited junk storage.

EDIT 2 (~65h): I have subscribed to Fallout 1st. Let's see if this changes my perception of things.

EDIT 3 (~120h): My perception of things has not changed a bit after 50+ hours with Fallout 1st. The scrap box should be free. Maybe even the tent (which serves as an extra camp with a stash and a scrap box, so you always can unload your items if you get overencumbered while exploring). The fact that I could not enjoy the game after 60 hours without Fallout 1st is bad. Really bad. No game should be like this.",great giving negative hot mess release took bethesda half fix wastelanders bethesda insisted selling launcher order possible store take cut atomic store insanely overpriced cosmetic micro transaction 40 yeah atomic store offer repair scrap kit e cosmetic despite pete hines repeatedly promising player micro transaction limited cosmetic item release player requesting unlimited stash space junk bethesda ignored offer monthly subscription allowing pay 15 dollar unlimited junk space release excuse giving player unlimited stash space junk technically possible crash server fallout 1st prof bullsh 60h comment misunderstand asking unlimited stash space asking unlimited junk storage 2 65h subscribed fallout 1st change perception thing 3 120h perception thing changed bit 50 hour fallout 1st scrap box maybe tent serf extra camp stash scrap box unload item overencumbered exploring enjoy 60 hour fallout 1st bad bad,0,-0.7783

1151340,Fallout 76,"I was wrong about Fallout 76. I had completely dismissed this entry into the series years ago and I probably would never have played it, if it weren’t for friends and the Humble Choice. I vaguely remember the criticisms from its launch and they are still completely valid. It’s a typical Bethesda game absolutely filled to the brim with bugs (and I’m not talking about the radroaches!) but I would be lying if I said this game wasn’t fun.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Approaching this game expecting heavy rpg choices will leave anyone disappointed, this is no [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/Fallout_New_Vegas/]FNV[/url]. However what it does well is bring a light Fallout theme park to a multiplayer action format. Actually seeing other players in the world makes it feel alive, playing with friends is a blast. There is always an event going on and combined with the folklore, culture and mythology of Appalachia this creates for a very engaging and unique experience.

You can play in first or third person and solo or in teams of up to four persons. It’s very easy to join random teams and doing so provides more benefits even if you never play together. For world events you don’t even need to join a group, just so long as you’re in the area you will get credit for completion.

There is a lot of flexibility in character choices. Beginning is limited but it doesn’t take long to start collecting enough levels to unlock perks cards and skill points. Perks can be changed on the fly (literally mid-battle if needed) and don’t worry about spending skill points either because they can be changed at a dedicated machine infinitely. 

The most prestigious loot is randomised and can have between one to three extra traits. ‘Legendary’ items can’t be scrapped like ordinary items but can be traded in for currency specifically related to rerolling traits and purchasing more legendary weapons.

There is a moderately deep crafting system which mostly revolves around the collection junk, just enough balance that you might have to consciously collect specific items but not so much it’s a tedious bore. Coincidentally if you die you will only lose items classified as junk. 

[b]Performance and Bugs[/b]
My FPS continues to be all over the place, I have never been able to get a stable 60 FPS. I don’t crash every session I play but it happened enough that I prepare for it now - especially after playing solo one session I crashed shortly after dying, losing all my collected junk.

Servers will occasionally freeze up and NPCs will be stuck in place without attacking, even after their death they’re playing a gory version of musical statues.

Enemy AI often seems borked, easily tricked by stealth even when you don’t have any stealth perks equipped. Stairs will confuse them and if you’re able to jump up to a high spot you can take your sweet time chipping away high enemy health.

[b]Community[/b]
The first few hours playing I met some of the friendliest people I have ever met in a video game. They were literally bending over backwards to be nice, giving out weapons and other useful items. They also loved showing off their houses and I’m always a sucker for wanting to see a person's creativity within games. Most people keep to themselves outside of small interactions but the in-game emotes are so warm and expressive you can almost have entire conversations only using them.

Servers are split into PVE or PVP with a maximum of 24 persons at any time. Custom/Private servers are locked behind the ‘Fallout 1st’ subscription. There are a few ‘trolls’ trying to PVP on PVE servers but they can’t really do anything unless they are actively engaged with - just make sure to store your junk before doing anything stupid.

[b]Trade[/b]
Economy is busted. Given that this is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic game, you would have thought food, materials and tech resources would be immensely valuable but nope - worthless. Everything is so plentiful and constantly respawning. Server hopping is a valid strategy for the few items that you can’t find easily. The most valuable things appear to be plans from previous events and seasons and occasionally weapons/armour with very specific traits. People who own these typically want way more than what a newbie could afford and people who wanted them had already farmed them before they became rare. For everything else, keep looking til you find someone selling them for pennies.

[b]Exploration[/b]
The map ends up feeling REALLY small because of the instantaneous nature of the fast travel. Previous open-world Bethesda titles have similar problems but a lot of quests in F76 have you revisiting locations and this exaggerates this feeling. It’s a bit of a double edge sword, being able to teleport to your friends is a must but you can accidentally skip a lot of content. Exploration without purpose feels underwhelming, the landmarks themselves are amazing but unless you have a quest or a specific reason for being there, you’re unlikely to be rewarded with useful items.  

[b]C.A.M.P and Monetization[/b]
Honestly, the player housing (C.A.M.P) is one of the best additions to Fallout 76. You can choose almost anywhere in the world to plant your roots and yes, it’s clunky and awkward to build but  there is access to a lot of items to build a decent little hovel without additional purchases using real money. I love my little pancake house.

Atoms are the real money currency. They are used to buy (mostly) cosmetic items from the Atomic Shop. You can earn a decent amount just doing in-game challenges and progressing through the season pass. I've managed to earn about 5,000 so far. To purchase them directly would have cost me £31.99. 

Fallout 1st monthly membership includes an additional 1650 Atoms every month at a cost of £11.99 (that’s more than World of Warcraft!!). Personally I think this is not even remotely worth it, you can earn more than enough cosmetic items through the free season pass. The biggest appeal to actually purchasing it, after speaking to others, comes from the infinite junk storage but it really shouldn’t be. It feels like the antithesis of hoarding habits many who play open-world games end up adopting and the cynic in me says they’re artificially creating problems and solving it with money.

[b]Modding[/b]
I was gobsmacked to discover that some mods work with public servers. My experience is second hand from a friend as I never downloaded any but amongst the mods they had included: improved load times and performance; a text based chat system that worked cross-server; visual notifications for nearby items (such as bobbleheads/magazines/recipes/etc).

[b]Achievements and Endgame[/b]
Completionists be aware there are two reputation grinds, one achievement that will require a second playthrough and then.… ‘Troglodiced’ (Kill 100 Trogs with an Auto Axe).
Trogs are an enemy only found in the end game raid-like instances called ‘expeditions’. The recipe for the auto-axe is sold by only one NPC for 1,000 stamps. Neither the auto-axe, nor the recipe, can be traded with other players. To earn stamps you have to play through expeditions but before you can start an expedition you have to do three specific dailies to ‘charge up a battery’. The first expedition I completed earned me 3 stamps… The most you can earn is 10 stamps per expedition (8 if you are not the group leader). 

Endgame in general is rather lacklustre and grindy. Revolving around doing the same daily quests and daily/weekly challenges working towards completing the season pass. There are big bosses but defeating them rarely feels like an accomplishment. However, I’ve still put over 150 hours into this game (which is nothing compared to some), I do not regret it and will happily still be checking in from time to time.",wrong fallout 76 completely dismissed entry series year ago probably friend humble choice vaguely remember criticism launch completely valid typical bethesda filled brim bug talking radroaches lying fun approaching expecting heavy choice leave disappointed url http store steampowered com app 22380 fallout_new_vegas fnv url bring light fallout theme park multiplayer action format seeing player world make alive friend blast event combined folklore culture mythology appalachia creates engaging unique third solo team four person easy join random team provides benefit world event join group long credit completion flexibility choice beginning limited long collecting level unlock perk card skill point perk changed fly literally mid battle needed worry spending skill point changed dedicated machine infinitely prestigious loot randomised three extra trait legendary item scrapped ordinary item traded currency specifically related rerolling trait purchasing legendary weapon moderately deep crafting mostly revolves collection junk balance consciously collect specific item tedious bore coincidentally die lose item classified junk performance bug fps continues able stable 60 fps crash session happened prepare especially solo session crashed shortly dying losing collected junk server occasionally freeze npc stuck attacking death gory version musical statue enemy ai borked easily tricked stealth stealth perk equipped stair confuse able high spot sweet chipping high enemy health community hour met friendliest met video literally bending backwards nice giving weapon useful item loved showing house sucker wanting creativity game outside small interaction emotes warm expressive entire conversation server split pve pvp maximum 24 person custom private server locked fallout 1st subscription troll trying pvp pve server unless actively engaged store junk stupid trade economy busted given supposed post apocalyptic thought food material tech resource immensely valuable nope worthless plentiful constantly respawning hopping valid strategy item easily valuable thing appear plan previous event season occasionally weapon armour specific trait typically newbie afford wanted already farmed became rare else til someone selling penny exploration map end feeling small instantaneous nature fast travel previous open world bethesda title similar problem quest f76 revisiting location exaggerates feeling bit double edge sword able teleport friend accidentally skip content exploration purpose feel underwhelming landmark amazing unless specific unlikely rewarded useful item c p monetization honestly housing c p best addition fallout 76 choose anywhere world plant root yes clunky awkward build access item build decent hovel additional purchase real love pancake house atom real currency mostly cosmetic item atomic shop earn decent challenge progressing season pas managed earn 5 000 far purchase directly cost 31 99 fallout 1st monthly membership includes additional 1650 atom cost 11 99 world warcraft personally remotely worth earn cosmetic item season pas biggest appeal purchasing speaking others come infinite junk storage feel antithesis hoarding habit open world game adopting cynic say artificially creating problem solving modding gobsmacked discover mod public server hand friend downloaded amongst mod included improved load time performance text based chat worked cross visual notification nearby item bobbleheads magazine recipe achievement endgame completionists aware reputation grind achievement require playthrough troglodiced kill 100 trogs auto axe trogs enemy found raid instance called expedition recipe auto axe sold 1 000 stamp neither auto axe recipe traded player earn stamp expedition expedition three specific daily charge battery expedition completed earned 3 stamp earn 10 stamp per expedition 8 group leader endgame general rather lacklustre grindy revolving daily quest daily weekly challenge working towards completing season pas big boss defeating rarely feel accomplishment 150 hour compared regret happily checking,0,0.9826
1151340,Fallout 76,"[h1]TL;DR at the end.[/h1]

I'm speaking [b]purely through my experience with the game.[/b] I am not a reviewer or anything, this is my opinion and you might disagree and probably will. But opinions are opinions, if you enjoy Fallout 76, kudos to you, I love it when people are happy with their time spent on X or Y.
If only Steam had a neutral score. It's what the game deservers.


[i][u]Is Fallout 76 a good Fallout game?[/u][/i] No, far from it. Heck, I would say it's the worse Fallout experience out there. Even after almost 3 years, it's still kind of a mess. Gamebreaking bugs? Not that I have encountered, but lots and lots of other inconveniences, such as: frame drops, server issues, inventory management, clunky combat, missing items, getting out of bounds, player interactions, etc.

[i][u]Frame drops:[/u][/i] What happens when you decide to use a singleplayer-focus engine and force it to handle multiplayer? Fallout 76 happens. This game is terribly optimized, even if you have the recommended requirements expect fps drops in some open world areas, combine that with clunky combat and you have one hell of a combination. Indoors instances are fine for the most part (looking at you daily ops). So if you look at the minimun requirements and believe it will run at 50'ish fps (obviously depending on your specs) you're wrong, it's probably 20-30, be prepared to struggle. If I have to dig into the game files to fix performance issues we are doing something wrong.

[i][u]Server Issues:[/u][/i] Let's see: we have a good engine! Just a terrible choice for multiplayer I hope servers can at least be stable! And yes, for the most part they are. Sometimes enemies tp, sometimes you tp, sometimes it disconnects you just because, sometimes it can rewind your progress (granted it only happened once and it was just minutes of desync, didn't lose anything, just had to do a step on a quest again). It clearly struggles to keep up with everyone.

[i][u]Inventory Management:[/u][/i] I will never understand how there's people out there that defend Bethesda for selling us a better stash. The vanilla stash has a total weight limit of 1200 ibs. Sounds like a lot? It's not, it might look like it at the start and you might go ¨pppfff this wont get full anytime soon¨ ooohhh but it will and when it does. It's hell. Welp, time to scrap/sell weapons/armor if you want to keep the sweet sweet junk with you. Even your character's weight limit is awful, even if you have max Strength, max carry weight perks, lower weight of X item perks. You're still gonna get overencumbered, your inventory will sit at a nice 249/250, just as an example. So it's about collecting junk until the limit, scrap it on your CAMP and repeat, or you would repeat if it weren't because your stash will eventually be full as I mentioned. 
Sometimes it even bugs and you become overencumbered when you're clearly not hitting the weight limit. Good luck fast traveling!

[i][u]Clunky combat:[/u][/i] Combat in modern Fallout games has always been a mixed bagged, it's either good or meh at best. And here it's pure meh. Let me elaborate further; it plays like F4 or even F3 but it sure as hell doesn't feel as good. 60% of the guns in this game are just boring, you got your standard pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, gamma guns, laser guns, melee weapons, etc. They all feel plastic'ky, there's no weight, they sound boring. What I'm trying to get to is that they do not distinct from each other. It's just a bad gunplay overrall. What about the other 40%? It's actually really really good! When you start getting the late game guns it's a whole different experience----and that's also an issue. Difficulty in this game is everywhere, it's either hard just because or too easy oneshot everything'ish. And for some people, including me, that's just not engaging after the 12453th time. Weapons have durability, check, ammo management is there, check. While annoying as it is, it's Fallout after all.
[i]Sidenote: There's always a meta, there's always something that's on top of the food chain. And that's fine! But if that means some weapons are just not reliable at all *cough* bows *cough* why have them in the first place? Also give love to laser guns![/i]

[i][u]Missing items:[/u][/i] Honestly what's the point in grinding out gear just for it to have the slightest chance of dissapearing from your inventory forever? Well, I got that slightest chance. I lost legendary armor part of my build and a whole set of PA. 
Bethesda wont do anything about it and never will, believe in that, it's been an issue for a long time now. They'll just ignore your ticket and move on, because from their perspective you're a liar going out for free stuff.
Some lucky people just log off and in for it to be fixed, some do and doesn't do anything, can you guess which one I was?

[i][u]Out of bounds:[/u][/i] Okay, this is just a small thing that probably wont affect you but hear me out. As a fellow Vault Dweller Cannibal, it's so annoying eating your victims and *puuf* falling through the ground. It may not happen, but the chance of dying in the middle of nowhere and having to sprint like crazy for your loot is just annoying.

[i][u]Player Interactions:[/u][/i] It's been an issue since launch and will always be an issue because of the game's core concept of an Online Open World Fallout Game. Simply put: Everyone is playing their Fallout adventure at the same time and they sure as hell are the protagonist. ¨But I'm a solo player, I don't care!¨ Then why are you playing an online Fallout game? You might as well go to New Vegas and have one hell of a ride there.
Anyways, the world is just hugeeeeee and also empty. NPCs can't carry the emptiness, they'll just stand there and repeat the same two lines, and when you finally find somebody it usually goes like:
X: *heart*
Y: *heart* *leave*
PVP players are only a 10% of the playerbase and they seen to have a bad time looking to 1v1 somebody else other than Dave level 750 over there. So if you're looking to do that, be prepared to struggle too. Maybe adding a whole PVP dedicated server would fix it, but Bethesda doesn't care about PVP, they did try with Nuclear Winter the Battle Royale mode but we all know how that turned out. 
It's not all negatives though, CAMPs are amazing! It's crazy what other people can do with such a limited builder and the best interactions with someone will happen on your or their CAMP. The community is friendly 90% of the time, so don't be afraid to salute a fellow dweller!

[h1]But I still like you.[/h1]
Despite all that, I still like this game, but I cannot defend it at all, on the countrary I will give it all the hard love it needs just to be better. And that's about it, my main issues with F76, there's stuff I didn't talk about like seasons, or the terrible writting or quests in general. I also didn't mention the perk system, which makes the combat way more enjoyable once you get the hang of a build.

[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
Fallout 76, is it better now? Yes, 100%. Does that make it a good game? No, It's mediocre at best, if you have the reference of what a Fallout game has to have then you're probably gonna have lots of  issues with it. Newcomers to Fallout in general should be fine but believe me when I say there's a better product out there. This game is the worse first impression you're gonna get of the franchise.
Terrible inventory management, lackluster multiplayer experience, boring gun play, dumb difficulty scaling, performance issues and many others.
Want to buy it? Wait for sale, it's not worth the full price tag, not even those Deluxe editions. And please don't support Fallout First, it's a joke (all though it's your money, don't listen to this crazy girl).

1151340,Fallout 76,"What if I told you that the endgame in Fallout 76 requires you to build a team of 4 and scatter about the map looking for 24 time sensitive encrypted key fragments. After finding them, you sit down together and decrypt a complicated and specific code that allows you to launch a nuclear missile onto the playable map. Feeling accomplished, your team gets together to assault one of the nuclear missile silos in an attempt to do your first launch. You spend a majority of your resources finding ways through this highly classified military facility and fighting off hordes of powerful robots. When you finally launch the nuke, it temporarily alters the playable map to a much crazier state. When you travel there, a giant boss appears. Already drained of most of your resources from clearing the silo, you fight with all you've got and scrape by to barely defeat the mighty enemy in time. You and your buddies claim awesome loot and talk about how you can't wait to do it again in a week or so after you've built up more materials.


Doesn't that sound incredible? Amazing experience. 

Now this is what it's really like. You google the launch code because once someone completes it, it's the same code for everyone. Solo, you clip through the front door of the missile silo, which causes the game to not trigger any enemies, and immediately launch without fighting anything significant. The nuke lands and does nothing to the terrain except change the color of some plants. The boss spawns and you fire on it, but some random player with a hacked weapon kills it nearly instantly before you do enough damage, so you get no rewards. 10 minutes later you launch another nuke only to lag out in ground zero because enemies are endlessly spawning under the ground. You eventually kill the boss and get basic items that you could loot practically anywhere else in the world. 


This experience pretty much sums up the entire game. Fallout 76 was masterfully crafted... on the whiteboard. In execution it is frequently a catastrophe. If half the things in this game actually worked the way they intended, I feel like this would literally be one of the best games of all time. But because almost every experience is bastardized, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I have sunken numerous hours into this game because I play video games 24/7.

So, you're tied with a limited stash in terms of economy ""balance"".

BUT, for a monthly fee, they're ready to forget about this principle and provide you with an unlimited junk stash.

Otherwise, you're required to heavily manage your inventory instead of having fun. It's a ""freemium"" model in a paid game.

1151340,Fallout 76,"In 2018, they tried to sell Fallout fans a hardcore multiplayer survival experience, a lonely desolate world full of horrifying creatures and insane griefers launching nukes at your head. Now, in 2021, they have turned it into post-apocalyptic Animal Crossing. It's a game about socializing, building your camp, running a store, crafting cooler stuff, collecting rare junk/outfits for your museum, and occasionally fighting an enormous, pregnant, mutant bat. I feel like if Bethesda could do a better job promoting what the game has become, they would attract more new players.

As a lifelong Fallout fan, and a single-player RPG gamer in general, I never wanted other random people running around in my wasteland. I tried to shut them out and play the game as a solo experience until a random high level player stumbled on me building my camp, flagged me down, and basically forced me to take some cool new building plans. When I tried to launch my first nuke solo, a lvl. 400 player followed me into the silo and helped me complete the quest with nothing more than thumbs-up emotes shared between us.  Visiting other random camps and shelters, and just seeing the creativity of the community has become one of my favorite pastimes.

As a Fallout game, it now ranks among my favorites, but it's a bit of a mixed bag and YMMV. The story content that is clearly pre-Wastelanders patch is [b]so good[/b]. It reminds me a lot of Fallout 1 in tone. It's more serious and personal, and all told through long holotapes, extremely dense terminal entries, and environmental clues. The NPC quests from Wastelanders on are a bit more varied in quality. I really liked some and didn't care so much for others, but I appreciate the attempt at making them more dynamic like old Fallout and less [i]go here kill thing loot stuff[/i] quests like in Fallout 4. However, the ""live-service"" aspect of it all means that a lot of the story content is ""coming in the future"" and feels unfinished or left on a cliffhanger.`

The combat feels a little underdeveloped and broken, which is nothing new for a Fallout game so I am not particularly bothered by it. I like where they've landed with the survival elements. It's cool that eating, drinking, resting, and diseases all matter in the Wasteland now, but you aren't really punished for ignoring them if you want to. The monetization sucks and the stuff is way overpriced, but that's just old man yelling at cloud talk. Those things aren't going away from gaming any time soon.

If you love Fallout or if you want to build a house and hang out in the wasteland, you will probably find something to love about this game.

1151340,Fallout 76,"[h1]Season 3 just started, so you might think, that Bethesda had enough time to fix their game, right? In meanwhile they managed to implement paywall similar to what you can find in F2P games, so that mean game is working like it should, right? Well, NO, and I am writing this review, to warn as many people as possible, so they wont pay for this broken software. Amount of positive reviews this game got now, is literaly incomprehensible. Especialy when we consider technical side of whole experience and how ugly this game is.[/h1]

The most positive thought in the context of Fallout 76 is that we should be glad, because Bethesda produces computer games and not, for example, software for respirators.
Just imagine that vision of some parallel universe, where what I just said is a reality and everyday life, especially when we consider it's 2020 right now. 
We should all put our hands together in a prayer (you too atheists!), because in the end our lives are not in danger, only mental side of our health is somehow exposed, but in this case solution is simple - just don't buy Fallout 76, no matter how big discount is, no matter how much Todd Howard is waving at you, smiling, telling you that ""it just works"" and you should try it on your own. 
No, you shouldn't, because this whole thing is simply not working. 

I avoided Fallout 76 for a long time after it was first released, and I started playing it when it was launched on Steam. I got baited by positive reviews pretending game is now fixed, and it's safe to buy it. 
No, it's not and never will, because engine used to make this Fallout is simply too broken and too old to handle multiplayer game.
There's a large pool of bugs and glitches, and Bethesda is pretending that they're fixing them, but in reality every single fix is bringing back old bugs. 
It's always the same scheme -> something is not working -> after two months (or even more) they apply fix (which break something else) -> week later new update break it to previous state for another two months -> then they release another fix... this circle never ends. You stuck in dialogue with NPC and can't progress your daily quest? Your turrets attack your own structures? Your perk/mutation is not working? Game is perma-freezing on loading screens and you have to restart it every 30 minutes? You lost progress because servers stability is a joke? Welcome in Fallout 76, where in endgame you will face bug every two minutes! I could make a very long list of bugs and other problems players face, but it would be just too long and it's hard to guess which bugs are active now, because like I said previously - Bethesda mastered bugs rotation in this game.

Optimization in this game is just like everything else - how it work (when it work) is depending on various circumstances and changes every patch they apply. If you just made new character, and you run trough early game in 60fps, then in endgame you will have 30fps with regular stutters. It is like this, because amount of items you carry and store in stash directly affects your framerate, and to be honest I've never seen something that much broken in any other game. Fallout 76 in a nutshell. 

But let's talk about something positive this game has to offer, and in this case first thing coming to my mind, is community this game has. People are friendly and very helpful, they will explain everything you want to know, no matter how long it will take. They will craft gear for you, give you materials, help with quests, build structures you can't build on your own yet. 
But there is a dark shadow hiding behind all those friendly faces. I am talking about small group (but very loud) of players, fanatics, trolls and sect-like minority. To understand what I am talking about, you can just browse Steam forums of Fallout 76 for 5 minutes and you'll see it on your own. Why I am mentioning them? I am doing this only because Bethesda is doing nothing about problem, they are allowed to keep offending and attacking people who dared (how dare they?!?!) to criticize Bethesda. They'll keep striking on you and reporting your posts, and you might end up warned/banned for speaking your opinion in mannered way. Yes, Bethesda has their own ""freedom of speech"" standards, and it's very close to what you can face in People's Republic of China.

Imagine you can build various items in your camp, and then you can use them to get buffs for your character. Great idea, right? In theory, yes, but you have to use each item for 40-50 seconds to recieve specific buff, so if you want to get all of them you waste 5 (!!!) minutes of your time, and one hour later you have to repeat whole process. Everytime you want to craft/repair/build you have to manualy change your perks loadout, which takes a lot of your time, and when you're done you have to manualy switch to your main build. Bethesda promised to implement perk loadouts system months ago, but it's not just about that. The thing is, that whole perk system lack any logic and common sense, because perks should be splitted into two categories - active and passive, and crafting ones should not steal slots. When you want to buff yourself using items from your inventory, you have to scroll trough whole menu to find them one by one. Every few quests/events, you have to do general cleaning of your inventory, because game keep throwing useless (and heavy) stuff at you as ""reward"". Every single system this game has is unintuitive, frustrating and not rewarding, and every simple thing you want to do takes ages to complete. 

At first it seems interesting, because you discover new places while hiking, do various quests, and simply enjoy it. But this phase ends pretty fast when you hit midgame, where grind begins and you realize how many limits this game has. In order to reach endgame you have to grind, everyday. How much you can store is limited, how big you camp can be is also limited, daily quests, daily currency gain, everything is made in a way to make sure you'll play game everyday to reach your daily cap, and make just a slight or no progress at all. Everything from events on map to daily quests is repetitive and boring.

Game is designed in a way, where player feel hounded and forced to play everyday in order to reach daily limits, and if someone play everyday, that mean there's higher chance he will spend real cash to get additional stuff or to buy premium. Fallout 76 preys on basic human instincts, the desire to show off, being noticed, generaly speaking - need to be ""cool"" in other people eyes. Everything in this Fallout is built like a wall surrounding all these behaviours and feelings. They might tell you, that you don't need all that stuff, but believe me, you want it. That's how human brain works. Atomic shop is a masterpiece when it comes to psychological manipulation, fake feeling of items availability being ""limited"" by time, so you have to buy them before they're gone, discounts lasting for limited time, great deals for premium owners. Atomic shop, seasons, game mechanics, boring daily/weekly challenges, everything this game offers in the end has just one common goal - to make sure you're attached enough to play everyday, so at some point you might start thinking, that it wont be a crime if you spend additional money to make your in-game life easier and more colorful. 

I understand servers do not run on fresh air and companies want to earn money, and there's nothing wrong with that. But this is paid game, not some F2P title for android. It's also impostant to mention, that every new feature (like the newest thing available in game - shelters) is hiding 90% of new content and fun behind a paywall. Bethesda is literaly moving border to see how far they can go, and how much they can earn before this $ fountain dries up.

Negatives
- Bethesda listens to the wrong people and does the wrong thing.
""I don't like it when it tooo dawk"" - Beta player who doesn't play anymore
* Makes nights too bright
""Wat if Atom Shawp was real place!"" - Reddit Galaxy brain who doesn't understand the amount of weekly work involved.
* Plasters Cardboard Vaultboy Cutout Shortcut Everywhere

- CAMP building could use less restrictions and more customization options.
- Lack of End Game Content
Only three events still exist that are intended for expert players, with the last one introduced two years ago.

- No more vault raids.
Expert event fumbled at launch. Instead of reworking it without the timer and adding a more appropriate boss, they dropped it entirely. Only remnant is a downsized version being used as an arena for Daily Ops.

- Content is constantly delayed or canceled entirely.
Major updates get delayed by a month or more. Four stars and improved pets silently dropped. Vaults dropped or downsized to empty smaller versions . NW was dropped with two unreleased maps. Completed presidential event dropped. Mole village and other areas dropped. Talks of PVP factions and survival competitions that never came to fruition. 

- New content is often short & unsatisfying.
Majority of new quest lines that come out every 8 months (if we're lucky) can be completed in under an hour. Choices don't matter and only affect some dialogue. The Pitt/Expeditions is just Daily Ops all over again. Better armor/power armor was introduced, but the best weapons of the game are still ones from launch.

- Legacy and Hacked Weapons
If you are new and have a friend who can hook you up, move this into the positive. If not, witness players seemingly tear through end game content without effort. Legacy weapons mostly consist of explosive energy weapons  that were removed from being dropped for being too powerful. However they were duped and thousands of them still exist in the game. 
There are also hacked weapons, weapons injected into the game that gave insane damage beyond intention. For a year, Bethesda refused to acknowledge these weapons even existed until the most common ones were disabled.

- Bethesda has no social responsibility. They ignore problems, until it publicly becomes a problem. 

If you have a legitimate issue even when the decision is ""final and not made lightly"", complain on reddit and hope it gains traction. Otherwise, it will never get resolved. People who lost their equipment due to a glitch (Vault Raid Event) or something malicious (Equipment stealer) were initially told nothing could be done about it.

Item Duplication via in game exploits ran wild for the first 3 months of launch with little to no disciplinary action... which of course just allowed the problem to spread with the assumption nothing would come of doing them. Instead of just wiping the characters and taking social responsibility, they banned a significant amount of people ""indefinitely"" and only unbanned them if they kept submitted support tickets about it months later. These duplicated items which include the best weapons still exist and continue to be given out freely or put on auction websites.

Nuclear Winter, their battle royale had tons of potential. It was then attacked by hackers using sophisticated third party software on a daily basis. During this time, it was proven their support stopped responding to tickets (with evidence!!) about the issue. Often just marking them as ""Resolved"" so that they could no longer be escalated. 

The NW bans didn't come until reddit and other outlets took to it publicly. Many of these hackers persisted for weeks, even months before being banned. Most of which only got a 3 day ban (sounds pretty light compared to the indefinite ban), just to go out and do it again before getting a permanent one two weeks later. 

- Code of Conduct really means, ""Whatever we feel like""

Recently a player known as ""TopHatFetus"" who used the name since launch had their name forcibly changed to OpalPenguin2. Instead of leaving it at just that, they also said this would be a permanent violation despite never having done anything else in the past. This was likely done in response to recent US politics. 

When researching the issue further, it appears other players were unfairly given these violations and even three day bans. These names which are subjectively offensive at best included TwistingHips78 (claims to have been mass reported by a troll group), AbhorsenRaist (named after a famous fantasy book), and bclinton8 (His real name actually happened to be William Clinton), Jack-The_Stripper (Parody Name). ManyFaces88 and MommySalami managed to get their violations reversed after resorting to reddit. It can be assumed many more people were affected, but have gone on unreported.

In a mature rated online game full of obscene material, a name like Bamboobzle (also banned) would be the least of my worries. I have also witnessed and reported legitimate harassment and racism with evidence, only for it to be ignored

- Sinseer 
An infamous troll among the Fallout 76 PC community who had seemingly been banned from every major discord, facebook group and reddit.  Footage still exists of this user engaging in extremely vulgar rants (on stream and in PUBLIC VOICE CHAT), using exploits, running two characters at once, using a voice disguiser, stalking and harassing other players. He also ran a website dedicated to name & shaming and even included players who had never even met him before. 

This individual for reasons unknown, managed to develop an open line with Bethesda in the form of phone calls and expedited support tickets for two years. Eventually the shenanigans got so far out of hand, they rightfully cut the relationship off and banned him. Of course, not before having amounted over 16,000 hours in the game.

In contrast, this beloved and recognized youtuber who promotes the game in a positive light received a three day ban for ""griefing"". What happened you may ask? A group of trolls found a way to by pass pacifist and repeatedly destroy her camp. Getting annoyed, her husband got on the mic and let out a small vulgar line which the group mass reported.

What happened to the griefers who exploited to instigate the scenario? Nothing.

1151340,Fallout 76,"I've played through most of the game's story now, gotten to level 50, gotten to the Officer On Deck quest and... well... I gave up. Entirely. And it's because of one reason. The fucking stashbox.

I am convinced that the stashbox's cap was raised JUST to make it so you'd fill it near the end of the game, because if you like hoarding resources in this game (Like you do in Fallout 4 when base building) then sorry buckaroo, but your box will become more full than a hentai character during a fucking gang-bang with three Deathclaws. As soon as it got full and I had like 20lbs of screws on me that I couldn't deposit, because for some fucked reason the junk weighs more than it does in Fallout 4, I immediately realized what the true purpose of Fallout 1st was.

To create a problem, then sell a solution for it. Yes, I know I am basically beating a dead horse at this point but seriously, what the actual fuck Bethesda? Do I look like the kind of fucking person who would want to spend 15£ a month just so I can get infinite scrap storage? The scrapbox should be fucking FREE. I don't care if you need to fucking kill the Scorchbeast Queen 69420 times or some shit to unlock its blueprint.

So, I can entirely say, with all my heart, fuck this game. I'm done with it.

EDIT: FYI, if you leave a comment disagreeing with me and saying the game is amazing and your only argument for that is insults, I'm just gonna delete it. I don't really like getting notifications from those types of people. If you are gonna just disagree with me or say something I got wrong, go right ahead. Just don't be a dick about it, aight?

This game has one of the best maps and some of the coolest dungeons in a Bethesda game, what held this game back and still does to an extent is in how soulless it felt and somewhat still feels, thought it absolutely has gotten better. But if you let people have a singleplayer experience of this game and let them mod it, I'm certain there would be so much more fun to be had in the world of Fallout 76.

1151340,Fallout 76,"
After 3200+ hours since B.E.T.A. I think it's time to tell anyone who's new or plans to come to the 76 universe my thoughts on the game and how it evolved in 4 years to what it is today. I'm choosing to write a review here because it's probably the only place Bethesda cannot delete any criticism, unlike the official discord and now the retired official forums where moderators erase any post that resembles anything else but a praise to their games. Since this will be a mostly negative review I'm going to start with the cons instead of the pros here:

1) Communication with the player base exists as long as the player base does not criticize the features of the game as they were designed by Bethesda. After 2 years of testing the changes on live servers - with disastrous consequences - a public test server has been made available to the fans - but still the bugs make it to live servers and the feedback is mostly ignored by Bethesda. All in all it's a ""yeah, we hear you, but we're going to do things our way anyway because we know better"".

2) Every patch is a russian roulette. It may break some minor things or may take out the game entirely for a couple of hours/days depending on the severity. There is no patch that doesn't mess something up.

3) Development is atrociously slow. Took them 2 years to bring NPCs to the game, one year and a half to bring the BOS questline, another 2 years to bring the expeditions to the Pitt. The new content is also becoming less and less polished and feels more like ""we need to copy something from the older fallouts so we can keep people interested"". Lately it seems they do the bare minimum when adding new content, because sometime ago they put on the roadmap and they can't postpone it anymore.

4) There is an overpriced shop and a subscription fee. Both are optional, but without them you'll be missing some important quality of life features. The shop items are rotating thus you don't know when something you like may be available again and that's how they create the fear of missing out, putting pressure on you to buy it right now. Some goes with special offers for a limited time. And regardless of the subscription, the really cool stuff will be available in bundles that can only be bought with real money. It's not quite 16x times the details, but it's definitely 16x times the cost or more if you're not careful.

5) There is a new battlepass every three months. It's called a season. Every season we get daily and weekly challenges that force you to login almost everyday if you want to get the cool rewards and those cool rewards are among the last on the battlepass. Sure there might be one or two in the middle to keep you going, but if you really want the good stuff you need to finish the season. It's considered new content. Used to be cosmetic only, now they're adding actual items to it so if you don't wanna grind like crazy afterwards, you'd better login daily and finish your battlepass. They're designed to keep the players paying the subscription when there is no actual content being released.

6) It's a looter/shooter in the end. The endgame is getting good gear. But unfortunately this too has a major twist. Welcome to Casino 76, where you will re-roll everyday - for a limited amount of course - the stats on your gear. Legendary gear has a maximum of 3 attributes. Let's say you need a good chest piece and rolled the dice, you got 1 good attribute and 2 crappy ones. Next time you roll you do not get to keep the good attribute, you roll again all 3. Chances are you'll get 3 crappy ones and get pissed. Getting a good set of armor with the perfect stats could take you years - I am not joking. Next game that I buy with such mechanics inside it will be a straight refund.

7) Nerfs. Every year or so, Bethesda decides to break something willingly. In the name of balance, or in layman's terms, whatever the kids on reddit are crying about. I will not get into everything which was nerfed to the ground, like melee and now explosive. Combined with what I've said in the earlier phrase at no.6, after gambling for a long time to get your desired legendary, when you see it nerfed into oblivion you'll be one angry customer.

8) Now we go into the dark side. Which is stricly related to the gambling mechanics on gear and broken balance in the game since day 1. The dark side is the black market, the illegal trading of items for real money. Regardless of any speculation Bethesda is in on it too, it is real and it's breaking the game. Hacked items, duped items, things that were never supposed to be in the game are available to buy and use. Hell, there are even legit items for sale. Say you need a full set of armor and you're looking for certain attributes on it. Will you spend years trying to get it yourself, and by that time probably the thing is obsolete anyway, or will you be tempted to buy it online ? 

9) PVP. Many veterans of the fallout franchise are not avid PVP-ers, so I suppose this was implemented for getting the attention of other types of players to the game. It's something they've been toying with since day 1 and failed in all possible manners. From game modes that got scrapped, like Survival (free for all PvP) and Nuclear Winter (battle royale), to forced PvP in certain areas of the map. Also PvP is plagued by black market items, without a proper set of armor, weapons and consumables any regular player has absolutely no chance of making it.

10) PVE. For a new player there is enough to do to keep you busy for a good amount of time. It's not as bad as it was 4 years ago, but the content is limited to some degree. The real problem is what the future looks like, new content is becoming less and less exciting. What do I mean by that? Well, the first world boss was flying. The second world boss was walking. Now the third world boss isn't even moving. See where I'm getting at ? Wastelanders brought NPCs to the game and it was a major and a good change, then the Brotherhood of Steel arrived but it was way less content there, next we had the Pitt which is a glorified dungeon and now they're bringing a very over simplified version of Nuka World from Fallout 4 into 76. And they'll keep doing that, put up the minimum amount of work into features as long as the subscriptions keep rolling in.

Here comes the pros now:

1) You can shoot super mutants with a MG-42 machine gun while you're chugging down Nuka-cola Quantums and flying in your power armor like you're Aluminium Man. Basically you can go do whatever the hell you want as long as it puts a smile on your face.

Conclusion:

Take it with a grain of salt. This is Fallout 4 multiplayer with pretty colors. And a ton of bugs. What Todd Howard said in an interview a while back sums it up pretty good: ""We sold 12 million copies of Fallout 4 and now we can't reach those players anymore"". And by that he meant reaching their wallets. They've tried with Creation Club, but anyone in their right mind would get free mods instead. 76 is the answer, it's where they can put up a shop and slap a subscription fee to a beloved franchise. Everything is done so you'll spend more time in-game and buy buy buy and then buy some more. That's why there is no mod support, even if they promised it a long time ago. That's why there are artificial problems created in-game, like the limits on stash size and the durability of items, so they can sell you the solutions. Of course you're not forced to buy them, but every year they tease you with the benefits of having a subscription and give you little doses of quality of life for free in the shop. Just like a dealer they try to hook you up and then milk you dry. So be careful, buy it on discount and use it at your own risk. Go through the story, because now there is one, have some fun, but don't make the mistake of getting too attached to it and have great expectations. You'll only be hurt in the long run.",3200 hour e tell new plan 76 universe thought evolved 4 year today choosing write probably bethesda delete criticism unlike official discord retired official forum moderator erase post resembles else praise game mostly negative con pro 1 communication base exists long base criticize feature designed bethesda 2 year testing change live server disastrous consequence public test available fan bug live server feedback mostly ignored bethesda yeah hear thing anyway 2 patch russian roulette break minor thing entirely couple hour day depending severity patch mess 3 development atrociously slow took 2 year bring npc half bring bos questline 2 year bring expedition pitt new content polished feel copy older fallout interested lately bare minimum adding new content ago roadmap postpone anymore 4 overpriced shop subscription fee optional missing important quality life feature shop item rotating available create fear missing putting pressure go special offer limited regardless subscription cool stuff available bundle bought real 16x time detail definitely 16x time cost careful 5 new battlepass three month called season season daily weekly challenge force login everyday cool reward cool reward last battlepass middle good stuff finish season considered new content cosmetic adding actual item wan na grind crazy afterwards login daily finish battlepass designed player paying subscription actual content released 6 looter shooter endgame good gear unfortunately major twist welcome casino 76 roll everyday limited course stats gear legendary gear maximum 3 attribute good chest piece rolled dice 1 good attribute 2 crappy one next roll good attribute roll 3 chance 3 crappy one pissed good set armor perfect stats year joking next mechanic inside straight refund 7 nerfs bethesda decides break willingly name balance layman term whatever kid reddit cry nerfed ground melee explosive combined earlier phrase 6 gambling long desired legendary nerfed oblivion angry customer 8 dark side stricly related gambling mechanic gear broken balance 1 dark side black market illegal trading item real regardless speculation bethesda real breaking hacked item duped item thing supposed available hell legit item sale set armor certain attribute spend year trying probably obsolete anyway tempted online 9 pvp veteran fallout franchise avid pvp er suppose implemented attention type player toying 1 failed possible manner mode scrapped survival pvp nuclear winter battle royale forced pvp certain area map pvp plagued black market item proper set armor weapon consumables regular chance 10 pve new busy good bad 4 year ago content limited degree real problem future look new content exciting world bos flying world bos walking third world bos moving wastelanders brought npc major good brotherhood steel arrived content next pitt glorified dungeon bringing simplified version nuka world fallout 4 76 minimum feature long subscription rolling come pro 1 shoot super mutant mg 42 machine gun chugging nuka cola quantum flying power armor aluminium man basically whatever hell long put smile face conclusion grain salt fallout 4 multiplayer pretty color ton bug todd howard interview sum pretty good sold 12 million copy fallout 4 reach player anymore meant reaching wallet tried creation club mind mod 76 answer shop slap subscription fee beloved franchise spend support promised long ago artificial problem created limit stash size durability item solution course forced tease benefit subscription dos quality life shop dealer hook milk dry careful discount risk fun mistake attached great expectation hurt long,0,0.7845
1151340,Fallout 76,"I have more than 2400 hours in this game and I have five characters, level 500, to 200, so this won't be noob rant. EVERYTHING about this game is designed to exasperate and extort $ from the players. The stash (workshop) limit is ridiculous, and it FORCES players to 'opt' for Fallout 1st, in order not to run out of space. The armors, weapons, and apparel are a nice touch, but the idea of three different currencies (caps, atoms, and gold bullion) is asinine at best. The 'events' are repetitive and uninspired, the 'special weekends' make one want to question why there are limits to caps and gold bullion trading - when you should and will be able to use the money in your pocket any time you wish - but not in Bethesda games. Resource hog as always for Bethesda, doesn't play well with 4K displays and optimized for shit, because my system can handle 3D CAD yet cannot give me a frame rate over 60 fps, but sometimes as low as 15-20 fps, for no good reason. Overall, this is a major waste of time and disappointment, to say nothing of the issues it raises with trolling and griefing (google that stuff), PvP that is meant to be uneven and humiliating, and 'legacy' weapons too powerful for even their own users. Perks earned the hard way in Nuclear Winter were lost after Bethesda 'decided' to phase out Nuclear Winter. This is pay to play, whether you consider getting gear/skins/content from the Atomic Shop, Fallout 1st, or try your luck at the gray market which is still booming, even if a lot of weapons became obsolete literally overnight. Take a hard pass at this game and consider yourself warned!

Edit: Season 4 thus far is a complete bust, with the game no longer loading past the log-in screen and I'm receiving error messages such as 'Failed Backend' or 'Servers Undergoing Maintenance'. This is apparently a 'known issue' and Bethesda's 'troubleshooting page' makes suggestions that are completely off topic - a game that worked yesterday now won't load. Again, this isn't a new thing, Reddit and Twitter are full of pages where the issue is described but neither solved nor does anyone from Bethesda take ownership to make solid suggestions toward a solution. Folks - this is the result of releasing 'working titles' that are anything but working.

Folks keep wondering why I play this game - it is because of friends I've purchased this game and it is because I'm hanging out with friends that I still play it. That doesn't take away from the terrible quality of the game. If you think FO76 sucked before, you should try completing this season's scoreboard. It is positively senseless and repetitive beyond belief. Seems like Bethesda has decided to rid themselves of the explosive legacy weapons (at least in the PTS). I am bewildered because most changes they made have been for the worse. Seems like they want to bury this game, but I'm not sure why as they've made bank on this game. I originally purchased this game from Bethesda for $86 and I gave up playing it once before. If not for my friends, I would have long ago rid myself of this game. Do yourself a favor and either get FO4 or if you haven't already, get New Vegas and see how different the Obsidian engine is from Bethesda's.

1151340,Fallout 76,"Let's get this out of the way first. Is this game better now?       Yes.

Everyone knows the history of this game, it released buggy, boring and left a bad taste in everyone's mouth.
Did they fix it?     Yes.

How did they fix it? What's good?
- The Wastelanders update (free) essentially replaced the entire original Main Questline from the games' original launch. It added countless new armor, weapons, clothing, C.A.M.P items, new areas, new creatures, new features, and most importantly Quests with compelling NPCs and a storyline that didn't have you chasing ghosts. Dialogue that hearkens back to the Fallout games predating 4's controversial dialogue system. With replayability and choices that actually effect the main story.
-The Brotherhood was reintroduced, its' lore was explained in a believable way that was obviously thought out and they tried their best to work with the existing lore to make it happen. While it may be controversial to some Lore aficionados, it's nice seeing a fan favorite faction worked within a new title rather than having to skip out on them due to lore reasons. It also adds new quests, NPCs, weapons, events, allies and your own personal miniature vaults called 'Shelters'.
-Tons of quality of life improvements and fixes with stability that even improve over Fallout 4.
-Seasonal events, A Seasonal ScoreBoard that mimics that of a Battle Pass to unlock free stuff, Daily Ops, Daily Events, Challenges to earn Atoms for free, and Public Teams that give you exp bonuses along with other buffs.
-Nuclear Winter, the Battle Royale mode that you can go into with friends (or alone) rank up, win exclusive armor and C.A.M.P items for the Adventure mode and any exp carries over to your character in the Adventure mode.
-One of the most creative and friendliest online communities I've ever seen.
-The atomic shop, while not for everyone, is completely optional, never feels like its forced on you, and all of its contents are MOSTLY cosmetic and usually are all pretty damn cool stuff.
 
While on the topic of the Atomic Shop I want to clarify a few things;
There are items that benefit you in game that you can purchase, I'll explain the existing ones in question.

-Scrap Kits; These kits allow you to break down your junk into its' raw materials on the spot. Without this Scrap Kit you can just as easily teleport to your camp (which is free) and break them all down at your own workbench (which is free). So really, it's only saving you a few seconds that you could normally do for free anyways.

-Repair Kits; These kits allow you to repair a broken piece of armor or weapon, or you can repair them yourself and most objects have relatively low costs to repair that might only take you one trip to a random building to find the needed materials anyways.

-Scavenger Protectron; The Scavenger Protectron is a robot that walks around your camp collecting and finding junk. While this can also be seen as pay to win, he doesn't gather much. And usually only finds a handful of things that are commonly found in that area. You can just as easily take over any workshop in the game (for free) and have one of them generating you junk that generates way more junk over time and at a much faster rate.

-Lunchboxes; These usually give a small buff that is randomized and sometimes aren't even buffs at all and are purely just for fun. Opening one may have a random effect for one hour where all enemies explode into confetti for one hour, or one may make it to where you can jump higher for an hour. Though I think there is one that gives you 5% extra exp for one hour, but you can lay down in a bed for 15 seconds and get an extra 25% exp for an hour in the game (for free) anyways. 

-Fridge; The fridge does what you would think it does, it preserves your food for longer. But with food and drink no longer being a complete necessity in the game (meaning you no longer take negative side effects from being hungry or thirsty, only small buffs when you do eat or drink) it's an optional item for a now optional mechanic.

Fallout 1st Subscription: This Subscription costs $13 a month. It gives you a free set of Clothing (cosmetic only), discounts on the Atomic Shop, and $13 worth of Atoms. You also get the Survival Tent; this tent allows you to drop it where you please on the map and creates a free fast travel waypoint. The Scrapbox, probably the most controversial item of them all, which allows you to have UNLIMITED storage for your junk items, it also breaks them down to their raw components for you. And the Private World option, which essentially loads you into a server where only you and any invited friends can play. You DO NOT have ANY options to mess with, you can not change anything about this server.
 

So to summarize the Pay to Win items, most are completely optional for optional mechanics and are mostly just time savers. EXCEPT the Scrapbox and Survival tent, but to be honest... for $13 a month I feel as though you at least deserve something of substantial value. I'd say Fallout 1st is only for those who play this game a lot and want to save some time.

And some minor things that I've noticed that I think are nice about the game:
-Great Soundtrack
-One of the best maps I've seen in a Betheseda Game, second to Oblivions'.
-Great Voice Acting
-A LOT of free content that you never seem to be short of things to do.
-C.A.M.P system is fun for builders and seems to keep getting improved on.
-Newly added lore is interesting, in my opinion.
-It is now a more true feeling Fallout game than 4 is in my honest opinion.
-A lot of returning things and mentions of lore from previous games like New Vegas, and Fallout 1, 2 and 3.

NOW the Negatives: (Some are just my opinion)

-Usual Bethesda bugs, though usually not game breaking and won't disrupt your experience, just goofy.
-Survival Mode was removed instead of finished, making Nuclear Winter the only true way to experience PVP in the game. 
-While there are tons of new armors and weapons, there are more reused assets from Fallout 4 than I'd like, but it was developed alongside Fallout 4 so I guess that's to be expected.
-Atomic Shop prices are still far too much.
-You are able to start the Wastelanders quest line at level 1, but after you've finished a handful of quests you are locked out of continuing until level 20. While leveling up to level 20 is not hard and will come quicker than you think, it is really annoying to not be able to continue just when the story is picking up speed and getting interesting.


All in all, I'll end it with this.
Is Fallout 76 worth your time? It depends. Did you like Fallout 4's gameplay? Do you want more Fallout lore? Do you want to play a new game with your friend? If you answered yes to all 3 of those then Yes, play this, especially with a friend.

But, if you are one of those Fallout fans who thinks that Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 were the best games in the series and that Bethesda is ruining the franchise and you want a TRUE single player RPG and don't want to be around anyone... then No. Don't get this, you won't enjoy the changes made to some of the lore, you won't enjoy being around people and it'll probably only fuel your hate for Bethesda more.

1151340,Fallout 76,"I came into this with low expectations but it's a fairly priced game and The Pitt expansion was included in the price so that seemed like value enough to finally make the plunge. Maybe it was my low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved the first 50 levels of game play! I played solo the entire first 50 levels and didn't regret it in the least. I have played every Fallout game in the franchise, including Fallout Shelter AND Fallout Shelter Online (which I do not recommend). I've logged thousands of hours in this franchise, so I'm fairly invested in the series and an admitted fanboy even before Fallout 3. 

I don't want to steer you from playing this game, it really is a genuine entry in the Fallout world. Exploring Appalachia is as rewarding as exploring any other place in Fallout's America. And the card system, while not perfect, isn't as bad as it first seems. There's a lot of interesting dynamics and you can change out your cards on the fly. You aren't locked into any build, though you will need to lock yourself in if you want to expand your Legendary cards early on. That's the trade off between choosing to keep your card pool diverse and choosing to exchange your sideboard for points in order to level your Legendary cards. It's give and take and I enjoy that. 

I'm a big time CCG player (as well as Blackjack and Poker) so it's appealing to me, even if I prefer the more traditional Fallout SPECIAL, perks, and skills system. Bethesda found an interesting and dynamic way to integrate everything into one system. Kudos for following through on that, but I'd prefer that future Fallout games stick to a more traditional leveling system. Having to open my perk card menu and change out my DPS cards for Lockpicking and Hacking cards every time I come across a terminal or safe and then reopen the perk card menu to change back to my DPS build, while not the worst thing to be forced to do, is still a totally unnecessary task. 

Once I got past level 50 I got into a daily challenge routine and started farming the nuke sites for my stable flux, which is the logical progression in the end game; but, it's also a long, long, long grind and you end up just doing the same stuff over and over, hour on end with little to no nuance. How many times do I need to kill this Queen Scorchbeast before I have all the plans and the perfect items set? Obviously well over 1,000 hours, considering I'm already around 300+ hours in and the people farming alongside of me are level 1,000, even 2,000+. 

Once I matured past the level 110 mark the game's tedious daily quests, ops, and especially The Pitt expeditions wore me out. I'm just not a fan of The Pitt, which seems like a completely lost opportunity to draw in new players and old Fallout veterans who have waited until now to finally play Fallout 76. 

What really gets me is how linear The Pitt is. There's no map, no sandbox exploration; it requires multiple daily quests to fuel a vertibird to entry, not once but every single time you want to play the expansion; the difficulty makes it a grind to solo, but if you want to enjoy it for the first time playing with a group, everyone wants to steam roll it and you're left behind and lose out on that first essential enjoyment of the atmosphere. 

I ended up soloing it with a stealth rifle/shotgun/explosives build, but it took me FOREVER and it was not very fun constantly kiting and retreating. I enjoy stealth kiting gameplay, otherwise I wouldn't choose that play style, but not when that's all you're doing in a tedious and linear expedition. 

So neither group play, nor solo play of The Pitt is inspiring gameplay. I just don't understand why The Pitt wasn't like the original Fallout 3 expansion with it's own map and nonlinear sandbox to leisurely explore. 

I do plan to come back and play Fallout 76 again, but I'm just burnt to a crisp and dreading the hours long, passionless daily grind. I realized the only reason I was playing was for some meaningless costume reward for killing things with an auto-axe -- even though I'm a stealth sniper. Why do I have to be meleeing trogs to get this reward? I don't want to be forced into a play style I don't prefer just to get a reward. I don't want to kill things with a melee weapon and I especially don't want to have to do it in the Pitt. 

When I realized I was playing content I didn't enjoy in a play style I didn't prefer for a reward I didn't really even need, and I was required to do this every day for two weeks in a row, I made the decision to stop playing. That was my breaking point.",low expectation fairly priced pitt expansion included price value finally plunge maybe low expectation pleasantly surprised loved 50 level solo entire 50 level regret fallout franchise including fallout shelter fallout shelter online recommend logged thousand hour franchise fairly invested series admitted fanboy fallout 3 steer genuine entry fallout world exploring appalachia rewarding exploring fallout america card perfect bad interesting dynamic card fly locked build lock expand legendary card early trade choosing card pool diverse choosing exchange sideboard point order legendary card enjoy big ccg blackjack poker appealing prefer traditional fallout special perk skill bethesda found interesting dynamic integrate kudos following prefer future fallout game stick traditional leveling open perk card menu dp card lockpicking hacking card across terminal safe reopen perk card menu dp build worst forced totally unnecessary task past 50 daily challenge routine started farming nuke site stable flux logical progression long long long grind stuff nuance time kill queen scorchbeast plan perfect item set obviously 1 000 hour considering already 300 hour farming alongside 1 000 2 000 matured past 110 mark tedious daily quest ops especially pitt expedition wore fan pitt completely lost opportunity draw new player old fallout veteran waited finally fallout 76 get linear pitt map sandbox exploration requires multiple daily quest fuel vertibird entry single expansion difficulty make grind solo enjoy group want roll left lose essential enjoyment atmosphere ended soloing stealth rifle shotgun explosive build took forever fun constantly kiting retreating enjoy stealth kiting otherwise choose style tedious linear expedition neither group solo pitt inspiring understand pitt original fallout 3 expansion map nonlinear sandbox leisurely explore plan fallout 76 burnt crisp dreading hour long passionless daily grind realized meaningless costume reward killing thing auto axe stealth sniper meleeing trogs reward forced style prefer reward kill thing melee weapon especially pitt realized content enjoy style prefer reward required week row decision breaking,1,0.9896
1151340,Fallout 76,"Fallout 76 is a game of contradictions, which at once improves upon the series formula in ways while also fumbling some of the elements you'd expect out of any Fallout game. It's difficult to definitively say: hey, if you liked FO3, NV, or 4 that you'll certainly like 76. It's just too different in the ways you'd expect a game in this series to play, but that also doesn't mean there isn't a lot of fun to be had.

Let me just go over why I've dumped 100+ hours into it across Steam and Xbox. And this is without knowing how the game was at launch or pre-Wastelanders.

1. The world is, legitimately, one of the best designed in the series. That is: the map is so outrageously huge (4x larger than FO4, according to Bethesda) and yet it also never really feels empty. FO76's Appalachia feels expansive, diverse, and always seems to find new ways to surprise. If you have a few hours to spare, you can be in a toxic desert one moment, abandoned farmlands in another, a crumbling Charleston the next, and then you're off into the hills where you'll encounter raider camps and an untouched golf resort. For as much as I love NV, there is just way more interesting things here to stumble upon, along with some amazing vistas that had me smashing the screenshot button. I'd go so far as to say this is perhaps my favorite FO map so of the 4 3D entries.

The downside here is that the Wastelanders patch is what introduced NPCs. Before that, there wasn't as much emphasis on character stories like that. So if you want to head into a town and find it overflowing with NPCs, you won't get that here. Appalachia is not alive with NPCs in the same way the other games were. It worked for me on a certain level, though, since the idea is that you're ""reclaiming"" a part of America that had mostly died off during the war. People lived after the bombs fell, or attempted to live, and then either moved on or died. If you enjoyed piecing together environmental storytelling in previous games, there's a ton here. As far as NPCs, though, you won't find many outside a few specific spots.

2. The main storyline is actually pretty good. I enjoy with a game attempts to give players as much agency as possible. NV did this perfectly. FO4 forced you to play a parent who is searching for their son, which I disliked a lot. FO76 allows you a lot more wiggle room to approach the main storyline as you see fit. You never feel pressured to take a certain side or behave a certain way. You can be cruel all the way through, or as benevolent as the Wasteland allows.

The downside: there is not a whole lot of reactivity in FO76. Outside of a handful of moments, there aren't many times in the quests themselves that provide you the kind of freedoms any other Fallout title usually allows. I simply haven't run into any moments in the story where consequences were a thing. This hurts the experience, but the game still allows you to express yourself in other ways in the open world. Because of how open the game is, I rarely felt like I was being railroaded into doing anything.

3. The multiplayer. Now, all the faults in this game can ultimately be traced back to the multiplayer and how it was implemented. Was it worth the sacrifice? Maybe, this once. I can't deny that I've been having a blast running around Appalachia with friends, looting places empty, taking on waves of enemies, tacking events and bosses. Plus, there's the interactions with the community who are, by and large, very kind. The game allows you to create your own custom settlement and basically, at will, drop it wherever there's room. Some of the players, predictably, have gone all-in on this feature and have built some amazing spaces out there in the Wasteland that are a joy to visit. Plus, reaching a certain point in the game allows players to nuke areas of their choice, so you'll often see mushroom clouds rising up in the hills, followed by a concussive boom from almost anywhere in the map.

The downside is that you're playing a game that's historically been singleplayer and now it's always online. This means VATS does not stop time, there is no ""waiting"" feature, bobbleheads and magazines provide temporary buffs, stealing is no longer punished unless it's on a player's workshop, and the AI is abnormally dumb to accommodate an online environment. Plus, there's a player economy that needs to be balanced, which can interfere with certain builds being viable or certain things being salable. And, of course, when the servers go down for maintenance, you cannot play the game.

4. Random positives: * Inon Zur's soundtrack is amazing, perhaps the best he's done in the series. * There really aren't that many instanced areas, which means you can travel and explore and loot for hours without hitting a loading screen. * Some of the quests, even if you're not really talking to NPCs, are some of the best in the series. * There's a lot of fun stuff hidden in all the game's text, sometimes hinting at loot or secret areas (as is tradition).

All this to say: I think if you're a fan of specific elements of the Fallout formula, Fallout 76 may potentially blow you away with the sheer amount of stuff that it has going on, the amount of places to explore, the stories to stumble across. Whether it's fulfilling a dead photographer's dream of touring Appalachia, exploring a family's failed underground fallout shelter, or piecing together the slow collapse of a group of survivors who attempted to set up medical outposts throughout the region. Even if you never want to touch the multiplayer, there's a lot of fun to be had.",fallout 76 contradiction improves series formula way fumbling element expect fallout difficult definitively hey liked fo3 nv 4 certainly 76 different way expect series fun dumped 100 hour across xbox knowing launch pre wastelanders 1 world legitimately best designed series map outrageously huge 4x larger fo4 according bethesda feel empty fo76 appalachia feel expansive diverse new way surprise hour spare toxic desert moment abandoned farmland crumbling charleston next hill encounter raider camp untouched golf resort love nv interesting thing stumble along amazing vista smashing screenshot button far perhaps favorite fo map 4 3d entry downside wastelanders patch introduced npc emphasis story head town overflowing npc appalachia alive npc game worked certain idea reclaiming america mostly died war lived bomb fell attempted live moved died enjoyed piecing environmental storytelling previous game ton far npc outside specific spot 2 storyline pretty good enjoy attempt player agency possible nv perfectly fo4 forced parent searching son disliked fo76 allows wiggle room approach storyline fit pressured certain side behave certain cruel benevolent wasteland allows downside reactivity fo76 outside handful moment time quest provide kind freedom fallout title usually allows simply moment consequence hurt allows express way open world open rarely railroaded 3 multiplayer fault ultimately traced multiplayer implemented worth sacrifice maybe deny blast running appalachia friend looting place empty taking wave enemy tacking event boss plus interaction community large kind allows create custom settlement basically drop wherever room player predictably built amazing space wasteland joy visit plus reaching certain allows player nuke area choice mushroom cloud rising hill followed concussive boom anywhere map downside historically singleplayer online mean vat waiting bobbleheads magazine provide temporary buff stealing longer punished unless workshop ai abnormally dumb accommodate online environment plus economy need balanced interfere certain build viable certain thing salable course server maintenance 4 random positive inon zur soundtrack amazing perhaps best series instanced area mean travel explore loot hour hitting loading screen quest talking npc best series fun stuff hidden text hinting loot secret area tradition fan specific element fallout formula fallout 76 potentially blow sheer stuff place explore story stumble across fulfilling dead photographer dream touring appalachia exploring family failed underground fallout shelter piecing slow collapse group survivor attempted set medical outpost throughout region touch multiplayer fun,0,0.9939

1151340,Fallout 76,"I bought this game in December 2020, as someone who absolutely loves Fallout 3 and 4. Here is what I have to say about it.

When I bought this game (about 6 months ago), there were a few major issues I had:
- The game was as optimized as a potato, and no matter how beefy your machine was it ran like garbage
- It's fun solo, but even more fun with friends. Not many other people were playing at the time.
- Content was somewhat lacking.

Now, in June 2021:
- I don't know what they did, but it runs similarly to Fallout 4 now, much much better.
- It's still cool solo (quests feel similar to Fallout 4), and with more of my friends to play with, it's a blast.
- They've added the Brotherhood of Steel, and have fleshed out the map more.

The takeaway? This game isn't a blockbuster, world shattering experience. It feels like Fallout 4, but with new lore, stories, and multiplayer. It's tons of fun and has what I would estimate to be 100s of hours worth of playability.

Combat is fun and engaging, the lore is good (and there's a lot of it), most of the environments are pretty interesting, and blasting ghouls with friends is satisfying.

If you're on the fence about buying it, I'd spend about as much on this as I would on a good movie ticket (~$10). Definitely recommended, but not at full price (it's good, not great). If you do end up getting it, I'm always looking for teammates.",bought december 2020 someone love fallout 3 4 bought 6 month ago major issue optimized potato matter beefy machine ran garbage fun solo fun friend content somewhat lacking june 2021 run similarly fallout 4 cool solo quest similar fallout 4 friend blast brotherhood steel fleshed map takeaway blockbuster world shattering feel fallout 4 new lore story multiplayer ton fun estimate 100 hour worth playability combat fun engaging lore good environment pretty interesting blasting ghoul friend satisfying fence buying spend good movie ticket 10 definitely recommended price good great teammate,3,0.996
1151340,Fallout 76,"I've been playing this game since launch, and between the PS4/5, Steam, and the original Bethesda Launcher on PC, I have probably at minimum, a few thousand hours in this game. I'm not going to talk much about the game mechanics, or really anything that probably matters, but I do want to tell my story.

This game, had a rough launch. Thats putting it lightly. After the rough launch, there were some growing pains. Some bugs, some glitches, few that were so bad they rendered the game unplayable. But I saw something in this game, even through all of that. 

Then a few months passed, and it got better. Then a few more months passed, and it got a lot better in some areas, and a little bit worse in others. Then a year passed, and by this time, most of the core issues players had with the game had been addressed. Bugs were less game breaking, and more just humorous and charming. 

Then another year passed, and the first update to make significant changes to the gameplay happened. Wastelanders. This was the first real indication that this game was shaping up to be something more. We got NPCs, new factions, new questlines, new events. It was great to say the least. I'm underselling it, because this was the point where most players who had walked away at launch had returned, and this is where I made a decision. From that moment forward, I made it my mission to do my part to make the game a welcoming place for everyone. I made an entire Discord server around assisting new players and acting as a resource for new and seasoned players alike. I began reaching out with my group and recruiting as many new players as I could to try to keep this game alive, and a positive and fun place to spend time. I refused to be the reason anyone had a negative experience in this game. 

Some more time passed, and someone very close to me that I played this game with day in, and day out, passed away. I couldn't play it anymore after that. Something was always missing any time I would try to load the game up. 

A few months went by, and I still couldn't pick it back up. Any time I would try, I'd find myself staring at my friends list at a name that would never come online again, and then close the game. 

Finally, after about a year of being away, I started playing again, and I dusted off my Discord servers permanent invite, and started getting back out there, this time in overdrive. New players, old players, I didn't care. I wanted to try my best to make a dent in this community for the better. Every day I still look at my friends list in game, at a name that will never come back online, and it hurts every time, and that just makes me try even harder. 

I have made so many friends in this game over the years, some of them growing to be the people closest to me in my life today. 

I am an extreme minority in the Fallout Community saying what Im about to say. I think that with all this games flaws, and a rollercoaster of a history, in the end, Bethesda hit the nail on the head with this game. This is the gaming experience I've been looking for, since I first loaded up Fallout 1. 

If you are thinking about getting this game and are on the fence, I recommend it entirely with no strings attached. 

If you already own this game, do your part. Be the reason people want to keep playing this game, and the reason people want to buy it in the first place.",launch ps4 5 original bethesda launcher pc probably minimum thousand hour talk mechanic probably matter tell rough launch thats putting lightly rough launch growing pain bug glitch bad rendered unplayable saw month passed month passed area bit worse others passed core issue player addressed bug breaking humorous charming passed significant change happened wastelanders real indication shaping npc new faction new questlines new event great underselling player walked launch returned decision moment forward mission welcoming entire discord assisting new player acting resource new seasoned player alike began reaching group recruiting new player alive positive fun spend refused negative passed someone close passed anymore missing load month pick staring friend name online close finally started dusted discord server permanent invite started overdrive new player old player care wanted best dent community look friend name online hurt make harder friend year growing closest life today extreme minority fallout community saying im game flaw rollercoaster history bethesda nail head gaming loaded fallout 1 fence recommend entirely string attached already,0,0.9738

1151340,Fallout 76,"[h1]Uhh.. Where do we start[/h1]

I wish i could say this game is for everyone. Unfortunately, it is not.
I'm at the age where you have very few friends to play with, and you can RARELY even hop on to play with because everyone has schedules and busy lives.
If you want to play solo you'll gonna have a bad time, you'll always pretty much be outpowered, and die dozen times within a single quest.

Don't get me wrong, i am not very good at this game even after getting some play time in it. But, that's the point, shouldn't it be more for everyone?

I mean, if you want to throw extra money you can feed into Bethesda's absolute disgusting and embarassing greed and purchase all kinds of stuff that will grant you everything you'd need.
Otherwise, you'll grind, grind, grind, and that's most of the stuff that's going on. 

It's frustratring because i am struggling to love this game, but ultimately Bethesda doesn't want or care if players are satisfied and happy with their purchase, as with every other corpo, they don't do things in a human fashion, they're robots.

I'll still play it for a bit but i can't say i like it. And if you're wondering why, one of the reasons is that i hate stopping things right in the middle.
I wish i could say that maybe it will get better, but... dude, this is the corporation that threatened another dev into changing the title of his game because it contained the word ""Prey"" and it would ""infringe"" their shitty trademark (Imagine not being able to use a random word found in the dictionary in an entire title made of multiple words). They're money hungry assholes, maybe on the same level as Rockstar even.

But enough ranting. Let's talk about the other parts.

For better or worse, the game is very deep and complex in terms of gameplay. I wish it was more simplified but even after 70-ish hours i still can't wrap my head around many things, i may be a bit slow, or maybe they just had absolutely zero direction when they worked on it. 
Either way, you're in for a ride, that's for sure.  
90% of the time i have to spend walking around (Over-encumbered) because of the small backpack limits, even after upgrading it, trying to find junk to loot so i can be able to craft enough ammo, fix stuff like weapons and armor and only 10% actual gameplay of shooting and doing quests.  

In a way, Bethesda managed to launch a boomer game but targeted at younger people that can afford pouring hundreds and hundreds of hours daily.

I wish Steam allowed us to post neutral reviews. 
This game deserves a (way-too-generous) 5 out of 10.

[b]Stuff i enjoyed:[/b]
- Weapon selection with some very cool stuff, such as a guitar sword, a mini nuke launcher, even alien guns. Gun design and models are great.
- The atmosphere is very immersive. Everything feels like its radiating with depression (pun intended), on this matter, this game does it perfectly.
- You can build your own C.A.M.P and build your house the way you want it, you can place decorations and such, design the rooms/walls. It's one of my favourite aspects of the game
- The player base is pretty cool and they often would like to help you. I only found very few griefers so far.
- The variety the world brings. There's so much diversity in the view, from absolute hell-ish wastelands to grungey parts of the city to beautiful floral landscapes, with many things in between.
- World events are pretty cool, and i really recommend you to participate in them when there are others there

[b]Stuff i didn't enjoy:[/b]
- Very big problems that existed for years and were never addressed, such as freezing in the loading/start menu, becoming stuck between props in the world and not being able to get out. For example, i just got stuck few minutes ago between some props when giong down from a building. I cannot fast travel because the inventory is full (of course), all i can do is leave the world, which means good bye to my claimed workshop...
- So much stuff is locked behind a paywall
- Totally not worth it for solo casual players, but if you have friends/time to play with them, it can be pretty good
- Fast travel costs bottle caps, which are pretty hard to find, and it usually costs a lot
- Speaking of fast travel, you can't fast travel if you have too many things in your inventory, which, you'll most likely have.
- 15-ish years later, Bethesda still hasn't learned how to do an inventory system, with enough slots to piss people off less, with proper organization and sorting
- Nightmare level up system in the beginning, i already wasted most of my energy on the leveling up and getting stuff because i couldn't do quests properly (Hint: I still can't..)

This game keeps teasing me, but ultimately fails to deliver and make me feel any sort of satisfaction. It's just a grind that never ends. By the time i will have enough stuff to be comfortable going around doing quests and just killing stuff, my wish to keep playign it will be gone.
Maybe they want to make players feel absolutely miserable for immersion purposes.

Bottom line: If you're young and have time and friends to play with at any time, you will have a blast, if you're a solo player, not so much. This game keeps leaving you wanting for more but it just doesn't happen. As a solo player, 90% is grind, 10% actual gameplay. There's little to no point playing this game alone. MMORPG or not, it doesn't matter.
Mediocre in a very grotesque and morbid way

Edit to add some further:
I'm now above level 100, it just doesn't get much better. It's only addictive, but not the enjoyable kind.
I spent like 8 hours making my house/camp as best as i could, next game, i got an error my camp couldn't be moved, i have a blueprint of my entire house saved and there's absolutely no place i can build it because it's apparently, somehow, bigger than the building area. I googled and it's one of the many problems that existed for years. But good job, Bethesda, milk people for money and don't fix any of the bugs.

1151340,Fallout 76,"I bought the game as soon as it came out on Steam, but I didn’t dare to play seeing negative reviews on YouTube, etc., I didn’t want to spoil my good impressions of the Fallout series. After some time in May 2021, I still launched the game and started playing. And you know, I really liked the game. I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe at the time of release the game was terrible, but in the 21st year a lot of things were fixed.

In the game, everything is very easy, if in other similar games you have to grind for years to achieve top gear, etc. But in Fallout 76, in a couple of months, you can achieve all the heights, so to speak. For me, this game is like a rest, after work I go to relax, play a little.

Separately, you can highlight the community of this game, I have never seen better anywhere. Any question will always be answered and helpful. Even in the game itself, many help beginners.

Of course, the game has its problems, but in general, at the moment the game is very good. If you are a lazy person like me, then this game is definitely for you. The game does not force you to sit and grind in the game 24 hours a day, unlike many similar games.

It would be possible to write about the pros and cons for a very long time, but some a positive side for someone can be a negative side and vice versa, therefore I recommend trying it yourself.",bought soon dare seeing negative review youtube spoil good impression fallout series 2021 launched started liked pleasantly surprised maybe release terrible 21st thing fixed easy similar game grind year achieve top gear fallout 76 couple month achieve height speak rest relax separately highlight community anywhere question answered helpful help beginner course problem general moment good lazy definitely force sit grind 24 hour unlike similar game possible write pro con long positive side someone negative side vice versa recommend trying,3,0.9666
1151340,Fallout 76,"For Context: I'm a huge fan of the Fallout franchise, with hundreds of hours in 3 & 4, and almost as much in New Vegas... I played 76 to completion of the Wastelanders main quest / level 50+, and as much as I wanted to like it, I just can't recommend it... Play 4 instead!

The Good: Where 76 really (nuka)shines is providing more of the same that made 4 such a success: A *huge* overworld map, chock-full of ugly-beautiful post-apocalyptic landscapes, which you can freely explore without loading screens... Bizarre and formidable cryptozoological monstrosities... Legendary weapons for the finding... Base-building with more parts than you could ever hope for (and this time, other people can actually SEE your constructions)... And since the Wastelanders update, quirky NPC's who breathe life and story into this space, giving you purpose and direction. On top of all of that familiar Bethesda retro-futuristic sci-fi RPG goodness, the online aspect of 76 offers the ability to team up with other survivors to take on foes that would have been waaay to much to solo.

The way you level up your character (SPECIAL) has been overhauled, too. Instead of allocating skill points and perks every time you level up, your skill points now equate to *capacity* for each skill, and you pick from a pool of perks up to that capacity. Best of all, you can change them at will. This eases the concept of playing as a particular ""build"" and gives you a lot of flex in how you apply those traits.

The online aspect itself isn't inherently problematic, either. I love that I can spend hours building a cool base (and I do), but now other players can actually see the result, and player-owned vending machines actually make that a pretty common occurence... All the junk you collect (well, mostly specific junk) that you don't need can be sold to other players for Caps.

The Bad: First of all -- Holy currencies, batman. It's a page right out of the micro-transaction mobile-app playbook. There's still Caps for most things you'll need like in-game vendors (though now mundane actions like Fast Travel will cost you Caps too). But now, there's also Atoms (which can be bought with real money for mostly-but-not-only aesthetic items). Then there's Gold Bullion, for late-game equips and plans. You can trade in another form of currency, Treasury Notes, for Gold Bullion, but only up to a certain daily max (this is why you play videogames, right? Math?). Then there's Legendary Scrips, you get those for grinding up your unwanted legendary equips. There's also AmmoPoints, because why would you dare think you could just sell your unused ammo to an in-game vendor, when there could be another inane currency that only exists to push you toward ponying up your real money to avoid the inconvenience of not having enough of the ammo you actually need? In a shooter game!!! And that's not even all, but I'm already sick of listing them.

Looking past the currency, there's the glitches. Technical difficulties can and will happen, and Bethesda has a special track history in this regard, but this is... not that. Instead of humorous physics freakouts, or one-out-of-a-hundred quests that just can't be finished, you get frequent server disconnects. You get unresponsive inputs when you finish crafting -- You have to log out and back in again, almost every time you craft something. You get half of the spoken dialogue not showing up in the subtitles (this one's nitpicky for most, but not for the hard of hearing). The glitches in this one aren't fun or funny.

It's a big game, in a big franchise, and I'm leaving out a lot, both good and bad... But everything I really liked about 76 was there in 4, and very little that I disliked about 76 was there in 4. I guess the biggest difference is just the finite nature of a single-player game... Once you've done everything in 4, you're done. 76 kinda keeps growing, but... mostly in superficial ways, meant to push you toward buying Atoms / subscription plans. Maybe skip it, and hope FO5 is everything we hoped 76 would have been.",context huge fan fallout franchise hundred hour 3 4 new vega 76 completion wastelanders 50 wanted recommend 4 good 76 nuka shine providing 4 success huge overworld map chock ugly beautiful post apocalyptic landscape freely explore loading screen bizarre formidable cryptozoological monstrosity legendary weapon finding base building part hope construction wastelanders quirky breathe life space giving purpose direction top familiar bethesda retro futuristic sci fi goodness online aspect 76 offer survivor foe waaay solo special overhauled allocating skill point perk skill point equate capacity skill pick pool perk capacity best eas concept particular build give flex apply trait online aspect inherently problematic love spend hour building cool base player result owned vending machine pretty common occurence junk collect mostly specific junk sold player cap bad holy currency batman page micro transaction mobile app playbook cap thing vendor mundane action fast travel cost cap atom bought real mostly aesthetic item gold bullion late equips plan trade form currency treasury note gold bullion certain daily max videogames math legendary scrip grinding unwanted legendary equips ammopoints dare unused ammo vendor inane currency exists push ponying real avoid inconvenience ammo shooter already sick listing past currency glitch technical difficulty happen bethesda special track history regard humorous physic freakouts hundred quest finished frequent disconnect unresponsive input finish crafting log craft half spoken dialogue showing subtitle nitpicky hard hearing glitch fun funny big big franchise leaving good bad liked 76 4 disliked 76 4 guess biggest difference finite nature single 4 76 kinda keep growing mostly superficial way meant push buying atom subscription plan maybe skip hope fo5 hoped 76,0,0.9863
582660,Black Desert,"So...

5000 hours played, and just got my Pen blackstar. What's not to recommend?

Here's the thing. This game is a beautiful exercise in game design. Virtually everything, from the economy through to the relative silver rates for crafting, grinding, and everything except hunting, is mathematically-balanced to a genius level degree. The world, quests, and classes have an amazing degree of depth.

The reason I don't recommend? The exploitation of your psychology is also perfectly designed. From the first time you get ganked and swear to yourself 'I'll get my revenge once I gear up', through to the constant shower of micro-rewards; need to login 24/7; gambling-based enhancement; and exponential sunk-cost, this is a game designed to exploit your every weakness to take out your credit card.

It's not a bad experience subjectively; a lab rat will always look forward to it's next morsel as it runs through the maze. But it is a ruthless exemplar of how to manipulate players. A bit like I'd say drugs are probably fun but I wouldn't recommend them, I think the same applies to this game. And much like drugs, you'll probably do better if you don't try them in the first place.",5000 hour pen blackstar recommend beautiful exercise design virtually economy relative silver rate crafting grinding except hunting mathematically balanced genius degree world quest class amazing degree depth recommend exploitation psychology perfectly designed ganked swear revenge gear constant shower micro reward login 24 7 gambling based enhancement exponential sunk cost designed exploit weakness credit card bad subjectively lab rat look forward next morsel run maze ruthless exemplar manipulate player bit drug probably fun recommend applies drug probably,1,0.9565
582660,Black Desert,"So, where to even begin. I guess the most important thing here is that this is certainly not the MMO for everybody. This MMO manages to pack in something for every kind of player out there, but that actually doesn't mean it will appeal to everyone. 

First of all, I'll cover the topic of the pricepoint, since in the very most lenient sense here, it's ""variable"". 

It's $10 to get into the game. No monthly fees, nothing. That's pretty handy. The price point is at least low enough that for most people, even if they don't like the game, they won't have lost out on much. Now, chances are, the price point is that low because THERE ARE MICROTRANSACTIONS, IF YOU WANT THEM. I'm putting this at the beginning of the review because I know that this will either immediately deter people, or encourage them to hear me out on this. The best way I saw these described was as ""conveniences"". You can get items that rival the cash shop items, but it will take time, and it will take effort. But, there is nothing to stop someone from simply getting a headstart on the game by dropping a little extra money on the game. Is that bad? Well, at a $10 initial price point, I don't think so, because almost all of the cash shop items are convenience items, i.e. streamlining workers, getting a nicer boat without investing time into it, getting gear to speed up fishing initially, etc. The game counteracts this by allowing a lot of things to be completed AFK, such as fishing, or even autolooping a running path to level up your stamina (seriously, you can just have your character run infinitely between two points and get levels out of it, I can't make this up). Need to level your mount? Check the ""auto feed"" option, stock up on carrots, set an autoloop, and go sleep or do productive things while your character travels between points A and B and your horse learns new skills. So honestly, the cash shop items are certainly a thing which most people would look down on, but I haven't even seen the need for them. That said, I could have higher tolerance for grinding (see my Maplestory hours, let's not talk about it).

Now, on the topic of grinding, this IS a korean MMO, and it's gonna involve a lot of grinding. The AFK system is honestly a god-send, I'm telling you. However, the combat is very dynamic and frankly the best I've ever seen in an MMO (it does seem very similar to TERA, but definitely more rewarding and satisfying). For skills grinding, a fair amount of it can be done while tabbed out, so the grindy feeling there is alleviated to a fair extent. 

As far as skills versus combat, this game does a very good job of letting you choose your own playstyle. Want to make it to the second town and then level all the way to 55+ and make millions by fishing? Sure, go ahead. Want to immediately start a farm and create a monopoly on food goods in the player marketplace? That works too. Set up trade routes between nodes and make all your money and experience through buying low and selling high, it doesn't matter, you get rewarded with level exp for so many things in this game, you can choose how you want to play the game. You can even treat it almost as a single-player game with the Black Spirit quest line, so play how you want to. And hey, if you're still into the kill-quest style MMO, that's all here for you too, and you won't even have to touch the other skills. It's relieving to play an MMO that lets you decide how you want to play it. 

Something I have not been a part of yet is the guild system, which entails warring over territories or capturing areas to claim tax to pay guild members and such. I don't know too much about this, but from what I've viewed, it seems incredible to wage all-out-war with other guilds for essentially control over money. The PvP seems to be a big part of this game, and I'm hoping to make it to that end-game experience soon. And yes, before you ask, these wars DO entail forts, cannons, armies, etc, which just seems super awesome. Other guilds though seem to take the game casually, and only want a community to play with, so that's diversified as well.

Now for the more technical stuff. The graphics are gorgeous, the combat is fluid and feels OH SO GOOD, and the AFK feature is even enhanced by an option to minimize the game to the tray. The chat is very spammy with system notifications when you first join the game, but the settings menus help with all that and it should take you just a couple trial-and-errors to figure out what you do want to see broadcast and what you don't want to see. The quest handling is nice and will even autopath you to destinations, and despite minor environmental hookups (I got stuck on a staircase once) it's a very reliable system and can streamline the early game.

Now, so after all of this, why can't I recommend it to everyone? I mean, I'm giving it a thumbs up, am I not? Well, it's because there is very little explained to you in this game, and that's probably because if they did, you wouldn't ever end the tutorial. The game has so much complexity to it that you're going to want to have YouTube open, whatever databases or guides you can find, a friend on skype, really anything to help you understand a new part of the game you've decided to dabble in. For some, that's incredibly daunting and I can't say everyone would enjoy the game based on this aspect. And this isn't me saying ""GO BACK TO YOUR BABY MMOS YA BABIES"" I mean seriously, this game is a lot to take in and I'm surprised even I can handle it. While I believe you can take the game in any way you like, you still might get curious one day and find a whole new aspect to the game that doesn't suit your fancy, or it's just so horrifically complicated at first that you aren't going to understand it until your 15th fail stack. Now personally, I don't mind having to research an aspect of a game, and I even personally have a journal where I jot down notes for all sorts of games I play (I'm a huge nerd, I know this). But some people want to hop in and just play to end-game, which is okay. Having to find and research your way to the end-game isn't always fun, and I understand that. 

So with all of that said, my final verdict is this: if any of this sounded appealing to you, give it a shot. Given that it casts it's net very wide, you can probably find something you'd enjoy in this game. But, be prepared to do some research, as some of the time you're just going to be confused, no matter how much experience you have with MMOs or in-game economies. If the mention of a cash shop that DOES benefit players deterred you entirely, then, ah well, that's fair, and I'd even encourage you to look elsewhere. Despite it being solely convenience items, I can't dispute the fact that they do exactly that. And finally, if all of this sounded appealing to you, I almost plead with you to play this, as I ended up finding the MMO I was looking for, and I hope you do to.

Thanks!

Edit: Wow! Thanks for all the reception everybody. Glad to see this review is helping people. After discussing the game with a prospective buyer, I realized I totally forgot to mention that the Black Desert Online site DOES ALLOW A 7-DAY TRIAL. Please note, the account used for that trial and the account used in Steam CANNOT BE LINKED, but this is a way for you to try the game and see if you like it! If the $10 or the cash shop is concerning, give the trial a chance and see, and then decide what medium you would want to purchase it on. I'd recommend using the trial and then coming to steam to start anew and know what direction you want to pursue, but please keep this in mind!

582660,Black Desert,"LOOK AT MY HOURS PLAYED. I waited 15 months to write a review. I've pretty much done it all. I'm running around at softcap with pretty much all content acquired. This game IS damn amazing. Today, 24th of August 2018, they made the game truly pay to win. I'm not talking ""added a ghillie suit to the cash shop"" or anything like that, I mean full-blown swipe your credit card to become stronger than anyone who put effort into the game or is skilled at pvp. If you as a gamer, value skill and talent over who has richer parents than for the love of god stay away. There is so much more fun to be had elsewhere. This game is officially dead with this change. I urge all players to leave a negative review to alert people who may fall for this scam-game.

The devs went back on their promise that they would not make NA P2W. Not only should you stay away from Black Desert Online, but you should try not to forget the developers; ""Pearl Abyss"" and the Publisher ""Kakao Games"" as we certainly will see them again in the future to further scam their playerbase once again.

582660,Black Desert,"You need to understand three things about this game.
1.) The game is gorgeous, but, it's a glorified interactive casino. Everything in this game is RNG dependant. 
2.) Like all forms of gambling, this game is extremely addicting. At first it may not be apparent, but, if you're running a beefy PC your electric bill will inform you that this game is consuming your life. 
3.) Like all forms of gambling, this game has the potential to be extremely expensive or extremely cheap while providing the same level of ""fun.""  The ""Pay to Win"" aspect of this game solely exists in the form of convenience. It is 100% impossible for you to spend $100,000 an expect to be the best geared player in the game. That said, it is 100% POSSIBLE for you to spend $100,000 and feel like you still need to spend more. 

So let's talk about that Cost for a second...

The game is designed to make it seem as though you need to spend, roughly $150 in order to have enough pets (for auto-looting), carry weight, and inventory space. However, if you're not a ""hard core"" player the 4 pets you get from questing and the additional 1 pet (5 total) you eventually get from your log-in bonus are more than adequate to keep up with most people's grind habits. The additional inventory slots you get from questing are also more than adequate for most people. Additionally, as a new player you receive several free Value Packs.

The Value Pack acts as a $15/month subscription service. However, if you focus your first month of the game on learning and gearing up you will easily find yourself having an income high enough to purchase a new value pack every month with in-game currency. In the event that you are a little slower on the uptake, you could join any guild that offers 5m silver / day daily pay and push all of that money into a city storage you don't often visit. Then, at the end of the month, you will find that your guild has effectively paid for your value pack. 

TLDR: If you are not a Hard Core player then the purchase price of the game is the only money you will ever *need* to spend. 

But what if you are a hard core player? Well, then, your entry fee is closer to the ball park of $150~250 depending on your Luck with obtaining Tier 4 pets, which is a gambling process involving purchasing multiple of the same type of pet and combining them for a chance at increasing their Tier. You're also going to want as many character slots as you can so that you 1) camp every boss site, 2) have a daily/weekly life skill character at each major resource hotspot, and 3) increase your family fame fund (daily silver awarded to you at log-in). As a Hard Core player you're also going to keep your Silver focused on obtaining stronger / better gear so you'll have a recurring payment of $15/mo ($45/90-day) Value Pack *and* an additional $25/mo for Blessing of Kamasylve (increases drop rate). The Kamasylve cost is mitigated by events where they give 7~15 day kamas out like candy so you can think of this in annual terms at about $150/year. As a Hard Core player you also will want to, later on, protect your TET and PEN enhancements using Cron stones. If you're lucky enough to be in a siege or node warring guild you might already have enough SILVER to buy Cron stones. However, only about 20% of players fall into this category. For everyone else there's Master Card. Reach into that wallet and spend roughly $68 on Costumes to extract Cron stones from *PER ATTEMPT.* Remember what we said about gambling? You can absolutely spend a million dollars here and never get any further. 

But Z!! This sounds an awful lot like Pay to Win!! 
True, depending on your definition of Pay to Win. But consider the following: if you're not a hard core player then you probably aren't ever going to bother with high level enhancing. This means if you decide to get stronger you're probably going to spend in-game currency. Mister Mastercard might spend  $10,000 on his first PEN item. You're going to spend about 17 billion silver on your first PEN. Most casual players at end game can rack in 400~800m/week which means you will see that PEN in about 28 weeks. Most Pay 2 Win type of people are not wealthy enough to drop $360/week into a video game. Do they exist? Sure, but, you have the same chance of meeting Clint Eastwood in Japan as you do of meeting one of those players. At this stage in the game, who is to say the person you run into isn't just someone who has played since launch?  Point is, it's not going to affect your experience on way or the other. 

So now let's get REALLY dramatic. Let's say money is no object for you and you want to be the best, of the best, of the best. Grinding is for peasants, you want to make all of your money and obtain all your gear without even leaving Velia. Bad news, bud. This isn't the game for you. The number of Pearl items you can sell is directly affected by the number of characters you have at level cap. If you only get 1 character to level 60 before you decide you're going to be a wallet warrior, you're only able to sell 10 Pearl Items / week. That means you are hard-capped at 3.35 billion silver / week on money. Your first PEN item is going to take you a minimum of 5 weeks to pay with cash BUT WAIT! There's more! As of writing this post there have only ever been 121 PEN Kzarka Blades sold on the central market place. Meaning, even if you have the silver you are still relying on the rest of the community to make the item.

Okay, so what? You'll just Master Card your way through the TET and PEN attempts. Well, we know of at least 1 player on the NA server who has, so far, failed 85 times in a row on safe TET attempts. But let's say you don't have the worst luck, let's say you have fairly average luck. You are going to attempt about 8 times for TET and about 20 times for PEN. If all of these are going to be safe attempts that's $1,360 for your PEN after you spend $240 on your TET. For simplicity sake let's call it $1,500 per PEN.. this will see you at $10,500 for PEN Armor and Weapons. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!

Accessories will always downgrade on fail when using crons, or break without crons. Let's be generous and say you have average luck, you're using crons, it's all pay 2 win, and we'll call it a conservative $2,000 per PEN accessory. That's an added $6,000

In short, the cost of outright pay 2 win in this game is a paltry $16,000 for the gear BUT DON'T STOP THERE!  Did you think having full PEN would make you formidable in the game? HA! You still need your Dream Horse.  Let's be generous with that too and tack on another $2,000. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!! You need a Frigate! And your Frigate has to be the best of the best of the best.  Let's call it $1,000 per piece of gear to hit +10 (frigate equivelant of PEN) and ignore the cost of actually buying blue gear. So there's another $4,000. So now we're at $21,000 to pay to win the game.

BUT WAIT!! Did you think having a fully decked out frigate was going to make you the strongest master of the sea? WRONG!! Because the free to play pleb has a Carrack. You need to get yourself a Galleus or a Carrack to keep up the pace. Can't let yourself be sunk by some guy that maybe spent $100 on the game. You're a Wallet Warrior, you fall to nobody! So you swipe your card.....  only to find that every single item required to make that ship can only be obtained through Bartering. A long process that requires your physical labor. 

 Where does a full PEN level 60 Wallet Warrior fit in? Bad news, guy. You have to grind. Because unless you are level 62+ you aren't scary even with full PEN. The cost to make you a God amongst players your same level without lifting a finger? $10~20,000 USD. The cost to make you useful in a siege or node war? Priceless. 

TLDR:
It is possible to ""pay 2 win"" this game. But it is inconceivably expensive to do so, would take a minimum of 65 weeks, and the margin between you and the Non-P2W player after 65 weeks will be negligible.",understand three thing 1 gorgeous glorified interactive casino rng dependant 2 form gambling extremely addicting apparent running beefy pc electric bill inform consuming life 3 form gambling potential extremely expensive extremely cheap providing fun pay win aspect solely exists form convenience 100 impossible spend 100 000 expect best geared 100 possible spend 100 000 spend talk cost designed spend roughly 150 order pet auto looting carry weight inventory space hard core 4 pet questing additional 1 pet 5 total eventually log bonus adequate grind habit additional inventory slot questing adequate additionally new receive value pack value pack act 15 subscription service focus learning gearing easily income high purchase new value pack currency event slower uptake join guild offer 5m silver daily pay push city storage visit guild effectively paid value pack hard core purchase price spend hard core entry fee closer ball park 150 250 depending luck obtaining tier 4 pet gambling process involving purchasing multiple type pet combining chance increasing tier slot 1 camp bos site 2 daily weekly life skill major resource hotspot 3 increase family fame fund daily silver awarded log hard core silver focused obtaining stronger gear recurring payment 15 mo 45 90 value pack additional 25 mo blessing kamasylve increase drop rate kamasylve cost mitigated event 7 15 kama candy annual term 150 hard core protect tet pen enhancement cron stone lucky siege node warring guild already silver cron stone 20 player fall category else master card reach wallet spend roughly 68 costume extract cron stone per attempt remember gambling spend million dollar z sound awful pay win true depending definition pay win consider following hard core probably bother high enhancing mean decide stronger probably spend currency mister mastercard spend 10 000 pen spend 17 billion silver pen casual player rack 400 800m week mean pen 28 week pay 2 win type wealthy drop 360 week video exist chance meeting clint eastwood japan meeting player stage someone launch affect dramatic object best best best grinding peasant obtain gear leaving velia bad news bud number pearl item directly affected number character cap 1 60 decide wallet warrior able 10 pearl item week mean hard capped 3 35 billion silver week pen minimum 5 week pay cash wait writing post 121 pen kzarka blade sold central market meaning silver relying rest community okay master card tet pen attempt 1 na far failed 85 time row safe tet attempt worst luck fairly average luck attempt 8 time tet 20 time pen safe attempt 1 360 pen spend 240 tet simplicity sake call 1 500 per pen 10 500 pen armor weapon wait accessory downgrade fail crons break crons generous average luck crons pay 2 win call conservative 2 000 per pen accessory 6 000 short cost outright pay 2 win paltry 16 000 gear pen formidable ha dream horse generous tack 2 000 wait frigate frigate best best best call 1 000 per piece gear 10 frigate equivelant pen ignore cost buying blue gear 4 000 21 000 pay win wait fully decked frigate strongest master sea wrong pleb carrack galleus carrack pace sunk guy maybe spent 100 wallet warrior fall swipe card single required ship obtained bartering long process requires physical labor pen 60 wallet warrior fit bad news guy grind unless 62 scary pen cost god amongst player lifting finger 10 20 000 usd cost useful siege node war priceless possible pay 2 win inconceivably expensive minimum 65 week margin non p2w 65 week negligible,0,0.9988
582660,Black Desert,"I have now 5.660,5 hours on this account besides this I have a Beta account that I played on when the game came out. Aka let me tell you about the game that will make you lose your mind in multiple ways.

If you like exploring, traveling, following a story, questing and lifeskilling you will be drawn to this game from the get go. Also you can drop all your idea's of your perfect E-Girl in the character design. 

When the game just came out it was mostly grinding for a long amount of hours. For a regular player it took around 20 to 40 hours of playtime to get to lvl 50. Now the game has turned into a fresh start friendly game where you get to lvl 50 in just 1 hour of grinding. The game also gives new players tons of stuff to help you to get further into the game. This is not just a MMORPG. It's a Korean MMORPG. This means you will have to grind a fuck ton to be able to do anything besides the things i listed above here. PVP wont be possible if you dont put any time into the game.

Now to the beautiful fail stack system. This is BS RNG based but keeps the game fun if you don't have a temper. The game can make you super frustrated but when you manage to reach your goal you will have a feeling of accomplishment. 

IF RNG IS NOT YOUR THING DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!

When you read this you probably see comments about that the game is Pay to Win. This is BS. The game gives you tons of free stuff and it's easy to get the stuff you want by playing without spending money. But here is a big BUTT. If you want to lvl faster and get more money out of the time that you are grinding spending IRL money on pets/outfits could be an option.

The game end game is 100% focused on PVP. There are sometimes PVE events tho. 

This game is for the people that have a feeling that they need something to put a lot of time in. This is the solution for you. You will meet tons of people that you can play with. There are some guilds where I met tons of awesome players that don't mind to help new players out at all.

582660,Black Desert,"Pros:

- The world is beautiful. Enemies are different from your regular MMO.
- The combat system is extremely complexed. You ""can"" hotbar buttons, however you're handicapping yourself if you don't press them in real actions like Up+F. It's much more fluid if you press action combinations for combos. What makes this the combat different than the others is move canceling. I didn't know this was in this game until I saw another player performing impossible moves.
- The grind actually feels good because you're performing attacks that are beyond that of rinse and repeat. You even feel like an absolute god.
- lots of jobs: crafting, fishing, tanning, etc. You can get lost in them for hours, and there's also a ranking system on it, which is weird but good if you like that kick back experience.


neutral:

- Gender lock, however some classes are just like the other such as Wizard and Witch or Musa and Maehwa.
- confusing minigames and small tutorial in the beginning that won't teach you anymore after the first 10 lvls.
- No fast travel, just your feet or your mount. The mount is an actual being too. Enemies can attack it seperately and kill it.

Cons:

- No endgame anything. Gears is by daily/weekly miniboss challenges in a particular location, which will take you 5-10 minutes on mount.
- No dungeon runs either. Match making isn't in this game. You want to party with people, you do it the old fashion way: by guild or shouting.
- RNG everything. However, this can be fixed with +luck gear. Luck will help increase particular chances but RNG rules most of everything whether farming, damage from particular anything, drops and stats on gear doing particular things.
- A turn-off to newcomers that don't like hard MMOs. The learning curve for this game is pretty high, but if you like a challenge it's rewarding. Those that like just pressing hotbar commands are the first to suffer after reaching lvl 50.
-A Majority of quests (if not life skills) are fetch and kill. Talk to NPC, go kill 30+ enemies, come back. This is what you call a Korean Grinder MMO.

Pay extra portion:

There are key things that make microtransactions somewhat enticing: Pets, value packs, extra inventory and weight limit expansion. Although you can play this game ""pay once"" like it was intended to be played, however these items make the game much easier PvE. As for PvP, there's nothing that can one up another player PvP other than better gear. Better gear is bought with silver and silver is power. In order to get this sort of silver, there are many ways, and what makes getting silver extremely easier are these items I've listed for microtransactions.

1) Pets w/a max of 4 can pick up items for you and carry on their own. This alleviates some of the stress of picking up items from mobs. Each pet is roughly $8 real money, but if you play the game long enough, 20 days gets you a free penguin (at least for the time being). At lower levels, pets aren't something you'll consider, however in higher levels while you're in a party you'll have that one player with pets, and that player will take everything that's dropped.

2) value packs: you can buy a 30 day value pack for $15, which is basically their version of subscription fee. This can be bought in auction houses with ingame currency, however it's quite hard to get one as it's the highest sought out item in the market and they only release 1-2 every 10-15 minutes. The value pack increase 100 weight limite, 16 inventory slots and 16 storage, and on top of that you get %30 back for auction house sales. What does that mean for sales? W/o it you're typically selling everything for roughtly 60%. That 300k stone sold will only give you back 180k unless you have the value pack in which you'll get back 210k. This actually adds up as you will be selling millions of items in the auction house and a majority of your income is by this.

3) inventory space. In-game there are quests that can increase your inventory space up to 30, or you can pay a premium and increase it even further to around 90, which a lot of life skillers do. If you want to carry a ton of different items, it's almost needed for you to carry so many things at once.

4) weight limit increase. You can grind to increase the strength of your character to carry heavier items, or you can have particular items that already increase your weight limit like the value pack or hercules gear that increase you 150+ weight. However, in higher levels there is gear that is far superior that you'll want to equip, so increasing your strength to carry is something that is either grinded or bought with microtransactions.

There are other items that I didn't list, but that's because they're a want vs need. These 4 that I've listed a borderline ""need"". All-in-all you can potentially play this game completely ""pay-once"" as it is intended whether being $6-10, but you will be extremely tempted to purchase one of the 4 items in order to make your life a bit easier in-game. One of the things you'll probably consider is the value pack as it is basically a subscription fee for WoW or FFXIV. Don't let that mentality of trading one MMO for another for its subscription fee sway your wallet. You should only buy this pack if you really do want to invest your time and real money into this game as BDO is multiple games in one. BDO with the core of a MMORPG has many elements that make it multiple games. These other games are called life skils.

1) Fishing: sure, you can fish in any mmo, but can you build a ship go to another island or in the middle of nowhere and fish there? With whatever you've caught you have options of cooking or finding a trader to buy your fish, which becomes an actual job that many players have come to enjoy called AFK fishing.

2) trade empire: I'm new to this concept but you can potentially connect areas through trade routes, process or build trade crates and have them shipped to another area to sell for a profit. You can have works around the world collect and bring back to your storage items in order to process or built crates to trade again making it a trade empire in which you can also haggle prices for these items in a different area.

3) Cooking/alchemy: the most effecient way to cook/alchemy and make money is by having contract NPC workers find resources, bring it back to your storage units in each town where you can make the necessary food or potions and then sell them on the market.

Again, the 4 microtransactions are borderline needs and they're more purpose for those that are serious about this game and for specific situations. Grinders: pets; traders/fishers: inventory space and weight limit; and alchemy/cooking: value pack. Although you can give your character all of them to make your character more well rounded, they're not much of a need as comparison to these particular key points. I hope this helps, and if you want to know more, leave a comment.

TL;DR

Is this game worth your time? Yes, because other mmos are really old and out of date. Top subscription IMO is FFXIV vs WoW. Top free to play mmo is Star Wars, however it's only up to lvl 50 free. Best pay once: this game followed by Guild wars 2 and then ESO.

What about p2w? It's significant. Since you're paying once, and if you played any mmo, you most likely put money into the game that was more than just subsciption or just the base of the game. If there's a game you really care about, you'd support it by buying something whether cosmetic or actually helpful. For the price they're asking for is pretty cheap. You have a choice whether or not to put more into it. If you get sucked into this game like I have, believe me, this is one game you won't regret. This game sets a standards of graphics and combat that newer mmos should have. I'd hate to have the next best mmo come with runescape graphics or Maple story 2-D feel.",pro world beautiful enemy different regular combat extremely complexed hotbar button handicapping press real action f fluid press action combination combo make combat different others move canceling saw performing impossible move grind feel good performing attack rinse repeat absolute god lot job crafting fishing tanning lost hour ranking weird good kick neutral gender lock class wizard witch musa maehwa confusing minigames small tutorial beginning teach anymore 10 lvls fast travel foot mount mount actual enemy attack seperately kill con endgame gear daily weekly miniboss challenge particular location 5 10 minute mount dungeon run party old fashion guild shouting rng fixed luck gear luck help increase particular chance rng rule farming damage particular drop stats gear particular thing turn newcomer hard mmos learning curve pretty high challenge rewarding pressing hotbar command suffer reaching lvl 50 majority quest life skill fetch kill talk kill 30 enemy call korean grinder pay extra portion key thing microtransactions somewhat enticing pet value pack extra inventory weight limit expansion pay intended item easier pve pvp pvp gear gear bought silver silver power order sort silver way make silver extremely easier item listed microtransactions 1 pet w max 4 pick item carry alleviates stress picking item mob pet roughly 8 real long 20 day get penguin lower level pet consider higher level party pet dropped 2 value pack 30 value pack 15 basically version subscription fee bought auction house ingame currency hard highest sought market release 1 2 10 15 minute value pack increase 100 weight limite 16 inventory slot 16 storage top 30 auction house sale sale w typically selling roughtly 60 300k stone sold 180k unless value pack 210k add selling million item auction house majority income 3 inventory space quest increase inventory space 30 pay premium increase 90 life skillers carry ton different item needed carry thing 4 weight limit increase grind increase strength carry heavier item particular item already increase weight limit value pack hercules gear increase 150 weight higher level gear far superior equip increasing strength carry grinded bought microtransactions item v 4 listed borderline potentially completely pay intended 6 10 extremely tempted purchase 4 item order life bit easier thing probably consider value pack basically subscription fee wow ffxiv mentality trading subscription fee sway wallet pack invest real bdo multiple game bdo core mmorpg element multiple game game called life skils 1 fishing fish build ship island middle nowhere fish whatever caught option cooking finding trader fish actual player enjoy called afk fishing 2 trade empire new concept potentially connect area trade route process build trade crate shipped profit work world collect bring storage item order process built crate trade trade empire haggle price item different 3 cooking alchemy effecient cook alchemy contract worker resource bring storage unit town necessary food potion market 4 microtransactions borderline need purpose serious specific situation grinder pet trader fisher inventory space weight limit alchemy cooking value pack rounded comparison particular key point hope help leave comment tl dr worth yes mmos old top subscription imo ffxiv v wow top star war lvl 50 best pay followed guild war 2 eso p2w significant paying subsciption base care support buying cosmetic helpful price asking pretty cheap choice sucked believe regret set standard graphic combat newer mmos hate next best runescape graphic maple 2,2,0.9933

The game is a korean grinder with a somewhat aggressive cash shop, so depends if you know your limits or not.

Game is not a theme park mmo, so as soon as you are done with the tutorial story you need to decide what you want to do, this is a problem for some since they need to be led about.

This game is a completely open world mmo so you can actually pick a direction and go there, you don't need to finish all the story to unlock different areas of the map, although you may get walloped :D
Following the black spirit quest line as a new player is the best idea, with a season character.

However there is an overwhelming amount of stuff to do and grind for, as the veterans always say BDO is a marathon not a sprint.

The main thing that first attracted me to BDO was the horse training which is surprisingly complicated, the horse animations and skills are very satisfying to use. The mounts also don't spawn out of your characters butt like in most games, when you dismount they are still there in the world, which I think is wonderfully immersive. 
There is also all the other usual lifeskills such as gathering, farming, cooking, alchemy, sailing, fishing, hunting, trading and bartering.

Gaming the economy is not really a thing in this game since max and min price of things is managed by the developers, there is also no player trading so don't expect it to be like EVE or ARCHEAGE in this respect.
BDO also has a pretty good housing system with lots of choices of house locations for convenience, roleplay or simple looks reasons and lots of choices when it comes to furniture items. 
Also there is no large inital cost or lack of housing, and no loss of said house/houses when you have a break from the game, everything is how you left it when you return.
Almost all the cash shop furniture can now be crafted for free now, which is amazing.

The action combat is first rate, I think of all the mmos I have played only TERA has better combat, BDO's mob grinding is better though. 
Which is just as well since grinding mobs is a huge part of the game and can be a decider as to whether you will like the game or not. (nothing like putting on some music and killing thousands of critters)

This game doesn't do dungeons like most mmos do, it has only 3 which are parts of the same dungeon.
Visually they are lovely but I think mechanically they are clunky and the reliance on having to use guides is a problem.
If you have played WOW, Final fantasy or Destiny 2 you will find these raids disappointing in comparison.

BDO has never been known for its story and it still isn't, some of the newest story content is fully voiced and is quite good, however unfortunately some of the earliest story/tutorial is a real slog.

Also the quality of life in this game is through the roof, every option you can think of for turning stuff off or on, or adjusting UI. 
Search bars for items/npcs and all items have a proper description and will have a auto path to the npc they need to go to, on a right click.
The autopathing is a pleasure, the knowledge system is great and contributes to your entire account. 
All of your alts have access to almost everything on your account; storage/mounts/pets, its just one big Family, which is very convenient.

Gearing is actually way easier than it was when I started playing in 2017; with the season servers, its almost obscene how much easier it is now, with benefits new and old players alike, a very good change. 
The upgrading of gear and the system of doing it are pretty complicated and much complained about but the season servers really do act as a great tutorial for how to works and if you'd prefer to just avoid it and just grind and buy what you want from the marketplace.

Cosmetics are some of the best and most detailed in any mmo however the best of them are in the cashshop, so be aware of that if it bothers you. 
The game is very cheap to buy or often free to try with no subscription requirement I don't think its a big deal, there is also ones you can get with a loyalty system/giveaways if you can be patient.
The dye system is extremely good and has many slots to achieve that specific look and is one of the main reasons its nice to have the optional subscription; The value pack.
If you are going to play the value pack is definitely worth having and has a lot of convenience. 
However the game has no required subscription, so you can just login whenever you feel like it.

The character creation is still one of the best in any mmo or even more modern games, which is kinda crazy and you can completely change your characters face or hair if you get sick of it, provided you have the value pack.

BDO is probably the best most complete open world/seamless mmo on the market, only New world looks better graphically.
The areas of the map look like they fit together naturally like they would in real life, some of the cities are actually modelled off real cities.

One thing I like is there is a distinct style as well, they don't try to do everything; horses are the primary mount, very little fast travel; so mounts are actually useful, and no true flying mounts either just gliding. 
The amount of crazy MMO stuff isn't outrageous either, no crazy mounts; flying cars/robots/giraffe monstrosities or ridiculous outfits like final fantasy/Tera. just some usual mmo suspects, battle lingerie being the main culprit, which i'm not opposed to ;)

582660,Black Desert,"Black Desert Online is a fantastic idea and world setting, the combat is immersive with a high skill cap, the character creation is the best of any game released to date, its enhancing system is horrid while still being extremely unique and what keeps people playing, and the game looks absolutely stunning with a welcoming community.

Black Desert Online's enhancing system is the games pinnacle as well as its downfall, while the enhancing system FEELS extremely rewarding when an enhancement succeeds you still end up losing millions on that enhancement. The games accessories break when an enhancement is failed unless cron stones are used (We'll cover these later) This means that if you have a boss gear accessory that is Tri(+18) and attempt to go to tet(+19) and your enhancement fails you've potentially lost BILLIONS of silver. The same applies to weapons but usually its just hundreds of millions not billions(Unless we're discussing a pen(+20) attempt) This will allow us to discuss the next topic. THE GRIND

Black Desert Online is an EXTREMELY grind heavy game. You will need to spend hundreds of hours playing to reach softcap(253ap(Damage) The grind is extremely tedious as there aren't a whole lot of decent grinding zones. You'll be stuck in the same spot or region for quite a significant time before being able to move on to another area when you meet its recommended AP. You will grind for silver to enhance your gear or to buy pearl shop items(We'll discuss these next) Which are REQUIRED(unless you want to spend more than 10 hours per day grinding mobs and making trips) to progress in the game with decent Silver per hour. You can lifeskill but it will be a large money sink as most lifeskills are extremely tedious and in-efficient without pearl items to assist you in success rate/swimming speed/breathing time/gathering speed/ and processing success rate. Which transitions us into our next topic, Pearl items

Pearl items are almost a must have if you plan on playing bdo seriously, this means investing losts of money into the game (about $200 for mob grinders and $400-$600 for lifeskillers) All these items are pay for convenience, Kakao makes its game unbearable without these pearl shop items. A must for all players is Pets, at least tier 2 for all of them(about $60-$80) Pets are absolutely necessary to your success in this game, they will loot items for you as well as give you boosts to certain xp values or knowledge gain chance. Lifeskillers, you're going to have to spend money on at least one pearl shop costume that are NOT able to be listed on the marketplace for silver. These costumes run about $22 USD and are essential for lifeskillers. This game is pay to win when it comes to maintaining a higher skill score. Outfit sets(cosmetic items that boost xp stats that are a pearl shop item BUT can be purchased from the marketplace using precious silver that could be going to enhancing) Can be melted down for CRON stones. Cron stones protect the enhancement level on an item from dropping on a failed enhancement chance or prevent an accessory from breaking on a failed enhancement. Which means, spending IRL money will save you potentially BILLIONS of silver that can be used to enhance other gear. Another ptw item from the item shop is Artisans memories. What these do is they make an item restore 4x their value on a repair. Meaning someone that spends money on these spends 4x less on repair materials for their boss gear which is extremely substantial. 

While Black Desert Online is a great online game for some, it is essentially having a second job and sinking every waking moment into this game if you have plans to progress, I can not recommend this game to the average gamer despite how much I enjoy it. The enhancing system is this games downfall and its rise, the pay to win is too much handle if you're a ftp player and Kakao is a greedy company out for that dough. If you like grind maybe this game is for you(I'm okay with the grind but find myself taking breaks lasting for a few months before picking the game up again).

582660,Black Desert,It's like a job except you don't get a paid,except paid,0,0.0
582660,Black Desert,"First thing is first, I am recommending this game but I caution you to make an informed decision with information listed below.

Black Desert Online is an MMORPG unlike its competitors, in that this MMO focuses almost entirely on PvP combat and due to this the entire combat system feels very unique.  Instead of quick-slotting abilities, BDO has a combo system where key combinations cast your abilities.  Learning your class is essential and will have many different learning curves and way of playing.  Rotating cooldown timers is an important part of it for sure, but it certainly makes the combat in this game feel better than other MMO titles.  For this reason I would say one of the main reasons I would pick this title over others is the combat.

Progression in this game is probably the most frustrating part of playing, and puts many people off.  Enhancing gear has a percentage chance to fail, which gets larger as the gear gets better.  If you fail an enhancement, the max durability of an item goes down and the only way to repair it is to get a base durability item and use it as a repair material.  This only gets more expensive when you acquire the best in slot equipment.  Additionally, once you get to the last 4 enhancement levels on a piece of gear each fail will revert the enhancement level back a step.  Players have come up with systems to increase the odds, but it is always a gamble.  Most players will choose to save their resources and buy gear rather than go through the tedious process of enhancing.  Failing higher level enhancements is extremely taxing to a player's finances.

Leveling in this game is a little quirky.  There is no hard level cap, but rather a soft cap where obtaining exp becomes so difficult that the next level is near impossible to reach.  As more players reach these higher levels the cap is raised and as such the gap between new players and old players increases.  The game managers have come up with clever events to try and close this gap and this works to varying extents.

Now let's talk about inactive progression.  This is the reason you will see so many players with thousands of hours on BDO.  This is due to inactive progression where the game will reward players for leaving their game running while they are away.  You can set the game to tab and do things such as auto-fishing.  Upon returning you can sell the fish and gain silver for time that you were sleeping, or working, whatever the case is.  Now look if you have the money for the electricity that's fine and all but not everybody does.  It is important to note that these inactive gains add up over time and can give you an edge over players who do not follow suit.

Guilds in this game are annoying.  The guild content is really nice don't get me wrong, but there is no way to trade items between players.  This isn't exclusive to guilds either.  Any items you have that you may even want to sell to your friend, you can't do so for a lower rate.  All player transactions go through an auction house, which means that there is always a chance the item gets snagged before your friends can buy from you.  I think the idea that guilds cannot share resources between members is a really dumb idea.  I understand why they do this, but it is quite a change from other MMOs.

That's a lot of meat and potatoes but here is my conclusion.  Black Desert Online has changed with time as many games do.  Back when I started playing the game in 2017 everything had a sense of wonder, and it was all uncharted territory.  Progression felt rewarding because once I was strong enough I could hold my own, or maybe even win open world PvP encounters.  This was the case for a while, but eventually the bar was raised, and winning fights was no longer an option for me.  The answer to this was grinding and pushing to have my gear enhanced but it just became a Skinner box of a video game.

582660,Black Desert,"Alright, so we're here: the Black Desert Online Steam page. Let me give you the lowdown on this $10 you're about to spend.It'll be worth it for maybe the first character you create and level up. The first 60 levels sort of fly by and you generally enjoy your time. Past that, you're in for one hell of a time.
This game is about as grindy as they come. It's great for those who want to spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours accomplishing mostly nothing. Your progress in this game is relative. There's always going to be someone more powerful, skilled, or otherwise better than you in some way or another. That being said, though, it won't really affect your gameplay much at all. 
Is the game fun? Idk, I guess. I've put so many hours in to it that I can't even tell if I'm enjoying it or not anymore. 
Graphics? Phenomenal. Absolutely beautiful. I sincerely cannot find a singular thing to complain about when it comes to how the game is designed. It's lovely. 
Controls? Most interesting combat system I've seen in an MMORPG to date. This game requires true skill and understanding of your class if you want to get anywhere in the PvP realm. 
Community? Equal parts helpful and toxic. It comes with its blessings and curses. Find yourself a guild that you mesh with and avoid drama like the plague. Don't make the mistake of falling in to anyone else's petty arguments, it will have consequences one way or another 

So, why don't I recommend this game to anyone? Mostly, because it's a waste of time. You experience gratification once every thousand years when you hit a TET or PEN. It's really just 50% PvP and 50% grind. It's not necessarily a problem, but it kind of sucks when you know that others are just dumping money in to services that do the grinding for you. If you had asked me if I liked the game when I got it, it would've been a resounding yes, but I can't recommend the endgame to anyone in good conscience.",alright black desert online page lowdown 10 spend worth maybe create 60 level sort fly generally enjoy past hell grindy great spend hundred hundred hour accomplishing mostly progress relative someone powerful skilled otherwise affect fun idk guess hour tell enjoying anymore graphic phenomenal beautiful sincerely singular complain come designed lovely control interesting combat mmorpg requires true skill understanding class anywhere pvp realm community equal part helpful toxic come blessing curse guild mesh avoid drama plague mistake falling else petty argument consequence recommend mostly waste gratification thousand year tet pen 50 pvp 50 grind necessarily problem kind suck others dumping service grinding asked liked resounding yes recommend endgame good conscience,1,0.9847

582660,Black Desert,"Note to considering buyers, the $10 price tag is false; you'll probably need to end up spending probably another $20 or so to feel like you're not being hindered in terms of bag space, weight, or auto loot speed. This game is an extremely long term game--there are no gear resets when new content drops. 

So if the idea of getting near to max gear in 2 weeks is what you need to have fun, then this game isn't for you. But the flip side of that though is this, the progression is always there. Concerning the length however, they did add seasonal servers which slingshot new players to a spot where they can actually start working towards end game gear. When this game first came out, you had to go Rags-to-Riches all by your lonesome, but now it's really not the case.

Concerning RNG, I've heard that they have made ways to get around it, but I personally haven't reached that point--but I have been getting some of said items needed to bypass the RNG.

Concerning P2W, it most definetly is possible BUT it is--in my opinion--a complete waste of money due to how inefficient it is. Though players most certainly can--and a small minority do--buy cash shop items and sell them for in-game money, you would probably need to spend no less than $10,000 USD to get anything close to end-game gear from 0. So yeah, whales can exist, but you likely won't encounter them and they make it so we don't need to pay a subscription to keep the servers running.

If you're looking for a game where you can AFK and make some money, love being able to play by yourself for high-end content, having the option for group PvP, and love complicated systems, this game is likely gonna be a good fit.

If the way you enjoy games is through dungeons and raiding, end-game content requiring groups, or systems that can be learned within a relatively short time span, this may not be the game for you.

582660,Black Desert,"Alright, so I've played many MMORPGS/online service games from time to time. Genshin Impact, GW2, Warframe, Destiny 2, Neverwinter, ESO, New World, so I got the general idea around them. And somewhere along the way I'll try to provide comparison to Black Desert Online (BDO) so you'll have an insight. Here we go.

[h1] The Good Things [/h1]
Nice graphics. BDO got a remaster not too long ago, and it turned out pretty good. Even by today's standards. The environments, equipments, character models, they are all good. They really have a good graphics design team. Up-to-date-graphics with little hardware cost. Good job devs, on that one. Some other games are a bit less optimized (New World, Bless Online, looking at you both).

Fantastic combat. I like an RPG game where the combat represents what I wanna do. When I wanna move left, the character moves left. When I wanna move right, the character moves right. I don't stand in one place and pretend we fight like we're having a family argument. Whether we like it or not, those old style combat (tab-targeting or whatever) are severely outdated and unrealistic. While BDO's combat is not. It's impactful, responsive, flashy, and configurable. I dunno about you, but BDO kinda represents how I would like to actually fight in a fantasy world more than most MMOs. And I can still pull it off with just 10 fingers, a mouse, and a keyboard. No need to band-aid with gamepad. Just as it should be for a proper PC game.

Animations inside & outside of combat are done well enough. Although, it still needs more proper running, climbing, and interaction movements. Kinda feels clunky but is it the engine? And why do you WALK backwards too in-combat? You're in a battleground, not in your house. Is it a feature or a deliberately mistreated animation? So weird. But overall, it's still better than other games like GW2 or Neverwinter.

BDO also has a (seemingly) generous & steady flow of event/minigames/quest/etc rewards that players can get for free. So much, that I become really confused which one to take in first.

I also like the whole node systems. It kinda puts a lot more feature than just fighting enemies. You can craft stuff, cook stuff, manufacture stuff, and sell them for profit. You can basically make a trading network out of it. And it can raise your non-combat skills too (BDO calls it life skill). So those are what I like about the game in a way that it's got both style and depth in features. It's a lot of fun, but it has boundaries.

[h1] The Bad Things [/h1]
Like I said, so many rewards. Which means you're gonna need inventory space & item knowledge. Before you take one item, you gotta know EXACTLY what you're gonna use it for, and the corresponding NPCs that may be involved. You can't just leave it in your bag or even storage cuz it's gonna take too much space. So if you're a hoarder kind, just hold on & keep playing the game until you have enough space for everything you want. It's not necessarily a bad thing. It's only bad because the game only tells you very little about inventory management stuffs. Is it deliberate? Do they intentionally obscure the facts to mislead people into buying inventory spaces at the premium currency market? Beats me.

The combat progression in this game contains a rather obstructive RNG, namely the enhancement system. It's a bit...I dunno how to call it. Cheap? Lazy? Discouraging? To compare, in ESO, you can craft stuffs and already get better. In Warframe, yes you get stuffs by RNG but once you get it you can power it up however you like. In BDO, getting endgame equipments alone contains RNG, and then they added even MORE RNG to enhance it. I'd be fine if it's just about failing and succeeding. But in BDO when you fail to enhance, it's gonna reduce your equipment's durability or even destroy them. It's not even lore-friendly, I mean the game has blacksmiths so why not use them to enhance anyways? As the players, I need to admit that we all seem to be really, REALLY untalented at enhancing. We are supposed to be fighters by nature, not blacksmiths, oh and we already paid to play your game so we deserve a little help and compensation. Hear that, devs? Maybe, change the system a bit so you can have even more players?

Also, this may not be significant but with all due respects devs I personally find your game trailers and the trailer music really miss the mark. You use them for advertisement, yes? If so, then please show us more about the game. All I've seen from the trailer is combat. That's it. I don't get the point. Okay, those people are fighting, but then so what? Where are we going from there? Is this game a Dynasty Warriors simulator? Do you want it to be a Dynasty Warriors simulator? If not, then please put more context into them. Try to communicate better with the players/potential customers. Look how New World went down (as per 2021) just because they have no idea how players filter out their games. You've been here longer. You should know.

Oh and the trailer music. I'm really sorry to say this, but they suuuuuuck like hell. Please, use better ones. Just take the in-game musics and pick the one that has the PROPER mood to each trailer. Every time I watch your trailers, BDO, I'm always turned off. Plus the whole trailer-concept-doesn't-have-clear-context-thing. If you want the game to be successful, you have to present them the right way.

[h1] Conclusion, or TL;DR [/h1]
So for you guys out there who wants to play BDO, I suggest to play just to have enough harmless fun but beyond that, I you wanna go further and become a semi-veteran player, you have to prepare to have lots of time due to the heavy grind and RNG nature of this game. It's not for everyone, and there are currently obvious better choices than this (ESO, FFXIV from what I've heard, Warframe, Destiny 2 if you can ignore the scummy content scrapping stuff). I would say BDO is 7/10. This is some of the games I really hope to get better in 2022. If done right, BDO can become larger than Warframe or New World. Whether it happens or not will be up to the players and the devs.",alright mmorpgs online service game genshin impact gw2 warframe destiny 2 neverwinter eso new world general idea along provide comparison black desert online bdo insight good thing nice graphic bdo remaster long ago turned pretty good today standard environment equipment model good good graphic design graphic hardware cost good game bit optimized new world bless online fantastic combat combat represents wan na wan na move left move left wan na move move stand pretend fight family argument old style combat tab targeting whatever severely outdated unrealistic bdo combat impactful responsive flashy configurable dunno bdo kinda represents fight fantasy world mmos pull 10 finger mouse keyboard band aid gamepad proper pc animation inside outside combat need proper running climbing interaction movement kinda feel clunky engine walk backwards combat battleground house deliberately mistreated animation weird game gw2 neverwinter bdo seemingly generous steady flow event minigames reward player confused node system kinda put fighting enemy craft stuff cook stuff manufacture stuff profit basically trading network raise non combat skill bdo call life skill style depth feature fun boundary bad thing reward mean gon na inventory space knowledge ta exactly gon na corresponding npc involved leave bag storage cuz gon na space hoarder kind hold space necessarily bad bad tell inventory management stuff deliberate intentionally obscure fact mislead buying inventory space premium currency market beat combat progression contains rather obstructive rng namely enhancement bit dunno call cheap lazy discouraging compare eso craft stuff already warframe yes stuff rng power bdo endgame equipment alone contains rng rng enhance fine failing succeeding bdo fail enhance gon na reduce equipment durability destroy lore friendly blacksmith enhance anyways player admit untalented enhancing supposed fighter nature blacksmith oh already paid deserve help compensation hear maybe bit player significant due respect personally trailer trailer music miss mark advertisement yes please trailer combat okay fighting dynasty warrior simulator dynasty warrior simulator please context communicate player potential customer look new world per 2021 idea player filter game longer oh trailer music sorry suuuuuuck hell please one music pick proper mood trailer watch trailer bdo turned plus trailer concept clear context successful present conclusion tl dr guy want bdo suggest harmless fun wan na semi veteran prepare lot due heavy grind rng nature currently obvious choice eso ffxiv heard warframe destiny 2 ignore scummy content scrapping stuff bdo 7 10 game hope 2022 bdo larger warframe new world happens player,1,0.9553

582660,Black Desert,"I have over 3000 hours in this game since early beta and while it is one of my favourite MMO's it has major issues that unless fixed  ruin the game.

- This Game Monetises EVERYTHING it is extremly P2W don't believe the people who play who justify it as a company needing to make money.
- P2W Components= As Examples.
- You need Pets to loot for you and keep up your grind pace.
- You use up a limited amount of contribution to expand your worker network and storage meaning CASH SHOP to increase without contribution. This means you can have more workers, more nodes without the encumbarance on your contribution amount.
- Enhancing Gear lowers durability you will want to use Cash Shop Artisan Memories to repair when your durability goes down due to enhancement failures. This reduces your repair costs by 4x and with Boss gear we are talking millions - billions in repair costs.
- Easy mode to get TET gear; Buy Costumes on the Cash Shop and burn them for Cron Stones to ensure enhancement failures don't de-rank your gear.
- Costumes, Pet Costumes, EXP Scrolls, Inventory Scrolls, Weight Limit Increases. There is no limit to the amount of money you can spend in this game for improvements that are so vast it is P2W. Ex. Increase your weight you can grind longer, fish longer, without having to go back and forth. Silver in this game = power the more efficient you are the more power you have access to. People will say this is pay for convenience but when we are talking about  4 - 100x more efficiency I think you can realize for yourself that you won't ever keep up with players for free.
- This game is expensive and you will always find yourself in need of something from the cash shop.

Enhancing in this game sucks and you have to enhance pretty much everything so be ready to deal with failures and RNG expenses, spend hours faming materials and building fail stacks so you can eventually succeed.

582660,Black Desert,"I have nearly 7k hours in BDO.  I don't recommend this game at the moment.

The cash shop is a complete money grab. Don't buy this game thinking you'll reach end game off $5 or even $50.  You're looking at a solid $200+ to be competitive in a decent amount of time.  Anyone who says otherwise is lying to you.  The game skirts P2W by creating massive annoyances, such as limiting weight and inventory space, to the point where players have huge incentive to fix the issues through the cash shop.  Even swimming is made slow in an effort to push a $20+ swimming outift.

The game is an endless grind, gated by RNG.  You might spend a month getting 5 billion silver only to blow it all in one night on Tungrad earrings and end up empty handed, with that entire month's work completely gone.  It can be incredibly demoralizing, and there isn't a viable way around it.

The developers are currently running around with the heads cutoff.  They introduced massive changes to the PvP system over three years after release.  These changes increased the gear gap, makign strong players even stronger.  However, they also managed to neuter many classes.  Remember how I said it takes nearly $200 to be viable? A lot of those cash items are tied to a character, not the account.  This means that if you want to play another class, you have to repurchase weight, inventory, and costumes.  It adds up extremely fast.  Therefore, you're at the mercy of Korean developers who don't even play the game, and who have shown that they can castrate a class on a moment's notice.  

 You can look at Steam Charts to see that the playerbase is slowly dying.  Even with a $5 sale, the game is losing more people than it's gaining.  Most high level PvPers like myself have abandoned the game because of the drastic changes to super armor, iframes, and crowd control.  What once was  fast paced game has slowed down considerably - most likely to pave the way for Xbox relase and/or compensate for their terrible, terrible netcode.

Be very wary of BDO.  It's essentially a giant scam to inconvience and annoy you into spending money.  The game currently is devoid of direction, with unneeded changes coming nearly weekly.

TL;DR:
Pros: 
-Looks great
-Fun for a few months

Cons:
-Predatory/manipulative gameplay
-Boring/repetitive
-Grind heavy
-Heavy focus on a broken and rng reliant system
-Extreme in game inflation that continues to rise at an absurd rate
-Empty promises from publisher
-Unstable servers
-Poorly optimized, don't be poor

Since 2018, I've poured close to 17k hours into BDO, half of which was active. I have a pretty good understanding of the game, probably better now that I haven't played in like a year. Like a previous top comment said, the game is designed in such a way to keep you playing, whether that's through a slew of AFKable activities, or through more conventional daily login or event based rewards. That alone isn't a red flag, many games offer the same incentives. But, the red flag is that the alternative puts you in a hole. In other words, if you're NOT logged in 24/7 (doing AFK activities when you're not actively playing), then you are going to fall far behind in whatever goal you set for yourself. Prices are so inflated in this game due to the ridiculous enhancement chances that if you don't AFK overnight, and login daily for rewards, and grind 3-4 hours a day (pve or lifeskilling), then a goal that would normally take a month, now takes 2 or 3 or more. 

That's the first problem, the fact that though these incentives to play are ""optional,"", they really aren't. Login at any time of day, on any server, and you will see hundreds of AFK players fishing or processing at a warehouse, before they leave for work in the morning, and before they go to sleep at night. Think about that for a second. The game incentivizes you to make it part of your day to day routine. That is NOT okay. Your first thought when you wake up shouldn't be ""I need to sell my fish and get back to fishing before I leave, I sure hope the Imperial Delivery isn't sold out."" I am not sure if the Oasis Chest event is still going on, but for nearly 2 years, to get the max daily rewards for that event, you'd need to be logged in for 6, yes you read that right, 6 hours. Every day, for nearly 2 years. 

The next problem the game has is it's shallow, boring, repetitive content. Sure, the first few months will be great, ""there are so many things to do, lifeskilling, grinding, pvp, decorating."" But once that honeymoon period is over, you realize just how agonizingly boring the game actually is, but it's too late, cause you've already been hooked. You've already spent several hundred hours, or dollars, and can't quit now. So you continue to sink more money, and more time, into a game that doesn't bring you any joy. As another comment said, grinding revolves around doing the same rotation of mobs/enemies for hours on end, daily, for months just to get a single piece of gear (there are 4 pieces of armor, 3 weapons, and 6 accessories, so to go up 1 level in gear, say full TET to full PEN, you'd be grinding 3 hours a day everyday for close to 1.5 years, assuming you're at old softcap which takes 5-6 months to get to). Lifeskilling hasn't been changed in over 2 years, since Fall 2019, and makes no where near the same amount of income as active grinding. So, if you're more of a casual player who only enjoys cooking, or farming, or hunting, or alchemy, good luck ever reaching your goals before you quit. The housing system in the game is also dead content. Essentially, the only purpose to ever spend time in your house would be to install cooking or alchemy tools to AFK lifeskill. Furniture gives negligible benefits to gameplay, and any decent furniture takes an absurd amount of time to grind for. Good luck buying it in the market, as there are either none for sale, or sell for extremely high amounts that aren't worth the silver. Not to mention that spending time decorating is time away from making any income, which puts you ever further behind. The only new content that has been added to the game since Bartering in 2019 was the new group dungeon, which has mostly mixed or negative reviews. It's extremely difficult to complete, and the payoff is abysmal for the effort needed. The game came out in 2016, and only now, 6 years later, are they addressing seriously broken aspects of their game, namely unbalanced pvp, dead grind spots, and desync issues when sailing. Because their focus has been on fixing this dry game of game breaking issues, the game has gotten even more boring. The discord suggestion channel is flooded with new ideas, nearly all of which are ignored.

The rng in this game is king. Nearly everything in the game revolves around chance in some way. From the obvious loot crates, to the enhancing system, to marketplace preorders, to guild quest availability, etcetc. Now rng isn't inherently a bad thing, but when a huge portion of the company's income comes from enhancement related purchases, you can see where a problem arises. Up until a a couple years ago, you could not see the actual % chance of success on enhancements, just a ambiguous ""Easy"" or ""Hard"". Even after they added those % chances though, nothing changed. For reference, the chance of going from TET to PEN on normal gear with 0 fail stacks is less than 1%. You might think that's fair, until you realize that normal PEN gear is not even top of the line anymore. If you want the actual best gear,  it has a base success rate of 0.0025%, that is after you spend upwards of 100 hours grinding for the necessary materials needed to even ATTEMPT enhancing. And because the game is EXTREMELY reliant on gear, you are forced into grinding for better gear, if you want to keep up with ever increasing costs. 

The publisher tried to remedy this issue by increasing silver/hour at certain grinding spots, but that only had the effect of inflating prices even more. Just like in real life, if you print more money, things get more expensive. For reference, a pet in 2018 costed 14 mil silver to place a preorder (which is rng, you could be the first person to place an order, and lose to the 70th person to place the same order). The same preorder was over 60mil in early 2021. 

Content is promised but rarely actually comes to fruition. An example of this would be the naval pvp arena, which was promised in 2019, and keeps getting ""delayed"" year after year while the company focuses on ""more important things"". When these promises do get worked on, they are dropped, and then abandoned. Several of the current arenas were ghost towns for years before the company decided to rework them or remove them entirely. For one such arena, savage rift, you could wait hours and not be matched with a single person. 

And lastly, like most online games, there is an extreme amount of toxicity in the game. Focused around a culture of griefing, it's prevalent in all aspects of the game, both pve and pvp. If you don't give up your spot to someone who wants it, they will either karma bomb you, which makes you a freely pvpable target, or feed you to mobs. In the case of lifeskilling, they will just gather or hunt on top of you, forcing you to either pvp, or leave the area/server. These actions are almost encouraged by the playerbase. The company itself refuses to take action on said players, or bother working on a new system to combat griefing of that nature.

Forgot to mention this previously, but servers are also unstable. You desync often at sea, and when swapping characters, regardless of connection type

Bonus, the game is poorly optimized. If you don't have moderate/upper end rig, good luck breaking 30-40 frames on lowest settings. If you truly want to enjoy the graphics of the game, you need to not be poor.

582660,Black Desert,"I have mixed feelings at best about Black Desert Online, but ultimately my conclusion is that the negatives significantly outweigh the positives.

First, what the game does well. It's pretty. The life skills system, by which you progress your ability to craft, farm, trade, and perform the various noncombat labors of the game is very wide and developed. Farming is fun, combos are satisfying, and the world is fun to explore. There are moments when you find certain places or cities that it does feel like you're in a living world. There's a scope to the landscape that lends itself to immersion.

But every aspect of the game has been meticulously designed from the ground up to be better if maybe you just spent some money on it. There is inconvenience engineered into dozens upon dozens of systems to encourage you to swipe that plastic. The largest cost to be competitive is probably the monthly item which provides a whopping 30% increase to the efficiency of your marketplace transactions, making profitable trading out-of-reach for F2Pers. But there's so many other places. Out of context, I like the idea of restricted travel encouraging a short journey to actually move from place to place. Such a thing orients a player to the landscape and assists in the immersion I mentioned earlier. Those of you who have played Morrowind will know what I mean. But in Black Desert Online, the only fast-travel option is a cash shop item. Furthermore, there is a highly punishing system for breeding mounts where males can breed twice, females once, and there's only a small chance of the offspring being higher in level. Once they're out of ""breeds,"" you're done... unless you want to recharge with a shop item. C'mon, you'll get it, you want to go places fast, right?

I should mention there's an autotravel option. It makes your character navigate to the point you establish, be that the next quest or the next town or whatever. It can take 15 minutes to get between some towns, further for others, so yeah, go do something else for awhile. But there are, again, dozens of systems for doing this... many life skills and other activities are almost exclusively afk. Fishing. Processing. Horse training. It goes on. And you cannot do this while your computer is off or you are logged out of BDO ala EVE. 

This game wants you to be online all of the time. It wants you to be thinking about it all the time. Black Desert Online will make it obvious to you that if you want to play it successfully it wants you to make it a priority in your life. It's designed to be a habit. I enjoyed it for a few hours, but the more I played it, the more uncomfortable I became with how elegantly BDO is made to encourage unhealthy behavior. I played DOOM with a glass of scotch at hand, loving every second of demon-slaying glory. I stayed up late with friends playing League of Legends in college. I really loved the Guild Wars series. It's not a dislike of anything to do with videogames or MMOs. It's Black Desert Online. The only thing I can compare it to is those games on your choice of cellphone or tablet appstore that actively try to foster addiction. 

But it's so much more sophisticated. This is the distillation and refinement of the Korean MMO design philosophy. It is an engine that convinces you it's important and then tries to get into your wallet. The gaming public should be ashamed we tolerate this stuff. This thing is designed to create whales. Forget gaming, this thing isn't good for *society.* Black Desert Online does a few things well... but allowing it to succeed is a loss for gaming. It is for that reason I cannot recommend Black Desert Online for anyone.",mixed feeling best black desert online ultimately conclusion negative significantly outweigh positive pretty life skill progress craft farm trade perform various noncombat labor wide developed farming fun combo satisfying world fun explore moment certain place city living world scope landscape lends immersion aspect meticulously designed ground maybe spent inconvenience engineered dozen dozen system encourage swipe plastic largest cost competitive probably monthly provides whopping 30 increase efficiency marketplace transaction profitable trading reach f2pers place context idea restricted travel encouraging short journey move orient landscape assist immersion mentioned earlier morrowind black desert online fast travel option cash shop furthermore highly punishing breeding mount male breed twice female small chance offspring higher breed unless recharge shop c mon place fast mention autotravel option make navigate establish next next town whatever 15 minute town others yeah else awhile dozen system life skill activity exclusively afk fishing processing horse training go computer logged bdo ala eve want online want black desert online obvious successfully want priority life designed habit enjoyed hour uncomfortable became elegantly bdo encourage unhealthy behavior doom glass scotch hand loving demon slaying glory stayed late friend league legend college loved guild war series dislike videogames mmos black desert online compare game choice cellphone tablet appstore actively foster addiction sophisticated distillation refinement korean design philosophy engine convinces important try wallet gaming public ashamed tolerate stuff designed create whale forget gaming good society black desert online thing allowing succeed loss gaming recommend black desert online,3,0.9957
582660,Black Desert,"I love this game, have played for almost a year. Problem is I have nothing to show for it, I do not recommend this game to people, it is non stop grinding, ridiculous market prices for gear, the enhancement system is an RNG mess that holds players back. There is no end game, you can't pvp unless you have gear, but gear is so out of reach, Gm's will tell you to life skill if you don't like grinding but even building life skills are a grind, this game is just chores and work, you would have to play 5 years for progression or spend $20,000 on outfits to sell, the game just starts feeling like it want's you to lose and hold you back, they try to hide this behind flashy classes and good visuals and combat. Just go play something else TRUST ME!

582660,Black Desert,"This game is the most beautiful empty shell, I ever came across.

Is this a bad game? Not at all, but it has a way of hiding what its endgame looks like and depending on your personal values, you might feel tricked once u get disillusioned. Most of this comes down to the player perception in the early game. Because this game doesn’t feed its content to you with a spoon, you have to explore a lot of the content yourself, leading to developing expectations based on those experiences.

Therefore, I think most of the frustration with this game comes from players developing expectations and false hopes the game can’t satisfy. And I am no exception from this.

As I got a first taste of the action packed combat, the astonishing graphics and the overall level of immersion, I couldn’t wait to see what the endgame content would look like, only to find out that there is no difference. If u have been busy grinding mobs for hours, congratulations, you experienced the endgame content. The gameplay in the early levelling experience isn’t really any different later on. The packs of mobs will have more hp and look different, but there isn’t much else different about them. They don’t get smarter, get any unique attacks or mechanic, to be honest the whole pve content isn’t really challenging at all. Even when fighting bosses I can’t help myself but to think that I have seen all of this done better in other games. 

At this point I have to confess that I´m a filthy pve´ler. I enjoy raids and similar group content so bdo not having any of those made me wonder what the whole point of grinding and gearing up actually is, if there is no fun content I am working towards.

Pvp some people said. As I already confessed I don’t think too fond of pvp. Specifically in this game it might sound a lot better on paper than it is in practise. What I heard, the always active open world pvp will mostly result in the one who oneshots and the one who gets oneshot. To me, this sounds like a lot of potential frustration for new players, rather than a fun experience.
Others said I should go fishing, processing or any of those afk activities, which I always found very hilarious. Why should I play a game with beautiful graphic just to not look at it? And overall I think the term “life skilling” is mildly infuriating. If I had a life, I wouldn’t be playing this.

Another thing that usually kept me grinding unhealthy amounts of time is to spend my efforts on cosmetic content. Especially because once those timed costumes expire, the character you spend 5h+ on to create, starts to look like a beggar again. Low and behold, there exists a quest ingame which seems to provide the “Karlstein” costume after completion. All you need to be able to accept the quest is to drop one of those rare stones with no designated drop location. Or so I thought, turns out that after the completion of the questline you still need said rare stones to craft the set. I got 3 (one is granted from the questline) in 80h of playtime and the whole set requires about 100 of them. Dependent on how lucky you are we are talking about around 2000h of nonstop grinding to get an outfit set that’s arguably on the lower end of all the costumes. Seriously, cleaning toilets will get you this set faster. But that would require me to leave the house, so that’s not an option.
Frustrated but not yet hopeless, I turned to the craftable costumes. Setting up my workers, gathering the needed materials and finally sending the order to a workshop. All this work just to be greeted with a fairly familiar armor in my inventory after equipping the costume. It turns out that the selfmade costumes take up all the armor slots instead of the actual costume slots, leaving you with paper thin defense while wearing it. After a quick research I am enlightened. Those crafted costumes can be made into real costumes with a tailor coupon. Which can be found in the pearl shop. For real money. And nowhere else. Not even in the loyalties shop. So except for taking screenshots they don’t serve any purpose. In result, my feelings hurt.

Ok, I´m thinking to myself, why not take the most obvious approach. Just buy it from the market place. Here is the thing. Upon opening the costume section in the marketplace you are greeted with tons of demand and apparently no supply. So when there are no trades happening in this section, does a market really exist? My guess was that the prices for said costumes in the pearl shop are definitely on the higher end of what I have seen in similar games so far. And because pearl abys is a very progressive company that values their player base and never lies to them, they of course have no cosmetic only surprise mechanics in their game. This and the fact that dismantling your costumes gives you valuable items which can be used in their perfectly balanced gear upgrade system; there is literally no reason for someone to sell their costumes. Apparently this was a little different in the earlier days of bdo with the old marketplace system, but I can’t travel in time. If I could, I would rather use that to kick someone in his one nut.

Devastated but still not completely sane again, I remembered the questline about the “Karlstein” set. And I also remembered that upon completing it I was granted with one of those stupid stones. So maybe … just maybe one could create an alternative characters to grab one of the stones I already dropped, run to calpheon, do the quest, store the additional stone from the quest, delete the character and repeat the process. All of this pain just to slowly cheese my way to reach those 100 stones without spending 2000h+ on grinding while praying to rngesus (yes I am that desperate). Well, turns out that your character doesn’t just need to have one of those stones in order to accept the questline but also a certain level, or maybe worse, needs to drop the stone themselves. At this point I am convinced, that if pearl abys spend as much time and effort into health care as they spend into making sure no one gets access to costumes with ingame methods, they could have cured cancer by now.

After all those efforts I have to admit defeat. I couldn’t find a long term motivation for myself to keep playing this game. And I tried really hard. But after around 100h of playtime, I am disillusioned. This is not a game for me. It is not like I didn’t had a lot of fun along the way. But to realise that there is nothing left for me at the end was really disappointing. A beautiful shell but an empty core.

But that is just my experience with the game and it’s still developing and changing every day so maybe … just maybe I´ll return to it one day.
If you think about playing this game I would suggest you to give it a try. Just ensure that you don’t get your hopes and expectations up too high. This game will push the need of spending money and the time consuming grind to an all-time extreme. Probably the most extreme in the whole genre. So be okay with that or brace yourself for some crippling disappointment.

582660,Black Desert,"I'm not 100% sure what I'm doing in this game, but the game lets me do whatever I want. It's been along time since I've played an MMO where the 'massive' part is taken this literally.

582660,Black Desert,"After putting in 2500 hours into this game I think I have a say in whether or not the game is good or bad. 

Is the game good? 

Sure. It can be. There has been countless times where I've enjoyed doing something other than grinding or pvping, like hunting sea monsters with my friends, or going to world bosses together, and etc. But there are way too many OTHER problems that are never being addressed, and when they are, players have already quit the game or rerolled to another class, throwing all the time away that they've invested into it. I had two friends so far reroll to different classes just because they were meta and the classes they played prior to rerolling were in a terrible position/they didn't enjoy it like they used to.

 I originally purchased Black Desert back in 2016 when the game released in NA. I had no idea what to do, and eventually a couple years later, one of my friends was quite knowledgeable, and was able to help me understand the game even more. Once everything became apparent, it's as if you were a newborn child opening your eyes for the first time. It was incredible. I played the game day in and day out, spending hundreds of dollars on cosmetics, and other things such as pets, and the tent that they offer in the Pearl Shop (Cash Shop). After four months, Pearl Abyss released a patch note that completely destroyed the balance of the game. Every class was pretty much stripped of their Super Armors (a buff that allows you to not be crowd controlled and makes you take reduced damage during the duration of the ability), and their crowd controls, and made most of the crowd controls for PVE (Player vs. Environment) only. However there was one class that was not affected in the slightest, and because of the changes, instantly became a top tier class in a matter or hours after the patch; Ninja. This event was the BDO version of the Great Depression pretty much. After people saw that PA wasn't fixing their classes, they started to notice the damage Ninja could do, and they rerolled to Ninja. They couldn't take it anymore. Hell, there was a point in time where even I couldn't take it. I almost rerolled to Ninja myself. But I stood my ground. I waited desperately, hoping for a buff or a fix to my (and other classes) problems. Six and a half months later, still no fix.

 I think the Devs don't play the game/listen to the feedback of their community. If they did, the decline in players recently, would not have been as big (maybe). As far as enhancing goes... I have to say, in my opinion, it has to be THE WORST enhancement system ever in a MMORPG game. You have to fail, spend more money, fail more, then succeed? Then what? You're stuck with no money for god knows how long? Unless you live and breathe this game, and live in your mom's basement, you literally have no chance of getting anywhere far in this game. Actually let me rephrase that, you do have a chance, but you'd have to invest hours and hours of time in order for that to happen. But, by the time that's happened your girlfriends already left you, your boss called you to let you know that this week is your last week at the office, and you have an eviction notice posted on the front of the door to your one bed, one bath apartment. 

Now, I know I bashed on the game extremely hard. BUT, there are some positives. The game is aesthetically pleasing. I think that the game is seriously ahead of it's time in terms of graphics, and it's combat system is unique and kind of fun. I came from games like TERA, and Elder Scrolls Online, where the only thing you'd have to do in order to use an ability is to press a hotkey, whereas in this, you actually have to press a key combination in order to use the ability. I think that, that is honestly second to none.

All in all, do I recommend this game to for you to play?

If you have a life:

""Hell no, don't do it.""

If you seriously have nothing to do with your life, you have a greasy neckbeard, wear Harry Potter glasses, and don't mind dying in front of your computer screen due to a brain aneurysm cause you failed a TET enhance on your accessory:

""Sure bud, go ahead.""

582660,Black Desert,"Returning player. I had heard the game had gotten better.

Turns out it really hasn't. The Oasis event has helped, sure, but it's still a crutch given to you that is actually aimed at the idea of you grinding day and night while you still have that gear and advantages.

BDO is really grindy, but unlike other alternatives, wich are also grindy, it only shows it's ugly head when you are deep in the activities.

BDO has awesome combat, pretty interesting lifeskill, and a great world to explore. You can do great things by starting little and turning them into something bigger... Except, that's the impression it gives to you. Soon you realize that in order turn that journey you started into something satisfactory you are gonna have to grind day and night for a looong time. 

The game literally forces you to leave it open and afk grinding in order to progress. And it just never ends. Each patch makes it worse.

You have a good 2 hours of fun while you follow the main story until lvl 56. Then you realize that you are gonna have to put up with a lot of frustration just to climb a small step, and that effort is exponential in nature. Of course, forget about trying more characters, it is a waste of time if you want to ever leave the wall you hit after obtaining awakening.

Enhancing gear is the most agressive and anti consumer mechanic I have seen in a serious game. It literally costs hundred of hours to get decent gear and then you have to pass dozens of probability checks in order to turn it into a competitive tool. And each attempt costs several enchancing resources, maybe one type, or maybe other, (or all of them) depending if you you fail or succeed. None of these are cheap and you will spend hours in the game gathering them.

This logic applies to every aspect of the game. No exceptions.

Events tend to introduce some currency, that you can grind in order to use other currency or resource, that will increase the chance to do X in order to obtain Y, which you need to obtain Z. And it is more probable that the process end up failing than succeeding. (Unless you spend real money on commodities, which frankly, don't even really help that much unles you have an unlimited supply).

Everything is designed to make you grind as fast and hard as you can to obtain resources that will sink in a bottomless pit when you try to convert them into something relevant.

So, what can you do with that system in a game that has awesome combat and exploration?

Once you reach softcap gear (gear which you can obtain before the grinding starts getting unbearable) you can explore a large chunk of the map. No elite grinding spots though. You can barely be competent in most of the efficient ones bare two.

You can also forget about PvP. You can enter, but you could last about a couple of blows against most regulars.

You can do lifeskill, but ever since a year or so thay nerfed heavily the money you make by everything that doesnt require expensive grinding (barter is the really only profitable lifeskill and it requires a lot of farming to get even started).

Basically, BDO starts you in an adventure where you feel like you can be anything, and then asks you, in order to progress, to dedicate more hours that you would do to your job and family or friends (or sleeping).

The worst part is that the hours don't really amount. You can fail a simple RNG check and lose the farm of an entire month. Or not fail it and still lose half of that amount just in failsafes and chance improvers.

I literally started a small business last year with way less hours than I spent in BDO and I got way more out of it. (It was also less frustrating, despite the obviously rough beginning).

582660,Black Desert,"You will love this game for awhile. Maybe even too much; however, the end game system revolves around blowing up all your gear for a small chance that one item might upgrade. This is pretty much designed to prolong the game's life. It's simply horrible and extremely unfun. I don't mind the challenge, but the entire process is seriously awful. You have to build ""fail stacks"" on trash items to increase the chances of the item you actually want to upgrade. Problem is, the trash items will frequently upgrade and you will have to throw them on an alt character with negative karma, have them die 10-20 times to guards for a chance that the item might downgrade. This is all done just so you can repeat the entire process all over. By the way, each fail also costs you millions and your items downgrade and have to be enhanced all over. To be honest, no one in this game thinks enhancing is fine whatsoever. I just blew up all my gear going for TET (+19), and I don't really feel that it's worth it to continue anymore. I play games for fun and this system is not fun whatsoever.

In addition, the NA/EU versions are completely out of the loop. Take Valencia for example, this is supposed to be a viable end game grind region with multiple good spots, and for Korea, it absolutely is. Korea has daily loot scrolls they're given for logging in, which increase drop rate of items significantly. For NA/EU, we don't have the loot scrolls. Why? No reason, we just don't. Thus, the only good grind spot in Valencia is Pila Ku. This means that pretty much from level 51+ you'll be fighting for a spot at Sausans or Pirates. Fun times.

This game has a lot of potential, but the disconnect between the developers and NA/EU publisher is just too much, and there are no signs of it being fixed. There are tons of other things wrong with the game like artisan memories (huge P2W) and the karma system for pvp. By the way, the base price of the game is deceiving because pets are required and eventually you will want more weight upgrades, maids, and possibly processing outfit, etc.

2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"Year after year, EA, despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of all-time, you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price. People are paying a premium for your games every year, and are met with some of the most lacklustre, mundane and boring features every year. Sure, you can blame us for continuing to buy the game, but the truth is, I love football. You love football. And FIFA/EA Sports FC is the only game out there that can scratch that itch. There are no viable competitors. Therefore, through our love for the beautiful game that is football, we keep buying it. And you know that, EA. That is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new features/improve the game.

You are too busy milking all the 12-year old FUTwhales that spend mum and dad's money on your stupid packs, which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end. You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC. 

I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be. Speaking of lists, I am going to provide one with all of the bugs that I encountered in my first few hours of game-play.

 → Choppy animations, frames drop and becomes an eye-sore to watch.
 → Commentary does not work on launch. There is 0 commentary.
 → Player models, the hair, bugs out when it is rainy and foggy. Becomes pixelated.
 → Can not connect to the internet (whatever this means). 
 → Controllers not working properly.
 → Game keeps minimising on PC. 
 → The game is not opening and launching for so many players.
 → Can not sack coaches in Career Mode, it just freezes. 
 → Objectives not counting.
 → Not getting XP when completing objectives. 
 → The game freezes on the EA FC logo. 
 → Stuck in half-time animation.
 → Game-play stutter. 
 → Overall TERRIBLE performance even on high-end hardware. 
 → Anti-cheat error message. 
 → Media questions still make 0 sense.
 → Same animations for media interviews and transfers.
 → Same animations for injuries, etc. 0 innovation and creativity here.
 → Menu in FUT will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again.
 → If you navigate the menu too quickly, it messes up and goes all over your screen.

Again, like mentioned, this list could be as long as you want it to be. The point is, you are incompetent EA, and you are ESPECIALLY incompetent when it comes to creating a proper PC port. But of course, because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives, you can keep getting away with this. I am an idiot for playing this game and ""enabling it"" and I know I am, but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run. 

Also, why on Earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game? What went on in your heads over there at EA when you thought, hmm, let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go. What about Champions League nights, important finals, etc? There is no immersion anymore. You do not get to watch your team walk out, line up, with the anthem roaring in the background, your players lined up and ready to battle it out... it just sends you straight into action. This is SO stupid. As a Career Mode enjoyer (shock, I know right, cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode?) this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games, especially big ones.

after more than 200 hours timeplay here is my review for the gameplay
tbh purble place is a better game than fc24 this game is awful
do you want to win? 71 depth - 5 at back - cutbacks - direct passing - and There you go! you have anything that you need to win now its up to you
how this game works??? its more like rocket league the ball just gonna bounce 1284 times until you concede a goal like bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce finesse shot and yep thats a goal there is no point in defending the ball just gonna bounce back to your opponent
your cdms are man marked by strikers (Yes your cdms are man marked by strikers and the rest of your players too !!!!!!!)
90 minutes pressure without lossing stamina and the only option that you have is to make a long pass from your lb to your rb or from your rb to your lb and then you have to wait for your opponent to make a mistake so you can make a move and create yourself a chance to score
for those whos gonna defend this company and say skill issue let me tell you something
there is no skill issue cause this game doesnt require skill anymore
its all about being a rat and have some luck

2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"Having played FIFA titles competitively and consistently throughout the last 5-6 years, I can safely say without a doubt that this is the [b] most horrific title ever released. [/b] This may seem like an overreaction (after all, how bad can a reskinned football game be right?!), and I wish it was, but it isn't in the slightest. I will break this down into some broad sections:

[h3] Gameplay: [/h3]
Where do you start with this. It appears that, for what feels like the third time in a row in FIFA/FC franchises, that the AI is only capable of playing at a high level using high depth, direct passing tactics, that completely negate any form of tactical flexibility or stylistic influence you may wish to have (this may be my FM brain kicking in, but im sure most people dont ALWAYS want to play the same 90 minutes over and over again?). Having been in the elite divisions and consistently finishing FUT champs at around 16-4, I have not seen any variation, besides the starting formation to revert to the standard 4321 meta.

[h3] Player Flexibility: [/h3]
With the new Evolution system being introduced, I, like many fans, were excited to see what layer of tactical flexibility this could offer to teams in ultimate team. Unfortunately, this feature is SEVERELY disappointing. In classic monopolistic style micro-transaction paradise, more 'premium' upgrades are locked behind what seems to be a ridiculously steep paywall (I am of the opinion that paying upwards of £15 for a single player upgrade is quite frankly outrageous). Furthermore, the restrictions are so draconian that only a select crop of players can be eligible. Take the 'Centurions Midfielder' upgrade, with an increased price of 150k coins (don't try to calculate how many games you would need to play) or 2k fifa points. The ONLY usable player in this selection that would be considered meta is Marcos Llorente (shocker!), and any other would be a waste of hard earned currency/ies. Like most years, the availability of exclusive players is so unbelievably high that you would have to wait until AT LEAST post Xmas for any hope of obtaining top level cards (and that is generous, since i'm basing this off of my experience in previous titles, having playing EVERY weekend league with consistent rewards). Would you like to use your favourite footballer, Kylian Mbappe? That is a shame, since you would need a literal mortgage on fifa points to afford just his services (lets not even get into top tier icon prices!!). 

[h3] Player Movement: [/h3]
Remarkably, even due to the 'new' engine that was blessed to us two years ago on PC versions, the level of AI stupidity is quite frankly remarkable. Positional play is non-existent to be optimistic, and downright outrageous on the other end of the spectrum. Realistically, the only avenue of scoring is (you guessed it) Step 1: Buy fast wingers with playstyle+s that offer more 'pace' than their stats suggest (Chiesa is a good example), to then cut it back on a plate. There is no variation at the top level of the game, as this is the most achievable way of scoring a goal. The lacklustre player movement also extends to goalkeepers, who not only do NOT save shots with their actual hands (more so a forcefield aura around their gloves, magic!), but fail to make basic saving animations, and often find themselves locked into animations that they are unable to get out of. We've all seen Alisson Becker make a howler as he is diving sideways, despite the ball coming straight at him (I guess?).

[h3] Predatory Marketing: [/h3]
For what feels like an eternity, EA have been very fast to implement micro transactions into their games without actually considering improving the fundamental gameplay, which in turn would give a more enjoyable experience and thus make people consider spending their hard earned funds on the game. When one of your landmark features in your ultimate team breakdown is the 'Claim All' Button, shouldn't you be looking elsewhere? New packs have been introduced which can set you back a literal weeks shop (if you're not careful). Thankfully there is some pushback in Europe from countries such as Belgium, but more needs to be done to recognise this in built slot machine, which, is also key to note, is listed as a PEGI 3 (ie. EA are perfectly morally ok with the fact that literal children could be gambling money on their game, just to get a virtual card which will be irrelevant in 12 months!!).

It is safe to say that this is the worst football game experience I have endured in a while. My likelihood of buying the next title is, for the first time ever, hit a new ground zero. I would encourage others to perform something similar until actual, effective, and purposeful change has been implemented to allow for tactical flexibility, gameplay consistency, and a fair playing field for all those who wish to play (from casual to professional players).

2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"UPDATED REVIEW:

Please note that this is purely my experience of the game during the stupid hours I have sunk into it.

I won't be completely critical of the game and I'll give credit to a couple of things, most notably the gameplay. I like the animations and the motion of the players, they are fun to control. I play on normal gameplay speed and it feels great. Players are responsive and it is very fun trying to keep shape defensively (especially against ultimate difficulty) but with practice, you get there. Attacking is satisfying too, I like the different dribbling styles, although R1 dribbling at the time of this review is a little overpowered, but even still, I am happy that it's possible to dribble past players in this year's game and score some lovely solo goals. 

I play purely offline, as where I am currently located I just cannot get a good enough connection to have any kind of online experience.

HOWEVER - despite EA releasing updates, not one of them has combated the biggest issue myself and many MANY others face, which is the abhorrent optimisation which is leading to stutters and for some, lag and game crashes. 

I would not want to know how many of those hours I have spent trialling fixes and it is the first time in my gaming experience to encounter a game that just won't play. Sometimes a workaround will fix things temporarily, but upon the next launch, it just doesn't work again. This to me is unacceptable. They are aware of the problem, yet nothing has changed now for well over a month of it being released. The hell I've been through to sort it should never be required to play any game. I paid £80, but I feel like EA owe me a year's salary for the amount of work I've done on their game for them. Crooks.

Stutters in these kinds of games destroy any pleasurable experience you can get from it. Imagine playing an F1 game, but before every corner it stutters for 3 seconds and when it fixes itself, you've crashed into an entire neighbouring village and caused £500 million worth of damage, you'd say 'Forget it' and toss it in the bin. The same goes for football games. You need precision and reactions because timing is important. You can't do that with 3-second stutters intermittently during a match. How can nobody have seen this? I feel like Mugatu from Zoolander.

It was a new era for the franchise, a fresh start, so I allowed myself to believe that things may be different, but it just isn't the case for any of the offline modes. If you think adding cut scenes of players winning the Balon d'Or (where nobody even speaks other than some announcer, which freaks me out) and an open-top bus parade of trophies you've won (which is cool the first time, but it is the same every single time after) then you don't understand why we play football games - WE WANT TO PLAY, NOT SIT THERE AND WATCH SILENT MOVIES. Is this their attempt at making it more immersive? Disaster.

True, some promising ideas were introduced, like tactical vision and hiring coaches in manager mode, but here's the thing - that was bugged when it was released. Imagine working on a new feature, but for it not to work properly. What I mean is, that you can't fire coaches, you'll lock the game and have no chance to back out. I actually hope it doesn't get patched, because it doesn't matter, it tells us what we already know - they don't care. 

It's a shame because I think that if they'd just put more effort into it, this could've been a really good game. The foundation is there with the gameplay, and that's the heart of any good football game. But why not just stop being a bunch of fraggles and develop your offline game modes more? The amount of work they put into 'create a team' for example, which was just uninspiring, is what I am talking about. Put that work into actually making a comprehensive, immersive career mode. 'Create a team' was fantastic in the F1 game, it works in that circumstance, but for a manager mode on a football game? It isn't what we want.

2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"[h3]Background[/h3]

I [b]have prior experience[/b] playing and enjoying football simulators, and this isn't my first encounter with the genre or the specific franchise. As a football enthusiast, my expectations were quite low, especially after reading some reviews. Nevertheless, I approached the game with interest and hope for a positive surprise. However, I [b]cannot recommend this game[/b] unless you fall into a very specific group of people, which I will elaborate on in this review.

Let's delve into the three most prominent game modes, which essentially encompass about 99% of the game's content.

[h3]Ultimate Team[/h3]

If you've ever witnessed people playing slots in Las Vegas, this mode might evoke similar feelings of shame and disgust. It's advisable to reconsider and [b]seek help[/b] if you find yourself going down this path.

[h3]Career Mode[/h3]

This mode should constitute the majority of your gameplay if you lean towards a power trip style of play. Progress, change leagues, build a team, win titles, and more. You even have the flexibility to adjust sliders and difficulty for a challenging experience against the computer.

[h3]Clubs[/h3]

On paper, this mode appears highly promising. You can choose a role, team up with friends, play together, lead your team to higher leagues, claim trophies, enhance your character, customize appearance and skills to match your gameplay, and compete against other teams. Sounds super fun, right? Well, here's the catch...

[h3]The Catch - Main Thesis[/h3]

The game is [b]evidently flawed[/b]. While it claims to be a football simulator, it's more of an [b]exploit simulator[/b]. If you don't conform to the prevailing trends in team composition and player abilities, centered around what is exploitable, you'll find yourself unable to compete against those who do. YOU WILL LOSE. Learning and executing exploits becomes a necessity, and while there are numerous tutorial videos available, succumbing to this approach can ruin the overall gaming experience.

Allow me to provide some examples that resonate with around 90% of the player base. The game's current form, and as per discussions with other players, past and possibly future iterations, is highly exploitable. Consequently, you'll witness only three types of goals in this so-called football simulator.

1 - Players exploiting the sides of the pitch, executing either a cross (Beckham's to Ronaldo vs Zaragoza) or a series of cheap passes systematically positioned between your defenders.

2 - A finesse/trivela kick from the corner of the box (Quaresma style), always resulting in a goal due to a bug in goalkeeper positioning.

3 - A messy first-post header from a corner, forcing you to move the goalkeeper around the box while the opponent reverts to the aforementioned alternatives.

While you may score and witness hundreds of goals like these, the game's rigidity to these play styles and game-breaking mechanics eradicates the sense of being immersed in a football simulator. It feels more like a game of [b]""exploit or perish.""[/b]

[h3]To wrap it up[/h3]

Frankly, I anticipated much more from the purported best-in-industry and expensive game. This disappointment isn't solely based on the gameplay; it extends to actual bugs involving matchmaking, glitched menus, automatic configuration reverting, uniform malfunctions, a community rife with sore losers resorting to excessive sliding tackles and leaving matches when behind, glitched animations, inexplicable computer decisions, alleged handicapping of matches, and other issues that my friends and I endured to play this game.

In summary, and being entirely candid, I [b]strongly advise against[/b] subjecting yourself to this experience.

[h3]That being said...[/h3]

... there's one exception though: if you happen to be a die-hard fan of the franchise for decades, maintaining a close-knit group of friends who play it year after year, regardless of the game's price or condition. If that's the case, go ahead; perhaps the camaraderie with your friends will provide moments of laughter, temporarily diverting your attention from the overall mess that this game truly is.",h3 background h3 prior enjoying football simulator encounter genre specific franchise football enthusiast expectation low especially reading review nevertheless approached interest hope positive surprise recommend unless fall specific group elaborate delve three prominent mode essentially encompass 99 content h3 ultimate h3 witnessed slot la vega mode evoke similar feeling shame disgust advisable reconsider seek help path h3 career mode h3 mode constitute majority lean towards power trip style progress league build win title flexibility adjust slider difficulty challenging computer h3 club h3 paper mode appears highly promising choose role friend lead higher league claim trophy enhance customize appearance skill compete team sound super fun catch h3 catch thesis h3 evidently flawed claim football simulator exploit simulator conform prevailing trend composition ability centered exploitable unable compete lose learning executing exploit necessity numerous tutorial video available succumbing approach ruin gaming allow provide example resonate 90 base form per discussion player past possibly future iteration highly exploitable consequently witness three type goal called football simulator 1 player exploiting side pitch executing cross beckham ronaldo v zaragoza series cheap pass systematically positioned defender 2 finesse trivela kick corner box quaresma style resulting goal due bug goalkeeper positioning 3 messy post header corner forcing move goalkeeper box opponent reverts aforementioned alternative score witness hundred goal rigidity style breaking mechanic eradicates sense immersed football simulator feel exploit perish h3 wrap h3 frankly anticipated purported best industry expensive disappointment solely based extends actual bug involving matchmaking glitched menu automatic configuration reverting uniform malfunction community rife sore loser resorting excessive sliding tackle leaving match glitched animation inexplicable computer decision alleged handicapping match issue friend endured summary entirely candid strongly advise subjecting h3 h3 exception happen die hard fan franchise decade maintaining close knit group friend regardless price condition case ahead perhaps camaraderie friend provide moment laughter temporarily diverting attention mess truly,3,0.9871

To make matters worse, FC 24 suffered from poor optimization, evident in excruciatingly long loading times and sluggish menu navigation.

2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST FIFA EVER!
I have bought and owned all fifa releases since 2002 on the day it was released. I have paid a premium to EA every year for the fifa franchise for 21 years straight.
The game is absolutely disgusting and ridiculous. Yes they have made a few improvements like they do every year, but along with those improvements which are minimal like always, the things that are wrong with the game made me feel like i just wasted my money and time. I know there is a crazy amount of fifa fans out there, Please do not waste your money. I understand all the latest squads and transfers and other stuff we look forward to which is always discontinued in the last fifa when the actual transfer window begins. Wait for EA to release an update addressing the issues that are there in the game, if they address the issues at all.

Issues that have nothing to do with the gameplay-
*The display refresh rate settings are locked to 60fps. (On Laptop) (Desktop is Adjustable)
*The game stutters and lags and is absolutely impossible at times. This happens even on menu screens in career mode or any other, when you are not even playing a match.
*Drastic and random FPS Drops every 5-10 seconds.
I have a RTX 3060 laptop with 64GB RAM and a RTX 4090 high-end desktop. Same lag and stuttering on both machines. So definitely the problem is with the Game software itself.
This is what i get after paying a premium to one of the biggest franchises in the gaming industry. The game overall feels like it was incomplete in its development but the launch date had to be met. What a shame.  

Gameplay Issues:

* The goalkeeper in the game is irrelevant. 
* Shooting and finishing is the worst ever.
* Even though the ball control is better and there is an element of ""centre of gravity"" in the movement of the player in control which is nice, i still feel there is so much wrong in the overall movement of the player in control. 
* Passing is the worst ever. 
* First touch is inconsistent.
There is so much more wrong with the gameplay. And i am hoping that these issues will be addressed with an update. I would be shocked if this is how the game is meant to be.

- Excellent visuals, up to par with modern standards in all fields. Dead Space never looked better, and feels just as eerie as the original for the most part.

- Expanded content, with a side-quests system and more optional areas. Clearing everything will require much longer than in the original.

- Overhauled / reworked gameplay mechanics with better alternate fire-modes, quality-of-life improvements and mechanics from other chapters, like free flight in Zero-G.

- The technical issues of the original, related to running it on modern systems, are no longer present.

- A carefully-done remake that respects the original vision, atmosphere and gameplay loop, without deforming it too much with modern implementations.
[/td]
[td]
- A few sections have been reworked in a way that makes them less engaging compared to the original.

- What have they done to Isaac’s face? Look how they massacred my boy! And Nicole? Boy.

- The game still spawns ammo only for the weapons you have equipped, and this causes balance problems in the long run (1000+ pulse rifle ammo in storage on Hard? Balanced!).

[td]It took me around 20 hours to complete DS Remake on Hard difficulty, taking considerable extra time to fully explore the Ishimura and clear all side-quests. ‘Impossible Mode’, NG+ and a secret ending may be an incentive for a second run, however most of the content will stay the same; replay value is overall low.[/td]

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
Several centuries into the future, humanity sailed to the stars thanks to new technology such as shockpoint, enabling FTL travel, and gravity manipulation that allows dismantling of entire planets chunk by chunk. This is performed by giant spaceships called ‘planet crackers’ - one such vessel is the USG Ishimura. Protagonist Isaac Clarke is tasked with solving onboard technical issues alongside his crewmates. That’s how the nightmare begins.

The storyline follows a plot of intrigue, government secrets and religious fanaticism aboard the Ishimura, where total mayhem has unfolded already, plunging the entire crew into hell-in-space. Compared to the original, the lore has been significantly expanded with many more logs to find, other than reworked dialogues with Isaac being a voiced character, and the side-characters interacting much more with him and each other. This abundance doesn’t detract from the horror atmosphere, if anything expands more upon it. The writing quality is solid, and while some characters are kind of one-sided, it’s overall good.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
The Ishimura is so large it has its own tram system linking its various districts, such as Medical, Engineering and so forth. Differently from the original, this time around you’ll be able to freely use the transport to return to any section you unlocked throughout the main story - a necessity, given the new side-quest system and optional backtracking unlockables. Each section is itself divided into numerous levels, corridors and rooms, all outlined on a handy map, while a GPS tracker will indicate where to go next.

Exploration is highly rewarding, as piles of breakable containers, closets with loot and hidden rewards are to be found by those investing extra time to look in every nook and cranny - a necessity to not run out of resources, on higher difficulties. Enemies partially respawn, a necessary change given this open-world approach, after all the ship IS infested to the brim. Many areas will be initially barred behind story events or Clearance Levels, a new mechanic that replaces Power Node Doors.

[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]
Forget center mass: to down a Necromorph you’ll need to [i]cut off their limbs[/i] using a selection of tools and weapons you’ll progressively find around the Ishimura. Targeting enemy appendages will progressively degrade and mutilate them, consequently hindering their mobility and attack capabilities. Accuracy and quick-thinking in combat are rewarded, as is triggering environmental hazards or using the Stasis (time slow) and Telekinesis (object throwing) modules to save ammo or waste less. Foes are varied enough and come in upgraded variants after some time; they range from the simple melee grunt to hulking beasts or lethal agglomerates of smaller monsters crammed together. Most enemies will drop loot once killed, but usually the ammo expense to down one is more than what you’ll loot, unless you get smart and efficient about it.

Bosses consist of especially mean and huge Necromorphs that obstruct critical sections of the ship, or have unique abilities. All of them have evolving attack patterns and specific ways to be defeated: you’ll need to analyze their weakness and use up all the saved resources to get out of a boss fight. Exception made for the final one, which seems to have been decisively nerfed compared to the original, which is a shame.

[h3]Character Progression & Upgrades[/h3]
Shops scattered through the ship still function and will trade ammo, healing supplies and utility items for credits looted around; you can even sell excess loot and valuables, like circuits, for an extra buck. Engineering benches allow Isaac to upgrade his tools, making them better-suited for the harder fights ahead, improving damage and adding special effects for a price in Nodes, somewhat rare items found sparingly or bought for a high price. Your armor and modules may as well be improved, but for all of this you’ll have to find the right blueprints or upgrade components; differently from the original DS, this time around most upgrade paths will be locked until you find the right gizmo around the Ishimura - a good balance choice to prevent early “min-maxing”.

[h3]Side Quests, Optional Modes & Minigames[/h3]
Side missions entail finding out more about the various endeavors of side-characters, dead or alive, aboard the Ishimura. They are interesting from a lore perspective, and also include solid rewards at the end, such as rooms full of loot or unique upgrades. Minigames include a shooting gallery spiced up with alien intrusions, and a Zero-G basketball course - both of them award great amounts of loot and components, other than achievements. The optional game modes feature NG+, the standard “keep everything and play again” affair, and Impossible mode, a masochist trial with only one save, permadeath and even more brutal enemies.",sum h3

1693980,Dead Space,"I've been a fan of Dead Space since before the first title even came out.  I was instantly intrigued by the early trailers and even ended up in the top 10 finalists of the No Known Survivors contest and won a free copy of the game.  I've counted myself as one of Dead Space's biggest fans ever since and replay the original and Dead Space 2 regularly.

Fast-forward to now and we have this absolutely stellar remake of the first game.  I have to admit I came into this cautiously optimistic because it would have been easy to miss the mark when remaking a game as legendary as the original Dead Space.  Not to mention the well-known fact that EA botched Dead Space 3 by meddling in its development (injecting microtransactions, coop, and story changes) and set absolutely absurd sales targets which lead to the ruination of Visceral Games.  Knowing that this franchise was still in EA's hands and being developed by an entirely different team was concerning to say the least.  

Well.. my concerns are history.  They knocked it out of the park!  Having finished the game at this point I can say that this game stands beside the Resident Evil 2 remake at the absolute pinnacle of video game remakes.  The main and side stories of the game were expanded upon without being drastically altered which serves only to improve them.  Isaac and Nicole's relationship is much more interesting for example, and we get further backstory on characters (and even monsters) that were more of a mystery in the original.  Parts of the original that could get a bit tedious (like the ADS defense segment) were polished and made more enjoyable.  The upgrade tree for weapons is very similar and yet enhanced with new unique special upgrades that make things more interesting.  Additionally the two main companion characters (Hammond and Daniels) are much more interesting and likable in the remake.  I absolutely loved the addition of optional side quests which expand on the story.  This is a clever way to add more lore for those of us that are interested without forcing it on those who are not.  

I have to say one of my favorite changes with this remake is the fact that instead of being a chapter-based setup locked behind the tram, this version of the Ishimura is completely open and you can take the tram anywhere and anytime you want.  With the new security clearance system this strongly encourages backtracking when you unlock access to new areas.  I was also very happy to see that the game clearly indicates the ""point of no return"" where you might want to wrap up any side quests before finishing the main story.

All in all, I was absolutely blown away by this remake and I am incredibly hopeful that they will continue with a Dead Space 2 remake of this caliber.

1693980,Dead Space,"Dead Space Remake isn't just a reimagining; it's a narrative and mechanical overhaul that elevates the horror experience. With Isaac now having a voice, the game's dynamic shifts from being directed to becoming a collaborative effort in the struggle for survival. No more barked orders – Isaac comments on situations, offering solutions and injecting personality into the horror. making it feel like everyone's in the same perilous boat. Isaac's personal mission to save his girlfriend adds emotional depth. The collective goal of survival shapes the narrative, creating a sense of purpose that extends beyond mere monster evasion. Every decision feels like a step closer to something more profound.
The Ishimura's interconnected map design is a love letter to exploration, akin to the Dark Souls series. Forget loading screens; now, you can seamlessly backtrack, explore, and uncover side missions. The map slightly evolves with each revisit – flickering lights and hazard detection keep the tension fresh, akin to a haunted space dance. The zero-g rework is reminiscent of Dead Space 2. Free-flying through space, Isaac's newfound agility injects thrilling dynamism into the gameplay. a stark departure from the rigid point-to-point jumps of the original game.
And let's talk about the horror soundtrack – it's more than just background noise; it's a pulse-pounding symphony that elevates the fear. Every step is underscored by atmospheric tunes that immerse you in the spine-tingling horror.

However, without giving spoilers, the last chapter exhibits some dated design elements and I wish they had reworked that section, also the game becomes somewhat predictable toward the end, but these are minor problems compared to all the remarkable elements we're getting here.
In conclusion, the Dead Space Remake is a thrilling symphony of terror and an unforgettable horror experience. some quirks in the final chapter can't overshadow the brilliance of this game. Get ready for a heart-pounding adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat!

An unfortunate reality. Regardless of this, I'm still changing my review to a positive one seeing as it's truly a great remake (outside of technical difficulties).

EDIT: The Latest NVIDIA driver (version 536.99) seems to have potentially fixed the issue.
I was able to play a longer session recently without crashing. Although I feel we need more accounts to confirm. Please keep an eye on the forums of both NVIDIA and Steam to see if people share these sentiments. 
Otherwise the game is obviously a great remake and I hope it works for everyone who decides to buy it.

It's a shame the developers are unable to patch the game, seeing as some NVIDIA employees have stated on the forums that it is an application bug they've reached out to them about several weeks ago.

(What follows is my old review):

There has been a crash in this game affecting NIVIDIA players for months now and the devs refuse to patch the game for some reason.
It's super annoying to fix manually so do yourself a favor and spend your money on something else until they decide to patch the game.

Keep in mind this is only if you're using one of the latest graphics drivers. After a certain amount of playtime you will start crashing and you won't stop crashing ever until the issue is fixed. The DirectX profile for the game is simply outdated.

1693980,Dead Space,"Pretty much what it says on the box: a sparkling new next-gen remake...but a pretty faithful one, on the whole.

A brief list of new stuff I noted (besides spiffier graphics and lighting, changed item placements, minor map changes and whatnot):

- Isaac now talks. Up to the individual whether this is a move forwards, backwards, or sideways. (""Silent protagonists"" have been a well-loved staple of games since Doom, after all!)

- Door unlocking mechanics are slightly more sophisticated, as you can now ""re-route"" power to switch this area off, but this other area on. A very minor ""enhancement"" of gameplay; but one that certainly added freshness for someone who's played the original game as many times as myself...and one that occasionally ups the suspense ante, as you're forced to remove the power (read: lights!) from one area to restore it to another (meaning greater reliance on your weapon's very limited ""flashlight"" for a wee while)!

- Sound. Sound was always one of the most effective things in the original, but it's been enhanced to even creepier effect here. You'll have a really hard time telling ""ambient"" machine/electronic noise from...""something else""...and a trickier time than ever before pinpointing precisely where enemies are approaching from. (If anything, I'd say this game pushes that kinda thing about as far as it can go; and almost arguably CHEATS, in that regard, given that just about everything in the frigging game sounds like a monster just about to attack you!)

- You simply [i]get given[/i] weapons like the Pulse Rifle, as opposed to having to choose to buy them. Which is kinda cool, 'cause something like the rifle was never really my preference for purchase in the original game...but the devs kind of ""encouraged"" me to trial it a bit more here! (It was never one of the more distinctive Dead Space weapons as far as I was concerned - I mostly just stick to the Plasma Cutter and Ripper! - but still handy to have in certain situations, and a welcome dose of variety; the only downside being, you can no longer sell it once you deem it worthless. Damn!)

- The trams are no longer limited to travelling to the next ""Chapter"" of the game, since the game is far more ""open world"" than before. A newly introduced ""Security Clearance Level"" mechanic ensures you'll be using said trams to backtrack - potentially quite a lot (!) - to open doors and access item boxes you couldn't earlier. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this, as I do sometimes like games to be broken up into ""bite-sized"" pieces...just so I can force myself to stop gaming for the night! So it does open up more of a ""can of worms"" for those of us who lack a bit in the ol' restraint/discipline department. That said...

- You no longer have to sacrifice a ""node"" to open certain doors. A welcome change, as it was very frustrating if you missed one and the goodies stored inside, and thereby always had the dilemma of keeping one on you at all times ""just in case"" (rather than spending them on a nice, spiffy upgrade as soon as humanly possible)!

- There's some optional ""side missions"" this time; evidently adding a bit of new gameplay/exploration. Though I can't honestly say I felt these added much more than ""padding"", and perhaps the teensiest bit of extra ""story""/""lore""...though this will clearly please [i]some[/i] players...

- Like Dead Space 2, you can use Telekenesis to pick up spear-like objects and pointy monster body parts to impale enemies with. So nothing truly new; simply something you couldn't do in the original Dead Space 1!

- Similarly, the ""zero gravity"" stuff operates more as it did in Dead Space 2: flying through certain areas, as opposed to simply jumping from designated surface to designated surface. This obviously expands the scope for exploration and gameplay in some bits, and a couple of sections are [i]very[/i] different as a result (again, mixed feelings from myself, as both ""modes"" have their frustrations; I'll leave it up to you to decide)!

- I don't know if everyone experienced this in the first game's Steam version, but I had a constant glitch problem where I couldn't carry weapons I could hurl with telekenesis - e.g. fire extinguishers - into new areas via doors, lifts, etc. They'd simply glitch out. This time, I could use them at least a [i]tad[/i] more tactfully! That said...

- Careful where you place exploding projectiles like fire extinguishers...as you can now accidentally stomp them while stomping other things, or get them caught in doors...wasting the projectile and injuring yourself! DOH!! (Pretty sure that wasn't in the original?!)

- Not all possible upgrades to suits and weapons are immediately visible: you sometimes need to find or buy items to insert into the ""benches"", to make them available. A bit irritating, really, as I mostly prefer skill trees that you can plan out from the start; especially if it's not your first time playing, and you're hoping for a more ""tactical"" run. But it does make it all a bit more ""nuanced"", I guess, and encourages more thorough exploration...

- Enemies might occasionally attack when you're, like, ""in the shop"". I'm not sure that happened before...Alien: Isolation, you have some 'splainin' to do!! (In fact: I'm pretty sure enemies just ""respawn"" a bit more than they used to, to give you a constant feeling like you're absolutely NEVER safe...but maybe that's just my jumpy nerves speaking!!!)

- The ""gun turret"" bit is completely different, arguably feeling more like the rest of the gameplay now...as opposed to suddenly finding yourself playing a 3D version of Asteroids for a wee while! (I'm personally not sure about this one: while I definitely felt the ""difficulty spike"" in the old version - I'm terrible at old-school 2D shooter games! - the ""solution"" they found here is certainly less striking/memorable. So one step forward, one step back, I'd say...)

- Oh, and last - and most probably least! - for those of us who like lots of saves to go back to...I think the original allowed something like twenty saves at once, while this one allows 40+ (I stopped at 40, and overwrote after that)!

...And that's about the main differences that I noticed. Everything else pretty much ""feels"" the same to me (which is far from a bad thing)! Heck: even the menu screens look and sound incredibly similar...

On the whole, then, I really can't make the call whether I feel this is ""better"" than the original, or simply a necessary update to keep the younger generations interested. (At the same time as I was playing this, I was happily replaying the original Resident Evil on the [i]PS1[/i], for feck's sake; so I'm clearly not the precise target audience for this kind of all-too-obligatory ""update"".) But for those who [i]have[/i] played the original Dead Space several times like I have - and are keen to play it some more - this should at least contribute to longevity. As for newcomers: well, I guess they may as well just go with this version (though curiosity may, of course, lead them back to the original in good time)!

No notable complaints, then, from a big, big fan of this absolutely amazing (and endlessly scary) franchise. And I can't wait to see what they do with a Dead Space 2...whether that be an equally faithful remake of the original, or an entirely different proposition altogether. Personally, I'd like to cast my vote for the [i]latter[/i]...but I'd be happy with whatever they have to offer!

Verdict: 10/10.

1693980,Dead Space,"[h3]Make us whole again, Isaac.[/h3]
This is a remake of the 2008 original game of the same name. This review will assume you've either played the original or are unbothered by minor mechanical and story spoilers. 

[h3]These are the main differences between the original and the remake:[/h3]
- Improved visuals 
- Issac now has a voice, the character did not speak at all in the first game. Dead Space 2 was when he got a voice.
- The limb system is improved, flesh will tear off the bone before more force is required to maim a necromorph.
- Upgrades are slightly different, arguably improved
- Some of the puzzles are different, for instance that horrible sequence where the ADS cannons are offline in the original is dramatically improved.

[h3]Tech and Performance[/h3]
On the following specs I was able to run the game at the high preset at 1440p around 50-90FPS. However, I ended up enabling V-sync to lock it at 60 because the fluctuation became too much.
Ryzen 5 5600X
RTX3070
32GB DDR4 @ 3600Mhz

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3121661740

In addition to the visuals, the game does a much better job at conveying what is actually going on while still being vaguely mysterious. Of course this is difficult to achieve having played the other two games numerous times.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3121665732

The one improvement I wished was in the remake is the ability to alter what the locator is looking for. Such that you're able to find benches, stores or save stations easier.

There are other differences as well such as needing security clearance to open certain lockers or storage units. You won't miss them, it's part of the story. Previously, you would have needed to use a power node to open [optional] doors. A resource used otherwise to upgrade weapons or your suit. Kind of like using a shiv in the Last of Us to open doors.

[h3]The Gist[/h3]
This is a great remake, if it doesn't inspire Dead Space 2 and 3 to also get remade I hope at the very least in reignites interest in the franchise and Dead Space 4 gets made.

[h3]Semi-Unrelated: Using genre tags and nomenclature of labels[/h3]
There are many people that describe this series as “Survival Horror”. And they also say that Dead Space 3 specifically strays from this path becoming an “action” game. Well, I've got news for those people, Dead Space was always an action game — just set with a horror aesthetic and theme. What I believe people intend on conveying when they say “survival horror” is that there is resource scarcity that requires management that makes combat more difficult. Which is not untrue of Dead Space, but on the medium difficulty there's nearly no place where you won't have health packs or ammo. In my understanding, the term “survival” — at least in regards to genre tags — implies there is something akin to tending to needs like hunger, thirst, sleep, etc. But for whatever reason, the survival part of “survival horror” seems to only be used in the more traditional sense. The sense where you are trying to not die. Which can be applied to a considerably large number of games. 

In any case, I consider the Dead Space series, or games like Resident Evil 4 and older to be action games set in a horror theme. The original 3 Resident Evil games, not the remakes, are what I truly think of when the term Survival Horror is used — 'tank' controls, inability to aim precisely and fixed cameras. But that's just my two cents.",h3 isaac h3 remake 2008 original name assume original unbothered minor mechanical spoiler h3 difference original remake h3 improved visuals issac voice speak dead space 2 voice limb improved flesh tear bone force required maim necromorph upgrade slightly different arguably improved puzzle different instance horrible sequence ad cannon offline original dramatically improved h3 tech performance h3 following spec able high preset 1440p 50 90fps ended enabling v sync lock 60 fluctuation became ryzen 5 5600x rtx3070 32gb ddr4 3600mhz http steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails id 3121661740 addition visuals conveying vaguely mysterious course difficult achieve game numerous time http steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails id 3121665732 improvement wished remake alter locator able bench store save station easier difference needing security clearance open certain locker storage unit miss previously needed power node open optional door resource otherwise upgrade weapon suit kind shiv last open door h3 gist h3 great remake inspire dead space 2 3 remade hope reignites interest franchise dead space 4 get quote found helpful consider following curation url http store steampowered com curator 28295405 station argus url quote h3 semi unrelated genre tag nomenclature label h3 describe series survival horror dead space 3 specifically stray path action news dead space action set horror aesthetic theme believe intend conveying survival horror resource scarcity requires management make combat difficult untrue dead space medium difficulty nearly health pack ammo understanding term survival regard genre tag implies akin tending need hunger thirst sleep whatever survival survival horror traditional sense sense trying die applied considerably large number game case consider dead space series game resident evil 4 older action game set horror theme original 3 resident evil game remake truly term survival horror tank control inability aim precisely fixed camera cent,2,-0.9864

1693980,Dead Space,"[h1][b]At first I wondered: Does Dead Space need a remake at all? But now I'm wondering: Who needs the original?[/b][/h1]
 
Well, I suppose the curious players that are not familiar with the original may be interested. You know, just so that they can see how things used to be. They used to be great, and, well, they still are. Dead Space 2008 is the gold standard of a survival horror. Dead Space 2023 is the gold standard of a remake. Everything has already been said about the game and there's nothing to add—it's an absolute must-play. So I will briefly, one by one, go through the changes that caught my attention the most.
 
• First things first: audio and visuals. The game looks and sounds amazing. Almost everything has been slightly reimagined in these aspects, but the game itself is as recognizable as ever. Most of the locations have remained virtually untouched in terms of geometry, but have been saturated with a huge amount of effects and detail, making the Ishimura even more uncomfortable than it was 15 years ago.
 
• Some new places have been added to the ship for the player to explore. They are mostly small rooms with loot, so their existence doesn't have any significant impact on the overall perception of the surrounding area. This is still the same USG Ishimura from 2008, updated technology-wise to a modern level.
 
• Dr. Mercer and Nicole, as well as some minor characters, have been recast or had their appearance changed. Nicole now appears to be a deeper character than in the original game, thanks to the expansion of her story arc. She used to be more of an archetypal princess to be saved. And, thanks to his updated appearance and behavior, Dr. Mercer has become a less cartoonish villain.
 
• The development and expansion of the overall plot, some characters' arcs, secondary events and lore have become available through the addition of a number of new audio and text logs, as well as simple side quests. The rewards for completing the latter are cutscenes in which Isaac watches holograms of past events.
 
• Controlling Isaac feels a bit different, as he now runs, punches and stomps a little faster. What's more, Isaac has now also changed his in-game appearance and learned to talk. And personally, I don't see any problem with that, because the actor who played Isaac is still Gunner Wright, and his participation in the dialogues didn't change his character at all, instead making it possible to better understand what kind of person the protagonist was at the beginning of his journey.
 
• Isaac doesn't need to stop every time he changes or reloads weapons anymore, which not only makes him more mobile, but also much more convenient and enjoyable in terms of controlling him. It would be absolutely wonderful if the locator could also be used on the move, but now, whenever you use it, not only the path is displayed, but also a brief description of the active quest.
 
• Some mechanics, quests, and side activities have been overhauled. Episodes like recalibrating the ADS Cannons, interacting with Power Cells, shooting range, Zero-G Basketball, and some other things are played very differently.
 
• As for Zero-G zones, Isaac now moves freely in space, just like in DS2/3.
 
• The changes to weapons mainly relate to new firing modes. Also, each and every Node in the suit or weapon upgrade system now gives a boost to some stat, unlike the original.
 
[b]These are only some changes; there are still a lot more that weren't mentioned here. I only listed the ones that, in my opinion, have the greatest impact on the perception of gameplay. And what's valuable about these changes is that they can be seen and felt by anyone who has ever played through the original Dead Space, but surprisingly they give almost the same, somewhat nostalgic, feeling, updating what can be updated without breaking what was already working perfectly. Motive Studio has done a phenomenal job. When remaking iconic projects like DS, you have to strike the perfect balance between not breaking anything and not doing too little. All in all, I would love to see a continuation of the series by this studio.[/b]

I got my account back which was great, however after logging on my account I got an e-mail saying that my account was banned due to SHARING/SELLING... Like, really?

I contacted them again but they said they will not provide any support as they have ''determined'' that's it. 

So, if you like the game you can play it, but I hope nothing serious happens to you, Hi-Rez won't do ANYTHING for you.

386360,SMITE®,"Keep in mind that I have played Smite for 4 years now, these Steam hours are merely 1/5 of my whole playtime.
I've spent about 2000 euros on this game, and while I don't regret any of those purchases, I really can't recommend this game in this state. Smite is not the problem, it's a good game. Hi-Rez is the issue.

If you enjoy basically non-existent lore, cash-grabs and rigged systems, cancerous matchmaking, unbalanced and clearly developer-favored characters, bugs aplenty, one completely incapable and utterly useless CEO that holds back the whole department and one of the most toxic communities that even rivals Overwatch's community, Smite is your game.

Back when I started playing, Smite was still in open beta and probably my favorite game for years. It was diverse, set itself apart from all other MOBAS through its 3rd person perspective and tons of different maps. It also had that great concept where you could just buy a skin that you wanted. But then Hi-Rez published it's first chests. There were only 2 exclusive skins, but they quickly realized how much money they could make off that garbage system. In the following years, 95% of all new skins were exclusive or limited - put in cash-grab events or chests. There was a time where there wasn't a single directly purchasable skin for 6 or more months. To this day there are still gods with well over 5 skins, all of them exclusive.

Let's put this into perspective: There are literally [b]128 types of chests[/b] in this game. They range from 200gems to 400gems, so about 3,20€ to 6,40€ respectively, [b]per roll[/b]. As a new player, you have 0/55 items from the Curiosity Chest. Each roll costs 3,20€. The chests are also rigged, not joking here, which means you'll get the skin at ~53/55, which puts you at a staggering 170€ just to get that one skin you wanted. 
And every single season, the grande finale of cash grabs, the so called ""odyssey"". Smite teases one ""Tier5 skin"", a skin that changes basically everything a god has to offer in terms of design. It's comparable to LoL's ultimate skins, which cost about 20€. The only issue here is, that you can't directly buy the skin. You [b]have to[/b] get a ton of other exclusive skins you probably don't even want for that one T5 skin that's barely worth 20 bucks. You'll lose about 100€, if not more, in this great ""odyssey"", as Hi-Rez likes to title it. The odyssey is also often accompanied by several ""adventures"". Adventures are basically one sort of RPG where you choose one god and kill some monsters. The catch is, this map doesn't change, the map always remains the same, and all rewards are either locked behind a paywall (who would have guessed) or a tedious grind-fest that'll probably take millions of your brain cells and about 2 weeks of your life. I'm not even going to talk about the recent ""adventure"", because that's just a pure joke.

Now, bugs. Smite suffers from so many bugs, many of which are present since closed beta. Some of the more recent ones are so gamebreaking it's honestly a joke that they're not fixed yet. First off, In 99% of all matches, lobby chat just doesn't work. It won't even appear in your chat box. You can't communicate with your teammates while you pick your gods. 

Second, also in 99% of all matches, one or more gods won't load in your stats screen. Which basically means, that, if you press TAB, it won't list that particular god. You can't see their items (which in turn means you don't know how to build against them), you can't see their relics, not even their score. Their kills [b] aren't even listed for your team[/b]. You basically have a ghost. 
Also, sometimes your game just freezes on defeat or win screen and just crashes alltogether. Present since beta, they're just addressing it, after 4 years.

While we're at it, I just want to point out Hi-Rez' favoritism, regarding both gods and modes. As you would expect with gods, there are just certain gods which are blatantly overpowered or just unfun to play against. These can usually be identified by looking at their skins, because they usually have billions. Examples would be Loki, Neith, Hercules or Nox. These are not necessarily overpowered, but have heavily bloated kits which make them almost unkillable and totally unfun to play against. 
Now modes. Like I said before, Smite has a multitude of gamemodes, many more than Hots, LoL or DotA. Now, the issue is, the whole game is balanced around the ""main"" mode, Conquest; the typical 5v5 tower-and-minion-push mode, which every moba has. In my 4 years of Smite, I have played 18 matches of Conquest. To compare, I've played over 2000 matches of Arena (5v5 without towers), 600 in Joust (3v3), 500 in Siege (4v4) and 900 matches of Clash (5v5 mix between Conquest and Arena). I never really found the ambition to learn all 4851 rules of Conquest, so I stuck to the other gamemodes which barely required 2 of my 5 braincells. Hi-Rez just tries to force Conquest down your throat at every single possible moment. IIRC, one of the design-leaders even talked about removing other modes so people would flock to Conquest. This alone truly catches the sheer incompetence of Hi-Rez's executives. Most players even stated they would quit before they'd even touch Conquest.

At last, Smite's community. I'm more of a casual and average player, but every single match you're plagued by atleast one incredibly inept (most of the time they're low level because matchmaking sucks) or toxic player, sometimes even both. The problem is, that just like in many other games, most players think way too highly of themselves. But Smite players take the cake. They not only play gods, they [i]think they are gods.[/i] The ultimate pinacle of garbage this game has to offer can be found on reddit. You can't criticize one single god without some white knight showing up and defending their true love like there's no tomorrow, because ""muh waifu"". It's one of the most toxic communites you'll ever see in any videogame, so rev up these mute buttons. Just be aware that you can't mute incompetence. Also, the matchmaking is so fucking bad that I have a legit 85% winrate this season. Every game balances the winrate around 50%.

In conclusion, I'm fascinated that both Hi-Rez and Smite are still alive. Hi-Rez ran so many good games into the ground, gunned them down in the streets or left them to rot in their bug-infested basement, it's a miracle that the company isn't bankrupt. Play this game if you want, but you'll be disappointed in the long run, which is the worst kind of disappointment. Many years I've defended both Hi-Rez and Smite, but at this state, it doesn't make any sense to. I've had my fun, I don't regret a single penny or minute I've spent, but I'm about done.",mind smite 4 year hour merely 1 5 playtime spent 2000 euro regret purchase recommend state smite problem good hi rez issue enjoy basically non existent lore cash grab rigged system cancerous matchmaking unbalanced clearly developer favored character bug aplenty completely incapable utterly useless ceo hold department toxic community rival overwatch community smite started smite open beta probably favorite year diverse set apart mobas 3rd perspective ton different map great concept skin wanted hi rez published chest 2 exclusive skin quickly realized garbage following year 95 new skin exclusive limited cash grab event chest single directly purchasable skin 6 month god 5 skin exclusive perspective literally 128 type chest range 200gems 400gems 3 20 6 40 respectively per roll new 0 55 item curiosity chest roll cost 3 20 chest rigged joking mean skin 53 55 put staggering 170 skin wanted single season grande finale cash grab called odyssey smite tease tier5 skin skin change basically god offer term design comparable lol ultimate skin cost 20 issue directly skin ton exclusive skin probably t5 skin barely worth 20 buck lose 100 great odyssey hi rez like title odyssey accompanied adventure adventure basically sort choose god kill monster catch map map remains reward locked paywall guessed tedious grind fest probably million brain cell 2 week life talk recent adventure pure joke bug smite suffers bug present closed beta recent one gamebreaking honestly joke fixed 99 match lobby chat appear chat box communicate teammate pick god 99 match god load stats screen basically mean press tab particular god item turn mean build relic score kill listed basically ghost freeze defeat win screen crash alltogether present beta addressing 4 year hi rez favoritism regarding god mode expect god certain god blatantly overpowered unfun usually identified skin usually billion example loki neith hercules nox necessarily overpowered heavily bloated kit unkillable totally unfun mode smite multitude gamemodes hots lol dota issue balanced mode conquest typical 5v5 tower minion push mode moba 4 year smite 18 match conquest compare 2000 match arena 5v5 tower 600 joust 3v3 500 siege 4v4 900 match clash 5v5 mix conquest arena found ambition learn 4851 rule conquest stuck gamemodes barely required 2 5 braincells hi rez try force conquest throat single possible moment iirc design leader talked removing mode flock conquest alone truly catch sheer incompetence hi rez executive player stated quit touch conquest last smite community casual average single plagued atleast incredibly inept low matchmaking suck toxic problem game player highly smite player cake god god ultimate pinacle garbage offer found reddit criticize single god white knight showing defending true love tomorrow muh waifu toxic communites videogame rev mute button aware mute incompetence matchmaking fucking bad legit 85 winrate season balance winrate 50 conclusion fascinated hi rez smite alive hi rez ran good game ground gunned street left rot bug infested basement miracle company bankrupt disappointed long worst kind disappointment year defended hi rez smite state sense fun regret single penny minute spent,0,0.9821

386360,SMITE®,"A game that is absolutely in the deathgrip of a bad decision driven company.  This game is no longer about the love and passion that was felt years ago.  The steady decisions to ignore or just flat out be incompetent at addressing the communities complaints are the only real constant here, to be honest. Oh, and a constant influx of new bugs while old ones remain and even evolve in annoyance.

[b]God Design[/b]
I have been an active player of this game for about 5 years, (Athena's release).  As a reference, this is about midway through beta.  I've got 2440H and 55M, so almost about 700 hours additional to the numbers shown here in Steam.  It seems like every hour I play these days is just enjoyed less and less.  During beta, and early season 1 + 2, there was a really heartfelt development aura that you could feel with every patch.  The gods that came out were much more enjoyable than almost everything that's come out during the past year or so, (I will admit, I do love Cerberus.)  But when you compare gods like Chernobog, Achilles, Hachiman, and Thoth to gods like Tyr, Ah Muzen Cab, Janus, and Scylla, you can just tell there really isn't much actualy originality being dumped into these kits.  They may have one mechanic that is new and exciting, but other than that, its just a better version of a previous gods ability and a boring passive slapped onto it to make it feel like its actually fresh.  (It isn't)

[b]Chests[/b]
Now you've got the community wide absolutely hated chest mechanic.  Originally when chests came out, they were all right.  There was a chest with approx 55 items in it, including voice packs, higher tier skins.  It was pretty cool.  Also included was the new Nuclear Ymir skin and Derpules skin.  Neither of these skins were really that out there as far as the original appearance, but they had nice little gimmicks.  Derpules took the joke of the community hating new hercules model's tiny head and took it further, giving him a pea sized head and a funny helium voice pack.  Nuclear ymir was also just a bright green version of ymir with a fun and unique voice pack and some pretty impressive effects added on.  These two skins were not exactly incredible, but they were fun and acquirable if you had already invested into much of the (much smaller) cosmetic inventory.  Now, every single patch that comes out, there is a new chest (Sometimes even three), slapped full of random older skins and all kinds of miscelleaneous cosmetic bullshit that shouldn't be in the game either.  I believe it was something along the lines of 8 months before an actual Direct purchase skin was released.  Everything was a gamble.  And that is bullshit.  Many of the skins are now just unoriginal theme crap, 

[b]Community Relations[/b]
Last year Hi-rez also had many of their employees be let go, quit, or fired.  Nearly every member of this employee pool was a well known, well liked asset of the community.  Now the company is flooded with all of these people that don't seem to even really give a shit about engaging in the community.  SNK8Four is my prime example.  This man was absolutely adored by the community, the pro scene, and pretty much anyone that began watching smite on twitch in its early days.  He was very much the face for many people that began early.  Then just one day, he's gone.  (To be fair, Hi-Rez no longer deserves him.)  So these decisions are just weird from an outside perspective.  The new character design lead is just full of shit, the new artwork / effect guy (HiRezChuck or some shit) is just a flat disppointment with everything, (WE NEED MORE ANIME AND SKULLS GUYS). Its really just confusing to see this massive sweeping directional change that the game has had, especially considering HiRez floundered their partnership with Tencent which included remodeling and removing pretty much everything in the game with skulls, and now they are just fucking everywhere.  Its edgy and annoying.

[b]Matchmaking[/b]
Here's one that was brought up in the comments, and should rightfully be added.  I guess I'm just too numb to it at this point to have thought it up while typing.  The matchmaking in this game, is terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  The queues are diluted because there are so many.

Here is a list of all game modes and a short description
[i]Conquest[/i] - The tried and true three lanes and jungle MOBA format.
[i]Siege[/i] - Two lane smaller map, with 4v4 and an objective boss in the middle to facilitate pushing.  Intended to be a somewhat shorter mini conquest.
[i]Arena[/i] - 5v5 Death match, minimal wave farming.  Its pretty much just the chance to beat the snot out of each other.  This is the game that is ranked as the most popular.
[i]Clash[/i] - Also kind of a mini conquest, however its 5v5 still with far less focus on jungle, as the lanes are closer together.  Pretty much arena with a little bit more farming and a center objective boss.
[i]Joust[i/] - 3v3 Single lane, small side jungles and an objective boss in the middle portion.  Also a more popular game mode than Conquest.
[i]Duel[/i] - 1v1 Joust on same map.  Ranked only
[i]Assault[/i] - All random gods 5v5 one lane.  No backing until death.
[i]Mode of the day[/i] - Random garbage that cycles through every day.  (All same god no cooldowns etc)

EDITED 
Smite has shifted to a timed queue system, so now you only sit for 3mins at a time for casual conquest.  Matchmaking still seems pretty random skill wise.

[b]God balance[/b]
This is Hirez's biggest problem, in my opinion.  I get the skins in chests thing.  I get the god design thing.  I get the business/employee thing.  But when your game is about beating the crap out of each other, is it not an all around better idea to focus on improving that aspect?  New gods are horribly bloated, every ability becoming a novel to read as opposed to the long forgotten ""This ability will hurt people in front of you"" mechanic.  Old gods are left to rot, unless Hirez has decided to do massive sweeping changes to an entire kit, buffing three separate things about them and then wondering why they are overtuned, of which they will then follow with sweeping nerfs that do not address the new problems and simply deteriorate a god to uselessness once more.  OP Gods sit at that stage for a much longer period of time than you would expect.  Conveniently when the oddyssey skin for Ullr came out, (Buy all the items throughout a time period = approx 140$USD), Ullr managed to sit at 100% P/B rate for Months.  MONTHS.  Tiny little nerfs came in to give the appearance of adjustment, but it was incredibly shallow and obvious.  3 months after the skin came out and was no longer acquirable, he was hit with multiple nerfs, bringing him in line. When a new god is released, there are two possible scenarios.   

Scenario 1) This god is unstoppable.  He can do everything by himself, requires no assistance, and will absolutely make everyone else have 0 fun, if the person playing them took the 10 mins it usually take to figure out the core mechanics of this god.

Scenario 2) This god is absolutely horrible.  The kit is just a mishmash of clashing abilities which in no way shape or form synergize together and will just serve as three random situational abilities with an ult that hopefully does something, (Looking at you Chernobog).  


This game is a huge part of my life, and I do not want to even KNOW how much money I have actually spent on it over the years, including a +1500$ to the world championships in January of 2015.  (EDIT - I forgot I also attended in 2016)

But, it is also a huge regret and a downward slope.  HiRez needs to get their shit together, because this game could easily be so incredible, but they refuse to take the proper steps.",deathgrip bad decision driven company longer love passion year ago steady decision ignore flat incompetent addressing community complaint real constant honest oh constant influx new bug old one remain evolve annoyance god design active 5 year athena release reference midway beta 2440h 55m 700 hour additional number shown day enjoyed beta early season 1 2 heartfelt development aura patch god enjoyable past admit love cerberus compare god chernobog achilles hachiman thoth god tyr ah muzen cab janus scylla tell actualy originality dumped kit mechanic new exciting version previous god boring passive slapped onto fresh chest community wide hated chest mechanic originally chest chest approx 55 item including voice pack higher tier skin pretty cool included new nuclear ymir skin derpules skin neither skin far original appearance nice gimmick derpules took joke community hating new hercules model tiny head took giving pea sized head funny helium voice pack nuclear ymir bright green version ymir fun unique voice pack pretty impressive effect skin exactly incredible fun acquirable already invested smaller cosmetic inventory single patch come new chest three slapped random older skin kind miscelleaneous cosmetic bullshit believe along line 8 month actual direct purchase skin released gamble bullshit skin unoriginal theme crap community relation last hi rez employee quit fired nearly member employee pool known liked asset community company flooded shit engaging community snk8four prime example man adored community pro scene pretty began watching smite twitch early day face began early fair hi rez longer deserves decision weird outside perspective new design lead shit new artwork effect guy hirezchuck shit flat disppointment anime skull guy confusing massive sweeping directional especially considering hirez floundered partnership tencent included remodeling removing pretty skull fucking everywhere edgy annoying matchmaking brought comment rightfully guess numb thought typing matchmaking terrible terrible queue diluted mode short description conquest tried true three lane jungle moba format siege lane smaller map 4v4 objective bos middle facilitate pushing intended somewhat shorter mini conquest arena 5v5 death minimal wave farming pretty chance beat snot ranked popular clash kind mini conquest 5v5 far focus jungle lane closer pretty arena bit farming center objective bos joust 3v3 single lane small side jungle objective bos middle portion popular mode conquest duel 1v1 joust map ranked assault random god 5v5 lane backing death mode random garbage cycle god cooldowns edited smite shifted timed queue sit 3mins casual conquest matchmaking pretty random skill wise god balance hirez biggest problem opinion skin chest god design business employee beating crap idea focus improving aspect new god horribly bloated novel read opposed long forgotten hurt front mechanic old god left rot unless hirez decided massive sweeping change entire kit buffing three separate thing wondering overtuned follow sweeping nerfs address new problem simply deteriorate god uselessness op god sit stage longer period expect conveniently oddyssey skin ullr item throughout period approx 140 usd ullr managed sit 100 p rate month month tiny nerfs appearance adjustment incredibly shallow obvious 3 month skin longer acquirable multiple nerfs bringing line new god released possible scenario scenario 1 god unstoppable requires assistance else 0 fun took 10 min usually figure core mechanic god scenario 2 god horrible kit mishmash clashing ability shape form synergize serve three random situational ability ult hopefully chernobog huge life spent year including 1500 world championship january 2015 forgot attended 2016 huge regret downward slope hirez need shit easily incredible refuse proper step,1,0.9943
386360,SMITE®,"1900+ hours in this game, I wish there was a neutral thumb review option in Steam, I think Smite is a very fun game and can get super addictive BUT, the community and devs are terrible and bring the game down. Also probably one if not the worst support I have ever witnessed... Your account got stolen? Some CPU bug triggered the anti cheat? You answered in a bad manner to the wrong person? Bye bye your account and money. You will never get help from Hirez support, just stupid automated messages that will waste your time. Anyways here is the list of everything I dislike about the game.

- Toxic and un-welcoming community, expect BM and VGS spam.
- People will ruin your 40 min long game on a whim and AFK or feed.
- Clowns that instalock and then demand you play a character.
- People play only top tier gods because it's ""meta"" even in casual.
- One of the most terrible matchmaking I have ever seen.
- Blatant cheaters still undetected (radarhack, aim, speedhack)
- Gods and Item balance is awful.
- Devs don't seem to understand their own game and playerbase.
- New gods have bloated kits and uncreative direction.
- Garbage servers since 2012
- Skin are super expensive, and most of them are behind lootboxes.
- Your Smite1 skins won't transfer to Smite2 so RIP your money.
- Hirez is known for it's terrible support, now I know why.

In conclusion:
Please, don't spend money in this game or in Smite2, you will sooner or later regret it. Tons of  games and devs out there that respect their playerbase and deserve your time and your money far more than this greedy uncreative company.",1900 hour wish neutral thumb option smite fun super addictive community terrible bring probably worst support witnessed stolen cpu bug triggered anti cheat answered bad manner wrong bye bye help hirez support stupid automated message waste anyways dislike toxic un welcoming community expect bm vgs spam ruin 40 min long whim afk feed clown instalock demand top tier god meta casual terrible matchmaking blatant cheater undetected radarhack aim speedhack god balance awful understand playerbase new god bloated kit uncreative direction garbage server 2012 skin super expensive lootboxes smite1 skin transfer smite2 rip hirez known terrible support conclusion please spend smite2 sooner regret ton game respect playerbase deserve far greedy uncreative company,1,-0.9423

386360,SMITE®,"SMITE is a fantastic game that takes the MOBA genre into a 3rd-person perspective; allowing me to implement the aiming, timing and skills I've gained from playing other games, like shooters, but with a stronger emphasis on strategy and team building-- making the combat fast and highly addictive. 

Compared with League of Legends and Dota 2, it relies less on builds and the minions/creeps, but without removing those elements of strategy either. Rather than losing an integral part of what makes other MOBAs enjoyable and meaty, it replaces them with what gives games like first-person and third-person shooters depth. It panders to and compliments a different style, giving a different experience but in a familiar format. 

Minions aren't as relevant late game as they are in Dota, but it feels right. You're playing the role of a god, and by the time you're at end-game, you have bigger threats to worry about-- other gods. It's satisfying to build a tank that 5 enemy gods and a tower, all at once, can't easily kill. It feels great to have your team expect you to clutch, but succumb to the pressure and miss all your shots. I love saving a teammate at the last possible moment by landing a perfectly aimed and timed kiss from Aphrodite, which stun locks the enemy. 

It's about timing, weaving in and out of battle, aim and speed. Team fights are intense and replicate the rush you'd expect from a competitive shooter, all while respecting the governing outline of a MOBA. That makes SMITE a truly unique experience.

Most people who claim SMITE ""sucks"", play LoL or Dota. They see other games within the same genre as direct competition to the game they love. They don't care about enjoying games for what they offer; they compare and contrast simply to feel like they’re part of a team—for the sake of ego. It’s as though they themselves had a hand in the game development; they're very, very proud.

Most of them like to say SMITE’s not as deep. I argue the opposite. I feel where it lets go in micromanaging, it substitutes with a skill-oriented, high speed combat experience. It has depth and develops a skillset absent from other MOBAs. So it comes down to misunderstanding the skills necessary in SMITE. 

I've been playing SMITE for probably a year now. I should have at least 300 hours, perhaps more. I wish my friends would play with me, but most of them have 'standards' and strongly draw the line after LoL. They’re better than Smite, and If I want to play with them, I’m going to have to play their favorite MOBA. 

It would enhance my experience to play with them on SMITE, but even without a single friend, this game has kept my attention and I'll continue to play it.

Moreover, SMITE is constantly evolving. New skins, new gods, new maps, redesigns, new items, nerfs, buffs, new UI, etc. In the short amount of time I've played the game, I've seen many drastic changes. If you tried Smite years ago, it’s a promise that this SMITE is a completely different game today-- by this time next year, it'll have drastically changed again. All these changes are enhancements and true refinements to the game. It continues to get better and better, and HiRez listens to the players. 

SMITE literally looks different graphically and the devs aren't scared to try some pretty wacky shit to make things more fun but balanced.

Free to play; pay to look cool. Smite's become one of my favorite games of all time.　

Note: I play LoL, Dota and Heroes of The Storm as well.

386360,SMITE®,"RISE AND FALL OF SMITE

I have been around since the Beta. This is by far my most played game with over 3000 hours over the years. Its kind of a love-hate relationship.

The game initially took my breath away. Playing as legendary mythical gods and champions in beautiful detailed environments. There were few bugs here and there, but nothing that really bothered me. We had He-Bro, Lil' Mana, Olympian Anhur, but I felt like these skins we're not seen too often. They did not break the immersion.

Some time went pass and they introduced new Gods, Seasons and Items. New gods kept getting more and more overpowered to push people into buying the God Pack. Bellona was a fine example. It took them months to fix a god, that everyone agreed was beyond broken. Simple hotfix, reduce healing in half? Nope. We saw her fighting 1vs2's, 1vs3's and shivered at the mere sight of it. Console players had to suffer her for even longer.

There was the Frostbound meta, Qins/Fatalis meta where Cernunnos and many others were running rampant with insane damage and mobility, (I still have 88% win rate with Cern and 86% with the Bee.) Then there was the Defence meta, where assassins and warriors built 4 bridge items, and were able to destroy mages and hunters with ease, while taking barely any damage. Hi-rez did struggle massively to balance the game, and as they added more and more Gods and Items, it was even tougher job to get things right. We've all seen how bad it eventually got.

With every patch note, we saw where the manpower has gone. Skins. The base mechanics are barely working, while leaving people often with issues like:
-Not being able to invite friends
-Having to restart Smite in order to receive invitations or invite people
-Not seeing who is online
-Not seeing who is in game
-People getting randomly deleted from your Friendlist
-Not being able to talk in Party Chat
-Not being able to talk in Lobby Chat
-Not being able to talk in game chat without saying /g (not all know this)
-Mouse not interacting with item store, forcing you to restart the game
... And many many more.


You can start to see the picture i'm painting here. This could have been a game that kept tens of thousands of players around for years to come, but they did horrible job with managing the game. There are few expectations, but most of these skins are not appealing. They are all copies of each other with the same Edgy Robot, School Girl, Stuffed Animal, Edgy Demon and Edgy Demon Hunter Knight Thing kind of themes. They have been using the same taunts and cringey pop-culture references for years, with the same god damn voice actors.
The atmosphere of mythology, lore and divinity is all gone. The balancing is underwhelming. These gods are complete jokes, throwing around Cringey lines and occasional VELVEL spams. I used to read lore behind my favourite gods, that's how big of an impact the atmosphere had on me.

Hi-rez did jump on the MOBA wagon when it was popular.
Hi-rez did jump on the Hero Shooter wagon when it was popular, leaving Smite behind with no care for the well-being of the game.
Hirez did jump on the Battle Royale wago.. you know how this goes.

This could have been something special.


Honourable Mentions:

-Massively overbuffing Ullr before the release of 80€ T5 skin for him. He got banned in ranked in nearly every game and destroyed the casual experience. He was nerfed after the event, leaving people who spent money on that skin disappointed.
-I once opened 73 chests in a row and got the rare skins Derpules, Nuclear Ymir and 4 Convention skins in the last 6 chests. It is all a scam for the people with gambling tendencies.
-People were unavailable to spend money on the store after a patch last year. It took them only few hours to take the game down and hotfix this issue. My lobby chat was missing in January, it was still missing in July hours before writing this review. This is not healthy.



JULY 2020 UPDATE:

All the user interface, lobby and friendlist bugs are gone for me at least. Great!


NOVEMBER 2022 UPDATE:

Time to kill changes killed the game for me.

Time to kill was increased massively some time ago. Now everyone hits like a wet noodle, and i feel like the game is way more boring and stale than before.
This sucks for the following reasons:

Previously you could kill a fed enemy, if they made a missplay. Now, they are so beefy that they can afford to mess up a full kit rotation and still somehow survive/kill someone.
This makes the game even more snowbally than before. Capitalizing on your enemies mistakes don't pay off the same way as before and the player who is ahead in levels/defence/health, just rolls you, even if they make major mistakes.
I'd rather have fed enemies deal tons of damage, than to be unkillable. If they just deal tons of damage, you can outplay their kit and actually kill them.

1vs1 fights feel awful. Previously you could kill gods with single kit rotation and few basics, if you used your god to its full potential. It felt great. It felt rewarding. Pushing your god further just to deal that extra 100 dmg could mean the difference between enemy escaping or dying. Now there are just few champs that can actually 100>0 someone. Ra ulting someone, just to deal about 18% of warriors max health feels awful.

Since 1vs1 killing someone is out of the question, you have to rely more on your team. If you're playing with randies, you know how bad people are at this game. I feel so powerless, when the enemies are rolling over us and I cant kill anyone on my own. I have to depend on Fleshgordon27FENRIRx007  with his level 23 account to follow up on attacks to actually kill someone.
Impact of individual skill has been brought down SO MUCH that i just feel dead on the inside when team refuses to group up or work together.

Hunters crit meta is ass. Fights are decided on who gets the lucky roll out of the RNG machine and that is horrible for a skill based competitive game. I do wish they would rework the crit system or remove it all together. Maybe crits would crit every 2nd or 3rd basic attack, so that you have ways to play around it. You would be able to keep track of your own and enemies crits to add another layer of depth to the game.

Hitting like a wet noodle and feeling powerless does not fit the game where you play as literal chad fcking Zeus. This is also not a skill issue. I've dropped solid 4000 hours into this game and made it into masters many times.


JANUARY 2023 UPDATE:

The recent updates are really good for the game and the overall experience feels a lot better.
Some defense builds are a bit problematic as they stack tons of survivability and damage at the same time, but overall I feel like I can actually deal damage. Extra free wards are mostly gone and that's really healthy for the game.

386360,SMITE®,"August 2020 update:

On top of all the things listed below, the game now crashes constantly for multiple players. I've sent several emails to Hi-Rez since originally posting this review, and haven't had a single response. Every time the game crashes, it bans you for what seems like a completely random amount of time. For example, I have been banned for 24 hours, 30 hours, 10 hours, 30 minutes, 10 minutes, etc. No response from the development team whatsoever.

The concept of this game is fantastic. One of my favorite MOBAs.

However, the community is absolute trash. Every single person is toxic and no one ever wants to help. As of July 2020, the game has been taken over by trolls.

That being said, the developers are just as bad. Several people in the community who have made smite as popular as it is constantly get abused by the dev team. Even casual players can fall victim to this as well. 
The reporting system is a joke. If a team wants to ban you, all they have to do is mass report you and you get banned. The ban system is all computer generated. 

TLDR; a good game with a complete joke of a management team and community.",august 2020 top thing listed crash constantly multiple player sent email hi rez originally posting single response crash ban completely random example banned 24 hour 30 hour 10 hour 30 minute 10 minute response development whatsoever concept fantastic favorite mobas community absolute trash single toxic want help july 2020 taken troll developer bad community smite popular constantly abused casual player fall victim reporting joke want ban mass report banned ban computer generated good complete joke management community,2,-0.8758

386360,SMITE®,"I think it's about time I finally review this game.

I've had a history with this game. I've played this game since Isis was released, which was over 2 years ago. I remember that I was a HUGE fan of the old Sun Wukong (Hun Batz nowadays) and enjoyed the game, although I never got hooked into it. I eventually just stopped playing and went to get addicted to other games, namely Team Fortress 2. Fast foward to 2015, where SMITE is finally released on Steam. I was very curious to give this another try, so I did. Now, before I continue, I have something to say. All of my good friends know this fact well, and I HEAVILY emphasize this:

[b]I hate MOBA games.[/b]

Long story with that, but I just never liked them, besides Awesomenauts. I downloaded SMITE and gave it a second chance, figuring it might be pretty cool now. Okay, this is the part where you look at the number of hours I have in the game. Just take a nice, solid look at it. To the review!

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

MOBAs aren't known to have god-tier graphics (heh) and SMITE is no exception. The game is just... eh. It's sort of bland, but at the same time it actually looks really nice in some places, like Siege and Conquest. Not much to say here, but this is not a game for the photographers out there like myself.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The big question to this is, ""Is SMITE a good enough MOBA to compare with LoL and DOTA?"" The answer to that question is, well, yes! I find it much better to BE the character your playing as, rather than telling them what to do. It's what makes SMITE stand out from the rest of the crowd, and it shines brightly in this way. I don't want to start a flame war, but although it is very simple to understand, the game is much more difficult to master because of the fact you have to actually LAND your shots. No more ""clicky-clicky here's the part where 3 champions die"" or whatever. Your abilities matter, and missing one could change the course of a game. Plus, of course, teamwork is important in Conquest, and I haven't actually encountered many ""OP"" gods, if any at all. Some items are clearly better than others *cough* bluestone pendant *cough* *cough* but most aren't too severe. Overall, SMITE delivers with the gameplay by miles.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Just like whether or not Set will be added to the game, there is no known story. This will not be counted towards the final score.

[h1]Audio[/h1]

The audio isn't all that special, but the some of the voice packs you can purchase for gods are actually really funny. Some of the writing is extremely clever and gives the game a LOT of personality.

[h1]Replayability[/h1]

Compared to DOTA and LoL, this game is much easier to pick up and play, although still being a very competitive game. The community, although not sunshine and rainbows, is much easier to deal with and far friendlier than those other toxic wastes of ""communities."" The gameplay, as said earlier, is simple and it doesn't require too much experience to understand, however I would recommend staying away from Conquest in that case. There are also daily rewards, but I don't like the fact that the prizes don't get increasingly better after 7 days, because it doesn't feel right getting 75 Favor for playing 8 days of SMITE. Invest the time, however, and it'll greatly pay off. Trust me on that.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

In the end, SMITE gives me a much better point of view on MOBAs, my least favorite genre of gaming. I can easily recommend this game if you don't want to go through a brutal experience like DOTA and LoL, and the fact that it brings out its differences with pride makes it one of the most enjoyable and addictive games I've played since Team Fortress 2.

386360,SMITE®,"I absolutely LOVE this game and have for a very long time obviously since I've played it a lot as is evident from my hours (there is also even more hours besides whats shown on just Steam alone). I put a lot of my time, money, effort and care into this game for many years and I don't regret it even with the crazy amount of time and money I put into it.

If we are going to judge the game solely on game-play alone then it's awesome and a really fun and great game but it does have some issues with bugs (not too many but still they exist especially old bugs that should've been fixed a long time ago), servers suck too, unbalances within the game-play like gods (usually the newly released gods tho) and matchmaking oh god the MATCHMAKING like don't even start me.. However no game is perfect and so regardless of those I'd almost recommend it just for the fact alone that it is a good game and for how much I love it, however I cannot look past the MYRIAD of other problems it has beyond just game-play and namely things like the greedy+useless Devs and the toxic community.

I eventually stopped buying things entirely like skins (or any items) in game and even stopped playing SMITE altogether for a couple years purely because of how absolutely DISGUSTING the Devs are. They're greedy and shameless about it, they don't do much at all to actually improve their game seriously or problems with it, all they care about is pumping out skins and pointless aesthetics, they don't care for their players and have no loyalty or respect even when you are a paying supporter or dedicated player in general, there is also no real support whatsoever for problems within their game from them or even support with other issues that happen within their game like toxic people who genuinely abuse others.
I was being bullied, stalked and sexually harassed from a whole group of living cancers (I wasn't even the only person being treated this way by the same people either) which I made a couple of reports about with evidence might I add and they did NOTHING about it while disrespecting me and when I went to follow-up about it just a couple days after I'd made my FIRST report to see if they'd at least done SOMETHING to help and they'd told me I'd need to re-submit my reports and everything AGAIN.. Even when I did re-submit they still did nothing!

The community is also pretty toxic and not friendly for new players at all or really anyone trying to learn anything in the game. I have even been banned on my first account for ""feeding"" when I at the time was incredibly new to the game and had no previous experience in ANY MOBAS at all! I tried to re-appeal it but the Hirez bigots rejected it saying they had ""evidence"" even tho they had never even checked my profile to see how many hours I had in the game (hardly enough hours or so to assume I was proficient in the game) and the fact that I was very new and had no idea what was even going on or my side of what happened at all. I didn't even know what feeding was at the time and I had never really fed in any game and honestly I still haven't ever fed.. You can actually still go and see my old account's hours and profile on SmiteGuru. So I am MORE than sure that they never even looked at my hours at all but they easily could've done so and neglected to do so out of choice. I also highly doubt they couldn't see this information about my account through their own means. So that means they were either neglectfully lazy or deliberately biased and abusive of their power, either way it was pretty crap of them.

I'd also like to add their tutorials are vague AF and hardly help inform about everything that's actually important in the game-play (like god builds and the overall stats within matches that is required to survive or be successful). Now they are much better these days than they used to be compared to when I first started (which added to my overall suck-age at the game tbh), however they still SUCK. Smite is not too complex but it is definitely not simple so thorough tutorials are definitely a necessity, especially for people new to MOBA's. I even understand that it would be tedious and possibly take a bit more effort to do so but it should still be done regardless. They're just not informative or thorough enough and perhaps they want you to just go straight in almost blind or they just assume everyone will just know how to play the game SOMEHOW and all the lil things about it, but even the most simplest of games or game mechanics will need to be explained to someone at some point in time especially people who are entirely new to that type of game or that game specifically or even gaming as a whole. It should just be a common courtesy and I get that the people who do already understand will find that annoying but that's literally why it should also be an option to turn off tutorials and tips in the settings in every game as a common courtesy as well (which I believe they actually do have that in Smite).

I still think it's pretty shady and crappy that if I am going to be perma-banned on being crap and confused at THEIR game because THEY couldn't be bothered to explain it even remotely well enough that's a disservice on THEIR SIDE, so no wonder they are gonna have people be crap at their game and then those people get reported and then banned. Because they set those people up to end up that way and to me that's just not right, it doesn't make sense either (it's like they're kicking out their own new players coming into Smite). They should either suspend someone's account before perma-banning them or at least give them one warning before perma-ban (personally I would just suspend because it's still a punishment but also serves as a warning AND doesn't just outright perma-ban them from the get go), I also think it's incredibly crap, lazy and WRONG to not even try investigating it at all beforehand.

I will never support Hirez in ANY way ever again if I can avoid it, they're greedy and disgusting. They do clones of games and the popular game type at that moment to join the hype train and get their money off of overcharging for the aesthetics within those games which for the most part btw I'm not even that against, because if they make their games free and they're mostly decent games where they only charge you for aesthetics that you DON'T need (so it's not pay-to-win) that's fine to me since that would be their way of getting income and so that makes sense and is pretty fair. HOWEVER they still don't need to charge THAT much for just the currency for those aesthetics alone especially how they make it so you will be so close to getting exactly what you want and paid for only to pay EVEN MORE for it, also just as a logical and smart business point they could easily make more money the cheaper they make the said currency because more people will buy them therefore the overall larger influx of profits will end out more than they probably make now.
Just look at all of Hirez's previous, future and current games they're all blanket copies of a genre type that is booming in a certain time. A more specific example is Realm Royale! Even Smite itself is a great example of this. They're always just that decent enough of a game but overall never that unique so therefore never too much work and effort put into them.
They usually seem to give up on their games too if they're getting old and less popular and therefore raking in less profits. Hirez do not care for their games or their players (or even paying customers), they are a greedy company to make and take money that's it.

I have only just recently come back to SMITE from being gone for a couple years now and not much has changed since I left besides new skins, new UI and overall aesthetics, a few new gods and a lot of the same problems honestly...

<EDIT: In light of the games current microtransaction model, I feel compelled to lower my praise of the game on that front. An overwhelming majority of the skins now are tied behind lootboxes, conspicuously the higher quality ones. Even among those that aren't there are time limited events to get those skins, so in addition to gambling we're now exploiting fear of missing out(FOMO). 

I returned to the game to find they had FINALLY given Ares a couple good skins... one I wasn't allowed to get even if I was willing to drop the $100+ dollars to get it... and another restricted to those who spent money on Paladins, a game I don't play. But these couple disappointments would be easy to ignore were this not how majority of skins are handled now. 

I used to go to a gods page, see something I want and pay a reasonable price for it. Now the price to quality ratio on skins has double and even were I willing to pony up... I'm not going to support the psychologically manipulative nonsense that is lootboxes and timed exclusives. These are just flags on my account, the only reason to make getting them complicated is to artificially inflate the value.

This runaround in the cash shop isn't the worst one in gaming.. but it's way past my line, it's way past where the line ever should have gotten to. As such I won't spend any money on the game anymore, even on the rare ocassion there's a straightforward transaction for something I want. I don't want to support what they're doing the majority of the time. I used to be happy to spend a few bucks a month on the game... no more. END EDIT>

If you've got the stomach for objective based multiplayer deathmatch, you should give this a try. For those familiar with MOBAs the structure of the game will be familiar. But for those that don't know, two teams of 5 try to push across a field to each others base, breaking defensive towers on the way, trying to stay alive and make the enemy die. There are other game modes but they mostly sit as variations on this theme. 

What really sets SMITE apart is the way you control your hero. Rather than the awkward click to move and attack system of other MOBAs you move with WASD, and aim your attacks as you would in a shooter, with your mouse. In SMITE 99% of the attacks are skillshots. Dodging is a real tactic, and you do it by moving, not submitting a request to move via your mouse cursor. There are more than enough characters for you to find several you're excited about playing. The game comes to you in layers, as you become comfortable moving around, aiming, and dodging, you begin to see new opportunities to improve. Whether it's making a smart predictive shot through the wall, or suckering an opponent into attacking you when you have a hidden teamate nearby, you'll start to get hype on smart plays, and you'll feel the pressure of avoiding your opponent's in turn. Integration with curse voice is nice, and even if you don't feel like jumping on the mic, there are shortcut keys to make tons of useful communications. This takes some getting used to but you get fast on it.

The game is at it's best in Conquest(the primary mode), but sadly is plagued by the same problem every other MOBA has. There is one map, with one set of objectives. As far as I know Heroes of the Storm is the only game that has bothered offering some variety in the 5v5 queue. I'd like to see them slow down the release of new heroes a bit, and offer some interesting twists in the 5v5 matches.

There is absolutely no pay to win system, and while there's always a lingering balance issue here or there, it's usually not really gamebreaking, and rarely will be enough to stop the better player from winning. You can unlock all the gods through gameplay, and color swaps for thier default skins. That said, the ultimate god pack, unlocks all the gods, current and future, and I strongly recommend it. It's a good way to support the game and it gives you all the toys to play with in your matches. I paid $40 for it, and I ain't even mad. The rest of the cash shop is premium skins and other vanity items, my only gripe in the cash shop are the ""chests"". These are virtual lottery tickets, the kind so popular in eastern free to play models, and some skins and vanity items are exclusive to these tickets. For me personally paying for a digital item is enough, I don't need to pay for a random digital item.

Pros
+Simple, responsive, movement
+All skillshots, aim and win, miss and lose
+~70 Gods to play, with a good range of abilities,
+Good character balance
+Mostly straightforward cash shop, that doesn't blackmail you with pay to win items, and makes it easy to get ALL the characters
+Robust quick communications system built in.
+Geb

Cons
-One map(in conquest), OVER AND OVER AND OVER...

-Digital lottery tickets<EDIT the cash shop has turned completely to the darkside of FOMO and gambling, while STILL charging for the gods and the voice packs separately this con is a big con>

386360,SMITE®,"I've got a lot of love for this game - I've played this game for about 8 years, and used to play it off Steam prior to it's migration.

If you're considering picking up this game, that's fantastic but beware - there is a learning curve in terms of understanding itemisation, builds and the 100+ playable champions in the game.

Similarly to league, it's not exactly new player friendly. The community has always been, and will be (it's a MOBA, shocker) absolutely appalling. People will shout ridiculous obscenities at you for dying once or blame you for their own mistakes. If you enjoy nothing but toxicity on a near constant, this game is for you.

Another thing to note is the servers - now, on patch day you can kiss any chance of playing a stable game goodbye. Half the day, the servers will be down. For the other half of the day, the servers will be absolutely shocking with ranked modes locked due to potential instability and normal games bugging out. Constant social feature bugs and issues have existed in this game for the 8 years I've played it (way too many to note). Inviting someone to your party to play with them should be trivial, but what ends up happening is if they go AFK after about a minute of you inviting them, they then have to restart the entire game to be able to join your party. Weird right?

Now if you've read this far, you're probably wondering why I've labelled it as recommended.. because when it works it works and I keep coming back to this game time and time again:

- The cash shop is literally aesthetics only, you are at no advantage against anyone for purchasing any 'skins' or anything else.

- The abilities and character versatility makes this game constantly exciting.

- New characters are released every 2 months, and they frequently balance the game (or mess it up, which can also be fun) bringing old characters back into the meta.

- The outplays you can make are SO satisfying... like you can seriously do some mental stuff in this game.

- You can play this on anything... probably even a toaster. It's UE3 and the game is 10 years old.

- There's a VGS system for making calls which you can get voice packs for, and some of the character lines will have you laughing for hours on end.

- There's 5 different modes, and they're all fun in their own way.

If you're considering giving this a go, I say why the hell not? It's free! You might end up finding a new favourite game. And if it's not your cup of tea, what have you lost? I do however highly recommend playing this with friends for a better experience. You can all learn together.

Yours truly,

Someone who's spent way too long playing this game.

552990,World of Warships,"To all the players of World of Warships,

I believe everyone has noticed the recent changes in the in-game economy, whether it's for anniversary celebration,plot battle,random battle,special modes,dockyard,battle pass,sequential bundles or armory. Wargaming is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game ""War Thunder,"" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Wargaming should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Wargaming keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent eighth anniversary is not just a simple anniversary, Wargaming is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.

I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Wargaming has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Wargaming continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Wargaming's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Wargaming.

I hope that each player will save and spread this message. This post will undoubtedly be deleted, but we should copy it, share it, on any platform, anywhere that allows us to make our voices heard. Fellow warriors, let's fight for our future. Stay strong!

552990,World of Warships,"So I went through the effort of downloading and launching this game for 5 minutes just to write this review. So if you are new to the game and genuinely wanting an honest opinion on it, please read my words carefully.

I've been playing this game for a little over a year now on Wargaming's client. 
I have over 2000 battles and 4 tier 10 ships grinded out as well. And am well on my way to more. 

Alright I'll get down to what everyone seems to be clamoring about and try to give an overview on it from the perspective of someone familiar with the system.

Free to Play.

All the skill needed in the game comes from a willingness to learn and the time invested in improving your skill. 
There are players I know personally who are quite good if not better than average without spending a dime. 
Most of the money that gets whaled on the game is spent by naval enthusiasts who just want to collect another historical ship. 

So how does this ingame F2p economy work?
Game progression works where each ingame nation has several tech tree lines to progress through in various classes of ships. Each line is divided into 10 tiers which determine the matchmaking the ship gets as well as it's overall power relative to other ships. 

Each battle you play you will earn credits and exp. The amounts are infulenced by things such as winning or losing. Surviving a battle. As well as individual performance. 
If you do nothing you will earn nothing.
In terms of exp grinding you are about halfway to a tier 10 ship in amount of exp grinded once you own a fully upgraded tier 8 ship.

What can you do with real money?
Well the obvious and most dramatic thing you can do is buy a premium ship. This is something I do not reccommend a new player do for many reasons.
YOU ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Im serious. No new player posesses the skill necessary to pull their weight in a high tier premium ship. You may get away with it with the gimmicky tier 3 and 4 premiums but this is not worth it, since the main perks of premium ships is increased credit and exp income, which at low tiers is moot as you make profit easily.
PLEASE do not buy any premium ships of a tier you have never played before. 
You not only will be disappointed at your results and regret your purchase, but you can and will throw a game if you are high enough tier and do not pull your weight.

The next thing you can buy is doubloons. This premium currency allows you to do multiple things. First it lets you convert exp earned on ships you have grinded past and allows this exp to be spend on other tech trees. Note: you still need to have played the game and have a substantial amount of exp saved in these ships. YOU CANNOT GENERATE EXP OUT OF THIN AIR WITH JUST CASH. Doubloons can also be directly converted into credits. But remember credits are useless without earning exp. Finally doubloons can be used to respec skill points put into your ship's commander, demount a placed upgrade for use in another ship without spending credits and to retrain your commander instantly when placed on a new ship. 

None of these actions are impossible for a ftp player it just takes time or costs an amout of credits. For example if you have a maxed out commander. You can use the excess exp as if it was already converted by doubloons.

RNG elements.
 
Dispersion as your shells leave the barrel is determined by an RNG mechanic. This mechanic is listed in port and the lower the number, the better. The number is basically saying that at your maximum range shells fired have a chance to land anywhere in an oval shaped area with a length of that many meters.
This really isn't that big of a deal at all, unless you are playing low tiered battleships that have ass dispersion by design. 
Real life balistics on this scale of artillery were not laser accurate. They could put a shell where they wanted, mind you, but by no means were they as accurate as tanks or sniper rifles. Simply put, If you know how to aim and are skilled in leading and prediction, you can and will have a few shells hit your target per long range salvo. Medium to ideal engagement ranges, you will see most of your shells hitting. Which is pretty realistic if you ask me.

As for armor and damage, That system is less realistic, but it is more consistent. 
Shells will do the same things under the same circumstances depending on where they hit the ship. 
If armor is too thick and and/or the shell isn't large enough, It will shatter and deal no damage. 
If the shell impacts a certain thickness of armor at an angle, and the shell isn't past a certain size, it will bounce and deal no damage.
If a shell is too large and the armor of a ship is too thin, the shell will over penetrate and not have a chance to detonate it's warhead inside the target for it's regular amount of damage.
Note: The above only applies fully to AP shells, HE shells have their own mechanics, but are even more consistent.
The chance for an HE shell to set fire is also a random % chance as well. But most ships that need to set fires have incredible rates of fire and large shell volume so this isn't too terrible.
Knowing your targets and how your shells interact with them is key to dealing damage. Otherwise you are wasting ordinance on something that isn't effective.

MOBA Elements. 

This game is a MOBA through and through. 
You are on teams, Placed in an enclosed map with key areas that you need to take. 
There is a 2 point capture the flag mode, 
a 3 or 4 point domination mode, 
and ""epicenter"" where you have a large set of cap zones inside one another. Where the deepist zone is worth the most points.

Because it is a MOBA, it is not a sailing simulator. You can and will encounter players at every tier that are playing to win and maintain their stats. Just like any online game, expect some toxic ingame chats if people have slighted each other. It can largely be ignored.

I must stress PLEASE do not go into battle and ruin another players experience by not contributing, refusing teamwork, Teamkilling/damage etc. 

Conclusion

From my experience this game is not near as ruined by being f2p as other games. 
Trust me I've played a few of those. 
Where literally every ingame action has a purchase option. 
Where if your pockets are deep enough, all content is available to you instantly. 
Where power creep runs rampant every month with new mechanics and items.
After having dealt with the worst of the worst of f2p games, this game is absolutely nothing to worry about. 
Yes things will take some extra time and effort than if you invest money in the game, but paying players and free players all have to still grind a significant amount. And no amount of premium ships or economic grinding bonuses will make someone a skilled player.

I reccommend this game if you want/interested in
-Naval history and ships.
-A competitive online MOBA played at a slower pace than most.
-A free to play system that isn't pay to win.
-An absolutley massive learning curve.

552990,World of Warships,"This game is addicting and you live for the highs of the gameplay. But it's also addicting in the sense of a predatory free-to-play game. The expenses of all the paid parts of the game are INSANE, ships going up to £100, premium time, resources, re-allocating points and equipment. You get so wrapped up that you start rationalising spending stupid amounts of money on a single digital ship. Everything in this game is pressuring you to spend money.

DO NOT play this game if you have issues with addiction or impulse control. If you do play this game look into guides on how to play effectively without paying or paying as little as possible.

And none of this is to mention the gameplay experience. When in a vacuum its so enjoyable, but the balance and resultant metas are frustrating and long lasting. That you have to choose between fighting mindless W pressing bots, or island hiding HE spamming snipers.

552990,World of Warships,"I have put 2200+ hours into this game. Unfortunately, I wish I hadn't. At its core, this game is fantastic. The mechanics, ship handling, etc. It's a lot of fun. Learning the ins and outs of ships, how they work, how to play to their strengths and exploit other ships' weaknesses. However, in recent months this game has turned into a downward spiral. The games slowly became less fun and more frustrating, and no, I'm not talking about bad teammates; you'll see those in any game.

I did not whale or spend much money; I was more of a dolphin looking at my spending over 3-4 years. If you are a new player looking in, I implore you to reconsider. The devs only care about one thing, and that's your wallet. They don't care about player opinion, hell they outright deleted the forums, which for one, still deleted dissenting player opinion but was a place with a tight-knit community. They have had a track record of not supporting their content creators, as some were highly critical about where the game was going. They were kicked from their program. Wargaming hates player opinion. It's either their way or the highway, which makes the decision to quit and uninstall easier. This was easily seen with the implementation of subs, players begged WG not to add them, but unfortunately, they were added, and everyone hates them. 

Microtransactions in this game are deplorable. High Tier Premium ships can and will set you back a ton ($50-$100). More than half of them aren't good; many ships aren't that great. WG also takes forever to balance things; if your ship is old, forget it. It's been power crept to hell, most likely, or isn't even playable since its accuracy is downright awful. There were many times that I loved a ship only to realize that in many situations, no matter how good you were, it was just bad, and playing it was frustrating since everything around you was better. I loved the Italian BB ship gimmick and line after playing the CA line. But let me tell you, that line is garbage until you get to the tiers 9 and 10, unlike the CA line. The accuracy on those things hasn't changed since the deadeye removal, and good luck killing a DD! They capped the damage on the shells. I had a moment where I was in the Colombo, and a DD tanked 12 SAP SHELLS!!! WHAT?!? Meanwhile, the CA Italian line shreds them like butter. It may seem I'm ranting, which is partially true, but it's frustrating when game devs don't listen to the player base and constantly lie to them. They even go out of their way to be stingy with rewards (Super containers were nerfed and give nothing now). Even the grind to tier 10 is painful, and I've played Warframe. I Have more fun grinding in that game than in this one. I want to get into many other issues, but this is already a long review, so I'll keep it brief.

Save your money and time. Don't download this game; play something better. The devs don't care about what you think as a player base and only care about how much they can siphon out of you. The game has become frustrating to play with the introduction of subs, and seeing how it's going, it will only get worse from here if the devs don't change their ways. I don't even recommend this game to my friends even though it's my most played game.

552990,World of Warships,"Should start by saying the ""600"" hours logged here is FAR FROM how many hours I have invested in this game. I would assume my actual play time is somewhere between 2,000-3,000 hours in total (Maybe even way more. I could be so far off on this number). I've basically unlocked the majority of T10 ships as well as a good number of freemiums and hell, I've even spent money on the game (though my wallet regrets that.)

So where do I start with this one. 

World of Warships is a game that I think everyone who plays it REALLY wants to love. Let's face it, you are in control of big boats and shooting big guns at other ships. It's a blast and mechanically the game is MOSTLY (Important here) sound. So we'll go through a quick pros and cons.

Pros:
- Art Department. I can't stress this enough. If there is one division of WG that has their stuff together it's these guys. The game looks great and the ships are AWESOME.
- The core gameplay itself. (Assuming you have a team that works together it can be pretty rewarding to set up crossfires, angle your ship correctly, have great brawling drive-bys in battleships. It's a blast when it works.)
- It's not a hard game to pick up and learn the basics. (More to note here)

Cons:
- On the note of it being a easy game to learn the basics. It's a difficult game to master. This results in some VERY poor play at higher tiers where people pay their way to get there. 
- Meta shifts. Currently the game is going through a frustrating shift where stagnant gameplay/static gameplay is becoming more commonplace. HE (High-explosive) shell spam, CV (Carriers), and the upcoming submarines all limit the ability to utilize tactics and work correctly as a team. These three things really damage the core ""tactical"" gameplay that makes the game great. 
- Balancing. Holy hell... You can look this up on the forums and see how brutal this really is. It's a lot to go over and I'm not going to fill this review with it. The balancing is bad and is only set to get worse. (Tip: Look up Carrier Rework, Smolensk, Colbert, Russian Battleships, Russian Heavy Cruisers, Stalingrad, SAP...) Yeah, there is a lot here. Some has been somewhat fixed but a lot is still problematic and this is parasitic mess that isn't being solved faster than it's being expanded.
- Cash Shop. Yeah. ""Free to play game."" But not really. If you play this game without spending money you are in for the grind of your life. It'll be frustrating and at higher tiers you won't break even on credit loss as high-tier ships cost more. Everything costs money - not just a little bit either... Premium time, Ships, Converting XP, Buying Doubloons, Buying Credits, yadayadayada. There is a lot of monetization in this game and it's REALLY important for people to be aware of this before jumping in.
- Probably the BIGGEST con of this game is Wargamings disconnect from the playerbase. This game could be great if WG would sit down and listen to some of the playerbase and actually consider their opinion. Recently they had a QNA on their discord which ended up being more of a ""Ask us questions so we can tell you to piss off."" This, unfortunately, sums up most of the interaction with WG and their staff. It's a dodgy company with horrible public relations.
- A lot of fantasy ships. Some of which aren't what really need to be added to the game. This goes back to balancing and WG's disconnect. (Looking at you USN Split BB's and Smolensk. WG just doesn't want to listen.)
- Competitive is absolutely dead and the rewards aren't worth the pain of taking part. 
- EDIT (Dec 5th 2020) Figured I should add this to the CONS since it's a pretty big deal! Basically this years Christmas Containers (And 2018/2019) have a shortlist of ships you will ALWAYS get. Problem is, WG advertises it as if you can get ANY of the 107 premiums when in actuality you can only get a handful of ships. I'm not going to explain this in detail, instead I insist you go to the forum post below and look this up. It's VERY scummy since this actually takes advantage of people's wallet WHILE being COMPLETE false advertisement.

I'm sure I could add a lot more to these lists. Especially on the cons side. But ultimately what is pushing me from the game is just how disconnected Wargaming is and that's really the core of all the things listed in the CONS. This game could be fantastic and I REALLY want it to be fantastic, but I just don't see that happening with WG at the helm.

552990,World of Warships,"This is a review I did not want to make. For background, I've been silently playing WOWS for around ~2.5 years. While not a pro, I consider myself to be an well above average player that has a fairly deep understanding of the game and where it's at in 2021. I've sunk thousands of hours into this game both for fun and in the competitive scene. While I have no doubt new players may be able to pick up the game and have fun for a while, there are several core systematic issues that make it so I cannot in good faith recommend this game to someone who's looking to play long-term. Here's my thoughts on what the game does good, bad, and the biggest reason why I simply can't recommend it in 2021. 

The Good:
[list]
[*]Art Style is excellent - from the ship models, to the landscape, to the effects it looks great and performs well on many different levels of hardware
[*]Continuous Content - Wargaming has never had an issue expanding content and this game is no different. Ship lines (some historical, most not) are getting released at a very quick pace which is great to combat game fatigue
[*]General mechanics - While not perfect (detonation, overmatch, CV 3D spotting) the game is easy to play at a low level but the mechanics are complex enough that even beta players are still learning every nuance and will be for years to come. 
[*]Rate of progression - I might be in a small camp here, but I actually enjoy the rate of progression. Compared to something like WarThunder (MUCH slower rate of progression), I think they struck a much better balance of grind vs. accomplishment. 
[/list]

The Bad:
[list]
[*]Botched CV Rework - Two years ago a complete reworking of the aircraft carrier class dropped. This rework (testers had told them time and time again it wasn't ready) broke the game for a good ~6 months. While they are more ""balanced"" now, what we are left with is a horrendous excuse for a class that (statistically) has the highest damage, nearly the highest average kills, highest spotting, the by FAR lowest death rate, and the highest impact in the game by far. They are not fun to play, and really not fun to play against. Total and complete failure. 
[*]Poor ship balance (especially on legacy ships) - While they continue to add lines, they continue to ignore player, tester, and community contributor feedback on ship balance. They know it's an issue internally, and the proof is in the pudding. For the last two clan battles they've had 6+ ships so powerful they had to be banned/number restricted. Players have been shouting about these ships for months with no adjustments. There's also legacy ships that have been broken for years and their solution is to simply remove them from sale instead of implementing smart progressive adjustments to existing ships. 
[*]Commander Rework (Also the game direction it signals) - Commanders are of supreme importance in WOWS. With the recent commander rework, they released it in a broken state (surprise) and that led to a complete reinforcement of the ""sniper BB"" meta (dead-eye). Beyond that, they made many nonsensical changes that increase the point cost of vital skills. Commander total points was raised from 19 to 21, which in it's own isn't an issue. The XP required to go from 19-21 is damn near as much as it takes to get from 3-19. This means that the vast majority of the community will not only never have a 21 point commander (further increasing the veteran/new player gap) but it makes it so that few players are acquiring ""elite commander XP"" which can be used to retrain commanders on another ship. They now charge around 500 doubloons (payed currency) for the retraining.
[/list]

The largest and the reason I am writing this review now is the recent change to ""signal flags"". These are special flags that can be applied to a ship before the battle that give straight buffs - not different game-play - just straight buffs. For instance,  ""Juliet Charlie"" provides [b]100%[/b] resistance to detonation (a completely random mechanic that 1 shots your ship), or ""India Delta"" that grants +20% to the amount of HP healed while using repair party. While I think they shouldn't exist in general, I have to note these flag were able to be easily acquired via completely free means of completing missions and reaching achievements in-game like ""First Blood"" (getting the first kill of a game). The last patch, they completely removed the latter possibility. They did so with little to no communication that they would do so (because obvious fear of backlash). The only realistic means to acquire these flags is now to spend currency (doubloons, straight buying them, coal - which you can effectively buy with IRL money). Make no mistake, these flags are not optional. They provide such a utterly massive advantage over others that you are required to run at the very least the core flags to succeed at a high level. The company has made it clear with this decision that they are okay with obvious forms of pay-to-win and will risk the backlash for more profit. The divide between new and veteran players is already so large, and this is truly the nail in the coffin. For this reason, and the others listed I will be parting ways with this game and I hope anyone considering playing this game competitively/long-term will reconsider. In the year 2021 they do not care about preserving game-play, they just want money. Pay up, or watch your ship go up in flames.",background silently wow 2 5 year pro consider average fairly deep understanding 2021 sunk thousand hour fun competitive scene doubt new player able pick fun core systematic issue good faith recommend someone long term thought good bad biggest simply recommend 2021 good art style excellent ship model landscape effect look great performs different level hardware continuous content wargaming issue expanding content different ship line historical released quick pace great combat fatigue general mechanic perfect detonation overmatch cv 3d spotting easy low mechanic complex beta player learning nuance year rate progression small camp enjoy rate progression compared warthunder slower rate progression struck balance grind v accomplishment bad botched cv rework year ago complete reworking aircraft carrier class dropped rework tester told ready broke good 6 month balanced left horrendous excuse class statistically highest damage nearly highest average kill highest spotting far lowest death rate highest impact far fun fun total complete failure poor ship balance especially legacy ship continue add line continue ignore tester community contributor feedback ship balance issue internally proof pudding last clan battle 6 ship powerful banned number restricted player shouting ship month adjustment legacy ship broken year solution simply remove sale implementing smart progressive adjustment existing ship commander rework direction signal commander supreme importance wow recent commander rework released broken state surprise led complete reinforcement sniper bb meta dead eye nonsensical change increase cost vital skill commander total point raised 19 21 issue xp required 19 21 damn near take 3 19 mean vast majority community 21 commander increasing veteran new gap make player acquiring elite commander xp retrain commander ship charge 500 doubloon payed currency retraining largest writing recent signal flag special flag applied ship battle straight buff different straight buff instance juliet charlie provides 100 resistance detonation completely random mechanic 1 shot ship india delta grant 20 hp healed repair party exist general note flag able easily acquired via completely mean completing mission reaching achievement blood kill last patch completely removed latter possibility communication obvious fear backlash realistic mean acquire flag spend currency doubloon straight buying coal effectively irl mistake flag optional provide utterly massive advantage others required core flag succeed high company clear decision okay obvious form pay win risk backlash profit divide new veteran player already large truly nail coffin others listed parting way hope considering competitively long term reconsider 2021 care preserving pay watch ship flame,1,0.993
552990,World of Warships,"I'm going to be honest, multiplayer games are something I steer away from in general, toxic communities and being headshotted by people way better than me are not my idea of fun.

Hello WoWS, tempted in by the loving care given to real historical ships I thought, hell, what's the harm in giving it a go.

100 hours later I'm addicted. The only game I've ever played where I choose full PvP every time. In over 300 battles so far I've yet to see anyone do anything other than take the game seriously and try to help their team, and the rants in the ingame chat are simply non-existent for the most part.

It's also anti-twitch, this is moves played out over minutes not seconds, and the joy of pulling it off, and the slow agony of getting it wrong and knowing you're doomed, all adds to a superb atmosphere.

A special mention too to the way the game opens up modes and sections as you progress through your first hours, never overwhelming, always exciting, and perfectly paced.

Also, loot crates done right imo. You can't buy them, it's not hard to earn at least one per day after 1-2 battles, and in 4 weeks I've had two super containers drop containing real world valuable items.

Finally, no pay to win. Yes, you can pay to advance quicker (premium increasing XP and Credits awarded) but all premium ships come with drawbacks to balance them out (just check the wiki for each). Nothing is a game winner by default, and yes a day one player can buy a high tier ship and jump into 'end game' battles but they won't have fun and they won't do it for long. The road to success, and the fun of the game, is learning to fight effectively through the tiers.

If you acknowledge the learning curve and take the time to learn how to play each class you're interested in at each level, there is a ridiculous amount to do here, with every battle unique, and a ton of campaigns and time limited events to focus on, what's not to love?

552990,World of Warships,"Try it, don't buy.

This is a game that starts simple, with a gentle learning curve and protected matchmaking for new players. It'll be fun. You'll research new ships, unlock missions, join a clan...and then you'll inevitably hit a fun wall. Try being in a match against enemy Aircraft Carriers and having virtually no counter. Try being in a match with a Tier 5 glass cannon Cruiser against veterans in Tier 7 ships that sink you with one salvo. The power difference between tiers is slight to start with, and very wide at the top tiers. And this is a game that wants you to be at the bottom of the food chain, so you'll pay to get to the top faster, or pay for a Premium ship because you think it will help you. It won't.

This is a game that is hard to master (which is good), but driven by marketing decisions and predatory practices (sunk cost fallacy, fear of missing out) that emphasises corporate greed over player enjoyment (this is bad). It was once fairly balanced, with only the United States Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy, and no Aircraft Carriers. But then came German, British, French, Commonwealth, Pan-American, Pan-European, and of course Russian. It's a Russian company, and they swear there is no bias. They try to make all nations have different playstyles (this is good) but as more ships are added the internal balance becomes more ridiculous, so now we have French Destroyers that go over 55 knots, and European torpedoes that travel at over 90 knots!

And the Russians? Well they seem to be blessed by having the most damage resistance, the biggest guns, and fast-turning turrets. We are all waiting Russian Aircraft Carriers to be introduced to see what these apex predators look like. As a general rule, the better a ship was in real life the worse it will be in the game, because reality imposes design compromises that paper ships don't. And this is a company that claim Realism is part of the game DNA. Researchable ships are meant to represent a entire class, but Premium ships are marketed to represent their historical namesake and appeal to collectors. The models can look fantastic, but never forget that gameplay comes first and accuracy takes a back seat. Speed and gun calibre may match, but rudder shift speeds, turning circle, acceleration, turret traverse, velocity, penetration, bursting charges, torpedoes, AA, and most of all concealment are simply a fantasy. Put emotion aside: you're not buying the real ship (and when I say buy I really mean rent).

In the last year and a half the game has changed for the worse. The developers ignore all negative feedback and simply push through on changes that make the game worse. We used to have Aircraft Carriers with strategic gameplay and air supremacy counterplay; now we have a very dumbed down flight simulator for attack planes and no way to counter. We used to have 11 pve Operations rotated weekly; now we have 5, and the rewards have been nerfed. We now have a Research Bureau for an elite of players who have researched 5 ship lines all the way to Tier 10 to get extra goodies; the community protested because it locks away advantages behind a grindwall, and nobody really wanted to regrind entire lines they already spent years on. We are going to get Submarines shortly, to add a fifth matchmaking class; nobody asked for them, but it will help sell new ships so we're getting them and to hell with the gameplay experience. The developers claim that change is needed to avoid stagnation but the community are dropping out from change fatigue. It is no coincidence that the positive reviews you will read are from those with hours played in single or double digits; the negative ones from those with hundreds and thousands of hours played who are passionate about the game and extremely disappointed. But the same people driving these bad decisions are still in their jobs, and the money is flowing in, and that's all they care about. When it comes to the players the developers always choose the path of least generosity, for their virtual (i.e. worthless) stuff, but when players who pay real money for stuff feel cheated they'd rather upset everybody rather than contemplate any compensation. That's who you're dealing with, guys.

FINAL EDIT FOR 2021: I stopped playing for good on 25 December 2020 because of imminent changes that I felt would further ruin the game play experience, e.g. a complete overhaul of captain skills that promised diversity but only cemented a min-max approach for all classes and completely destroying Cruisers as a viable ship in the PVP game. World of Warships is in a very bad place right now, and that's before entirely new mechanics are introduced (Submarines and Aviation Battleships). Avoid, avoid, avoid. Uninstalled with a heavy heart because I loved the game when it was fun (2018 was a great year).",start simple gentle learning curve protected matchmaking new player fun research new ship unlock mission join clan inevitably fun wall enemy aircraft carrier virtually counter tier 5 glass cannon cruiser veteran tier 7 ship sink salvo power difference tier slight wide top tier want bottom food chain pay top faster pay premium ship help hard master good driven marketing decision predatory practice sunk cost fallacy fear missing emphasis corporate greed enjoyment bad fairly balanced united state navy imperial japanese navy aircraft carrier german british french commonwealth pan american pan european course russian russian company swear bias nation different playstyles good ship internal balance ridiculous french destroyer 55 knot european torpedo travel 90 knot russian blessed damage resistance biggest gun fast turning turret waiting russian aircraft carrier introduced apex predator look general rule ship real life worse reality imposes design compromise paper ship company claim realism dna researchable ship meant represent entire class premium ship marketed represent historical namesake appeal collector model look fantastic forget come accuracy take seat speed gun calibre rudder shift speed turning circle acceleration turret traverse velocity penetration bursting charge torpedo aa concealment simply fantasy emotion aside buying real ship rent last half changed worse developer ignore negative feedback simply push change worse aircraft carrier strategic air supremacy counterplay dumbed flight simulator attack plane counter 11 pve operation rotated weekly 5 reward nerfed research bureau elite player researched 5 ship line tier 10 extra goody community protested lock advantage grindwall wanted regrind entire line already spent year submarine shortly add fifth matchmaking class asked help new ship hell developer claim needed avoid stagnation community dropping fatigue coincidence positive review read hour single double digit negative one hundred thousand hour passionate extremely disappointed driving bad decision job flowing care come player developer choose path generosity virtual e worthless stuff player pay real stuff cheated rather upset everybody rather contemplate compensation dealing guy final 2021 stopped good 25 december 2020 imminent change ruin e g complete overhaul captain skill promised diversity cemented min max approach class completely destroying cruiser viable ship pvp world warship bad entirely new mechanic introduced submarine aviation battleship avoid avoid avoid uninstalled heavy heart loved fun 2018 great,1,-0.9705

552990,World of Warships,"I'm very skeptical of most of the reviews of this game as a long time player.

Here is the story of Wold of Warships. There was once a fun naval arcade game where you took pixel boats out and fought each other. It wasn't perfect but it was an enjoyable game. All the 3 main classes (Destroyer, Cruiser, and Battleship) all had their roles, and had a good meta game. Destroyers are the kind of sneaky low HP guys that are fast. Battleships are the big slow brawler type. Cruiser is someplace in the middle. The game was good, all the main classes had strengths and weaknesses. Aircraft carriers (CVs) existed but were difficult to play and largely ignored. 

Then the CV rework happened.

The CV rework changed CVs drastically. We now have units in the game that can sit out of range of anything, with totally different mechanics, that basically just ignore what is going on and impose their will however they want.  You can not defend against the class as anti-aircraft fire is basically worthless. You can't out maneuver a CV because their planes are so much faster and more nimble. You can not outplay a CV player whom is not brain dead, period. The class is so broken if you have anymore than 1 on each side in a game, it simply becomes a nightmare for most of the players. Basically this class doesn't belong in the game, period. Whomever came up with the new CV mechanics is smoking moon rocks. Then rather admit the rework was basically just keep pushing them because failure is not an option. 

This is only one of the major issues with the game. 

On top of this, the game is structured in such a way to cause to frustration either though limited resources or long grinding in order to get you to buy stuff. I'm not really against this part but after you play a while you will realize how much of this game is aimed at whales. There is a non-stop amount of new ships, even though they are broken and not tested half the time, or special events to get players to spend money on top the already aggressive monetization system.

I mean they have events where they release new ships a month before you can get them in the game tech trees to get people to spend virtual money to buy them ahead of time. These ships cost a lot of money. I've watched people spend $150 to get a ship early. There is no bounds to the amount of money you can spend on this game if you want.

I do not care that they want to monetize the game but high level ships you can buy cost $50+, we are talking AAA game cost for 1 ship. There are other special high end ships that require a resource like in XP, where if you where to buy the XP to buy the ship it would cost $300+. Even after buying a ship then the game still screws you, as you need a captain to go along with it. Now if you want your captain to have skills you will either have to play the captain a lot, or spend a bunch of money to level them on your ship you just shelled out for. If you want to level them even faster you can buy flags, and camos that give you more captain XP. They also basically doubled the captain XP cap earlier this year to make it even worse.

I guess my point it it never feels like when I have shelled out money into the game that I can just play the game. I have always felt ""milked"". It feels like it never ends. There are too many ways to shell out for this game.

You're probably saying ""Well Rage, you've played 650 hours how bad can it be?"" Look I've played and had some fun, but overall I've had a lot of not fun watching the game continue to erode what I thought made it great in the past. To be fair it could still be a great game but never will be unless there are leadership changes at Wargaming.

Me recommending this game is like me telling you to get into an abusive relationship, because that is what it is.

I've played this game long enough to know this:

Wargaming does not care about the players. 
Wargaming does not care about balancing the game.
Wargaming does not care about making the game competitive. 
Wargaming does not care about making the game better. 
Wargaming only cares about how much money they can extract from you. Period.

552990,World of Warships,"If you played any other Wargaming multiplayer game you should know already what to expect.

As much as I enjoyed World of Warships for a long time, I cannot in good conscience recommend it. I played way more than the 200-ish hours before (and after) the game went on Steam. Gameplay is fun as soon as you take a couple of hours to understand the mechanics. Graphics are fine, so are the sounds and music.

Here comes the ""but"" - devs are using every single trick in the book to coerce you into paying. The game is addictive in real drug dealer style. At first, up to about tier 5, you get the good stuff. It's easy to earn credits, you unlock new modules and ships every few battles, you feel like you are progressing and making a difference. And when you're hooked, you hit the wall. Game becomes a grindfest. You need to play lower tier battles just to make credits. UNLESS you buy a premium account. Or a premium ship. Or premium camouflages. You have oh so many options. You can also buy lootboxes, err I mean containers. Or skip the middle men and just buy credits outright with real money.

There is a ton of events where you can win premium stuff for free, so that's nice. BUT, expect to get hit with enormous amounts of grind, thats where ""loss aversion marketing"" kicks in. After all you can just pay and get that prem thingie right now. They really outdid temselves in British Destroyers event - you could earn ""guineas"" to get a premium tier 8 british destroyer. You just needed to get 50 guineas, which you could earn at a rate of 4 per week, or buy at I think about 0.75 euro apiece. But here's the catch - you could only earn 48 guineas by playing. If you wanted the ship you had to pay something. And I bet a lot of players didn't read the event announcement (extremely long because the event was complicated like hell) carefully enough to notice that you couldn't earn all the 50 guineas in game.

552990,World of Warships,"Can’t recommend the game under any circumstance.

1. WG is heavily monetizing everything. 
	Monthly sub
	Battle Pass
	Containers (for economic bonuses)
	Premium ships
	Early Access Events
	Dockyard
	Lighthouse
Their main standing is that you don’t “need” any of this, and indeed, you can play the game without paying anything. However, I will say that it becomes excruciating to grind a line. You may even end up in a situation where you are losing more resources than gaining just by playing the game in higher tears.
90% of the game is RNG - from shooting/dispersion, penetration, fire chance, detonation, flooding, matchmaking, and container drops.
In other words - Gambling! (textbook)

Also, you have no channel for feedback except the forums - which is a waste of time. The people that read those are just community managers, which means they acknowledge your option and ignore it.

The reporting system is just there to say “it’s there”. Reports have 0 impacts.
Blacklisting does nothing

Overall it’s obvious that the company identifies what people enjoy doing in the game and then they take it away.



2. Gameplay and Meta: 
Current meta is “Stay at range and farm damage”.
The worst class to play is a BB (Battleship). You are just a pinata for people to farm off you.
Nobody pushes, lately, people don’t even want to go for objectives. (Can’t really blame them)

The main issue with the game meta is CVs and Subs. 
Bad matchmaking forces you to endure 2 CVs in a game - and that is made worse by adding the new Hybrid BBs so - 3 CVs in one game (per-side!). Tones of fun.
Absolutely no counterplay against CVs. T10 Premium CVs are … I don’t even know what to say.
You pay - you win. You need to be mentally challenged to do bad in those.

Subs - Two words  “homing torpedoes”! Because aiming is for losers!
Although, I have to say, that mistakes playing subs do get punished very severely. So to an extent, a counterplay is possible.

Then we come to Super-Ships - no comment here - Just T11 Damage-Piñatas and even stronger CVs (Jet-Plains bby!) - Fun times for T9 players ;)

Regarding the game mode: Random Battle is garbage - but it’s the only way to level.
Ranked is a joke but better than randoms, however, they are level (Tear) locked, so overall not good if you are looking to level.
Other game modes are scarce.
Also, most modes are time locked - which means that if you are an EU person that plays on US servers - you are …out of luck :D


3. Community: 
The stated above only makes the following a logical conclusion. Bad game mechanics on top of the greedy company on top of bad development breeds a toxic community.
After League of Legends, WG’s products (WoTs and WoWs) are probably the games with the most toxic communities. Here, I am not talking about the random burst of frustration that people make when they have a bad streak of games (5 games with double CVs for example) or people with less than 2k games that are struggling to understand and learn the core mechanics of the game - No. The main issue comes with people with 10k or more matches on their belts. With accounts that were made during the beta stages of the game. Those people go the extra mile to constantly stat-shame you and bully you after the match.
I have had very few cases of people actually offering a bit of constructive advice other than just snarly sarcasm when you ask a how-to question in the chat.

I am by no means a “good” player. I am barely hitting average scores, however, I have enough matches on my belt to see the general trend. And let’s face it - you don’t need a degree in rocket-science to see what’s happening.

I can’t recommend this game to anybody. In fact, I strongly recommend deleting it and doing something other with your time. Games are supposed to be fun and even a loss should provide you with the opportunity to learn in order to do better. This game rarely does that.
Even from a money perspective. Even if you have the money to get everything you want, the quality you get for that amount of cash is extremely poor. 
Honestly, if you like warships so much, go buy a scale model and paints, watch a few videos and enjoy the time. You will learn more and have more fun than playing this game. This will make this a lot better financial (and health) choice … and you will have something to show for it ;)

To all of you that are playing this game, just delete it. I know I will.

552990,World of Warships,"***PVE review - because PVP is unbelievably toxic*** I hate this game in its current state... I only play it because there is no other (pve-ish) Capital Ship simulator that I have found.  Wargaming.net purchased my previous PVP & PVE favorite, Fractured Space, and this is what I'm left with.  And Dreadnought is dying the same death.

Inbalance is the name of the game now, the power creep is real.  They seem to only be interested in players spending more actual currency and purchasing ""premium ships.""  They used to be worse than the experience-obtainable tech tree ships, not anymore.  They used to have more than 5 PVE ""Operations"" allowing for fun and rewarding PVE gameplay, now they make random ways to increase difficulty without doing any investment (enemy ships several levels below yours given perfect aim and (ever) increased damage.  And this game has lost the ""Historical"" tag for me, as they have added ships which never sailed and have capabilities unrealistically exceeding those same-level ships that did.  And they cannot decide on a CV mechanic, so they seem to change it once people have become used to the previous one.  And if you want to bypass any challenge and kill-steal your way to the top, just play a ship of the favored nation: the Soviets.

What I like is still there: The ships are beautifully rendered which is great; they obviously have put great investment into that.  There is fun in seeing what-if designs come to life, provided respect is still shone to the older ships.   The challenge of maneuverability and dodging shots from afar through tactical foresight is great.  And the feeling of power when my battleship full-broadside shoots another is lacking in every other game that I have played.

If the devs/Wargaming would invest into what they already have, and put out the old PVE scenarios again, instead of constantly bringing new ships into existence with tactics that make the older ships unable to succeed, I would be happy.  If they would perfect what they have (CVs or Operations for instance) instead of searching for a new power inbalance they can add, it would be better.   And if they would STOP NERFING THE OLDER SHIPS TO PUSH FOR NEWER SHIPS, IT WOULD BE GREAT!!! (German secondary accuracy and British Battleship citadels are things that didn't need to be changed!)

I have played too long in this game and given too much money to them.  I thought my investment was worth something, but apparently there is no respect - only greed.  This makes me sad.  And yearn for another capital ship simulator (on sea or in space) where I can drive my mass of steel into a firefight and wither the enemy (RIP Leviathan).

- 12 v 12, 20 minute, Naval battles. 
- Focus is on either: holding cap points, defending base cap, or full out enemy destruction. 
- 4 classes of ships with different play styles: Carrier (CV), Battleship (BB), Cruiser (CA/CL) and Destroyer (DD)
- Several nations including: American, Brittish, Russian, German, and French.

- The stunning graphics.
- Dynamic and evolving music.
- The satisfaction of nuking an enemy ship.
- 20 minute game times, not having to sit down for hours on end to play one game.
- The diverse range of historically reflective ships available for play.

[b] You won't like: [/b]
- Getting detontated, seriously, wear anti-det flags. 

The idea around this game is super simple, you're in a ship, your objective is to reach 1000 points before the enemy team, but what makes this different from other games is how you go about it. Do you defend your cap, do you attack theirs, or do you chase their DD to the A line (you don't!). While the concept is simple what diversifies this game is the 150+ships available for use (majority of which can be earnt) and the 20+ maps available to play on. Every match you play will be different.

- f2p but p2w, most tech tree (free obtainable by regular grinding) ships are meh or alright at best, some are good and a few are op, butif you want the best ships you´ll have to open up the wallet.

- expect a scandal every few months. What made me write this is the current scandal. Every Christmas, WG (the company) sells santa crates with big stuff in them (even premium ships). This year they just lied to us, saying you could get any premium but in truth only a handful shitty ones. When people complained on their twitch stream WG started to actively sensor them.

- unbalance, and it gets worse. One of the few historically accurate things in this game is that carriers are op as hell. They ain´t fun, you can´t punish them if they screw up and the counterplay is non existent. Many other ships are either useless or super op. There is no change on the horizon.

My advice is to not start or download or whatever. This game is beautiful on the surface and could stay beautiful, but now it is a toxic place.",alright positive ship stunning piece art ship boom big ship boom core easy learn difficult master expect waste 150h properly learning learn armour scheme gun calibre ship overmatch kind armour con community gamedev interaction interaction revolves hey take fun unblanced stfu pay 100 euro scam ship need want arp yamato pay rico look example f2p p2w tech tree obtainable regular grinding ship meh alright best good op butif best ship open wallet expect scandal month write scandal christmas wg company sell santa crate big stuff premium ship lied saying premium truth handful shitty one complained twitch stream wg started actively sensor unbalance get worse historically accurate thing carrier op hell fun punish screw counterplay non existent ship useless super op horizon advice download whatever beautiful surface stay beautiful toxic,1,0.8591
552990,World of Warships,"It used to be good, used to and what a shame.

In the good old days the game revolved around a circle of ships that countered each other, though their were things you could do to ease that. Battleships countered Cruisers, Cruisers countered Destroyers, Destroyers countered Battleships. Aircraft Carriers were introduced, at first with something called the RTS system but that changed to the detriment of the game, because apparently the captain of the Carrier also flys the planes or something, at least that's what Wargaming thinks happens in real life, this was the first worrying sign as now a class of ship was introduced that could effectively counter everything. Its planes can spot, thus rendering DDs pretty useless, however AA on ships was somewhat effective. (that would not remain true)

Wargaming however started getting more and more greedy, they noticed that people who play Carriers tend to be the ones who spend the most money so they can play with their new toys. Thus Wargaming began to focus on appeasing them, introducing more and more overpowered ships. But the balance was still there, sort of.

Fast forward to now. Submarines counter everything, they are fast, have magic homing torpedoes and can outspot anything and tanky to boot. Even Destroyers that are made in real life to counter them just try to avoid them. Wargaming itself in fact stated once they would never introduce Subs as it would break the balance of the game, well, that didn't last.

Wargaming itself has doubled down on its greed, introducing made up ships such as the disgusting ""Hybrid"" ships, because apparently they think people needed more sky cancer flying about.

Matchmaking is in utter disarray. Due to Wargamings obsession on getting new players and selling Tier 10 ships you will find new players at higher tiers, often, one team will be almost entirely new players or bad players whilst the other team is made up almost entirely of seasoned veterans. What follows can only be described as Spec Ops VS a group of blind-deaf children. Most games will be blowouts where you or the enemy will get utterly obliterated, typically the former.

Enjoyment is not a factor in Wargamings decision making process. Doubloons (The premium currency) costs more than Bitcoin it seems and you need a lot of it to get anywhere as well as to do things to reset skills and etc. Oh you can earn it in-game, about 100 every month when you need about 20000 to get a halfway decent ship. Wargaming also does these constant ""Token Events"" where you can get tokens and new ships by completing objectives, sounds fun right? Well, what they don't tell you is you need Doubloons to actually purchase the ships, don't get me started on the Auction House event (99.9% of players need not apply).

Many of the missions are designed to cater to whales who do nothing all day but play and spend money, especially Dockyard missions. They will often require you to do say millions upon millions of damage or earn millions upon millions of Exp, Credits and etc. Its designed to be as long winded as possible, unless you constantly play or of course pay to skip stages, you will not get anywhere close, so for people with jobs and a family, you are done.

Oh, containers that hold Premium Time are activated the moment you unlock them, so you can't hang onto them.

They also have a Battlepass system, there are two tiers, free and Premium, here's the catch. Premium time doesn't give you the Premium pass, nope, spend more money.

I get they want to make money, however the game focuses on pulling in new players whilst older players are left to rot. Many ships are laughably unbalanced and many ships have not been touched in years and are uselessly outdated. Wargaming is focused on introducing as many silly ships as possible, does not make sure they are balanced and then moves onto the next gimmick. If you decide to play Subs and CVs, be prepared to be abused, because people will hate you and they will not support you.

At the moment the game is dominated by Submarines and Carriers, if you want to play a surface ship, you will be at their mercy, just as Wargaming wants. Wargaming does not care, many idea have been put forward to fix this and people have been begging for balancing, Wargamings response to this is ""Oh look! A new shiny ship! Look duckies! :)""

I did enjoy this game when I first started playing, but I can't recommend it in its current state nor would I with Wargamings greed and utter disregard for their player-base.

(Edit) I also suspect Wargaming to use Bots to review their game and praise it, a lot of 1 game accounts just loving Warships. Something is just off and uncanny.

(Another edit, 25/08/2023) I highly implore people to change their reviews to negative, because only then will Wargaming listen, they recently shut down the forums to shut down any criticism of their brain dead decisions. My review still stands though I have now completely stopped playing and there's very little reason now to return due to Wargaming being corrupt.

552990,World of Warships,"Yes the game's free, however update after update the game keeps getting more unbalanced. Adding submarines with homing torpedoes. Such a stupid and frustrating mechanic. Adding so many aircraft carriers and carrier/battleship hybrids that further fill the skies with planes. However no adjustments to the ships' Anti-Air to even the playing field. Every game just having to deal with being always spotted and constantly being shelled from above and below without fair ways to counter them.  

They've removed many of the rewards and progressions that benefit regular players and the game has turned into a massive grind fest. The company added so many layers of pay-to-win or pay-or-waste-your-time to the game and it keeps getting worse every update. 

Player base is pretty demoralized at this point and openly talks about how much Wargaming hates its players. Wargaming, this is your own fault. You put greed and gimmicks over players.",yes keep unbalanced adding submarine homing torpedo stupid frustrating mechanic adding aircraft carrier carrier battleship hybrid fill sky plane adjustment ship anti air field deal spotted constantly shelled fair way counter removed reward progression benefit regular player turned massive grind fest company layer pay win pay waste keep worse base pretty demoralized openly talk wargaming hate player wargaming fault greed gimmick player,0,-0.8126
