1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"This game used to be somewhat good. Gems were obtained fairly and even though there were quite OP boosts in the gem shop, you could've obtained them for free and somewhat quickly.

Time passed and the developer got a lot more arrogant and added predatory monetization practices (very OP boosts either exclusive for real money or for tons of gems) and lootboxes, and started banning users who criticized these practices from his Discord server.

Now, there's a new currency - green gems - which gives you pets with OP stat bonuses and there's no way in the game to obtain them, you have to pay for them with your $$$ to obtain them.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",somewhat good gem obtained fairly op boost gem shop obtained somewhat quickly passed developer arrogant predatory monetization practice op boost exclusive real ton gem lootboxes started banning user criticized practice discord computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player currency green gem give pet op stat bonus no_way obtain pay obtain
1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Sea of Thieves is special because it's the first game that I have played where I had a truly entertaining story to tell my folks after each session.

I could deep dive in all the details that make this game perfect, but I won’t spoil it for you.
What I CAN tell you is that whatever you try to do in this gem of a game, crazy stuff will happen to you: 
Sometimes funny
Sometimes challenging
Sometimes frightening
But also heartwarming

Yes, it’s a sandbox game, and it will mostly be about what you make out of it; but if you pour in enough hours to go through all the quests and stories it has to offer, you will discover something magical in the end; and that something is that SoT is not exactly about plundering.

It's about building friendships, defying the odds, playing bold and experimenting.

It taught me to charge towards the unknown, to try new things, to take my time, to stay composed through fire and flames,  to interact with strangers, to lose (and win) gracefully and heck… even to enjoy defeats. 

With all this, for the first time of my life, I play a game because it feels good in a meaningful way; it keeps on giving.

A year has now passed since I shared my first incredible tale with my family and recently, my 7yo son finally asked to join me! We now sail and live new adventures together every Saturday morning. I cherish these moments with all my heart as we bond together more than ever.

In Sea of Thieves all are equal, and in these crazy days we live in as an increasingly divided society, the community feels like a safe haven to me. This game is a ray of sunshine to me and will probably be for many years to come.

Thank you Rare <3","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",special truly entertaining folk session deep dive detail perfect spoil whatever gem crazy stuff happen funny challenging frightening heartwarming yes sandbox mostly pour hour quest story offer discover magical sot not_exactly plundering building friendship defying odds bold experimenting taught charge towards unknown thing stay composed fire flame interact stranger lose win gracefully heck enjoy defeat life play feel good meaningful keep giving passed shared incredible tale family recently 7yo son finally asked join sail live adventure saturday morning cherish moment heart bond equal crazy day live increasingly divided society community feel safe ray sunshine probably year rare 3

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"One of the better MMO's on the market right now. I will keep this simple, I won't waste your time as everyone has different tastes with MMO's and there is alot of debate on whether ESO is a good game or not within the MMO community. I will simply go over pro's/con's.

The Good:

- HUGE open-world to explore and lots of open-world content such as quests, delves (mini-dungeons), public dungeons, bosses, treasure chests, materials to farm, etc. 

-No Pay2win

- Alot of customization, but I will explain this further, later in the review.

- The combat is a bit mixed. Some classes/weapons are more fun and versatile than others, but this is entirely dependent on the player's preference. The only true problem with combat is the absolute necessity to weave your light-attacks in-between your skills. Alot of players don't like the idea of animation canceling being required for good damage in end-game content. With this in mind however, I find the combat fun regardless.

- Making big money/gold isn't hard, it's just time consuming when you're a newbie. Don't worry about this too much until you're max level.

- Leveling is fairly easy, if you're into that.

- This game has enough lore to fill up 60,000 books worth.

The Meh:

- There is a lot of DLC. This game has been out for a long while, and the dev's monetize this game via DLC. The base game is big, but the collection of DLC's are bigger. More fun content is nice, but it can be expensive if you want all of it. Optionally you can buy a subscription for ESO+ which gives you access to ALL DLC in the game except the newest expansion at that current time.

The Bad: 

-A lot of the customization is locked behind a paywall that is the Crown Store, and a lot of the motif (armor/weapon style) pages are locked behind RNG and/or pricey purchases with in-game gold. This becomes a lot easier to handle as you play longer.

- The community is very helpful most times, but you're going to get some assholes who can ruin an experience such as trial (raid) leaders who disband a party of players because they are salty over something, thus wasting everyone's time. Zone chat can be silly-fun but again there is some weirdo's who can be off-putting. There is also PvP players and PvE try-hard's who can be nasty as well. This is just gaming community in general though. 

- The lack of tutorials are off-putting. Expect to have a lot of questions as you play.

- You WILL need guide's to understand end-game content (veteran trials/dungeons). You can try to wing it, but expect a lot of failure unless you get carried by your party-members. 

- Half of your performance as a player will depend on your build, meaning your armor/weapon set and your class skills. If you just slap on anything you feel like and then attempt harder content, chances are you will fail. There must be some sort of value in what you build. 

Overall, I love this MMO despite it's flaws, I give it a solid 8/10 at the moment.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",massively multiplayer market simple waste different taste massively multiplayer alot debate eso good not_within massively multiplayer community simply highly skilled experienced con good huge open world explore lot open world quest delf mini dungeon public dungeon boss treasure chest material farm no_pay2win alot customization explain combat bit mixed class weapon fun versatile others entirely dependent preference problem combat absolute necessity weave light attack skill alot player idea animation canceling required good damage mind combat fun big gold hard consuming newbie worry max level_emphasizeding fairly easy lore fill 60 000 book worth meh downloadable additional released initial launch long monetize via downloadable additional released initial launch base big collection downloadable additional released initial launch bigger fun nice expensive optionally subscription eso give access downloadable additional released initial launch except newest major addition add feature mechanic bad customization locked paywall crown motif armor weapon style page locked rng pricey purchase gold easier handle play longer community helpful time asshole ruin trial large group player tackling difficult challenge leader disband party player salty wasting zone chat silly fun weirdo putting versus player_emphasizeds versus environment hard nasty gaming community general lack tutorial putting expect question play guide understand veteran trial dungeon wing expect failure unless carried party member half performance depend build meaning armor weapon set class skill slap attempt harder chance fail sort value build love massively multiplayer despite flaw solid 8 10 moment

899770,Last Epoch,"[spoiler]This game will be among the top ARPGs soon.[/spoiler]

[b]Classes & Skills[/b]
This game is a classic top down ARPG based around 5 different classes. Each of them can specialize into 3 different mastery-classes later, that define your gameplay further. In addition to that, the skills you gain while leveling the first few levels and later through the passive talent trees, can be modified in a unique node based system, which can alter the skills completly. Your lame starter fireball can be modded into a channeled fireball ""flamethrower"" or for high single volley damage for example. You can respec your passive skills in town for a gold fee and you can respec your skills in the UI but you will need to relevel (exp farm) the skills back to maximum again (its not as bad as it sounds, especially in endgame).

[b]Movement & Combat[/b]
The movement and combat in this game is fluent as f*ck. There is no delay and the game feels really responsive. When i returned to play some Path of Exile I was shocked how clunky it felt compared to LE. Imho the spell effects are a bit overtuned sometimes but that might be adressed in later patches. The mobs you are fighting can be a bit tougher compared to PoE's I would say, even normal mobs have unique attacks you need to dodge (later in the game, the beginning is really easy).

[b]Loot[/b]
The loot in this game is plenty and there are various rarities, including unique and set items that allow for specific character builds. There is an ingame lootfilter that you can use to easily customize for yourself or import filters from someone else.

[b]Crafting[/b]
The crafting in this game is amazing. Your items have up to 4 different affixes. In the world you can find shards with different properties that can be crafted into your items anywhere at any point. Each Affix has a tier limit of 5 while crafting but in the world you can find items that have affixes of tier 6 or tier 7 on them. When crafting you choose your desired affix and are shown a chance of success for crafting. Beware, while crafting and altering an item you make it more and more unstable and it can break in different ways, either making it completly useless, lose some stats or just make it so that you can't craft further on it, but you can use it, as is. You can also find other crafting items that allow additional options for crafting like extracting shards from items or increasing your chance of successful upgrades. While your items can break, there is also a chance for a critical succes which gives you additional levels for your affixes.

[b]Story[/b]
The Story is about timetraveling and different timelines which is an interesting premise. While the premise is interesting the story is not super exciting to me, but not without its highlights either. All in all i would say it does its job and is perfectly fine for an ARPG.

[b]Graphics & Sound[/b]
The graphics are beautiful imho and its really cool to discover the huge variety of zones in different epochs through timetravel. The Music is calm and often a bit melancholic but thats what i really like about it. You feel immersed in the world and its not artificially hyping you up, it just fits and gives me a mysterious vibe.

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
The Multiplayer is not yet released but from what i gathered they are hard at work and internally testing it already. What i want to say though is, that the multiplayer has HUGE potential in this game. Because its not as fast as PoE and even has an Arena/Wave-Survival mode, i think it will be very fun to play in a group and unlike PoE there won't be someone clearing the whole map before you even got in melee range of the first mob you saw. The Arena mode will give opportunities to create specific group setups/builds with healing and tanking in mind to conquer as much waves as possible. And there is already a ladder system ingame for you to compete in!


[b]Conclusion[/b]
With almost 2000 hours of PoE i can say that this game will be serious competition for the other ARPGs out there soon. And for an early access title this game offers alot of content already. Some class masteries and skill specializations are not out yet, but there is already so much, that it doesn't really hurt. The devs are really open to discuss problems and feedback with their community. [b]Buy this game and support these awesome indie devs![/b]

I always saw people complain about those same issues in past Maddens but never had any troubles, but this year just randomly on some plays it'll come to a crawl and it'll stay like that until suddenly the play is over and it's full speed again. Menus are worse than the last few years in that they're even slower than usual, which they were already about as bad as it gets for menu speed. 

Anyways, the game is actually a pretty big improvement on the last few years WHEN it wants to work right.

It is very simple to get into and offers a very deep dive into min maxing the shit out of your character.
You can play it casually and enjoy most of the game with ease or you can go hard and dominate every enemy in this game.
If you are a fan of action rpg's or beat'em ups, this is right up your alley.
Story was just long enough for me not to get bored by it and people complaining about localization or shallow story really need to think about how much else this game offers and that in comparison, those points mentioned don't even matter or are bad, they are coping hard. 
The biggest downside of this game is probably its auto-camera (turn it off) and it's lock-on (its very inaccurate on what you actually want it to do versus what it does).
Another downside is that if you use a Dualshock 5 controller (PS5) on PC and you tab out often from the game, your controller will eventually not respond ingame anymore or have delayed response. The only fix for this is to close the game and steam and then restart the game. Very annoying if you are a multitasker. 

Game gets a 10/10 regardless of the cons.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"Baldur's Gate 3 & Divinity Original Sin have proven to me that Larian Studios can make one hell of an RPG. Baldur's Gate 3's early access is very promising, making me ambitious for the games full release. As of right now only the first act of the game is available with most of the gameplay mechanics already implemented, as to be expected the game has a few bugs but nothing game breaking, certainly nothing that will put you off while playing.

Larian has added a table-top game element with a lot of your actions being controlled by the roll of a dice, for example while conversing with an NPC you could be given the option to persuade said NPC to give you more information on your current objective, once this is initiated a dice will appear on screen with a number on it, rolling below this number will fail the persuasion attempt however rolling the exact same number or above will result in a successful persuasion attempt. This mechanic is exceedingly enjoyable since it adds a layer of unpredictably to the outcome of situations.

All of the companions are well written and unique, you are thrown into a party of complete strangers all of which do not trust each other. There is a heavy tension between you and your group as you try to figure out what has happened and survive. If you gain the trust of your companions you can build friendships and eventually romance them.

Baldur's Gate 3 Early Access already has a lot of replay value, there are tons of paths you can take to complete the first act of the game. I'm certain you will miss a lot of side quests and secrets on your first playthrough. Larian has confirmed that the game will have 3 acts in total when it officially releases, they have not confirmed a release date for the game, stating that ""It'll be ready when it's ready"" in the meantime they intend on adding more playable races and classes to the game. Overall I'm very excited to see where Baldur's Gate 3 goes from here, and I have faith that Larian will do the game justice.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 505,051 user reviews for this game are positive.",baldur divinity original sin proven larian studio hell role baldur player purchase play official release promising ambitious game release act available mechanic already implemented expected bug breaking certainly larian table top element action controlled roll dice example conversing non controlled artificial given persuade non controlled artificial information objective initiated dice appear screen number rolling number fail persuasion attempt rolling exact number result successful persuasion attempt mechanic exceedingly enjoyable add layer unpredictably outcome situation companion written unique thrown party complete stranger not_trust heavy tension group figure happened survive gain trust companion build friendship eventually romance baldur player purchase play official release already replay value ton path complete act certain miss side quest secret playthrough larian confirmed act total officially release not_confirmed release stating ready ready meantime intend adding playable race class excited baldur go faith larian justice

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Hello Friends, 

Today i wish to review the game Assasins Creed Valhalla. This is technically my first playthrough with a newer Assasin Creed game. I have personally played earlier ones, but not in this new format that is open world version. It was very fun to play for me personally. Although this game sufferes from some issues, some big and low, but if you can survive thru them, you may enjoy the game. Following is a list of all bugs i have encountered in my playthough of this game:

#1. Constant crashing all the time in this game. This causes alot of problems. There is a workaround i used to temporarily fix it was to delete shader cache everytime i started new playing of game, file cache deleted everytime i started the game, set fps to 60 FPS in the game, and that did the trick. It is not a permanent fix as there is none. SO BE WARNED, the game will crash most likely.

#2. Many bugs, including armour bugs that switch in cutscenes, clipping issues with many armours, issues with the ending swithing character types in the scenes, and many smaller bugs.

Due to the above bugs, this will put off many purchasers of this game. Many people also do not like the steam version as it is required to download ubisoft connect to even play the games thru steam. This also is why there are no achievements on steam. Personally, getting acheivements do not bother me. 

So as for the game itself, It follows the adventures of the viking Eivor and how he conqueres England. There are many twists and turns in the story, and some choices can change how the ending is. Depending also how you act too in the game can change the ending. The game has so many quests and side quests, if you want to finish it, it will take you quite awhile, especially if a player takes their time to finish all of them. This is what i did and why my playtime is so high. Anyways, here is the PRO/CON list:

PROS:

- A viking saga set in the dark ages of history.
- Many side quests and lots of main quest storyline to finish.
- Beautliful world locations and great music.
- Nice voice acting for many of the characters.


CONS:

- Major crashing bugs that effect the game. At this time, no permanent fixes will completly fixes this issue.
- Many small minor bugs including swapped characters in scenes, clipping issues, and issues with maps and environment.
- The ubisoft connect store that has many microtransactions to force people to buy their special money version to buy items in the game. The opal store in the game helps a bit with buying stuff for free in the game, but you still need to hunt down opals to buy most of the stuff.


So do i recomment this game? Personally, i would rate it as neutral, as it has it's good points and bad points. The crashing is a very bad turnoff of the game. BE AWARE IF YOU DO WANT TO BUY THIS, YOU WILL CRASH WHETHER USING A NVIDIA OR AMD GRAPHICS CARD. Personally, when the game worked, i enjoyed it. I do recommend it, but only if you can ignore the constant crashing, the minor switching bugs in some scenes, and clipping issues. Otherwise, avoid this game with a 100 foot pole.","Mostly Positive71% of the 17,395 user reviews for this game are positive.",hello friend today wish assasins technically playthrough newer assasin personally earlier one not_in format open world version fun play personally sufferes issue big low survive thru enjoy following bug encountered playthough 1 constant crashing cause alot problem workaround temporarily fix delete shader cache everytime started file cache deleted everytime started set shooter 60 shooter trick not_a permanent fix warned crash 2 bug including armour bug switch cutscenes clipping issue armour issue ending swithing type scene smaller bug due bug purchaser not_like version required download connect play game thru no_achievements personally acheivements not_bother follows adventure viking eivor conqueres england twist turn choice ending depending act ending quest side quest finish it_emphasized awhile especially take finish playtime high anyways highly skilled experienced con pro viking saga set dark age history side quest lot task objective given non storyline finish beautliful world location great music nice voice acting character con major crashing bug effect no_permanent fix completly fix issue small minor bug including swapped character scene clipping issue issue map environment connect microtransactions force special version item opal help bit buying stuff hunt opal stuff recomment personally rate neutral good point bad point crashing bad turnoff aware crash nvidia amd graphic card personally worked enjoyed recommend ignore constant crashing minor switching bug scene clipping issue avoid 100 foot pole

311210,Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"If you buy this game for anything other than Zombies, you're doing it wrong.

Campaign isn't that good and Multiplayer is completely dead (I can't find a single game), so your only real option here is Zombies. But, I'd say that makes up for everything else because Black Ops III Zombies is outstanding.

The map you get by default, Shadows of Evil, is amazing. It has so much depth but even as a newer player, you don't need to know how to do everything to have a fun time with the map. If you want to spend some extra cash for the DLCs, I'm very confident that they're all worth it except for Zetsubou No Shima. It's just a very tedious map and it's the worst one of the bunch.

However, every other map is totally worth picking up. Definitely recommend this game to any Zombies player who hasn't played it yet.","Very Positive87% of the 118,545 user reviews for this game are positive.",zombie wrong series connected mission level form storyline t_emphasizedhat good mode multiple player interact compete real completely dead single real zombie make else zombie outstanding default shadow evil amazing depth newer fun spend extra cash dlcs confident worth except zetsubou no_shima tedious worst bunch totally worth picking definitely recommend zombie

230410,Warframe,"Fifty hours in and I've yet to encounter any elements of pay to win. Beyond speeding up timers or unlocking characters or cosmetic fashion(frame) items there is absolutely no need to pay to ""advance"" the game.

Lots of the mission types are skill based in any case, so no amount of platinum (in game currency) will buy you success.

The game itself is a extremely solid third person shooter. Satisfying. Very. Think destiny with more stuff to do.

Community is absolutely ace too. Vets will actively join you to help you get what you need. And you'll need a lot. Metric ton of blueprints and weapons to try out. 

Also, I have no idea just how many characters there are. I thought street fighter had a large roster! Blown away by how much content is in a free game. The gameplay loop will ultimately be what keeps you playing.

PS the developers have a rather good pedigree too :-)","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Sea of Thieves is a game with a long history of ups and downs,
that have shaped what has now become one of my favorite games of all time.

It's hard to pinpoint what exactly went wrong during the 4 years before the closed beta started,
but to say that, what would eventually be released to the public at a full price, 
would shape the reputation of the game for years to come is an understatement.

Despite all efforts, Rare has been continually fighting the sour preconceived notion
from consumers that have grown cynical from years of being burned by corporate business 
not unlike the initial release of SoT. I'd say that mindset is more than justified.

I believe this game is a massive outlier when it comes to genuine ethical backtracking 
in terms of ongoing work retroactively fixing the game.

Over the past 2 years SoT has recieved close to the most free updates and hard labor of love 
I've ever seen put into a game that never needed it to bring the money in.
Many would say that sort of description already fits games like No Man's Sky, 
but its approach to it and the design decisions are what makes Sea of Thieves stand out.

Unlike NMS, progression in SoT isn't vertical, but horizontal. 
Meaning all of its mechanics can be experienced in the first hour of play 
and will not differ from someone like me, who has played it for over 1000 hours 
on the M$ Store version. 

While this means overall incentive is that not unlike your high score in an arcade game,
if you actually view the game as what is essentially an open world, 
per session arcade experience, the genius behind this design starts making sense.

Every single update the game has received doesn't suffer from the growing pains of any service game that relies on conventional progression systems.
If Rare decides to add a literal grappling hook mechanic to the game 
that lets you hook onto rocks and pull off drift maneuvers, 
you will get to experience that mechanic the moment you log in. 

This is where that approach really shines.

New mechanics aren't just one and done features, every single one of these now gets to be designed to enrich the gameplay loop itself, meaning the developers have full freedom to find all kinds of secondary and primary uses for just a single mechanic.

For example: 

The rowboat was advertised alongside the volcano region in the game, 
but it's not just a tool to savely park your ship away from erupting volcanos.

- Rowboats can be used as a stealth item that lets you hide your ship 
and silently sneak up to another crew to steal all their belongings. 

- If an island holds many treasures, a rowboat is usually the fastest way to gather it all up and bring it back to your ship if you're in a hurry, which you WILL be.

- If your ship sinks, your rowboat remains and you get a second chance to secure your efforts.

- Rowboats also include their own storage space and as of recently are a very reliable source of supplies if you find them on islands. Effectively cutting supply gathering time in half.

This doesn't even touch on how new features retroactively add to previous mechanics as well.
For example, the aforementioned harpoon can be found on certain rowboats as well which, 
if you have it docked on your ship, allows for an entirely new grappling angle.

So yes, Sea of Thieves is a service game. 
As such it has benefited from new content stacked on top of the already existing structure.
Thankfully that structure is incredibly flat and wide, meaning climbing that structure 
to reach said features is non-existent.

This unfortunately means what was already there could hardly be fixed without entirely redesigning the whole structure which has NOT happened. It's still the same game but with most of its holes and gaps being closed up by genuinely great mechanics and content.

Yes, if you played Sea of Thieves on release 
and disliked the ""go from point A to point B, back to A then repeat"" experience,
that has largely been unchanged and the occasional dead air, while now being shorter than ever, will probably still bore you as much as before. 

However when that dead air is gone, you will experience many many more interesting and fun
scenarios with an incredible amount of tools and ways in how you deal with those situations.

The point of this review isn't to just list all the positives and negatives, 
after all you will find plenty of those already, but to explain why people who have stuck with the game all this time consider the new additions it has received to be much more valuable than they might look to someone who's never played it.

Sea of Thieves has proven to not only be one of the most unique 
and fun coop experiences I've ever played, it reminds me of a time 
when Rare took a formula, injected as much of their own personality and charm as they could
and also manage to introduce an incredibly polished and innovative title 
that stands on its own merit... It just took as long as a Steam release to make that happen.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",long history ups down shaped favorite game hard pinpoint exactly wrong 4 year closed pre release version available testing started eventually released public price shape reputation year understatement despite effort rare continually fighting sour preconceived notion consumer grown cynical year burned corporate business not_unlike initial release sot mindset justified believe massive outlier come genuine ethical backtracking term ongoing retroactively fixing past 2 year sot recieved close update hard labor love never_needed bring sort description already fit game no_man s_emphasizedky approach design decision make stand unlike nm progression sot vertical horizontal meaning mechanic experienced play not_differ someone 1000 hour version mean incentive not_unlike high score arcade view essentially open world per session arcade genius design start sense single received suffer growing pain service relies conventional progression system rare decides add literal grappling hook mechanic let hook onto rock pull maneuver mechanic moment log approach shine mechanic feature single get designed enrich loop meaning developer freedom kind secondary primary us single mechanic example rowboat advertised alongside volcano region not_just tool savely park ship erupting volcano rowboat stealth let hide ship silently sneak crew steal belonging hold treasure rowboat usually fastest gather bring ship hurry ship sink rowboat remains chance secure effort rowboat include storage space recently reliable source supply island effectively cutting supply gathering half touch feature retroactively add mechanic example aforementioned harpoon found certain rowboat docked ship allows entirely grappling angle yes service benefited stacked top already existing structure thankfully structure incredibly flat wide meaning climbing structure reach feature non existent unfortunately mean already hardly fixed entirely redesigning structure not_happened s_emphasizedtill hole gap closed genuinely great mechanic yes release disliked b_emphasizedack repeat largely unchanged occasional dead air shorter probably bore dead air many_emphasized interesting fun scenario incredible tool way deal situation t_emphasizedo positive negative plenty already explain stuck consider addition received valuable someone never_played proven not_only unique fun coop experience reminds rare took formula injected personality charm manage introduce incredibly polished innovative title stand merit took long release happen

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"Ever wondered how Sousuke Sagara pulled out those sick moves in Full Metal Panic? Do you like mech games, perhaps even fan of the Armored Core series? Maybe destruction is your middle name?!  Do yourself a favour then, go ahead and buy this game. You'll love it, guaranteed.

The game will probably kick your arse a few times, it kicked mine too, not gonna lie. Stick with it, learn, adapt and eventually you'll overcome every challenge thrown at you. Of course beating everything isn't easy without proper equipment, thankfully the game has a really good customisation system, so you can pretty much build a meka that would make even D.va have the hots for you. And, oh boy, you'll need a good mech, because the game won't hold your hand in combat for too long. It will tell you the basics and throws you right into deep water.

Sink or swim is the name of the game here, just like in the Souls series. The combat is unforgiving, finger-breaking levels of hard ,but weirdly satisfying. Once you learn the ropes and unlock some more parts for your mech, it will get a bit easier, but this game is no push-over. If you've played the older AC games, I'd say it feels like a mix of AC3 and 4 with a few additions. You have medpacks, auto targeting, sekiro like guard break/poise system in the mix. It's fast,responsive and feels unique in a way.

The storyline is alright, it serves its purpose and has multiple branching paths and endings. There are a few cutscenes, most of the story is being told in mission briefings, old school style. Also it has more treachery than your average 300 episode telenovella from around 2000.

Graphics wise there is nothing to be said, it looks good. The port is actually really well made, this thing can pretty much run on a toaster.  Maps are mixed, some look really badass, others are bland and uninspired.

Sounds design is also excellent, the only issue here is with the music. It has a few good tracks, but most of the ost is forgettable. I mean c'mon guys, the older games had banger soundtracks :(

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"Studios ethics 10/10
Gameplay 10/10
Story 10/10

Baldurs gate 3 is what modern western Devs hate. A quality title packed to the brim with unique content. Modern Devs say themselves that providing too much quality and content is apparently bad, as it sets standards that are ""hard"".  Most devs prefer to create absolute trash that's half working and packed with micro transactions. It's so refreshing to have another studio along side Fromsoft that actually cares about the consumer. 

This game is loving crafted with nothing but the player in mind, hundreds of hours await you in this detailed, deep and beautifully crafted RPG. Just like Elden ring set the new standard for open world  action RPGs, Baldur Gate 3 has just set the new standard for turn based RPGS. 
 
The choice of engine for the game perfectly fits the D&D feel as it allows you to approach encounters in creative ways that non pen-and-paper RPGs normally wouldn't allow.  Most of what makes Dungeons & Dragons fun is the freedom you have in how to navigate the situations you find yourself in, and I find the heavily updated Divinity engine is as close as you're going to get to that in a video game.  Having one character throw a nearby barrel of water at a group of enemies and then casting an ice spell on the puddle with your wizard, causing all the enemies to slip on the now frozen ground making them ""prone"" and open to more successful attacks... this is the kind of creative gameplay that usually is only found around a table with a group of friends and a Dungeon Master. 

Get this game, support the new (actually old) standards, accept nothing less and watch these Devs squirm.

[h1]The Guide[/h1]
Soo, due to the steam restriction on the character limit for reviews, I will be putting the following points into a Guide:
[list]
[*] Free to play - why this game has a great monetization model and you don't have to worry about being ripped off.
[*]The Story - yes this game has a story, one which will entertain you for quite some time, combined with all the 'character quests'
[*]The Star Chart - or The World of this game and what to expect of it
[*]The Factions - and the characters which inhibit this galaxy
[*]The Gameplay - which is obviously the most important part here and reasons you will sink hours on hours of your life into this game
[*]The Visuals - the beauty this work of art is
[*]The Sound - and how far you can take it
[/list]
If that is too much reading for you, go ahead and finish this off with my personal verdict and then form your own opinion.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1409926603

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
If you get through the harsh beginning, where you will lack a guiding hand this game will suck you in.
Once the game catches you into its flow of daily activities like the login reward and the sorties - 3 mission endgame action - and keeps you there with hourly temptations like alerts and new void rifts, you will become lost in space and time will just fly by.
Warframe is not without flaws, but it is steadily being worked on and being improved, the devs neither lack creativity nor daring, to try new things.
Although it's easy to forget - this game doesn't cost you any cash, so just give it some time and see what it can give you back.

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is an MMO game base on the series with the same name. It features elements from all the entries and creates a huge world filled with lots of things to do. What set it apart from other MMO’s is that it looks visually appealing, that its system is easy to learn but hard to master and that it has a lot of versatility when it comes to its players. It is a fluid system with a good amount of room to explore and take it easy.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The gameplay features common elements of what an MMO would have. Players do quests in order to gain exp and level up, once they do they are able to queue up for dungeons, trials(bosses) and raids which they can battle together with friends or with other players through the party finder, which works like a charm.

Each player is required to choose a class, then at lv 30, that class will become a job. Job is a more specialized class. Depending on the class the player chooses, gameplay will vary and while it would be impossible to mention all of them in a review, I will give some examples. Classes are divided into three roles:

[h1] Healers [/h1]

Their job is to keep their fellow peers alive through the art of healing. They can range from the classic white mage with lots of healing spells, to a more offensive approach with the scholar who has damaging spells. Players can also opt to get a mix of both with astrologian, which depends on the high skill of the player and some RGN but features the higher arrange of abilities.

[h1] DPS (Damage dealers) [/h1]

They are the ones who kill the monsters. DPS is the role with more classes in the game and they feature different types of jobs such as black mages, which enjoy lots of damaging spells but lack utility, to bards who can buff their whole party with beneficial effects while keeping up damage or ninjas, who mix different kinds of abilities to generate powerful ninjutsu.

[h1] Tanks [/h1]

The heart of the party, they always must protect their fragile party members and be the shield that guards the realm of men. Like their description says, they keep everyone out of harm's way by provoking monster, rushing to deploy barriers or just being a pain for bosses to get rid of in general. Tanks will redirect all the damage towards them so that the healers and dps’s can do their jobs without preoccupying about dying.


Is the mix of all these roles that create a functioning party, and with the finder, you are always guaranteed to get a good balance of all of them. Each of these roles is equally important as they are pieces of a greater whole. The healers keep everyone alive, the DPS kills the enemies and the tanks keep the other two out of harm's way. No matter which role you choose, you will always be important for your party.

Speaking of side activities, there is another type of roles I haven’t mentioned yet. These are the disciples of the hand and the disciples of the hand. In these fields, players can find classes ranging from blacksmiths to fishermen or even culinarian! These jobs tend to break the normal pace of the game and offer a more relaxing environment. They might sound boring at first, but players often find themselves lost in them for hours. Once you get going, you just want to do more, and they are beneficial to yourself and your other classes.

If you are a culinarian, for example, you can make your own food which allows you to get bonus exp modifiers. If you are a blacksmith or an armorer, you can craft your own weapons and armors to use in your other classes. If you are a fisherman, you can sell the fish for lots of money on the player market and well, who doesn’t love fishing in a game?

[h1] Story [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a game that takes its story very personal and treats it with the utmost care. It does start pretty boring and dull but catches up fast and it can feel like watching a series or a movie. The richest stories are in the expansions, unfortunately, but these are quite enjoyable, filled with lots of believable characters, conflicts, development and more.

 Reading all of it or catching up to the latest expansions can be quite daunting, so if you are not into spending a lot of time reading/watching cutscenes, you can always skip them and rewatch them later at an inn’s room. There are also plenty of summaries only that are well written and consist of thirty to an hour reading material per expansion (game+2 expansions= 3 hours of reading total) so feel free to skip it if you do find it boring or exhausting to sit through. Do however note that the story is one of the strongest points of the game.

[h1] Some Notes [/h1]

The game runs well on any system that meets the requirements. Some areas might decrease your fps depending on your settings and the sheer amount of player characters that are present in the zone but fret not, this is not a big issue by any means. Duties can be bothersome when you are at a party with friends but are overall enjoyable. Probably the easiest MMO to get into has a UI that the player can adjust to fit their playstyle or needs and the game lacks any sort of pay to win or in-game advantage bought with real money, only shortcuts for those that simply don’t have a lot of time.

[h1] What Makes It Special [/h1]

What makes Final Fantasy XIV special is that it is well balanced when it comes to all the classes and jobs. That it looks more realistic when compared to its peers and that it features a dynamic, fluent system with that is easy to use but hard to master. By sharing all classes across one character, the player will never need to go back to the start of the game in they decide that maybe that class they picked, in the beginning, wasn’t the one for them. 

The game makes an effort to make fights different from one another. Players can find themselves fighting in Rubik's cube, getting devours by a Cerberus and fighting the beast from its stomach or even getting split from their bodies and have to move across a labyrinth of AOE’s in order to go back into them and continue the fight. There is always something new in waiting for the player in the next encounter. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a fantastic MMO, it is filled with great amounts of content and different ice breakers to teach new players how to play and hold their hands until they can go by themselves into the wild worlds of Eorzea. There are a bunch of side activities to break the normal pace of the game and have some fun if you are ever tired from questing, and each dungeon or trial keep adding new mechanics, keeping the game entertaining and making you wonder what you will encounter in your next adventure. I recommend this game to those that haven’t experienced an MMO, and to those that have as well.

230410,Warframe,"[h1]Update (24/4/14):[/h1] It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had. 

The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind.

Multiple new game modes exist, including ""Invasion"", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission.

The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat.

The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy.

In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new ""EVE Online""-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard.

<hr>

[h1]Original Review (25/11/13)[/h1]

A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole.

Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. 

Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. 

Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character.

So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a ""community effort"" in which everyone can participate.

The only ""issue"" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games ""premium"" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. 

The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its ""free to play"" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds.

Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

I have never cheated or used hacks/mods. And suddenly Rockstar decided to ban me for no reason.

Once my ban is lifted, 5 years worth of progress will be gone.

If they won't rectify this issue, I'm going to turn this into a full-blown media scandal.

EDIT:
Just in case my claim sounds dubious, here's what I was doing in the 24-hours before I got banned:

- I just received the Stone Hatchet and completed the 25-kills challenge (and didn't receive the 250,000 GTA$ bonus for it).
- I received the 750,000 GTA$ moneydrop for watching the official livestream event (https://www.facebook.com/rockstargames/posts/10156559856180097).
- I was promoting my Nightclub and waiting for my supplies to fill up.
- I logged out to take a nap for a couple of hours.
- I woke up, tried to log in again, but the Social Club verification was taking too long, so I quit out of the game and restart.
- When I restart the game, I received the message that my account has been banned for 30 days.

I have sent multiple messsages to Rockstar Support, but all of my tickets were closed immediately with a preformatted response:

- ""You did something wrong but we won't tell you exactly what you did.""
- ""Your account will be reset: Character, Money, EVERYTHING.""
- ""This is final and cannot be appealed.""

So, yes, I'm being banned for something I didn't do and the punishment is 5 years worth of LEGITIMATE PROGRESS, gone.","Very Positive86% of the 1,588,848 user reviews for this game are positive.",5 year ps3 pc never_cheated hack mod suddenly rockstar decided ban no_reason ban lifted 5 year worth progress rectify issue turn blown medium scandal claim sound dubious 24 hour banned received stone hatchet completed 25 kill challenge receive 250 000 gta bonus received 750 000 gta moneydrop watching official livestream event http www facebook com rockstargames post 10156559856180097 promoting nightclub waiting supply fill logged nap couple hour woke tried log social club verification taking long quit restart restart received message banned 30 day sent multiple messsages rockstar support ticket closed immediately preformatted response wrong t_emphasizedell exactly reset final cannot_be appealed yes banned punishment 5 year worth legitimate progress

[b]The Positives[/b]

- Graphics, especially with RT, are absolutely next gen and stunning.
- Story and most ""real""/major side quests are for the most part well done.
- Voice acting, especially by female V, is top notch, as are the production values in general - animations, motion capture, facial animations, lip sync.
- The City is beautiful, detailed and sprawling, just the right size to not be too overwhelming but to have a lot of room and variance. It is a perfect base for things to come, hopefully, as right now there is just nothing there - see under Negatives.
- The Cyberware system is pretty fun and useful to augment your character or make up for its shortcomings. Also it's the only system in the game that actually gives you a meaningful feeling of progression and increasing power, especially the double jump which is a total game changer.
- Stealth is relatively fun and usually a viable option - even if it's always realistically faster and easier to just kill everything guns blazing due to how unbalanced the game as a whole is.

[b]Neutral[/b]

- Combat is just average, serviceable, but nothing to write home about.
- Driving is relatively bad compared to other similar games such as GTA series, but it does its job, except the damn zoomed-in Minimap which will make you miss every turn if you are driving more than 50 mph.

[b]Negatives[/b]

Unfortunately the category where most points will have to go.

- BUGS. The amount of bugs in this game is absolutely insane - I've never played a buggier game and that includes early access and Beta titles. Literally every aspect of the game is bugged heavily, some are easier to notice, some harder. Many of them are, at least, easily fixed with a Load game, but they happen often enough to pull you out of the world every few min. And some are huge and make entire game systems not function - such as most armor mods not working at all, or perks not working as intended.

- OPEN WORLD as a whole is extremely underdeveloped and shallow - basically non existant. Outside of the 100% scripted missions, and Paint-the-map gigs and NCPD jobs (most of which are the same - come here, kill and loot, job done), there is no pedestrian AI at all, no Police AI, no reputation system of any sort - you just kill a million members from each gang and they all still love you and their bosses still work with you without a word, no fun activities, no hangouts with love interest/ buddies, no car customization, no property buying or at least apartment customization (nor any reason to visit it ever)... Many basic things missing, even stuff that appeared in other games such as GTA 3 20 years ago.

- ITEMIZATION is probably the worst I have ever seen in an RPG. You have literally a couple of guns, a baseball bat, a few bladed weapons... and that's it. They all get random “quality”, and they scale with your level. The system where items get a random number of mod slots is just the worst - for example you can find Legendary items with 0-4 mod slots. Legendary with 0 mod slots is EXACTLY THE SAME as just a white item of that level (??!). So you are forced to savescum to obtain Legendaries with max mod slots, which you can already do as early as lvl 8, and from there you can just keep crafting Armadillo mod (which scales with your level and you can even craft Epic versions without having the Perk for Epic crafting) and never worry about any items ever again, they just become an annoyance. Iconic/unique items serve no purpose at all as they are always much worse than just random things you already wear - unless you invest 20 points into Crafting to be able to upgrade them to Legendary quality. And if you do that you lose most of your combat/stealth/ hacking potency so it's definitely not worth it to get a 5% better item. Leading to...

- BALANCE: Non existant. I played at Hard from the beginning and I was able to 1 shot most enemies including bosses through the entire game with just 1 Katana strike to the head. Just from buying a new legendary Katana on the same vendor every 10 or so levels. Once you stack some Armadillo mods you become completely invulnerable to enemy bullet fire - but somehow still get 1 shot by any explosion or melee weapon. I guess this is an error in damage calculations, i.e. a bug, but that's how it is at the time of writing this review.

- NO REPLAYABILITY / CHOICES DON'T MATTER: Unfortunately I don't see the game having any replay value due to having basically NO meaningful choices at all. The origin story just gives you some unique dialogue which doesn't really ever change the quest or dialogue in a meaningful way. Regarding the story, I can already see it being a lot worse on subsequent playthroughs as a heavy focus is put on just slowly walking/ driving and talking from objective to objective, in completely linear missions with very little to no player agency. Once you already know what's going to happen, I just don't see it being fun.

- PACING is completely broken as well. If you do gigs/ NCPD missions you will very quickly outlevel the entire content and have all quests at ""Very low"" threat level until the end of the game. Also towards the end you will find yourself in a situation where you have several side quest chains unresolved and have to spend hours driving around the town waiting for people to call you and give you next parts of the quest - while on main quest you are already at the ""point of no return"". What can easily happen is that you think you are done with all sidequests and you just go finish the game - without ever knowing you were supposed to wait for 72h for another call to continue the chain.

- SCRIPTED AND OPEN WORLD DON'T MIX WELL - By this I mean situations where you kill a guy in a quest... and then you reach him in the main quest later on and not only is he alive but you both act as if you just met. This happens on several occasions. Also it's pretty funny when you have a scripted car chase as part of a quest and you can see the regular cars keep disappearing all around you, so the scripted ones that are supposed to cut you off on intersections can spawn in instead - it looks insanely amateurish and completely takes you out of the game. Or, I have a guy scan my cyberware during a quest and he calls it ""complete garbage"", while I actually am decked out in full BiS Legendary cyberware - just cause the script expects me to be lvl 10 at that point, while I'm actually 40. Way too many continuity errors like that everywhere.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

All in all, as someone who considers Witcher 3 the best single player game of all time, I'm deeply disappointed by what Cyberpunk turned to be. The further I progressed in the game and the more I played around with its ""systems"" - or a lack thereof - the more apparent it was that most of the budget and development time went into the scripted quests, while basically all other elements are left criminally underdeveloped. CDPR turned from the golden son of gaming to worse than Bethesda overnight, seeing how they on purpose lied about many aspects and systems of the game that never made it in not even in a most basic form; not to even mention the bugs, nor the console situation.

That said, the game does have that certain ""something"" that makes you wanna login and play, so it it not outside of the realm of possibility for CDPR to actually make it a great game it was supposed to be, a few years down the line. However after finishing the entire game I'm doubting it a bit as there's just too much wrong with it - for starters they will need at least 6 months of heavily working on the game just to fix most of the bugs - so without any gameplay additions or enhancements.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"(This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum)
Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all.  All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. 
Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive.
The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. 
The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level.
I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. 
My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less!
And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! 
I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it.
And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.","Mixed57% of the 529,504 user reviews for this game are positive.",mainly mode multiple player interact compete real mention series connected mission level form storyline not_played warzone past bare minimum man wanted love avid duty 2013 range opinion game series biggest letdown all_emphasized trailer promotional material set expectation high given sequel best cod game modern warfare 2019 expecting release released ui terrible clean concise menu mw 2019 clearly opts side scrolling mess guess developer memo literally no_other game chose ignore different suck menu style menu oh no_this class creation menu class selection messy constrictive weapon equipment range actively disadvantaging stupid not_to good example former tactical camera field upgrade call worse piece equipment black ops 1 come worst piece equipment incredibly situational watching an_emphasizedgle camp watch domination flag get captured teammate play objective field upgrade dead silence silence footstep not_before alerting weapon progression bad introduces idea weapon platform similar weapon ak 47 ak 74u interchangeable component meaning switch assault rifle sub machine gun reconfigure gun scratch good idea except t_emphasizedake long reconfigure majority switching gun mean component carry addition gun locked gun progression rather wanted talk game issue skill based matchmaking type matchmaking grab player similar skill level match lobby mean equal skill idea anyway execution worse type matchmaking breed distinct group smurfs meaning purposely throw game lobby worse player sweaty hards life line play severe adhd good prize next filled bot teammate best enemy bad avid downright unplayable casual player tired businessman wanting unwind long player never_played cod life fun play relating skill based matchmaking ensure friend party 30 300 awful next contention ricochet anti cheat software us catch cheater rather highly inconsistent happens aim gun despite zero indication ghost perk active timer run blatantly t_emphasizedake damage shoot bother expecting activision infinity ward read report not_care best describe developer simply not_care bother mode multiple player interact compete real warzone battle royale cash cow add save development bother buying license gun name series started trend contemporary military shooter real gun name pay licensing right gun mp5 ak not_just trust dude joke mw 2019 gripe useless mode no_one play lacklustre mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal mission horribly boring versus environment raid actual false advertising promise very_emphasized long positive believe series connected mission level form storyline good unmemorable gun play good fun fire quick draw mechanic pistol lead cool moment la john wick 2 catacomb scene graphic awesome detail reflection gold gun detail map go working enjoyed it_emphasizeds damn shame rest agree battle royale genre die

916440,Anno 1800,"Unfortunately the actual quality of the game is completely redundant - this is another case of Ubisoft going out of its way to screw paying customers.

Issue 1: Denuvo
I don't think I need to say much more here. Denuvo objectively hinders game performance in return for not stopping piracy whatsoever.

Issue 2: Uplay
Or connect or whatever they call it these days. Again, the only actual function of this is to make pirated copies function and perform better than legitimate copies.
If you play this game without buying it, you get to avoid:
Logging in to your Ubisoft account repeatedly
Loading a launcher that doesn't always work, especially hindering on SteamDeck
Instantly losing your game progress because your Internet cut out
Uplay Offline mode still requires semi-regular log in and Internet connection for literally no reason whatsoever.

Issue 3: DLC DLC DLC
seriously guys I would spend more money on this if you would put some real time and effort into the extended content. Charge more money for it, go back to the days of 2070 where you released actual expansions.

All in all I was hyped for this game for years. Long time Anno fan, love the setting of this and the gameplay is (mostly) improved on previous installments.
But the above issues are way too much to ignore. 
Remember, none of this stops piracy. All of it actively encourages piracy. I don't know how Ubisoft gets off complaining about pirates while simultaneously bunging their games up with pointless bloatware, extra log in steps and a soft always online requirement.

899770,Last Epoch,"This game is just like Wolcen, in no way whatsoever. 

This review is specifically about my experience in the game and with the community throughout the Alpha and Beta. With over 500hrs I feel like I am in a unique spot to hightlight the good and the bad. 

First, the price... Even at the current price of $30 or so the game is an absolute steal. For those who choose to wait and not pay a premium for beta access, the game will be $15 at release. The developers have confirmed that the real money shop will be purely cosmetic. 

This game has two major things going for it, the extremely customizable gameplay and very active and transparent Dev team. The development team has been very prompt when it comes to new content. From what I have seen a new patch is out about once a month, and every other patch has major improvements/additions to the gameplay. Devs are not ashamed to push back an update or a feature in order to ensure quality. Don't get me wrong, there are still bugs in the game but they are addressed quickly and usually fixed by the next patch. Overall, probably the best dev team of any game that I have followed closely. 

Now to my second point, customization. As I mentioned, even at the current price you will have no problem getting your moneys worth. There are 5 classes(still missing one, Rouge) and each class has 3 very distinct passive trees. Each different passive tree of every class has 1, if not multiple different possible builds that can be explored(most can be competitive). Now to the truly ""juicy"" part, every single active skill have their own skill tree(excluding some skills  who's skill trees are not released yet) This means that not only do you have a ton of choices when it comes to passives, but you also have the ability to change how fundamentally some of your active skills work. At 500hrs, I still haven't explored all possible builds. Not to mention that there is a ton of content yet to come out which would only add to the game. 

The main question I have seen from people contemplating buying the game is, ""Is it worth the money?"". If you like RPGs you will like this game. You just need to understand that as of right now(Jun 2020) this game is still early access and may not be as polished as other major games of the genre such as PoE, D3, and Grim Dawn which have had years to improve. One thing I have never had to worry about with this game is the solid development and the steady improvements of gameplay and bugs.

899770,Last Epoch,"[h1]Last Epoch[/h1]

Last Epoch is an ARPG in Early Access which was just released with beta build on Steam and was in Alpha since August 2018.
It features 5 different classes, each with 3 subclasses which reminds talent trees in World of Warcraft:
[b]Acolyte[/b] with Lich and Necromancer specializations (Warlock spec not yet implemented)
[b]Primalist[/b] with Beastmaster, Shaman and Druid specializations
[b]Mage[/b] with Sorcerer and Spellblade specializations (Runemaster spec not yet implemented)
[b]Rogue[/b] (Not yet implemented) that will have Marksman, Falconer and Bladedancer specializations
and [b]Sentinel[/b] with Void Knight, Forge Guard and Paladin specializations. I chose Sentinel for my first character and started my journey.
When you create character you may choose ""optional challenges"" like permadeath/increased damage received etc., but it's not something you'd want to test during early beta I believe (for example, I died 2 times in lag spikes and at least 1 time I was oneshotted by 2 wonderful minions without a chance to prevent this).

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]

+ A lot of ""quality of life"" gameplay things are already implemented in the game which impressed me from very beginning. 
+ I've played plenty of ARPGs and I constantly caught myself thinking ""Oh, this is from Path of Exile"" or ""Oh, this is for sure from Diablo/World of Warcraft"", but at the same time I never had a feeling that Last Epoch is a clone or wannabe ""X"" game. 
+ Everything that is related to skills/skill trees/character development is done quite well.
+ Each class is unique and masteries/specializations creates even more diversity and unique builds. 
+ Music is okay. It's actually even good, but lacks diversity sometimes.
+ Graphics is okay too. It's not super impressive, but you won't be disappointed as well. Optimization is another story though.
+ There's enough content/replayability to enjoy game as is.

+- Map/radar are good and sucks at the same time. No quest navigation on global map and no option to open full location map made me think so, because in everything else maps are fine. 
+- The story/Quests are okay. They are not annoying, completely skippable and quite decent if you'll actually read them, but it's definitely not the strongest part of the game.
+- Locations. There's a good diversity in locations, but they are too generic at the same time and you have no reasons to explore them (implementation of something like treasure goblins/secrets would solve this issue imo).

- Optimization is far from ideal. FPS drops are very common on any high-end PC. Was not critical for me though, only small lag spikes sometimes, but for some players it was way worse.
- Plenty of [u]interface[/u] textures looks horrible for me, like they are low resolution or something like that. In a combination with poor optimization it looks even more ridiculous.

[h1]A couple more things worth mentioning[/h1]

[quote=devs]“At full release, slated for April 2020, the game will be priced lower than early access. Supporting now lets your voice shape the design of the game, and earns you exclusive in-game cosmetics.”[/quote]

Keeping that in mind you should think twice about buying game now. If you want to support devs and you enjoy leaving feedback and participating in game development this way - go for it. If you hesitate about game quality and/or not a huge fan of unfinished products - better wait for the later stages of development. As i mentioned earlier there's enough content in the game right now, but you still see NYI notifications here and there.

[quote=devs]“Online multiplayer coming mid-beta”[/quote]

As we all know from the past - this could be delayed drastically, so if you're looking for a co-op gameplay -- better wait for an actual multiplayer update and feedback about it.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

[b]Last Epoch[/b] has a great potential and it requires only multiplayer and a good amount of lategame content to become an amazing game in future (and a lot of additional polishing of course). It already has enough content and replayability to consider game in a current state as a good purchase, especially if you like this genre.
I enjoyed my first 11-12 hours in the game and I will play again without a doubt. Every time I had to take a break I ended up in a ""just 5 more minutes/just one more location"" situation and it's already enough for me to like Last Epoch. However, you may want to wait for later development stages, so you won't have to look at that sweet NYI talent like I do now.

1203620,Enshrouded,"I really wanted to love this game. The single-player experience is pretty solid. the building and combat are great, and the world is compelling. It's a ton of fun to explore and discover new recipes. But at present, it's only really playable single-player. There are only 2 flame altars per server, which means that either a 4 or 16 player server must share 2 bases between them. There is no way to make your own base, or chests, they're available to all. There are no admin tools to deal with griefers either.

In addition progression is server wide, AND character dependent. This means if a character is not present when a quest is completed, they lose out on the rewards for the quest, but also can't receive the quests themselves, effectively gating their progression. Only one person gets boss and quest rewards, so on a 4-16 person server, good luck sharing loot.

Even in two player co-op, both players always present, quest progression is broken. you can only have one major quest at a time, and I had a quest to make a weapon, which I didn't complete, as I didn't realize it was gating my progression. In that time, I helped my co-op partner complete several quests, including a major boss kill, and I don't have the quest completion reflected in my journal, but the area is permanently altered and I can't receive or complete those quests, so my progression is bricked.

Given the way multiplayer is implemented, it's clear it started as a single-player game with a changing world that tacked on multiplayer to appeal to the survival craft genre.

If you want a single player survival game with a compelling world and decent combat, go for it.

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"The game itself is good, even great. A true technical marvel.

. . . not its gorgeous, 1:1, 24/7 live streaming version of Earth, its 2.2 mbps launcher that's required to download the game and bump you up past that 2 hours maximum playtime so  you can't get a refund before actually getting into the game itself.

so I do love this game, I've tried it on GamePass several times, but I'm leaving this review specifically for the people like me tempted by the -40% going on in the Steam Autumn Sale. be absolutely crystal clear -- you will absolutely not play this game before going past the 2 hour refund window. it's gonna say I have 9 hours or so in it at review time -- this is false. it was just downloading all last night in its intolerably slow launcher. it got half-done. nine hours, half done a 160 gig game. massive warning. just so you know. 

but the game IS good, I promise you that. if what you're after if realistic flight mechanics on a fully-rendered map of Earth - and you have at the very least a high-mid computer to run it - it's not going to do you wrong.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Edit: Still good 4 years later.

For a long time, I avoided FF14 even as word continued on that it was one of the best MMO's  currently out there. This only increased with the release of the Shadowbringers Expansion, which I heard nothing but good things about. Still, this was not enough. Knowing how I operate in MMO's, starting one would be a colossal time investment for months, and possibly years depending upon how much I enjoyed it. I ended up giving FF14 a try when I saw how many of my oldest friends were either playing it or planning to. They let you do a free trial up to level 35, so I figured... why not? If I make it that far and like it, then perhaps this may be worth buying.

Even so, I wasn't quite prepared for how much I was about to be consumed by this game. FF14 is easily the best MMO i've played since WoW's Wrath of the Lich King expansion more than 10 years ago. I found it to be more enjoyable than EVE and Guild Wars 2, and far superior to WoW's current expansion Battle for Azeroth. After over a year of enduring that mess, it was refreshing to play FF14 and find an MMO that I actually could enjoy without excessive RNG and obnoxious busywork.

Ok, so reviewing an MMO in its entirety is utterly mad and i'd be here for hours, so instead I'm going to try to highlight a few key points.

First and foremost, FF14 puts some serious investment into its storylines. While it might officially be an MMO, FF14 is also probably the largest JRPG ever made. Expect dozens of hours of cutscenes and story events, with me having about 300 hours played when I finished all current story content. Now I didn't spend all 300 of those hours only doing story content, but that should give you a pretty decent idea of how large the story is. If you are familiar with this franchise then you have a pretty good idea of what to expect, and longtime fans will see many familiar names among this game's characters and boss fights. On the other hand the story is a bit mediocre early on and only really gets going in the first expansion Heavensward. Technically you can skip all the cutscenes (and rewatch them in an Inn or your house), and even buy a skip all the way to Shadowbringers if you really want to, but I'd recommend against it considering how much of a role story and character development play in this game. The story might be a bit bland and lengthy in its early stages, but it becomes one of the better parts of this game.

Moving on to gameplay, FF14 has a large number of different classes, or ""jobs"", that you can play as. You get your typical MMO setup of tanks, healers, melee, and ranged each with their own distinct play style, strengths, and weaknesses. Crafting and gathering in FF14 is much more developed than in most MMO's with each of them being different classes in their own right. But unlike most MMO's, FF14 allows you to play all of these different classes on a single character. This is a major selling point for someone like me with major alt problems in other MMO's (12 120's in WoW, for example). FF14 ensures that you are able to play all of the classes and their own storylines while at the same time not forcing you to build a new character from scratch for each different class.

As for group content, there are plenty of opportunities for PvE and PvP. When it comes to PvP, i'll admit that my experience is somewhat limited. However from what I have seen of PvP in FF14 it is a bit clunky, does not seem to be particularly popular, and is one of the few areas where WoW clearly beats FF14... for now. As for PvE, FF14 is very strong indeed. There are a large number of Dungeons (4 player runs), Trials (8 player boss fights), Raids (8 players), and Alliance Raids (24 players). FF14's version of LFG, the ""Duty Finder"", is simple to use and allows you to queue up for any content you have unlocked - though you may want an organized group for the high difficulty content. Worth mentioning are the ""roulettes"" which let you select a category (such as Trials, Level 80 Dungeons, or Alliance Raids) to queue for and obtain a daily reward based upon your class level. FF14 does have level scaling that reduces your level to fit whatever PvE content you find yourself in, though it is possible to turn this off for your own private groups. 

Like what WoW used to have when it was still good, FF14 has a token/badge system where you collect currencies from doing 50+ PvE content that you can use to buy gear, materials, and other goodies. There is also nothing like the Titanforging or weekly chest RNG BS like what is in current (8.2.5) WoW. Current content raids work a little differently in FF14 too, with you being limited in the amount of gear items you can get per week. On the one hand this slows down gearing a bit, but on the other you are free to run the current raids as many times as you want until you get the gear drop you are after, at least on normal difficulty. In the light of having to wait months before getting crucial gear upgrades in WoW due to only getting one chance a week, I like how FF14 does it.

As for the community, I haven't been on forums or around hardcore players since I have not joined a proper raid guild yet (or Free Company as they are called in FF14). However, from what I have seen FF14 players are far more friendly and far less toxic than many other game communities. I've completed over 500 dungeons so far and I can probably count on one hand the number of times i've dealt with jackasses in those dungeons. People tend to be friendly, helpful, more relaxed, and more forgiving of errors - especially if you are new and have the ""sprout"" icon. I think FF14 might have stronger rule enforcement for bad behavior, but I am not completely sure about that. I don't even see much swearing, which is kind of a shock for an online game. In any event, I very much like the peaceful community this game has.

Ok I better wrap this up before this review goes on forever.

And yet there are so many other neat things to mention. Gold Saucer and all its minigames, Player owned housing and all the customization that comes with it, the massive amount of special items to collect, and on the list goes. FF14 is an MMO after all, so having an insane amount of content to spend time with is to be expected. There are so many opportunities to play this game in the manner of your choosing. :D

So... If my opinion on this game isn't obvious to you by know, I don't know what to tell you. :o

One last note though... like many other MMO's, [url=https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/friend_recruit/]FF14 has a ""Recruit a Friend"" feature[/url] where a new player who has yet to buy their first month of subscription can get a code from a current subscriber and get rewards for both of them that increase the longer the new person sticks with the game. If FF14 sounds like something you may be interested in, feel free to leave a comment on this review asking for one of these codes and i'll reply with one. :D

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I've been playing this game nearly every day since it released on Steam. I've supported this game by spending a generous amount of money. I continue to play even after one of the most egregious displays of greed I've seen in a game. Despite this, I can't recommend this game to anyone.

I'm a long time gacha player. I'm familiar with typical gacha mechanics, such as low rates for rarer characters and limited availability. This game did not use to have a pet gacha. Most of the cash shop was QOL things to reduce how much time spent playing each day. The developer added a gacha, which players can roll on for pets. Normally, I'd be okay with this as I am a long time gacha player. However, I haven't seen greed and an obvious cash grab of this magnitude since Naruto Online. For those unfamiliar, Naruto Online is a predatory gacha game, with some characters requiring players to spend a minimum of thousands of dollars to get a character. This is the direction I see Legends of Idleon going. This single update turned it into a predatory gacha game.

There's no justification to make the lowest rate character cost a maximum of $350 if you pull to pity. This is far beyond the cost for any typical gacha game on the market. The saddest thing is this is not corporate greed. This is a single developer who decided this was a good thing to add to the game. The developer claims to respond to player feedback, but he chose to die on this hill. The overwhelming majority of players do not like this update. Long time players do not like this update. Spenders do not like this update.

I waited to write this review to give the developer the benefit of the doubt. This update went live on June 17th, 2023. The developer is not changing his mind. It's clear to me that the developer has given up on this game. This is his final attempt to milk as much money as he can from his community until he slowly phases this game out. To newcomers reading, avoid this game. To new players, quit while you can. To long time players, do not recommend this game to anyone.

Bought this for myself and friends; our first three hour session was, I reckon, the best co-op horror experience we've had in ages. Perfectly cut screams, eerie silence, frantic pleas for help, the lot.

While it still has a way to go before it's complete and bug-free, the dev has absolutely nailed the atmosphere and experience. The creature content is well fleshed out and pretty original- save for a few must-have gimmicks that fit very well; the communication and teamwork dynamics are a pleasant surprise.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 274,684 user reviews for this game are positive.",tl dr develop tech wiki great bought friend three session reckon best mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal horror age perfectly cut scream eerie silence frantic plea help complete bug nailed atmosphere creature fleshed pretty original save gimmick fit communication teamwork dynamic pleasant surprise
686810,Hell Let Loose,"This is a realistic, hardcore WW2 styled shooter game that will be very challenging to all new players due to the communication, strategy and teamwork that is required in order to defeat the opposing team.

Choose from a selection of classes (each time you respawn), which have access to different weapons/load-outs, each bringing a different spin on how to play the game. For example only certain classes can blow up tanks, or support other units, or build structures.

My tip for new players, don't be afraid to communicate. Let your squad know you're new to the game and ask for help if you're finding it tough. If you find that your approach isn't working then change it up, people will sit and wait for you to run back down the exact same path if you're silly enough to do so over and over.

Pros:

Few bugs in the game - The devs consistently update the game and roll out patches, they release new, FREE, content available for public testing before releasing into the full game.
Extremely realistic, graphics, sounds, everything. Very easy to get immersed into the game.
Helpful/talkative community.
Strategy wins games.
NO MICRO TRANSACTIONS, NO ADVANTAGES.

Cons:

If you come into this game with a COD mindset you will not do well. Running around = death, especially at the start.
Not a game for those without a microphone.
Can be fairly CPU/GPU intensive.
Not designed to be new player friendly - There is no tutorial, the most the game will help you with are some hint boxes. Communicate to your squad, they'll be your help.

1966720,Lethal Company,"I don't know what comparison to draw to explain the games mechanics. It's a survival horror but it doesn't fall into a monster hunt category like Phas. 
This game does allow for players to make their own fun as well, it does not have to be hardcore at all if you don't want it to be. Its very socially comparable maybe to Among Us although I was not a fan of that game. 

This game is about collecting scrap. The objective is to meet an ever climbing quota in 3 days which makes it run based, after failure to meet quota you restart. There is a shop you can spend money at for cosmetics or useful items. Because you need to hold everything in this game it means you really gotta plan with your team what you're going to take with you (If you're going for long runs) otherwise you'll find yourself short and you might find yourself being introduced to the companies disciplinary measures for lazy workers. 

Each monster has audio queues to recognise and methods of detection that you will have to play around. Giants have very keen sight but pick up on movement and don't hear well.
Dogs can't see at all but they're fast and chase after sound. 
I'll leave it at that for now but there are methods to dispatch/avoid the various creatures and most don't feel alike to deal with. This also makes monster combos something to really keep in mind when setting up your teams load out. 

There are 3 tiers of maps based off difficulty/reward. The final tier require that you pay(Not real money) to get in but these maps are required for making it into later quotas for long runs. These are also the maps you'll run into monster combos, a real challenge when your making your way past the 1500-2000 quota range. Before that difficulty takes a bit of time to climb, don't be surprised to see 1 go running in solo and making quota alone for the first 6 or so days. 


I've played Phas and a bunch of its clones (Some better honestly than phas itself) but I still like this game way better than all of them. 
If you found waiting around in Phasmophobia for the information to basically come to you was boring then I think you'll enjoy this game much more. You have limited time in a day so your actually fighting the clock to be more efficient until you can't keep up. 
I personally don't want to sit around waiting in a survival horror until I can progress because then I'm relying on the spook factor to entertain me while I would otherwise be bored with nothing to do. The spook factor has very much died for me in horror games.
This games design promotes finding faster and more active ways around problems. Is a giant camping your ship? Send someone out to bait it, and once they're far use the teleporter to return them to the ship while you use the opening to get out.
You can just sit and wait for an opening but the time that's ticking away is your punishment for not coming up with an active solution. This is an important aspect to the difficulty which drives me to want to play the game in the first place. Its not just about surviving the encounter long enough to get paid with some process of elimination running in the background. It's about improving the efficiency of your game plan and doing better every run. A single player can make a huge difference on the team, and having a knowledgeable team is like a multiplier on an individual players skill. 

Half the excitement for me comes from the dice roll upon joining a lobby with new players. It could be a funny lobby, a try hard lobby, people experimenting with the game there is so much variety in how this game 'can' play out.

An extra note for players hosting Boss only lobbies. Its early access, the rank doesn't work. It resets and displays wrong. If you're kicking anyone who isn't a boss from your titan run lobbies you're probably kicking some of the more experienced players. Its better to ask what they know about the game than to judge based off the tag.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 274,684 user reviews for this game are positive.",comparison draw explain game mechanic survival horror fall monster hunt category phas allow player fun not_have hardcore socially comparable maybe not_a fan collecting scrap objective meet climbing quota 3 day make based failure meet quota restart shop spend cosmetic useful item hold mean ta plan long run short introduced company disciplinary measure lazy worker monster audio queue recognise method detection play giant keen sight pick movement hear dog fast chase sound leave method dispatch avoid creature alike deal make monster combo mind setting team load 3 tier map based difficulty reward final tier require pay not_real map required quota long run map monster combo real challenge past 1500 2000 quota range difficulty take bit climb surprised 1 running solo quota alone 6 day phas bunch clone honestly phas found waiting phasmophobia information basically boring enjoy limited fighting clock efficient personally sit waiting survival horror progress relying spook factor entertain bored spook factor died horror game game design promotes finding faster active way problem giant waiting strategic location ambush defeat player enemy ship send someone bait far teleporter ship opening sit wait opening ticking punishment not_coming active solution important aspect difficulty drive play not_just surviving encounter long paid process elimination running background improving efficiency plan single huge difference knowledgeable multiplier individual player skill half excitement come dice roll joining lobby player funny lobby hard lobby experimenting variety play extra note player hosting bos lobby player purchase play official release rank reset display wrong kicking bos titan lobby probably kicking experienced player ask judge based tag

374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"[h1]Into the Deep End[/h1]

As a Dark Souls newbie, this game was extremely punishing at first and tested my patience to the next level. Never have I been forced to realize how bad I am at combat. True, unadulterated, combat. The kind where it is your fault for going in too deep when the enemy was preparing an attack. Where slowing down and observing is just important as attacking. Death after death, and then some more for good measure, I finally managed to take down Iudex (the starting boss)…down to his second phase. Of course he had to have a second phase, I mean, it’s only been 5 minutes since I created my character and this guy is more difficult than most games’ final bosses. Alright fine, let’s try it again….and naturally, the stupid skeleton guarding the boss entrance chunked me for half of my health. This obnoxious heathen never managed to hit me in my previous 16 runs, but now its eyes gained some sort of holy enchantment to make every arrow land on my back. This is the type of game DARK SOULS III is. One without mercy, care, or pity. It took me approximately 2 hours to beat Iudex as a starting Mercenary, but the thrill and adrenaline post-battle was truly something no other game offered. Who knew I could come to love a game that wanted to kill me so badly.

[h1]Ashes, Cinders, and Bonfires[/h1]

As I fought my way through the story, I began to become immersed with the lore and progression system. Every single item’s description, name, and method of acquisition imparts just a tiny bit of knowledge or history onto the player. At first, most of this information is useless at worst, or intriguing at best. These little puzzle pieces manage to eventually paint a very vivid and dark image about the world of Lothric and its inhabitants. Ashes and unique equipment often detail the previous owners’ qualities; a gift to fans of previous games in the series. Although DS III is fairly disconnected with any of the other SOULS games, certain NPCs and discoveries will tie up loose ends and provide closure for particular aspects of the first DARK SOULS game.

Unlike the previous games, bonfires are placed just when you truly need them, and most important of all, teleportation between bonfires are available from the get-go. Firelink Shrine, the base of operations of sorts, serves as the location for player stat upgrades, weapon upgrades/infusions, Estus flask upgrades, and bonfire upgrades (increases healing per flask). Similar to Humanity or Human Effigies from the previous games, Ember heals the player and boosts max health in exchange for allowing human and NPC invasions.

Although the world design is fairly spectacular, it was mostly linear/bi-linear (city with a dungeon below it) with moderate exploration required for completionists. The traditionally grand map comprised of interconnecting smaller maps through shortcuts is replaced with a more direct route, however, the world is still HUGE. In fact, without proper investigation, it is extremely easy to completely miss 4 optional areas with their own bosses. In total, there are 19 bosses that will do their best to make sure life in Lothric is a living Hell, along with several other mini-bosses in between. The grunt and fluff type enemies are never too difficult – just strong enough to warrant consistent player attention. The extremely well planned level and boss design (excluding a couple) easily makes DS III one of the most memorable games I have ever played. I can clearly recount most of the paths in every area along with every bosses’ movesets and shenanigans. From clones and body doubles, to massive variances in combat range and aggressiveness, the boss fights and surrounding environements are truly, and remarkably, unforgettable.

[h1]The Art in Killing[/h1]

One of the most noticeable changes to the tried-and-true combat involves the introduction of weapon arts. Think of it as a special skill move belonging to certain weapon types. Hacking and slashing is always fun, but turning that long sword into a propeller of death is even more so. Special and boss type weapons are often imbued with properties of their wielder, including a unique weapon art that can be so hauntingly beautiful to perform. Lance thrusts with bursts of electricity, sword strikes covered in fire, and duel-wielded weapons moving in an artistic dance are only some of what you will see. Unfortunately, most of these arts require the use of FP (focus points), and once out, they won’t be usable until replenished.

[h1]Issues & Updates[/h1]

DS III launched with quite a few minor grievances, mostly sporadic FPS drops, but all of them have been fixed. The only major issue at the moment is regarding softbanning due to “Data Inconsistencies” which may occur due to advancing in the game offline (de-syncing with the server) or from online hackers. Continuous patches have been applied since the posting of this review in order to keep up to date with the demanding pvp balance and bug encounters.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

I can’t stress enough how much I really enjoyed playing DS III. This game is one of my personal contenders for 2016 GOTY. I really regret never playing the earlier two during their heyday, but at least it gives me something to do while i lament the end of this great journey – at least, until the Season Pass content gets released. For those that want to continue into New Game +, DS III fortunately provides 3 other endings with vastly different consequences to uncover, increasing replayability immensely. One of those endings also requires an extremely strict quest-line progression, ultimately leading to one of the most shocking moments in the game!

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"On one hand, the QoL streamlining is great in this, coming from CK2. A lot simpler to navigate and find anything. 
And if what you care about is shaping your characters' lives through RPG-like events, you're getting enough out of it too.

But that's where the issues begin for me: Compared to CK2, 3 focuses too much on these (mostly shallow and repetitive) events, rather than focus on the fundamentals of a good grand strategy game. Its almost like they're chasing the CK2 ""look at the crazy stuff happening"" memes.

There's so many fundamental elements that are just plain worse in this than CK2. For example: 

[list]
    [*]Wars: In CK2 the war leader(often you) can tell their allied units where to go and what to attack/besiege. Its an essential tool in planning out wars and strategies- In CK3 this feature is removed for some reason, resulting in AI allies being completely useless. Yes they show up, but 90% of the time, they just Benny Hill run from a bigger enemy army, never contributing anything to your war efforts. Good design!
    [*]In CK2, you got reasons for imprisonment whenever someone would commit a crime, or target you directly. In CK3 only crime targeting your own family gives you a reason. Meaning that your step mother could be killing half your court and loyal subjects in her murder craze. As long as she doesn't kill anyone from your dynasty, the game sees no reason to imprison her and everyone will hate you for doing so. Good design!
   [/list]

It'd be too long to list all my issues in that regard tho. One more (minor) thing is tho, that they completely removed notification settings. Whether you want less pop ups or more, either way is not an option because the tracking of events and characters has been made a complete hassle in this one. By pure chance I found out that my heir is missing half his limbs and on his deathbed because CKIII sees no importance in reminding you. 

There's one more thing I feel needs talking about. Years ago, Johann from Paradox Games had an infamous melt down on Reddit while Hearts of Iron 4 was in development. Yelling that he does not want to feature nazis in his games. Reddit then kindly explained to him that the ""german guys"" are kinda important to the entire WW2 scenario and without acknowledging their existence, you're devaluing everything the allies have fought for, everything the allies have lost. 

Ever since, anything of that matter has been a very touchy subject for Paradox. Before CK3 released there was some controversy regarding the term ""Crusader"" and showing what is basically a forceful invasion, in positive light or having players partake. So PDX released a statement saying that CK3 will focus way less on these aspects of the game and that ""Crusader"" is only the title of the game, but not its content. 

So what does this mean effectively for the game? That I think you can just feel that PDX is tip-toeing around a lot of elements in this game, as to not be labeled a conservative dev, or someone catering to white supremacists. I know it sounds weird on paper, but given the abundance of German Reich ""what could've been"" memes and PDX getting flak for even making a game called Crusader Kings, CK3 feels as if PDX is working HARD to do anything not to be put in that box. 

What that means for the game is, that the core of the game feels just less fleshed out and focused than it was in CK2. I always loved that PDX were (mostly) global and not just focused on a single region. But when they'd rather flesh out the entire world before making the European core halfway as interesting as it was in CK2, then something is amiss.

And ultimately, CK3 is just a shallower version of CK2 that looks prettier.","Very Positive92% of the 66,890 user reviews for this game are positive.",on_emphasizede hand qol streamlining great ck2 simpler navigate care shaping character life role event issue compared ck2 3 focus mostly shallow repetitive event rather focus fundamental good grand strategy chasing ck2 crazy stuff happening meme s_emphasizedo fundamental element plain worse ck2 example war ck2 war leader allied unit attack besiege essential tool planning war strategy ck3 removed resulting ai ally completely useless yes 90 benny hill bigger enemy army never_contributing war effort good design ck2 reason imprisonment whenever someone commit crime target directly ck3 crime targeting family give meaning mother killing half court loyal subject murder craze long kill dynasty see no_reason imprison hate good design long issue regard tho minor tho completely removed notification setting pop ups not_an tracking event character complete hassle pure chance found heir missing half limb deathbed ckiii see no_importance reminding need talking year ago johann paradox game infamous melt reddit heart iron 4 development yelling not_want nazi game reddit kindly explained german guy kinda important ww2 scenario acknowledging existence devaluing ally fought ally lost matter touchy subject paradox ck3 released controversy regarding term showing basically forceful invasion positive light player partake pdx released statement saying ck3 focus aspect title not_its effectively pdx tip toeing element not_be labeled conservative someone catering white supremacist sound weird paper given abundance german reich meme pdx flak called ck3 feel pdx working hard not_to box mean core feel fleshed focused ck2 loved pdx mostly global not_just focused single region rather flesh world european core halfway interesting ck2 amiss ck3 shallower version ck2 look prettier

[h1][u]FF14 Con:[/u][/h1]
[i]Gonna do cons first as that's more important for a should I buy imo[/i]
[b]SLOW AS ****[/b][i]like watching paint dry slow, seriously seriously slow[/i]: 
This con needs it's own subsection as it's slow in so many aspects.
[olist]
[*] Slow/ bland early quest progression - After starting the game as a new player you will spend approx 30-40m doing run to character A for tedious dialogue, now run to character B for some more tedious dialogue and if you are really really lucky you will get to run to character C for..... you guessed it more tedious dialogue. Eventually Character C will send you off for the inevitable kill X amount of adorable critters quest because. hey who likes critters am I right, it's not like Eorzea has P.E.T.A or anything. I know that you are a new low level day 1 adventurer and can hardly be expected to go kill a legendary dragon first day on the job but ""please can you take this note to my mate who is upstairs in the pub"" is a bit rediculous. [i] This changes abit more at late game but not much [/i]
[*] Slow combat - One of the biggest complaints you will hear from anyone about FF14 is the combat. Early level it is excruciatingly tedious. Auto attack speed and damage is roughly to normal, however alot of you moves share a GC and it's set to around 2.5 seconds this is a very long time especially at early level when you only really have a hand full of moves all of which will likely share the same GC. It is worth noting that this becomes less of a bore as you level and get more moves but for a new level 1 player this can be a deal breaker.
[*] Slow Leveling - Leveling in the game can feel like a grindy chore and it's something that alot of people complain about, the game has quests like you would expect from a traditional mmo but honestly most of your Exp will come from a mix of Fates(Public quests) Leves (like quests but not quests, it's a weird pre realm reborn system that hung around) and instances. This isn't exactly a bad thing as personally I would rather run dungeons than kill 10 boars and run back to someone but Exp gain is quiet slow(buy food in the first town and eat it, food increases EXP gain by like 3%, no one tell you this and alot of people miss out on extra EXP  early game) early game theres only like 3 different dungeons so running them repeatedly gets old fast. 

This is more of a gripe than a con but meh, Recently some jack*** dev(clearly someone in the cinematics team) decided that they worked so hard on the main scenario cutscenes. so players should not be able to skip them. This dev is an ***hole and everyone hates him/her.
Also houses cost your soul, ingame and IRL, not even kidding like ridiculously expensive, but alot of people band together and by a guild hall so meh.
[/olist]
Con over now to the pro's, seriously the only real issue is the slowness.

[h1][u]FF14 Pro's:[/u][/h1]
[b]Current Content[/b]
FF14 has some incredible content most of it is end game, like alot of it. I remember playing pre expansions(so just realm reborn) hitting 50 and saying to my friend ""So what's left?"" We looked about and immediatly found out that the game pretty much starts at end game, here is a list and brief info about some of the content:
[olist]
[*] Primals - Although you fight some of the primals (GFs/Summons) through the main storyline, some of them can only be attempted at end game, also you can attempt them on harder difficulties which honestly completely changes the fight and gives loot, primal skinnned gear :).
[*] Classes/Crafting - So orignal day 1 combat classes are split into 2 groups Disciple of War, Disciple of Magic. theses classes evolve once you hit 30. If you feel like you aren't enjoying your current class you can go to the trainer for one of the other classes and they will give you a quest to change class. You won't loose your level in the current class so 1 character can have a max level for all classes if you want to put the time in. Crafting is apparently really fun and an entire game to itself. I've not done it as it's never been my thing in MMO's but apparently it's very good and there are character classes specifically for crafting.
[*] One Character, ALL OF THE THINGS - the game has a multi class system which lets you swap class based on the weapon you use, these cannot be changed mid combat or whilst in a dungeon/instance/raid, however outside of that as long as you've done the class quest to unlock it you're free to switch anytime you like.
[*] Raids - The raids a fun and one of the biggest things going for FF14 is that the instances and raids feel epic, they have interesting mechanics the environments have a feel of grandeur, Good King Moogle Mog is the most epic box fight music you could get, and the general feel while instancing is awesome. 
[*] Chocobo raising - you can dye your chocobo and train it for chocobo racing,
[*] Mini games - This MMO loves it's mini games like seriously loves them, they added a version of the golden saucer from ff7 to the game and they also added a version of the tera master card game. It's pretty fun.
[*] Querky Quests - I complained before about the early level questing being dull but the end game quest are awesome espesially when you start to realise they aren't really there for leveling more for a fun side story. There are alot of really querky and fun quest lines out there so find them and enjoy the oddness.
[*] Outfits and costumes - You can either glamour a single item of gear at a time using a consumable item each time you want to glamour the gear, or you can use the consumable and add the gear piece to your waredrobe, this destorys the gear but makes it accessable to use whenever and doesn't cost to apply.

The game does have PVP, I've never done it tho.
[/olist]
[b]Story[/b]
The Story in FF14 is split 3 ways:
[olist]
[*] Main Story - It's a true final fantasy game, the story line is very enjoyable if story is important to you then you'll love it.That's all I'll say as I don't want to spoil anything. Also dont worry about skipping cutscenes for general story stuff if you wish to save time, you can retire to your character room at the inn and watch them all at once if you like, ok now that's all I'll say on the main story line.
[*] Class Story - Each Class has it's own Story quests cutscenes etc, they are fun introduce some cool characters over all a nice addition to leveling.
[*] Querky Quest - Some of the quest lines are like their own little miniture adventure for example the detetive quest line which probably has the most notoriety. Again I don't want to spoil anything so I'll say no more, but they will probably give you giggle or two.
[/olist]
[b]New Content[/b]
Dev support for this game has been great, probably because it's making square enix so much money that they are actually funneling it back into development.... I know right a company that realises if you want your MMO to do well you've got to add more content, It's quiet refreshing. We get quiet alot of ingame events and things also new story progression which basically covers a build up to the next expansion. 
[b]Community[/b]
The community is amazing, Don't get me wrong like all games some people are toxic but overall the community in FF14 is great. There's a novice global chat that new players are auto added to which high level can opt into being a mentor etc, if you have any question people tend to reply real quick and are genuinely pretty decent in helping others.

[b]Final Verdict[/b]

686810,Hell Let Loose,"After more than 300 hours I can confirm that Hell Let Loose in its current state is well worth its price.

The easiest way i can describe it is like Battlefield and Squad or Post Scriptum met in the middle for a hardcore and tactical FPS that doesn't get too bogged down in the nitty gritty ultra realism or unintuitive/clunky controls or boring/anti-fun mechanics of a more traditional milsim, while not being totally arcade-y like BF or CoD with its sights on every gun or near instant healing.

The game encourages teamwork by having limited loadouts in your squad that work with one another, the combat is simple but satisfying as most weapons are 1 or 2 hit kills putting a lot of emphasis on your positioning, movement and accuracy as an individual but also when coordinating with your squad you can suppress enemy positions to help give members the chance to advance to throw nades or to flank.

In a lot of cases multiple squads need to work with one another to pull off a larger tactic, like by having 1 squad engage at the front making a lot of noise with an MG while another flanks while another sets up nodes and uses artillery to pound the objective.

As a result I do recommend you have a mic to play though as without one the gunplay in other games like BF or CoD is better 
Even though a single player can cause a lot of damage, a squad working together well will always be both more effective but will also have more fun as in a communicating squad you will have more spawns meaning less walking, more eyes means you will spot more enemy positions, and having people cover your back and to pull off group tactics with is extremely fun and rewarding.

I will say now that the game is still in EA and that this means a lot of mechanics are subject to change both for better or for worse, so while there are some clunky bugs here and there they are not game breaking and the more common ones are due to be fixed in future updates.
I will try and keep this review up to date if the game changes to be too much of a milsim or becomes an arcade shooter.","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",300 hour confirm state worth price easiest describe battlefield squad post scriptum met middle hardcore tactical shooter bogged nitty gritty ultra realism unintuitive clunky control boring anti fun mechanic traditional milsim not_being totally arcade bf cod sight gun near instant healing encourages teamwork limited loadouts squad combat simple satisfying weapon 1 2 kill putting emphasis positioning movement accuracy individual coordinating squad suppress enemy position help member chance advance throw nades flank case multiple squad pull larger tactic 1 squad engage front noise mg flank set node us artillery pound objective result recommend mic play gunplay game bf cod single cause damage squad working effective fun communicating squad spawn meaning walking eye mean spot enemy position cover pull group tactic extremely fun rewarding ea mean mechanic subject worse clunky bug not_game breaking common one due fixed future update change milsim arcade shooter

1203620,Enshrouded,"I don't have time to do a full initial review and only have an hour of playtime so far, but I haven't had any problems and it adds some nice twist to the survival/crafting genre.  The only bad thing is that it came out after a particular ""Pal"" game with a unique twist on the genre.  

While I have yet to get far into the game, I do recommend it to those who enjoy the genre.  Now, the only question is, do you spend your time playing this or the Pal game? If you can decide your time, both are unique enough to be worth picking up if you can afford to do so.   
 
I do like the ability to spec into any number of archetypes, as I prefer casters, and luckily for me, this game has multiple magic user trees.   I am playing solo right now, but this is a game where I could see myself wanting to co-op with others.  I usually am not big on multiplayer, but this game has an excellent chance to change my mind.  I know they have put out a couple of hotfixes already, and I read that most early complaints were server-related.   It is hard for a company to judge what kind of load to expect; this goes even more so for smaller studios, but when you see big AAA companies struggle, and you know they have the money and knowledge like a particular company, let's call ""Snowstorm,"" just kidding I will not cloak the fact that I am talking about Blizzard have the same issues, it is hard to fault a newly released game, even more so when it is in early access.   
 
I wish I had more time with a game tonight to do a deeper dive into it, but for the money, it is undoubtedly, even at this point, worth the asking price.  If the developers keep up the excellent work and continue building upon what they already have playable, I can see good things ahead for Enshrouded.

899770,Last Epoch,"I've played just under 15 hours in 2 days... It's amazing and will only get better with time... There are issues granted its a beta. 

Lets talk about the cons so we can list the pros and out beat it. 

Cons:
- The game crashes on specific skills because you are legit blowing everything up and the game goes (NOPE.AVI) 
- You get stuck on doors sometimes, your skill or punch can hulk smash half the door off and leave the other part to block you.
-  There is no mulitplayer YET! that is going to change in the next couple months. 
- You cannot link items in global chat
- Global chat has a bug where it doesn't load and you cannot type to anyone. 
- there is more but I have yet to be bothered by them as these do not take away from the positives. 

Pros

+ So much customization it is crazy (Character/skills/mastery

+ Crafting is sooooo satifying and easy to understand ( you do not need a PhD to understand (POE) ) it tells you how many prefix and suffix you have left on that item.

+ There is a gambler that is soo damn fun to mess with (Example: Buy a ring for 50 gold that can have no mods or up to a rare or even unique) 

+ AUTO SORT BUTTON IN YOUR INVENTORY AND STASH! OH MY GOD THIS IS AMAZING. 

+Crafting materials have a button that transfers all crafting materials into a pouch that doesn't take up space in your inventory after you click the button. ++++++ for this idea.

+Uses actual gold... This is a straight shot at POE but your currency isn't your crafting matierials. Well it might, once trade opens up, but gold exists for a reason in this game.

+Right now it has 7 acts (8 is coming in the next week or so)- I am 15 hours in and half way through act 2. 

+Already has end game content, arena and monolith (However I have yet to reach this yet myself) 

+You can respec your character as many time as you want. The mastery points cost gold which is a small amount and your skills can be completely wiped as much as you want.

+idols are here(Diablo 2 style) and have their own slots that you can play tetris with and get specifc boosts to your resistances/health/mana ect.  or even class oriented mods.

+Hundreds of builds... I had to put this twice because as any ARPG player knows: Builds are the most fun. There is no meta. Of course there are ""preferred"" builds (hammerdin) but that doesn't mean you are going to be left behind if you decide to play anything else.  For example I am a necro who is an embodyment of death... Or I can respec and turn into a skeleton nuke. It's all up to me.

+$39.99 for a game that is built by a team of less than 50 and the quality rivals AAA titles (Diablo,POE,Grim Dawn, Wolcen... HAHA!) this game is going in a direction that makes you excited to try new builds and you can be in on the ground floor and join a community that is growing together.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"This is the first AC game that I just cannot bring myself to finish. I wouldn't consider myself a massive fan of the series, but as a historical geek I always tend to find myself buying them on sales and playing through them once. I've had numerous gripes with the series forever, but none strong enough to prevent me from playing the game until now.

Maybe it's just that 3rd person action games have evolved so much in the last few years, but it is an understatement to say this game feels ""cheap"". 

Animations are floaty, bad, and feel budget. The sound design and mixing is so bad that I had to desperately search the settings and internet to find out why on earth everything sounded so bad (Turns out they decided to compress the audio like crazy to save space). The voice acting is boring and forgettable, the side quests are classic ubisoft trash with awful children voice actors that you just want to skip through.

The combat is bad. It feels bad. Weapons lack any impact, it's far too floaty. Their idea of ""high difficulty"" is you die in 1-2 hits while enemies die in 10+ hits. For a game series that has continued to be hyper focused more on combat than stealth, completely failing at making the combat engaging is sad.

Exploration sucks too. I turned on pathfinder mode originally as I liked these modes in Origins and Odyssey. All the environments are the same, white snowcovered mountains, with a light colored UI that makes it difficult to see areas to explore in the first place. The map UI is laggy and slow, the ability tree is full of garbage stat increases spread out in a convoluted way designed to look like a star constellation than be useful (Skyrim did it better). Your bird (Not every game needs to have a bird... classic Ubisoft copy and paste the same idea over and over again) is laggy and less useful than it was in previous games.

Enemy AI is bad. Just everything about this game other than maybe the character models, texture maps, and actual graphics is just B tier at best. Shockingly bad game. I got it for like 8 dollars on sale and wish I had spent that on a double down instead.","Mostly Positive71% of the 17,395 user reviews for this game are positive.",ac cannot_bring finish consider massive fan series historical geek tend buying sale numerous gripe series forever strong prevent maybe 3rd action game evolved last year understatement feel cheap animation floaty bad budget sound design mixing bad desperately search setting internet earth sounded bad turn decided compress audio crazy save space voice acting boring forgettable side quest classic trash awful child voice actor skip combat bad feel bad weapon lack impact far floaty idea high difficulty die 1 2 hit enemy die 10 hit series continued hyper focused combat stealth completely failing combat engaging sad exploration suck turned pathfinder mode originally liked mode origin odyssey environment white snowcovered mountain light colored ui make difficult area explore ui laggy slow tree garbage stat increase spread convoluted designed star constellation useful skyrim bird not_every need bird classic copy paste idea laggy useful game enemy ai bad maybe model texture map actual graphic tier best shockingly bad 8 dollar sale wish spent double

1599340,Lost Ark,"Although I had a high number of hours in the game, I want to say at least half that was spent idling the game in one form or another, since it doesn't auto-close if you trigger the afk disconnect. 

I've uninstalled it for three reasons: 

1) AGS sucks. AGS protecting our wallets is a meme in the community because they are so slowly releasing more of the (I'm not kidding) hundreds of skins present in the South Korean version of the game. The company devoted themselves fully to dripfeeding the worst looking skins in the entire catalog, 1-2 per month, long term.

2) The bot problem is so out of control, it's just as infested as Runescape 2 was by bots in 2005-2006. Bots in Lost Ark swarm like locusts clustering together across the starting areas of the game and the major cities zooming around with their speedhacks along the same paths. They also spam advertisements in area chat, which happens to be the one chat where anyone bothers to say anything, so you have to put up with the spam and blocking and reporting to see any human conversations in the game. 

Life skills as a result of the bot population are close to worthless. Infinite chaos dungeons are a very boring alternative for making more gold and I'm certainly not swiping my credit card to progress faster either. Let me put infinite chaos dungeons to you this way: some people I've spoken with ingame have described grinding them out as ""brain melting"". Others claimed it was a guaranteed road to burning out. Lost Ark players reading this may counter, ""If you need gold, just make alts!"". I'm getting to that.

3) The gameplay loop is so simple and stale. If you make 6 characters, expect 2.5-3 hours of chaos dungeons and guardian raids you've already done, every single day or every 3 days if you want to get optimal gold and material gains. Argos will add even more time to your weekly quota, though it will get easier in the future as people outgear him. If reset day came and you aren't running 6 1370 characters, lord help you, it's time to spam abyssal dungeons which are a massive time sink across 6 alts even if you party finder for varying reasons. Maybe your teammates don't understand mechanics. Maybe party finder is slow during your time of play. Maybe your teammates just want to make everyone sit through cutscenes (which require a unanimous vote to skip). If you think like me, someone who simply cannot play games in as a casual for very long, you have to play more than 3 hours a day if you want to go participate in the other content in the game, like quests, or the many collectibles or even the time gated islands that only appear a few times a day. 

It is so easy to burn out with the current gameplay loop that even Smilegate's own past statistics reflect a massive decrease in the South Korean playerbase during their version of this era of the game (pre-Legion Raids). Smilegate must have made a lot of money back then to force the Western regions to experience the same hellish era. 

* In writing this review, I came to realize a fourth reason I'm done playing the game. 

4) Waiting 3 days is possible because of rested bonus, which the community generally considers time-efficient. I was obligated to ask myself after waiting for rested bonuses enough times on my alts, ""Why am I waiting 3 days to play a game on a specific character?"". My answer took shape as, ""The game is almost like a bad job, the chores are so tedious"". I have never encountered another mmorpg to make me feel so bored. If I got bored in BDO, for example, I could go ride my turbo horse around the region, I could go fish, I could jump my Tamer mount off mountains for fun. If I got bored in Runescape, I could play minigames, something Runescape did best. If I got bored in Path of Exile, I could make a new build, run special maps or decorate my hideout extensively. 

Lost Ark's side activities are nowhere near as entertaining as the ones I've encountered in other mmos, except for PVP. Smilegate's game is so extraordinarily barebones when it comes to its fun activities that I feel like it meets the bare minimum requirements to pass as a game outside of its dailies. It feels like a very poorly made skinner box. Legion Raids will improve upon my complaints but not enough to bring me back. Miraculously, Smilegate's mmorpg convinced me to look for enjoyment in my creative hobbies again.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",high number hour half spent idling form auto close trigger keyboard disconnect uninstalled three reason 1 ag suck ag protecting wallet meme community slowly releasing not_kidding hundred skin present south korean version company devoted dripfeeding worst skin catalog 1 2 per long term 2 bot problem control infested runescape 2 bot 2005 2006 bot swarm locust clustering across starting area major city zooming speedhacks along path spam advertisement chat happens chat bother spam blocking reporting human conversation life skill result bot population close worthless infinite chaos dungeon boring alternative gold certainly not_swiping credit card progress faster infinite chaos dungeon spoken ingame described repeatedly performing action gain resource brain melting others claimed guaranteed road burning player reading counter gold alt 3 loop simple stale 6 character expect 2 5 3 hour chaos dungeon guardian raid already single 3 day optimal gold material gain argo add weekly quota easier future outgear reset running 6 1370 character lord help spam abyssal dungeon massive sink across 6 alt party finder varying reason maybe teammate understand mechanic maybe party finder slow play maybe teammate sit cutscenes require unanimous vote skip someone simply cannot_play game casual long play 3 hour participate quest collectible gated island appear time easy burn loop smilegate past statistic reflect massive decrease south korean playerbase version era pre legion raid smilegate force western region hellish era writing realize fourth 4 waiting 3 day possible rested bonus community generally considers efficient obligated ask waiting rested bonus time alt waiting 3 day play specific answer took shape bad chore tedious never_encountered massively multiplayer online role bored bored bdo example ride turbo horse region fish tamer mount mountain fun bored runescape play minigames runescape best bored path exile build special map decorate hideout extensively s_emphasizedide activity nowhere near entertaining one encountered mmos except versus smilegate extraordinarily barebones come fun activity meet bare minimum requirement pas daily feel poorly skinner box legion raid improve complaint not_enough bring miraculously smilegate massively multiplayer online role convinced enjoyment creative hobby

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Don't let the low pricetag fool you, you're basically forced to pay a subscription or dump cash into the game at some point, the $20 into is to lure you in, and once you're invested, you're going to get slapped.

This game is plagued by completely unethical business practices, at every corner they're jabbing you for more and more money.

[u]ESO Plus:[/u] 
- You get a ""Stipend"" of 1650 crowns for subscribing, which is about $15. This is mental trickery. You're paying for crowns, and being given access to things you -should have access to in the first place-. IE: Crafting Bag, More Storage, old DLC/dungeons, ect.
- Game is ""Buy to Play"" but you have to either buy the DLC areas, or subscribe to ESO Plus to ""unlock"" (most) of them without having to back-pay. If you want to permanently unlock these additions, it's ~$15-$35 each. About $350 worth at a -modest- estimate. Not only do you have to pay for old expansions. You have to pay for modules (such as the thieves guild) and dungeons.
- ESO Plus doesn't include the newest expansion, so tack on another $40-$60

[b][i]So that's ESO Plus, that doesn't even touch the cash shop and other poor practices. Here's some more.[/i][/b]
- There's 3 alliances, dictated by what race you play. Unless you pay $20 for the any race any alliance upgrade, you're stuck in that alliance. This only counts for PvP anymore, but when the game came out, it mattered a lot.
- Appearance ($10), Alliance ($25), or Name/Race Changes ($25-$35) are all horribly, horribly priced.
- You can't trade cash shop currency/crowns with other players. You can ""Gift"" packs of crowns to other people. This has resulted in a network of scamming where people wish to pay others ingame currency for cash shop currency, and get ripped off/scammed.
- The mount system is -garbage-. In other MMO's they scale all mounts to the best one you have (on that character). In ESO, you have to ""train"" your mount skills. Per Character. They sell shortcuts for this arbitrary grind in the cash shop.
- Want to do crafting? They sell shortcuts for that grind too.
- Mobile Banker / Merchant? $50 a piece.
- Cosmetic outfit slots? Sorry, those are per-character only. They're also $15 a piece.
- Player Housing is a mixed bag, because some stuff can be purchased ingame, and other stuff can only be bought with crowns.
- Player housing crafing benches? $30 a piece, and it can only be used in one house.
- Endless amounts of cosmetic mounts/outfits/pets.

[b]TL:DR[/b] for all the MTX in this game.[/b]
Arbitrarily small bank/character storage you can pay/subscribe to increase or improve? ☑
Inability to trade premium currency between players easily? ☑
Per-character upgrades that -should- be account-wide? ☑
Cash shop items to skip grinding? ☑
Expensive player housing items? ☑
Rotating deals in the storefront? ☑
Overpriced convenience items? ☑
Normal Mounts/Cosmetics? ☑
Lootboxes? ☑

Honestly, if it weren't for the horrible, horrible monitisation, I'd love this game. I love running around as a cat person or lizard, actually playing things in-character with friends, and learning about the Elder Scrolls universe, but, it's just too greedy.

A lot of people have been coming to this review, saying none of these things are ""necessary"" to play the game. That isn't the point of this review. This review is to warn people that this game sells an -insane- amount of microtransactions, [i]a lot of which are time-skips or solutions for systems they put in place.[/i]

If you can look past all the money grubbing, and just want to play a game set in the Elder Scrolls universe, you might be fine. Grab a subscription and go for it. This game -does- have some pretty good quests, and tons of lore, but the main point this review is this:

[b] The price you pay is the just the entrance fee, and they're going to be asking for a lot more.[/b]

People are wired differently. Some people can completely ignore MTX. Some people don't care how their character looks as long as they can pump big numbers in raids, but personally, the -sheer amount- of stuff they have for sale in this game keeps me away from it. The cash shop is pushed in your face on every log-in. It takes months to max out your mount on -each- character. Things that -should- be account-wide, are not. The -worst- thing out of it all, is that you can't trade other players crowns, they can only be gifted, and that's a big giant rotten scam.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",low pricetag fool you_emphasized basically forced pay subscription dump cash 20 lure invested slapped plagued completely unethical business practice corner jabbing eso plus stipend 1650 crown subscribing 15 mental trickery paying crown given access thing access ie crafting bag storage old downloadable additional released initial launch dungeon ect play downloadable additional released initial launch area subscribe eso plus unlock pay permanently unlock addition 15 35 350 worth modest estimate not_only pay old expansion pay module thief guild dungeon eso plus include newest major addition add feature mechanic tack 40 60 eso plus touch cash shop poor practice s_emphasizedome 3 alliance dictated race play unless pay 20 race alliance upgrade stuck alliance count versus anymore mattered appearance 10 alliance 25 name race change 25 35 horribly_emphasized priced t_emphasizedrade cash shop currency crown player gift pack crown resulted network scamming wish pay others ingame currency cash shop currency ripped scammed mount garbage massively multiplayer scale mount best eso train mount skill per shortcut arbitrary grind cash shop crafting shortcut grind mobile banker merchant 50 piece cosmetic outfit slot per 15 piece housing mixed bag stuff purchased ingame stuff bought crown housing crafing bench 30 piece house endless amount cosmetic mount outfit pet tl dr mtx arbitrarily small bank storage pay subscribe increase improve inability trade premium currency player easily per upgrade wide cash shop item skip repeatedly performing action gain resource expensive housing item rotating deal storefront overpriced convenience item normal mount cosmetic lootboxes honestly horrible_emphasized monitisation love love running cat lizard thing friend learning scroll universe greedy appended 12 8 20 saying thing necessary play t_emphasizedhe warn sell insane microtransactions skip solution system i_emphasizedf past grubbing play set scroll universe fine grab subscription pretty good quest ton lore price pay entrance fee asking wired differently completely ignore mtx care look long pump big number raid personally sheer stuff sale keep cash shop pushed face log take month max mount thing wide not_the worst t_emphasizedrade player crown gifted big giant rotten scam

686810,Hell Let Loose,"This review is written from the perspective of someone who has predominantly played Battlefield, and only Battlefield, since 1942 came out when I was in high school. Therefore it draws heavily on comparison between the two games, not to try to contribute to any kind of rivalry, but because it's really my only frame of reference. I'm in my mid-30s with a full-time job, so most would probably consider me a filthy casual, but I've been playing long enough to not be completely clueless.

With that said:

Hell Let Loose is the kind of epic scale, cooperative shooter that I always wanted Battlefield to be. When BF2042 came out and abandoned many of the core ideas that drew me to the series initially, I turned to Hell Let Loose out of desperation. I'm glad I did, because HLL is chock-full of those ostensibly ""only in Battlefield"" moments that keep you coming back.

If you're coming to the game from Battlefield like me, it's important to note that this is a far less arcade-y, far more strategic game. When I got started, I was constantly getting one-shotted a few seconds after spawning. Because getting it wrong is so punishing, HLL forces you to learn about good positioning and battlefield awareness. In fact, I noticed that after a few months of playing HLL that when I went back to BFV, my play had improved significantly. While definitely more hardcore than Battlefield, once I adapted I didn't find gameplay significantly more difficult or tedious, or less action-packed.

Is the game perfect? No, definitely not. It's not as polished as a AAA game, the graphics are good but not spectacular, performance isn't always great, and many of the mechanics are boring and/or frustrating (artillery, resource nodes). But the most significant factor that has made it easy to look past these complaints is the awesome community.

I had not played other, more hardcore shooters (like Squad or Post Scriptum) before, but the veterans I played with were friendly and helpful and helped me quickly acclimate. While I regularly play with a friend, unlike in Battlefield, it's not a night and day different experience between squadding up with friends and squadding up with randoms. Mic use is prevalent (in fact, I wouldn't recommend playing without one) and I've had many, many games on public servers with a full squad communicating and working together. It's awesome. 

I'll end with a tip about the game that I wish I had known before I started. Obviously, it's not a game that you win by K/D ratio alone, but then neither is Battlefield. But unlike Breakthrough or Frontlines, it's not even really about attacking or defending cap points, either. While these things are all obviously important components, at its heart this is really a game about SPAWN POINTS: building your own (garrisons, outposts) and finding and destroying the enemy's. Without actively prioritizing both of these things, I rarely see teams win, even if they're doing everything else correctly.

In short, this game saved me from the pit of sadness I experienced after the disappointment that was BF2042. I've played a ton over the past few months, and almost every game is fresh, dynamic and chaotic. It's taken on the mantle of delivering the large-scale, historical combined arms combat experience it seems DICE is no longer able to deliver. In many ways, I consider it the true spiritual successor to the original Battlefield 1942 I fell in love with so many years ago.","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",written perspective someone predominantly battlefield battlefield 1942 high school draw heavily comparison game not_to contribute kind rivalry frame reference mid 30 probably consider filthy casual long not_be completely clueless kind epic scale cooperative shooter wanted battlefield bf2042 abandoned core idea drew series initially turned desperation glad hll chock ostensibly battlefield moment battlefield important note far arcade far strategic started constantly shotted second spawning wrong punishing hll force learn good positioning battlefield awareness noticed month hll bfv play improved significantly definitely hardcore battlefield adapted significantly difficult tedious action packed perfect no_definitely not_it not_as polished a_emphasizedaa graphic good not_spectacular performance great mechanic boring frustrating artillery resource node significant factor easy past complaint awesome community not_played hardcore shooter squad post scriptum veteran friendly helpful helped quickly acclimate regularly play friend unlike battlefield not_a night different squadding friend squadding randoms mic prevalent recommend many_emphasized game public server squad communicating working awesome tip wish known started obviously not_a win k ratio alone neither_is battlefield unlike breakthrough frontlines not_even attacking defending cap point thing obviously important component heart player enemy enter world point building garrison outpost finding destroying enemy actively prioritizing thing rarely team win else correctly short saved pit sadness experienced disappointment bf2042 ton past month fresh dynamic chaotic taken mantle delivering large scale historical combined arm combat dice no_longer able deliver way consider spiritual successor original battlefield 1942 fell love year ago

1599340,Lost Ark,"tl;dr - If you're a loner or a solo player, just avoid it. This is a cookie cutter Korean Party Grind.

Text below is my personal opinion. I am a casual ARPG enjoyer.

Leveling content is basically point and click adventure, with occasional use of skills. The idea is to simply speed run main quests.
Killing monsters, doing side quests and side content is waste of time - literally.
Story becomes mind numbing, especially when the idea is for you to have multiple alts.
Entire effort is put onto endgame grind loop and money ""draining"". Certain quests are halted, because you can't craft items, due to gold being removed for low levels, at the same time no adjustments had been made to the quests, all to combat the bots.
Daily rewards are heck knows what. Bunch of items, currencies and things you have no idea how to use or what to do. Of course it's for endgame, but sadly there is no button to skip to endgame, free of charge. I have to sit and do quests for dozen more hours.

Publishers mentality seems like ""Soon it will be okay"".
Maybe I'll give a try ""Soon"". For now the game reminds of ""Make Love not Warcraft"" Southpark episode, where the gang reaches max level by wasting weeks for leveling, kill the bad guy and wonder what to do next, and the Cartman says - ""What do you mean what to do? We can finally play the game"".

If it launched with co-op support I would've maybe been more fine with it. Otherwise there's plenty of survivor-like games that are free that are better in every regard.

The game lacks meaningful upgrades; you pick between firerate / reload speed / damage and occasionally you can switch damage type or pick an overclock, which is an amalgamation of possibly 4 stats. +15% firerate or +15% reload speed as options are not interesting, because it doesn't matter what you pick, it might as well be just +15% damage so long you're not hitting diminishing returns. Additionally, there is no diversity in weapons and at best it's a choice in which order you get them. Unless they can push out weekly content updates I don't think will ever be in a state where it is interesting to play, unless you really fawn over the DRG brand.

1144200,Ready or Not,"Devs are redpilled on a lot of things. 

Gameplay feels well-paced. Every bullet feels like it has punch. The sound design and visuals make gunplay autistically realistic and offers a lot of dynamic ways to approach every feature of the game itself. You have a myriad of options regarding loadouts and customisation. 

The level design has recently turned from ""tech demo"" to ""New Vegas levels of environmental story telling"" that create really bitter and gritty tones that in some cases will make pulling the trigger a bit easier. The levels in RON are an art into themselves with contextual NPCs and dialogue to accompany them. Each level is standout and unique. Levels also change sometimes depending on gamemode which means some sections will close off or new areas open. 

The bot AI is competent but this is best enjoyed with friends/randoms. The game seems to have a growing community across the world so there is always someone out there to help with a mission. Teamwork is what sets the difficulty of each mission. 

The enemy AI keeps getting better. At first they were the ""John Wick"" archetype or utterly clueless. Now they've come a long way. They hide, they play dead, the react to sounds and lights, they'll spray through walls, they will pretend to surrender and hide weapons on themselves and if their morale is broken they'll even kill themselves. You can also deal different types of damage. If you're bullets are of a lower calibre you wont penetrate an enemy with body armour. Alternatively you can shoot them in the leg/arm and they're more likely to comply. A shot to the chest might miss a vital organ and they keep fighting whilst bleeding out or sometimes you just need a snap shot to the head to put the beefier enemies down. 

Enemies are also contextual to their levels and behave appropriately. So for example the crack-fuelled psychos of the crackhouse mission will run around carelessly, they aren't afraid to magdump in a room full of civilians either. Organised professional terrorist/political activist groups like the jihadis at the gay nightclub are harder to break regarding morale and the ex-military guys of the Brisa cove will try to flank, use cover and put their expertise to use against you. 

It will feel like a horror game at times. 

Overall, the game offers fantastic features and dynamic approaches to every possible situation. There is immense replayability which is enhanced by the growing modding scene.

230410,Warframe,"upd8: please look at the first two comments for more things I reviewed! comments contain spoilers!

this game tends to be one of two things for most people: either you love it & sink countless hours (and maybe dollars) into it, or you pick it up for a couple hours & put it back down.

this doesn't need saying, but I fall into the former category.

Warframe is a masterfully done game that offers its players a lot of choices not just for what they want to do, but also how they want to do it. you can spend your days designing rooms and outfits. you can sneak through puzzles trying not to get caught, or slash through wave after wave of enemies where your only objective is don't die. you can play as a swordsman, or a magnet, or a golem, or a dj, or something else out of the 30+ warframes they have available (each with their own unique kit of abilities).

pve has never felt this satisfying and engaging. the game has a good balance of quick ""get in get out"" missions, as well as endless missions with rotating rewards (this way you get incentive to stay, but also you don't feel bad for leaving). the sound design team deserves a medal, because this game is the only fps I've played that makes me feel satisfied through sound, not just rewards.

speaking of design, the world is incredibly interesting, & so are all the factions living in it. each has its own unique visual style & moral code, we're not seeing reskinned enemies going ""I wanna destroy the tenno cause reasons!"" or reskinned npcs going ""help me obi-wan kenobi, you're my only hope!"" over and over again. but that doesn't mean they're disconnected; we're constantly seeing people from different factions talking to each other & mentioning each other in passing. the connectedness of the people living in this world is a level of realism I'm not accustomed to in games that aren't 100% story driven, & it makes me appreciate the level of detail the devs use for this game.

that's not to say Warframe doesn't have a story. it's not always easy to find, & at times very frustrating to work through, but it's there and it's interesting and strange. (fwiw, a LOT of the story is told/enhanced through environmental storytelling. you're going to want to hunt for kurias, cephalon fragments, & synthesis targets. or consult the wiki!) the most I can say without spoiling things: you're caught in the middle of factions trying to fight each other, & they either want you with them or they want you dead.

Warframe is optimized to hell and back, to the point where I suspect it could run (poorly) on an apple watch. this optimization HAS gone down in recent months (they recently said that they're no longer supporting 32 bit machines and OS's before Windows 7), but that's still a lot of ground they cover. I was able to play Warframe with little to no issues on a laptop with a terrible graphics card (seriously it couldn't handle Skyrim with the lowest settings). this is an incredible achievement, especially when you consider the details and particle effects the game contains.

also you can get dogs, cats, & pet robots. petting your animals is a game mechanic that gives them buffs. you can fly around in space. you have dance emotes. you can get capes & jet packs & bobbleheads & action figures. you're a robot ninja in space! and all of this is free!

now I've spent a lot of this waxing poetic about how great Warframe is, but this game isn't without its faults. you should know what you're getting into if/when you get this game.

if you're strictly free-to-play, this game is a huge grind. gaining platinum (the paid currency that allows you to get cosmetics, progress boosters, weapon/warframe slots, and weapons/warframes if you don't feel like building them) is best done by getting things called prime parts, which are random drops from relics. you can trade these prime parts to other players for platinum (there are other things you can trade, but prime parts are basically the only things that'll get you any platinum). I wouldn't go so far as to say that rewards in this game resemble a loot box system (the devs have removed systems in the game that act as slot machines), but that doesn't mean it's without frustrations. basically, if you don't want to give Digital Extremes your money for platinum: you have to grind a lot of missions to get prime parts, which you can trade for platinum, which then makes grinding less frustrating. life's rough if you don't have money to spare.

it's also frustrating when you want to get That One Thing you need, but it's the rarest thing on a drop table. again, I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate the devs going out of their way to eliminate loot box/slot machine systems from this game! but often you're stuck with either 1) deciding if you want to take a shortcut by spending platinum, or 2) not having any shortcuts to take so you just keep grinding and grinding. (one time I asked someone if they played Warframe, & they said ""if I wanted to grind I'd go to a club."")

the story doesn't get engaging until Natah. Natah is a quest which you can't access until you can do missions on Uranus, which is also the planet where enemies suddenly get a LOT harder. this point is basically where the game is like ""we're not holding your hand anymore, you need to start upgrading your weapons/warframes."" (funny enough, upgrading your stuff ALSO involves unskippable grinding, but this time it's less rewarding!) Natah has been out since 2015, and by now it's what brings new players into the game (along with the quests that come after it). trouble is, new players are going to want to rush to get to these quests. and by rushing, without taking the time to upgrade their stuff by painstakingly grinding it to rank 30 over and over again, they're going to suffer and get frustrated. this game needs to do more story-wise to not just capture new players' attentions, but to also keep them. (seriously, when I played The Second Dream for the first time, I had to take a long break from Warframe. I was rank 6-7, I was constantly overwhelmed, & I was too busy trying to stay alive to actually pay attention to the story. it sucked.)

DE enables this by making Natah available to people who are as low as rank 3. that's not to say I have a problem with newbies playing the main story! my problem is with DE making it available, but also making the level scaling completely inaccessable. if you're going to make this quest available to people as low as rank 3, you need to make it so that they can actually succeed at it. otherwise what's the point?

not all the quests in your codex are repeatable. so far only the ones that are directly tied to the main storyline can be repeated, & even then it feels really random. I can replay the quest that introduces me to the infested faction way at the beginning of the game... but I can't replay Natah? the quest that basically starts the whole mess of events that we're going through? come on!

now this IS a free to play game, more often than not. so maybe these things won't bother you. that's totally fine, it's just something you should keep in mind if you ever feel like spending money on this game. (which isn't something I'm against, ftr; Digital Extremes is one of the few dev teams out there which I can safely say respects their players and makes sure their game is fun and not just a way to make money.)

ultimately, I recommend trying it, especially if you can get some other friends to join you. you're gonna have a good time! and if you ever get stuck, there's a lot of people who can show you the ropes!","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"Positives :
1. The best visuals in the genre that we would see for a while given the actual lack of competition within the genre, the upcoming product from competitors have openly stayed that they won't even try to compete in visual department.
2. The offered standard aircrafts are reasonably detailed both in visuals and systems
3. Game is continuously being updated, with the upcoming (as of this writing) 40th anniversary edition would add more free aircrafts and officially reintroduce helicopters to the franchise
4. Easy access to mods both via in game marketplace and external means.
5. Payware addons are reasonably priced
6. Upcoming update would bring DX12 (ironically funny for a flagship Microsoft franchise) and DLSS that would help the performance.

Negatives :
1. The game has the worst file system management *ve ever seen from any games... 

Potential buyers from steam ought to know that steam would only handles the launcher and the essential platform files for the game, the rest would come from Microsoft servers... And that is notorious for having problems, you would experiences things like download loop, redownload ING the whole file or even the whole game after your download paused or crashed or your internet was down, verifying the game via steam could result in total redownload etc... Just Google it, it can be a nightmare.. I spent like 100 hours alone just downloading, updating and redownload ING the game, so keep that in mind.
2. Because of the aforementioned issue, you would surpass the steam refund time in no time so beware.
3. Performance on my hardware is decent but there are stupid design decision like the 3D render on the main menu basically a waste of your resources (going to have a remediy in the next game update)... Also this game basically demands a balanced PC, powerful CPU, GPU, loads of RAM and SSD are basically necessary, but the genre has always requires that soft of PC...

1144200,Ready or Not,"Just when everyone thought 2021 was over in terms of relevant releases, [i]Ready or Not[/i] appeared out of thin air. Well, not exactly out of thin air. People knew it was coming, and it has been under development for a while now, but [i]Void Interactive[/i] was being rather secretive with the early access release date, throwing people off the scent with a [i]Twitter[/i] post two days before the public EA release with the classic “it just might come out this year”. And it did. 

[i]Ready or Not[/i], or [b]RoN[/b] like people usually refer to it, is a tactical shooter in the making, that promises to eventually become just as good as the legendary [i]SWAT 4[/i] from [i]Irrational Games[/i]. Your character is a [i]SWAT[/i] operator and your job is to arrest or kill bad guys, make sure civilians are safe and apprehend drugs, illegal weapons, destroy human trafficking schemes, and so on. The usual tactical police stuff, done brilliantly. You can either play alone with four AI-controlled teammates or cooperatively with up to four teammates, with the twist that there’s no friendly AI to offer a hand or two, meaning that heading to the mission with just one or two friends will be rather challenging. The enemy count varies per map and it’s often dependent on the environment: some will naturally have a higher civilian to bad guy ratio due to its sheer likeliness while the opposite also occurs. Currently, there are five different maps to choose from, with an extra two [i]WIP[/i] environments, still untextured and ridden with glitches. Granted, it’s still an early access title and more maps are going to be released, along with full modding support so that the community can also help provide extra content to warrant unlimited hours of fun.

As far as content is concerned, there isn’t a lot just yet, but the variety is good enough to allow different approaches to each mission so that the replay factor is nearly endless. From your average M4 rifle to a paintball gun (yup), they got you covered. The gear list is also rather extensive, with different vests, masks, cop paraphernalia like battering rams, breaching shotguns, C2 explosives, flashbangs, even a camera thing that allows you to look under doors. Who’d ever imagine that voyeurism could be used to enforce law and order!

As it couldn’t be any different with an [i]Early Access[/i] title, some things still do not work as expected, an OK thing if it gets fixed, and it probably will. The AI can be rather unpredictable sometimes, with civilians running from you, sometimes locking themselves in rooms with the enemies, or just straight up hiding from you and making your mission take a lot longer because you and your friends end up forced to play tridimensional [i]“Where’s Wally?”[/i].  Something else that might annoy you ever so slightly is the fact that civilians and enemies don’t have a lot of different voice lines, meaning you will hear the same sentences over and over even during the very same mission. Granted, it’s probably a placeholder. On that same note, the cop’s voice is way too calm, which differs a lot from real-life operator footage telling bad guys to drop their weapons. But once again, a placeholder card probably applies. 

The gameplay aspect is where [i]RoN[/i] truly shines, sporting the possible best gunplay on the market, shootouts are dynamic and challenging. The AI can be very accurate at times, making it so you and your friends got to be on the very edge, with eyes wide open. It doesn’t take much to die, just like in real life. You are not a bullet sponge, nor are the enemies or civilians. As a matter of fact, civilians are even more fragile, so be mindful of that and take extra care when breaching into a room with thugs and civvies inside. That’s where the tactical element comes into play and cohesive play rewards you, while recklessness can be punishing. There are multiple ways to approach the different situations that you will be faced with and no right answers. Go with your guts, trial and error, or develop standard operating procedures with your friends so that everyone knows what to do and what not to do to get things done the cleanest way possible. It’s easier said than done, as [i]Ready or Not[/i] is very hard and will give you a tough time if you are not paying enough attention. The sheer unpredictability makes for very fun and engaging gameplay. 

It would be interesting to have a little more dynamism on certain stuff, like objective items that always spawn at a fixed location, making it so you always know where to go and how to get there efficiently without major hiccups, which is good from a speedrunning standpoint but doesn’t help when it comes to longevity, because it will get repetitive quickly. On the other hand, enemy spawn points are always random, with no mission playing the same, even if the items will always spawn at the very same location. Just like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get.

Visually, [i]RoN[/i] is impressive. Powered by [i]Unreal Engine 4[/i], it certainly does not disappoint with textures, lighting, level design, and performance. It doesn’t take much to run, and my old faithful [i]RTX 2070[/i] could easily run it on epic settings in 1080p, well above 100 fps, with eventual drops here and there. As expected from any so-called next-generation title, it supports [i]DLSS[/i], which boosts the overall performance quite significantly, up to 40% even in sub-4K resolutions, without compromising the visual acuity, meaning no ghosting, no artifacts, as clear as it can be. A really solid implementation, even more so considering it’s still a work in progress.

It’s no exaggeration to say that [i]Ready or Not[/i] is perhaps one of the most solid early access releases ever. As much as it still has a lot of things that are not quite up to standard yet, the gameplay mechanics and the challenge are enough to keep you coming back for more. A breath of fresh new air into a genre that we haven’t seen much from, apart from [i]Zero Hour[/i]. It was a long, painful wait, but SWAT 4’s spiritual successor is finally among us and it’s great.

236390,War Thunder,"As much as I want to recommend this game, I can't. The grind for vehicles is insane, and as you progress further and further, the more annoying the grind is alongside having to fight spawncampers every now and then in ground forces. Sea battles is mediocre compared to World of Warships. The combat mechanics are great though.

EDIT (July 29th, 2019, previous edit was June 29th): To iterate on what I mean. I don't recommend the game in it's current state, but it's still one of the better games for vehicular combat out there. If you want to try it out, I won't stop you, it's actually pretty fun, but the way Gaijin's been handling things for the past 2 years hasn't really sat well with me, especially with how they've been just adding on content (Which isn't bad), but haven't been fixing half the bugs and issues that have been popping up every update.

Also, to explain what I mean on the grind for vehicles. Starting with ground forces, from tiers 1 - 3, the grind isn't so bad. It's actually fun since you can duke it out with others on the maps without many problems other than, for example, spawn camping and (if you're running stock) the lack of FPE / Parts. However, as you proceed into tier 4, you start to notice small nuances, such as ultra-low quality players, or the rare hacker ( note, this is really, really rare, like 1/50 chance of even running into one based on my experience). The grind isn't too bad at this point, but you still have to deal with the occasional bullshit that occurs from time to time. Tier 5 is where it gets cheeky, where nuances begin to turn into annoyances, spawn camping occurs half the time, and either half your team or half of the enemy team quits within the first five minutes. Tier 6's grind is the longest (Understandably, but also has the most suffering), where the annoyances become everyday life, and is absolutely dreadful. 
>I didn't even mention CAS at all because TLDR: CAS is apparent in all tiers. Somewhat annoying at 1-2, Worst at 3-5, not too bad but if you don't have anyone running an AA vehicle with radar at tier 6, you're fucked. 

As for Aircraft, Same dealie, but Germans slap the shit out of anyone at 5.3ish. Bombers are practically useless since gunners are all zeroed at 200 meters iirc, and almost 3/4ths of the time when you play bombers, you'll be shot down either just before reaching the target or after dropping bombs on target. It's still fun as hell to fly in formation with other players and try to survive the onslaught though. Grind is better in aircraft to be honest, nothing too irritating comes to mind for grinding in aircraft. Gameplay for aircraft is also better despite just being Search and Destroy basically half the time. 

Naval? I uh.... I haven't really touched on naval, but I can definitely tell you it isn't as fun as WoWs.

EDIT (June 29th) : To add alongside this, it doesn't help that the most recent events for War Thunder have been mainly to encourage use of their ""Gaijin Market"", which is basically a 1:1 replica of the steam community marketplace minus the trading. 

Ground Forces at top tier is currently a mess, especially with the unbalanced, untouched maps being just released once and not tweaked again except for spawn areas even 5 years after they were released. The new shell calculations basically neutered french and japanese tanks at the start with terrible penetration values. Game modes have been the same since launch as well 5 years ago, one or three points, you push, capture and hold, rinse and repeat.

Air battles have and always been the same to me to be honest. There isn't much too bad about air forces, other than maybe how punishing it is to play bombers, or how in order to discourage players from playing certain aircraft, the repair cost for such certain aircraft is exorbitant compared to another aircraft that's also available at the same br in the same nation.

I'd also talk about jets as well, but it's somewhat? temporarily? fixed from what I can tell, with R2Y2s not having bomber airspawn anymore, and 9.0-10.0 being in a separate matchmaking section now. However, there are still problematic maps out there, especially for top tier jets, such as Battle for Wake island. This map in particular, it isn't too bad for prop aircraft since both teams have decent amounts of time to get up into the air and gain energy to duke it out with each other. However, for top tier aircraft, especially with the japanese having their hands on the T-2, and having an airspawn compared to the US where they have to take off from the airfield, and not even get 5km away from the island before being hounded on by Japanese aircraft with higher energy than them, it isn't really fair at all.

All in all, this game is decent for what it does below 7.0 in general, but when it gets past that point, alongside the grind and events that pop up every now and then that progressively get more grindy and grindy (Looking at you Battle Engineer), I can't say that i recommend this game at all.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:

1. Loading screens take forever.

2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.

3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.

4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.

5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.

6. The f*cking loading screens X___X

7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.

8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.

9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.

10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make. 

11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.

12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.

13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.

14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be).

15. And shark cards can gobble my balls.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"The first thing me, my cooperative-mode friend, & a viewer of my stream said at the same exact time was ""Man, these graphics suck!"".

The antagonist does not stir any emotions, the gameplay & character movement is way too fast paced, many parts of the story are flawed; such as the protagonist escaping a boat being riddled with holes; Castillo being allowed to get away with the crimes he does even with civilians & his son idling by, the difficulty of the game isn't there; with tanks being found five minutes after having left said riddled boat, & workbenches being absolutely everywhere & plentiful for weapon customizations, overall the game feels like a rinse & repeat; the trailers are not comparable to the game; as usual, they copied the same story from their previous titles; basically the same villain-&-influential-bystander-as-protagonist, same game mechanics made worse, same downgraded graphics rinse & repeat from their other titles, & so on. And Lita, oh how they mention this character so much when I was around them for not even a minute.

If you are someone who just wants a game to enjoy & pass the time, & does not care about an immersive story or solid, paced gameplay, then this is for you. 
If you are someone who came for a story to embrace, a game that felt long & filled with content, & genuinely memorable characters, then this is not at all the game for you.

For a big game with tons of storage space taken up, it has felt nothing shorter of a basic game with forgettable everything.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"After my main character, Emperor Illiya of Italy, a drunken fornicator and heretic, was assassinated while attending a ceremony, I switched to his grandson, Emperor Astore of Italy, who took to the throne at the age of 25. Astore was born of two white parents, yet suspiciously looked to be of partial African descent. Despite looking nothing like his ""father"", he still managed the Empire much better than his predecessor. His sister, Agostina, who also looked to be half-black, ruled the neighboring Empire of Francia. Because the realm split when Iliya died, they both had a strong claim on their respective empires. 

Despite this, they both considered each other great friends. And the comfort of this friendship helped Astore greatly after his firstborn son was mysteriously murdered. As an emperor, he was known to be extremely generous and kind. He helped put down many rebellions caused by his ""grandfather"", and restored much of the land which had previously been lost. By the time Astore was 75 years old, he had lived a long and content life. 

It all came crashing down, however, when an extremely old man offered to give Astore a secret in exchange for a favor. Expecting the secret to be some mundane thing, such as some man from India having slept with one of his courtiers, Astore reluctantly accepted the offer. However, the secret was nothing less than the true murderer of Astore's son: Agostina, his only sister, best friend, and faithful ally. 

Betrayed, Astore declared war on the 80 year old Agostina, shattering the alliance. The war waged for 4 years until she was eventually captured and executed. 

The fact that such an incredibly elaborate and detailed story can occur without any script whatsoever is amazing, and earns this game's acclaim.","Very Positive92% of the 66,890 user reviews for this game are positive.",emperor illiya italy drunken fornicator heretic assassinated attending ceremony switched grandson emperor astore italy took throne age 25 astore born white parent suspiciously looked partial african descent despite father managed empire predecessor sister agostina looked half black ruled neighboring empire francia realm split iliya died strong claim respective empire despite considered great friend comfort friendship helped astore greatly firstborn son mysteriously murdered emperor known extremely generous kind he_emphasizedlped rebellion caused grandfather restored land previously lost astore 75 year old lived long life crashing extremely old man offered astore secret exchange favor expecting secret mundane man india slept courtier astore reluctantly accepted offer secret murderer astore s_emphasizedon agostina sister best friend faithful ally betrayed astore declared war 80 old agostina shattering alliance war waged 4 year eventually captured executed incredibly elaborate detailed occur script whatsoever amazing earns acclaim

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"This game is a declaration from Fromsoft that there are more Souls fans than Armored Core fans. The hallmarks of a Souls game are all here. Animation locks and poor player attack tracking that forces massive commitment to every action. Perfect enemy tracking that invalidates positioning and maneuver and rewards split-last second dodging. Rapid player stunlocks that remove player agency and lead to instant death for a single missed dodge. Enemy stunlocks which are only available at great player expense and take mild pieces of the HP pool of enemy bosses. A ranged system which punishes attempts to remain outside enemy melee range. Boss melee attacks with lunges that often exceed weapon lock-on range.

And occasionally, you might get to do an AC vs AC duel that lets an Armored Core player remember what this series used to be about, and use that old skillset of maneuvering and tracking. But then you'll be back to the spectacle, the enormous bosses whose wildly cinematic presentation and flashy attacks really cement how insignificant you are as you spend your AC's entire ammunition storage to whittle away at their health bar only to die on one missed attack.

It looks nice. But I feel stupid now for making fun of all the articles trying to convince Elden Ring players that Armored Core might be a different genre. It used to be, but it's not now. I'm still going to fight through it, for old time's sake, but I'm not playing an Armored Core game, and I'm not enjoying my first Souls game.","Very Positive90% of the 50,561 user reviews for this game are positive.",declaration from_emphasizedsoft soul fan core fan hallmark soul animation lock poor attack tracking force massive commitment action perfect enemy tracking invalidates positioning maneuver reward split last dodging rapid stunlocks remove agency lead instant death single missed dodge enemy stunlocks available great expense mild piece hp pool enemy boss ranged punishes attempt remain enemy melee range bos melee attack lunge exceed weapon lock range occasionally ac v ac duel let core remember series old skillset maneuvering tracking spectacle enormous boss wildly cinematic presentation flashy attack cement insignificant spend ac ammunition storage whittle health bar die on_emphasizede missed attack look nice stupid fun article trying convince elden ring player core different genre not_now fight old s_emphasizedake not_playing core not_enjoying soul

From the visuals and scenery, to the open exploration, and the unique creature designs, not to mention to destructability of some environments, this game does a lot of things really well. It's worth $40.

That being said, I cannot explain to you how demoralizing it is to play a 40 minute mission with 20/20 samples, 2 side objectives done, and the main quest finished, only to disconnect as we extract and lose all of that progress. And to do that multiple times? F*ck that. That's horsesh*t.

In my opinion hands down the best Battle Royale game released.


+Built on a very flexible engine that is built to handle games of the FPS genre

+Core mechanics of the game are solid and function with little to no bugs (In my experience, I've personally only encountered 2 bugs)

+Vehicles that have good physics and good controls to them

+The game in most aspects visually looks great

+Plenty of weaponry (For release)

+Gun mechanics themselves feel very solid and fluid, weapons have recoil to them and for me feel ""weighted"" 

+Nice animations for all weapons currently in game

+The map size in my opinion is perfect. Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere 

++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for ""leaving you behind"" ) 



-Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon) 

-Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter ""fix"" does NOT work for everyone) 


Aside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. 



Overall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for them




System specs the game was played on:

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"As most people who are familiar with the Grand Theft Auto franchise I will not be reviewing the single player aspect of this game at all because there are countless reviews of that online.

Instead I will be focusing on the cesspool known as GTA: Online. The online aspect of this game has always been one thing and that is promising, I remember getting home excited on the 1st of October in 2013 (Crazy to think that that is 6 years ago almost) and loading into GTA: Online for the very first time, making my at the time god awful character (anybody who has played the old gen gta games can vouch that the character creator was even worse than it is now) and being so excited at this new world of possibilities, fast forward 2 weeks and this was all that myself and a bunch of my close friends would play, we would sink days on end into just roaming around the map having fun.

The world to us was limitless and we never got bored. I remember being the last one in my friend group to reach level 75 and unlocking rooftop rumble which we proceeded to grind until each of us was at least level 120 to unlock the last bit of content. After that all my friends kind of lost interest in the game, but not me. I started a hobby of collecting unique cars and meeting people and we would have car meets by the Los Santos Customs. This was an amazing thing for the then 16 year old boy whom I was. I still remember the excitement of the first christmas event when we woke up and the whole map was covered in snow, it was like an entire new experience.

One of the first games I got on my brothers ps4 was also to no surprise GTA V and again it was like a second wind to the game, there were more features on making your character look unique and the big one bigger lobbies and more new content to come. I played this on and off every time new content came out because I had my original character from my PS3 and they had a lot of money which I worked way too hard for, so the moment the DLC came out I would go on experience it buy all the clothing, cars, and properties I wanted and then played for a few days before leaving the game again.

During the 2019 Summer sale a few friends bought the game and I caved and got it as well, this was after a 4 year hiatus from the game so there was a lot to take in. I immediately got back to grinding away to get a high rank so I could unlock all that the game had to offer as well as to make money to again buy all the things I wanted. This led to me being up until 2 am on most nights for a few weeks just getting the most progress that I could. After making my way to Rank 100 and being satisfied I ran into a griefer who also had a mod menu at his disposal, he stated that everyone should make their way to the airport in game as he is going to be dropping money for people. I told him that I am fine since it was 2 am for me and I did not need his money. I was completely satisfied with working hard for my money. This person then dropped 2 bags of cash on me using their mod menu, then in game I saw my cash go up by $2 billion. I decided to log off because I didn't know what to do, and as I was attempting to write an email to rockstar support to ask if I could get this money removed from my account that's when I received the single most pathetic copy and paste email of my life stating that I have been banned for 30 days, this definitely made me feel betrayed as I was wrongfully banned for something that a lot of other people also get wrongfully banned. 

Fast forward to the 12th of August and I got my access to GTA online back and I did the one thing I knew would keep me happy, I continued to grind with the free content I was given from buying the Premium Online edition of the game (To anyone looking to play online this is a great purchase) and I made my way back the where I was at least in rank withing 2 weeks again. I was happy with helping friends with their import and export missions and just all round messing around in the game. That was until today when I helped a friend deliver cargo for their Business as they had just started out. After the delivery I decided to modify a car that I had been looking to find for a very long time. After I finished modifying my car and making my way to my friend to show him this car, I got interrupted by a haunting message. You have been permanently banned from GTA Online. Please return to GTA V. This was followed shortly by the aforementioned copy and paste email but this one changed to say permanently.

Now I know that I was playing legitimately and I was not cheating so I do not know why I got banned, however I do know one thing. The people behind GTA Online do not care about people cheating in their games, you will spend a lot of your time trying to escape people who have godmode or aimbots or just people who are caging you and all round stopping you from enjoying your  game. Those people might never get banned and if they do they will just buy a new account off of sites like G2A and get back to making money by modding peoples accounts. But if you are a legit player who spends a lot of time grinding to get money. You are more likely to get banned by them. I will never be supporting Rockstar Games again and that is a shame because as many of the other people who grew up with games, their games have always had a soft spot in my heart.","Very Positive86% of the 1,588,848 user reviews for this game are positive.",familiar franchise not_be reviewing single aspect countless review online focusing cesspool known gta online online aspect promising remember home excited 1st october 2013 crazy that_emphasized 6 year ago loading gta online god awful anybody old gen gta game vouch creator worse excited world possibility fast forward 2 week bunch close friend play sink day roaming fun world limitless never_got bored remember last friend group reach 75 unlocking rooftop rumble proceeded grind 120 unlock last bit friend kind lost interest not_me started hobby collecting unique car meeting car meet los santos custom amazing the_emphasizedn 16 old boy remember excitement christmas event woke covered snow game brother ps4 no_surprise gta wind feature unique big bigger lobby original ps3 worked hard moment downloadable additional released initial launch clothing car property wanted day leaving 2019 summer sale friend bought caved 4 hiatus i_emphasizedmmediately repeatedly performing action gain resource high rank unlock offer thing wanted led 2 night week progress rank 100 satisfied ran griefer a_emphasized modification alteration player fan menu disposal stated airport dropping told fine 2 not_need completely satisfied working hard dropped 2 bag cash modification alteration player fan menu saw cash 2 billion decided log attempting write email rockstar support ask removed received single pathetic copy paste email life stating banned 30 day definitely betrayed wrongfully banned wrongfully banned fast forward 12th august access gta online knew happy continued grind given buying premium online edition play online great purchase rank withing 2 week happy helping friend import export mission round messing today helped friend deliver cargo business started delivery decided modify car long finished modifying car friend car interrupted haunting message permanently banned gta online please gta followed shortly aforementioned copy paste email changed permanently legitimately not_cheating not_know banned gta online not_care cheating game spend trying escape godmode aimbots caging round stopping enjoying never_get banned site g2a modding people account legit spends repeatedly performing action gain resource banned never_be supporting rockstar game shame grew game game soft spot heart

1599340,Lost Ark,"I cant recommend it for several reasons. 

At first the community is insane toxic if somebody dont get a mechanic all will flame him to the death. 
Second the game has an insane learning curve in my opinion (that leads back to the first problem in my opinion, the toxcisity, because everybody gets frustrated) 
And the last problem why i cant play this game anymore and furthermore cant recommend it to anybody is, that nobody has patience to play a game more than 15 minutes. I miss the good old days when you had to try a raid over again and again to finish it and everybody had the patience to do it.

374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"I summoned a mad phantom with the intention of dueling him, but instead he sat down and offered to toast with me. We continued on throughout Undead Settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area. After a while, I became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his last, dying breath.

We were a team. The best of friends, and nothing could stand in our way. He may not have been a Warrior of Sunlight, but Solaire's legacy thrived on within him. Jolly co-operation resumed until we neared the Curse-Rotted Greatwood... And it was then that I decided to take yet another chance and summon a second Mound-Maker to see if we could rally him to our side.

The plan seemed successful at first. But it wasn't long before I noticed some suspicious patterns in the phantom's movement, and his interest in my backside became a significant concern. My anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missed.

My loyal protector raised both his hand and his middle finger at the attacker, before charging forward with fury the likes of which none in Lothric had seen. He made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at me, and before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath. He rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the ground, giving us an opening to attack. My companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of co-operation and sunlight.

The valiant protector lunged his sword deep through the attacker's back before he could escape, the weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk. I dropped down following this, and we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious glee.

But this was the end of our time together. We gave each other one final wave before my friend's body started to fade away as he was whisked back to his own dimension.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"This game has got some serious salt that comes along with it. 

So, my first and only bit of advice is; don't play this game when you're already in a salty mood. You're a pirate, you can see and guess what kind of asshattery people will present you with. 

The game graphics wise is beautiful, a lot of people will say the sea mechanics is a part of what makes this game and it does! The hand to hand combat is simple, but very engaging. You'll see what I mean if you get this game. You have a sword and three gun types to choose from. 
Combat at sea is fun with a fair few types of cannonballs to be using, your inner pirate will awaken at some point, one day you will say enough is enough with the PvE and losing your loot to PvP'ers, you realise you can't ignore PvP forever. On the one hand, there are pirates out there that live for PvP and others that live for PvE. 

PvE and PvP; some servers are more PvP, some servers are more PvE. You gotta scope the server out like reading the room. You can alliance up with another crew, you get half value of what they turn in which boosts profit for everyone. However pirate asshattery is to be expected even in an alliance. 
And in what feels like more of a PvE server, you will still get PvP. So always, even if its chill be on your guard. 

Thats basically it without going into the game in more detail. I won't go into the content of the game because you have to discover that stuff for yourself. Plenty of questing for treasure to be done thats for sure! And if you're more curious as to whats happening in the world around there is plenty of opportunity to explore and find out. 

I will say though if you're a new pirate its best to get on in with randoms if you've no one else to play with, you can have some bad experiences but there are plenty of people out there willing to show you the ropes. Its a case of being on the right boat :)

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"This game is very enjoyable.

Though, for those that are solo players: be prepared for frustration and anger.
As a new player I've had nothing but bad experiences meeting other players. Though they're far and few in between, I'm constantly being shot to pieces.

The dynamic events will jump on you at the worst possible times. Surviving a Kraken straight out of a respawn is not possible.

I don't have IRL friends to play with; and I think that's 90% of the experience in this game. I don't know how I feel about playing with strangers - but we'll see. I might try signing up for a crew soon enough - don't know yet.

I've been shot in outposts/safezones, had my boat sat on fire and you name it - it's not a solo friendly game. Know that when you buy it. If you HATE PvP... well, take a guess.

I've only played 28hrs as of this review and it's been solo.
I hope you get to enjoy the game if you buy it!


Edit on 07/06/2020
To clarify on Whiterabbit's comment:
- I'm not saying people shouldn't shoot each other, but that I used the first hours of me playing this game *trying* to learn the mechanics and it was overwhelming. I've been attacked straight after spawning in on new ship, while docking for my first voyage, while in town. The pirate code is just that: A CODE! not a rule. And I think PvE minded players need to be aware of that. There's no safe place; you can be shot, killed, and sunk anywhere at any time - even as a new player who just opened the game. I've also tried turning my back on my ship to turn in my treasure for like 20seconds, I came back and a Galleon had docked and sat my sloop on fire; they apologized and repaired my sloop and when I was out on voyage again, I noticed they had ripped my sloop for every possible resources. 

As an anchored sloop trying to do a voyage, meeting a PvP ready Galleon was by no means fun and they shot me only for the sake of shooting me. This type of encounters can be grueling and very demoralizing. New players need to be aware of this because it makes or breaks the game for some of them.

Not everyone is okay playing with other people due to anxieties and playing solo is their only option - this game will not be for them. I'm simply trying to make a certain group of gamers aware that there's no Single Player version of this game and you won't be left alone out there on the seas.

Solo and Single-Player is two very different things.

If I'm going to play with other people, I'll play with someone I know in real life.
The game does encourage team-work and I love that - even the alliance system is cool.

And I know I'm making it sound like the game is such a bad thing, but I just have to highlight certain events that'll make some people really bumped out about having spent 40EUR.

Personally I love the game to bits. There's things and details that annoy the living out of me, but I understand why it's done as it is. The treasure system is fantastic, I LOVE the riddles and bounties, I love the different factions and that some items can be turned in to any of them for extra experience. The Sailing mechanics are very enjoyable once you get it down - and sailing a sloop alone is almost therapeutic.

While the game is very linear and grindy, it's a joy.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",enjoyable solo player prepared frustration anger bad experience meeting player far constantly shot piece dynamic event worst possible time surviving kraken straight act enemy reappearing world defeated not_possible irl friend play 90 stranger signing crew soon shot outpost safezones boat sat fire name it_emphasized not_a solo friendly hate versus guess 28hrs solo hope enjoy 07 06 2020 clarify whiterabbit comment not_saying shoot hour trying learn mechanic overwhelming attacked straight spawning ship docking voyage town pirate code code not_a rule versus environment minded player aware no_safe shot killed sunk anywhere opened tried turning ship turn treasure 20seconds galleon docked sat sloop fire apologized repaired sloop voyage noticed ripped sloop possible resource an_emphasizedchored sloop trying voyage meeting versus ready galleon no_means fun shot sake shooting type encounter grueling demoralizing player aware make break not_everyone okay due anxiety solo not_be simply trying certain group gamers aware no_single version left alone sea solo single different thing play play someone real life encourage love alliance cool m_emphasizedaking sound bad highlight certain event bumped spent 40eur personally love bit thing detail annoy living understand treasure fantastic love riddle bounty love different faction item turned extra sailing mechanic enjoyable sailing sloop alone therapeutic linear grindy joy
899770,Last Epoch,"I have played 30 hours (not counting AFK time, maybe 23-25 hours) I will edit my review over time. 

I am a Kickstarter backer, but I decided to give it some time to get fleshed out before I tried really playing it. 
I check in on the progress from time to time, but only sat down to play this past week.
It is a good game it seems, and it has potential; so, I will give it a thumbs up... for now...

The skill system is great, I like the diversity in each class to have 3 master classes PLUS you can still use a bit of each mastery class as long as you stay under the vertical 50% mark of each mastery, AND you have a lot of choices to flesh out some truly unique builds. 
The skills are numerous, and are complimented by the mastery system very well. Each skill has it's own passive tree and that blows my mind, Even more diverse than I had thought!

My biggest complaint is... it seems dull and drawn out. 
Currently I have not reached the end game, a lot of people say it really picks up the pace there, but what about the leveling / storyline part? that is sorely needing some *oomph*!  
In the beginning, I explored EVERYWHERE... but later I found myself running to quest markers just to get stuff done. and see if something exciting would occur... but not even the boss fights intrigued me, and it all just seemed so easy.. except for an occasional monster that had some odd combination of affixes to make it difficult. I wish I could describe my view on this lackluster gameplay better than this, but I just cannot pinpoint it exactly.
I hope the devs do something to breathe life into the gameplay in the early parts of the game... because I just closed the game due to lack of interest.
I know I will get flamed for this statement, but Wolcen was a game that kept me interested..yes it was busted, but I still enjoyed playing.. and the story kept me wanting for more. 

That is my honest opinion of the game so far, and I am not going to apologize for it. you don't have to like it, but it is highly unlikely you will sway my decision... the devs have to do that!","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"Took the dive after watching some gameplay. I had 0 crashes over my ~5 hours of gameplay and performance was flawless (strong rig tbf). I had no real network issues and was able to play quick play the whole session just fine. Had some people d/c out of a mission here and there but some of them likely just quit cause they were getting torn to shreds.

Gameplay wise, I had a ton of fun. I think the customization/stratagem abilities are incredible and look forward to unlocking more weapons of mass destruction. Mostly played on ""challenging"" difficulty, which is a step up from normal. It is definitely challenging already and I'm looking forward to getting slaughtered by bugs in the harder modes. Maybe my perspective is helped because I had 0 expectations going in, but I was pleasantly surprised. The game is just fun to play and I think the systems are well designed.

The p2w stuff is completely overblown and you can earn the premium pass for free anyways. I do not feel any FOMO over the premium stuff and look forward to grinding this one out.

The anti-cheat is what it is, but I remember all the same complaints when Valorant launched with Vanguard... Is it ideal? Nah, not by a long shot, but based on some of the issues I heard about from cheaters in the first one, I'd say it's probably the lesser of two evils. I don't buy into the BS about the anti-cheat being there to protect their ""P2W"" model, since i think the p2w complaints are wildin after getting hands on with it.

Anyways, glad to see the reviews have turned mostly positive as I think this game scratches that co-op itch in a way other games haven't in quite awhile.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Below you will find a video of my first impressions with the game.

The game is very good. But here is the problem, most people come into it expecting Skyrim online. DO NOT DO THIS!

First let me get this out of the way, as this needs to be noted! 

If you look at the game as an MMO first and a TES game second you will not be disappointed. Others will look at the limitations compared to Skyrim or other TES single player games. Instead i look at the freedoms! I can loot just about every container i come across, i can go into pretty much every building i come across. Other mmo's don't do this. Other mmo's don't have things scattered across their dungeons to loot aside from corpses. Someone else might say ""well i can't pick up everything like i can in Skyrim"" No you can't, but what mmo let's you? In this you can at least interact with objects more than other games. 

The combat: You don't just stand in place watching cool downs! You have to react to your enemy, you have to block and dodge. You can't get away with auto attacking! They have improved the feel of combat, you don't feel like you are slicing thin air anymore. 

The community: It's amazing! Everyone i have spoken to has been extremely friendly, eager to group up, eager to role play and get into character. No one is arguing in the chat! No one is spamming to sell you gold.

The crafting: It's just as much fun as other TES games, collecting the reagents you need isn't a chore because the world is fun to explore and gather in! There are plenty of recipes to find and experiment with.

The world: The game looks great, it's not mind blowing great, but it does look good, especially for an MMO. This isn't going to look like a graphic mod for Skyrim so forget that! But it's no slouch either. The lighting is very well done but some textures can be bland. 

The customization: This is a big one! This game has a TON of customization options, dozens of skills to choose from which only get added on from joining things like the fighters and mages guild or becoming a werewolf or vampire! You can use any weapon and any armor type, there are thousands of builds for each class! The best customization i have ever seen and i've been a rabid MMO gamer since 2003. 

The crown store: It isn't pay to win! It's very similar to GW2 and there are only aesthetic options available. I was so pleased by this that i found myself WANTING to give them money in return for a cool looking mount, pet and costume. They don't pester you for money with pop ups or anything annoying like that. You buy the game and you choose to purchase aesthetics on your own terms. 

I haven't experienced PvP yet and i haven't got to end game, i am enjoying my time in the game as a slow burn and i recommend you do the same! DO NOT be in a rush to get to cap! Live in the world, enjoy your ascent!

In closing i will just say the game got a bad rep early on. Essentially people were paying for a beta until Tamriel Unlimited launched so i can understand their frustrations. But the game is in a MUCH better place now, i'm sure it's going to be very popular when it launches on consoles and the PC community seems to be growing now that the game is B2P! 

Thank you for reading my review and i hope you find it helpful.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft. It is the next installment in Assassin's Creed series and a prequel to Assassin's Creed III in terms of storyline.

Desmond Miles is dead, but his legacy continues. An unknown Abstergo Entertainment employee is doing research on Desmond ancestors in the familiar machine called Animus based on Desmond samples where he dives into the history of the one of many fearless and notorious pirates, Edward Kenway.

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag like Assassin's Creed III, get some gameplay change and improvements again. Most improvements are very good and makes the game more fun and entertaining. The story takes place before the event of Assassin's Creed III, you play as Edward Kenway, grandfather of Connor Kenway, and a father to Haytham Kenway. In some location in this game, like in the city of Havana, we can go back to the building climbing style of gameplay, while in most location where it's not a city, the tree climbing still present a lot. But the best thing this Assassin's Creed has to offer is sea battles, piracy. While not on mission or on the way to mission location, you can engage and loot Spanish or Her Majesty ships, fleets or convoy and loot them for money and resources. Ship-to-ship battles has been improved a lot in this game that most of the time you will forget the mission and do some piracy instead. Sometimes I wonder how a small Brig can take down 2 big Spanish Galleon without a scratch and live to tell the tale. But those moment are awesome. But that just only one of many new features in this game that you can try. There are other things you can do like hunting sharks, wales or any of those extinct fish, explore undersea shipwreck and gets eaten by sharks, attack and conquer Spanish and/or British coastal forts, or maybe you just want to play checkers here. Sadly the Assassin's Brotherhood feature has been taken out in this game and replaced with Kenway's Fleet new mini-game. But many of these features are great, and there is still more to see.

Graphics of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, for me, I don't know, I don't see much difference with Assassin's Creed III, except the effect on the sea. Sea can be very unpredictable here, sometimes the waves are calm, sometimes you have to face a small tsunami or hurricane which will damage you beloved ship. Performance of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is good, I haven't encounter any bugs or glitch and the game runs smoothly.

In multiplayer, mictotransactions are back, I don't know why Ubisoft do that, but it's not like you have to buy them, so no harm done here.

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, in my opinion, is the second best Assassin's Creed after Assassin's Creed II, ever. I recommend this.

All of the things you enjoy about AC games are here, with a new tropical setting that stands out from previous AC games. The naval element to the game is incredible also. Anything you'd want to do as a pirate is here, you swashbuckler you. Digging for treasure, swinging aboard destabilized enemy galleons, drinking rum to excess, wrestling gators with your bare hands, listening to your crewmen sing shanties as you splash your way through the open sea, having chats with Blackbeard, Kidd and Hornigold...

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"I have over 6 thousand  hours in this game, so I'd have some ground to stand on when it comes to posting an honest review of this game:

It's a fun game, when you are playing with the right people and don't really care too much about actual game-play. But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out. 

Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game. 

Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning. But, there are so many issues that need to be resolved that Krafton are just not addressing which is why I can't whole heatedly recommend this game.

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Well, this started off more poorly than I expected and for a reason that I dont see talked about much in other reviews. After dropping the $70 for the game, I was forced to download additional software to my PC in order to play the game, in addition to the Origin software I had from previous EA games. You may not think its a bit deal, but this software is by definition malware as its software I did not seek out, it is taxing to my system via background processes and is by design extremely difficult to eliminate. Seriously, check the end user agreement as they even openly state multiple links to various websites, including third party websites, for instructions at only removing part of the software before capping it off by saying that you will still have to eliminate remaining software manually from your local files. This is, frustrating, that a company can get away with such business practices and I have doubts about how legal this practice actually is. However, the damage is done for me at least, but buyer beware. 

Oh, I am also seeing frame rate drops even in just menus, but the game is otherwise playable in case you were just looking for that.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"It's pretty much the normal Madden roster update.  I hadn't played Madden in a number of years and wanted to pick this one up, remembering the fun I used to have playing franchise and head to head.  While it doesn't seem as though there's been much (if any) development in those areas, I guess I can say that it feels much the same as I recall.  So, if you enjoy playing an NFL game, this is decently good for that.  Unfortunately, it's currently your only option and therefore, lacks improvement.  Monopolies are never good.  For me, this satisfied my desire to play an NFL-based game.

Also, after reading others' reviews, I can say that I don't experience many of the same gripes they do.  My game isn't nearly as laggy as people make it out to be, and the AI players aren't nearly as bad as I recall them being in earlier versions of the game.  Sure the menus are slightly sluggish, but not nearly as bad ass people made them out to be in my opinion.

236390,War Thunder,"DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE PLAY THIS GAME

For context, I've been playing since Alpha. I've seen the good, the bad and what this game was promised to be. It is not that. They saw WoT as competition and based their model on that. Premium currency, premium tanks, a secondary ""auction"" currency and a lack of progress, promise-keeping and lack of direction has led this game down a dark hole it will never climb out of.

Thousands of hours (pre-steam launcher) and now 1000 on steam and this game has gone nowhere. From the old days of Kursk to the tired old skies of Europe, not much in this game has changed. Broken maps, one sided sight-lines, Ultra low quality players, lack of support and kneeling to the CCP. Nothing has changed. 

Except of course the lies. ""We will never add fire and forget missiles they said"" - 2014

""We will never go past 1960"" ""We will always make sure premium is not pay to win"" ""We want a free and fun game for everyone.""

With the release of tanks, were economy issues. Not enough tanks to play, so lower research gain. That was fair. When there was finally enough tanks to buff research gain, they buffed it. Then silently 2 weeks later raised how much it costs to research a tank by slightly more than the research buff was. 

Converting XP used to be a 400:1 Lion:GE. So, in a way you could fairly transfer XP from your hard earned money. Now it's a 40:1. Your dollar is worth 10x less now in this game. 

Like to be impenetrable from almost all angles except the rarely seen back of your turret? $250 CAD on the market will get you that. Oh yeah, did I mention ON TOP of having a Micro transaction research tree there's also a new built in market system like steam trading just for skins, tanks and other rare items. Where $1GJN (their currency) is worth almost $2 USD! But they don't tell you that when going to buy their currency.

So, not only can you pay the company to win, you can pay the players to win. 

The maps haven't changed from 2012 and earlier except for some cosmetics. Maps are decidedly unbalanced and spawning on a certain side guarantees victory. The physics engine, despite being great for the time of development is now lacking. Tanks are invisible until they fire (Depending on settings/bandwidth), network errors will cripple your plane and sent you into the abyss, oh and to top it all off you can now buy a helicopter for $60 USD that allows you to spawn behind enemy lines and fire 48+ AP rockets at people as they spawn. 

I've played this game since Alpha days. I've spent hundreds of dollars. I am somewhat addicted to this game because no other game comes close in what it does. 

But they lie. The devs, the publishing committee, the forum Mods, Game Masters and PR. They want you to feel like you're having fun because it's a fucking sand-casino. Hundreds of dollars and hours of time you can spend in a game that doesn't suck your soul dry. 

""Maybe this time."" ""One more match and I can get this tank"" ""12 more matches and it'll be easy mode"" But no. research the craft you wanted for 4 months? Guess what, it has nerfed ammo, barely functioning engine, can't turn and your crew isn't high enough level to survive being /looked/ at by anything. 

So, if you want to spend months, researching one tree, gambling on what it will be like, hoping it gets fun at high tiers, you're sorely mistaken. Time in, progress, loyalty and skill reward nothing in this game. You get shit on with the rest of the playerbase until you pay the snail for premium vehicles and a premium account. Past tier 3 you will not earn RP. You will not earn Lions, you will not be having fun and you WILL be wondering why you've spent so much time playing a game that offers no reward. Your progress in the game is based on wins and losses. You can end a game top of the board and still make as much RP as the player who did nothing. Win though? You''ll make 3x that. 

Oh yeah. There's also boats. 

Don't be like me. Don't play the sand casino. Run far away and play something else.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"My biggest complaint so far is that it is virtually impossible to start a franchise with a created character that has to climb up from the bottom of the depth chart because no matter where you are on the depth chart, the game acts like you are the starter. For example: I created a QB with the undrafted rookie option. His overall was about 61. It put me at 3rd on the depth chart but for some reason, at the beginning of every preseason game, the coach sends me a message talking about his expectations for me for the game and which quarters I'm going to be playing. Problem with that is that my guy never sees the field. Then the game registers that as my character underperforming and then I get negative messages from the coach about my performance (even though I didn't play a single snap) and this goes on for a few weeks into the regular season about how poor my performance has been until, one week, you get a message for the OC saying that if you don't perform well in the next game you are going to get cut. Don't play a single snap. I apparently didn't meet expectations from my spot on the bench. Get cut a few weeks into regular season. Stuck at an overall of about 65. Can't practice or do anything else to raise overall while on the Free Agent list. Nobody wants a QB with such a low overall. Stuck on Free Agents without any offers for a couple years without any contract offers (even as a backup) before giving up. Tried this a few different times with a few different teams with the same exact result every time. Fix this by making the game recognize that your character isn't a starter (or even getting any snaps for that matter) and I might be able to enjoy this.","Mixed43% of the 5,008 user reviews for this game are positive.",biggest complaint far virtually impossible franchise created climb bottom depth chart no_matter depth chart act starter example created qb undrafted rookie 61 3rd depth chart beginning preseason coach sends message talking expectation quarter problem never_sees field register underperforming negative message coach performance play single snap go week regular season poor performance week message oc saying perform next cut play single snap apparently meet expectation spot bench cut week regular season stuck 65 practice else raise agent want qb low stuck agent offer couple year contract offer backup giving tried different time different team exact result fix recognize starter snap matter able enjoy

The game does come with plenty of various planes to try and fly so there is definitely a lot of replayability. Of course, there already is because you can basically fly to and from wherever. The physics of the game is also really well done. 
You can just cruise along while flying, put on a podcast or some music and fly away, much like just being chill with other simulator games like Euro Truck Simuiator 2.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'm a 70 yr old lady, and I've played for some time now and I love this game. I will never be hardcore or even a good player. But there are so many things to do in this game it is almost overwhelming. Quests are very good, the story-line is very good and last but not least, the graphics are fabulous. 
On the downside; it is expensive being a Plus member, especially on a retirement pay (shoe-string budget). I recommend a much cheaper monthly fee. There is ofc the DLC content you get with the Plus membership but the ideal is to have a cheaper option only for that magical bag space just for crafters. Well, it's just a thought.

Happy New Year 2020!
Just a review of 2019 gameplay (many hours as you can see).
And I'm still playing (since my birthday 7 Dec 2017). I have just scratched the surface...
If you are looking for an adventure out of this world (pun intended) Elder Scrolls Online is the very very best.
I do pay for Eso plus, I need that magic bag since I farm and horde like a squirrel and craft like a boss. I have soon maxed out my main crafter.
I am in a guild with absolutely fabulous and helpful people. I have started to have a bit of confidence doing trials and dungeons with this guild, they know I am old and slow and they are patient with me. Hopefully, I will be a better team player this year. I am working on it.
In the meantime, I quest, explore, collect whatever, do delves, public dungeons, world bosses, farm and craft. And I enjoy it all!
All the best to all gamers in 2020.

I have edited this review, the starting-date was wrong, I got the game on 6 Dec 2017, and started to play on my B-day, 7 Dec 2017. Otherwise, counting the hours of gameplay, I must have been glued to the screen, LOL. I do have a life outside Tamriel, I promise... 
To All gamers Stay Safe in these crazy times. / Onna_Bugeisha

UPDATE 2022; This coming 7 Dec I'll turn 73 yrs which means that I now played this game for 5 yrs and I still love it.

Thank You! To all wonderful people for your heart-warming comments and awards. I like the titel ""Gaming Grandma""  

I have a confession to make - I fell in love with Horizon Zero Dawn, and spent some time there, i.e. I did 6 re-runs of that game (lol), it's a fabulous game. 

Now I am back in ESO again with the new High Isle chapter and two new companions, there are just so many things to do in ESO you never run out of options. Things like crafting, just exploring and farming, decorating your homes and create gardens... even fishing is very relaxing when you need a rest from bandits and monsters. 

Have I mentioned I lured my husband from Guild Wars 2, to come and join me in ESO last year? Now we play together, so much fun. 
A very important advice to all couples out there... this game is captivating and time-consuming - so please, see to it that you both play together or you might end up wondering what in the world happened to your significant other, seriously. 

I hope to see you in game or mail me (I am @Wing-Zun - on PC, EU server), I am in three trading guilds (BTW an excellent way to get some gold). 
 Arenthian Trade Guild - Tamriel Marketeers - The Twelwe Knights. Very nice guilds.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I will continue to play this game to completion, but cannot recommend it. Whereas I thought the world of AC Odyssey was interesting the world of AC Valhalla is just a weird, almost childish, rendition of the period. 

It's very bizarre when Eivor in one instance raids a village for some supplies, killing dozens of warriors, but then in the next reviles murder in some world event (as an example: Eivor at one point chastises Ivarr for enjoying raiding too much....a viking, a person that believes a warriors death is his way to Valhalla, enjoys fighting....too...much). The vikings themselves do not murder civilians, let alone take any slaves, despite the fact this was expected of viking raids during the period. The vikings are depicted as oddly progressive in their morals and attitudes while the Saxons themselves are often depicted as backwards and comically savage - even though the reversal is more closer (though not entirely) to reality. I suspect the reason for this is because Ubisoft doesn't have the stomach to handle such a period with authenticity with its Disneyesque obsession with making games that ""speak modern audiences"" (N.B.: politically fashionable types)  and because Ubisoft could not square the circle that is making a main character a viking while also making the main character relatable and likeable to the player. Regardless, it results in a watered down and weird experience. 

I could always look past on the ridiculous elements of the post-Origins AC games (the absurd armour, weapons and fantastical elements) because Origins and Odyssey managed to depict a believeable world despite however lax in historical accuracy, but Valhalla fails in that. If Ubisoft did not want to depict the vikings in all their savagery then they should have simply depicted the period from the point of view of the Saxons and kept the vikings and the Ragnarson clan as accurately depicted with all their villainous brutality, but that would mean making Christians look like the good guys and I suppose that's more intolerable to Ubisoft than completely butchering the authenticity of the vikings. I could go into more and more about the complete lack of accuracy depicted in the social attitudes and society, but that is just nitpicking and doesn't really matter so long as they get the core of it right and they did not - it's as if you was playing GTA but was not allowed to steal a car. 

AC Valhalla tortures the player to a unique degree compared to its Origins and Odyssey counterparts. Sure, Origins and Odyssey has a ton of things to explore and collect, but AC Valhalla seems to have this ten fold and, what's more, hides everything behind awkward architecture and minor puzzles with zero regard for how it makes any logical sense. If, like me, you want to collect everything on the map then be prepared not for a fun experience, but for a test of endurance, because virtually everything will be locked behind an explosive wall, a small crack, a locked door, a barred door - you will spend as much time figuring out how to get to an object as you will collecting objects and this is not a good thing, it's frustrating and I mean it when I say it is a real test of endurance. The map is simply not designed with any kind of logic, things are hidden and locked away with no regard for design consistency or reasonable player expectation. As an example: There is a location in the game called Evinghou Tower and it contains an ingot to collect.  The ingot is on an enemy inside a room in the tower that has no entrance, so how do you get in? Well, you must destroy some wooden panels on a window behind the tower - see how this makes no sense? There is an enemy in there, so we assume that there must be a way in and you will spend all your time looking for some hole or door, after all, the enemy got in there somehow and it is logical to assume he got in there via a door or some hole in the ruin wall, but nope, there is no logical consistency; you will have to deal with dozens of such cases like this - oh and some areas have loot that can only be accessed once you progress far enough into the game so Ubisoft doesn't spawn that loot until you reach that point...right? Nope, enjoy spending many hours wasting your time trying to find that secret entrance only to give up and later realise you could only enter once you reached that point in the questline. 

As for other concerns - this is the buggiest AC since the release of Unity. I played Odyssey and Origins without a single crash or bugged quest. So far I have had one quest bug and probably a dozen or so crashes. It seems the game has about a 50/50 chance of crashing if you try to take a steam screenshot and will often just crash during a cutscene. I also get weird stuttering in towns despite the fact I am running this game on a RTX 3070, 32GB of RAM and Ryzen 9 3900x 12 Core CPU. All I can say is that I am glad I got this game while it was on sale.","Mostly Positive71% of the 17,395 user reviews for this game are positive.",continue play completion cannot_recommend whereas thought world ac odyssey interesting world ac weird childish rendition period bizarre eivor instance raid village supply killing dozen warrior next reviles murder world event example eivor chastises ivarr enjoying raiding viking belief warrior death enjoys fighting viking not_murder civilian alone slave despite expected viking raid period viking depicted oddly progressive moral attitude saxon depicted backwards comically savage reversal closer not_entirely reality suspect stomach handle period authenticity disneyesque obsession game speak modern audience n politically fashionable type not_square circle viking relatable likeable result watered weird past ridiculous element post origin ac game absurd armour weapon fantastical element origin odyssey managed depict believeable world despite lax historical accuracy fails not_want depict viking savagery simply depicted period view saxon viking ragnarson clan accurately depicted villainous brutality christian good guy suppose intolerable completely butchering authenticity viking complete lack accuracy depicted social attitude society nitpicking matter long core not_it gta not_allowed steal car ac torture unique degree compared origin odyssey counterpart origin odyssey ton thing explore collect ac ten fold hide awkward architecture minor puzzle zero regard make logical sense collect prepared not_for fun test endurance virtually locked explosive wall small crack locked door barred door spend figuring object collecting object not_a good frustrating real test endurance simply not_designed kind logic thing hidden locked no_regard design consistency reasonable expectation example location called evinghou tower contains ingot collect ingot enemy inside room tower no_entrance destroy wooden panel window tower make no_sense enemy assume spend hole door enemy somehow logical assume via door hole ruin wall nope no_logical consistency deal dozen case oh area item reward dropped defeated enemy accessed progress far t_emphasizedhe player enemy enter world item reward dropped defeated enemy reach nope enjoy spending hour wasting trying secret entrance realise enter reached questline concern buggiest ac release unity odyssey origin single crash bugged task objective given non far task objective given non bug probably dozen crash 50_emphasized chance crashing screenshot crash cutscene weird stuttering town despite running rtx 3070 32gb ram ryzen 9 3900x 12 core cpu glad sale

With that said, the game is a tried and true fun.  Standard ubisoft game.  It is long, the story so far is decent.  The gameplay loop is just like every other farcry game.  Honestly, it looks just like the others with new features added for better quality.  If it weren't for the story, you wouldn't know if it was farcry 5 or 4.  But thats not bad.  It is really fun. Graphics are great. THe story has you slightly captivated, the game was $15 out the gate which is a steal considering I will get a solid 30 hours out of it just doing the story.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"A rewritten review. Far Cry 6 is a most beautiful game, the map is huge with many details. There are always tons of things to do. It's a pity that it lacks a proper introduction, you're just thrown on a roof. You don't know where you are or what is going on, if you haven't seen the trailer (really nothing is shown in the game when you start). The first hour the game is a bit mediocre, just a FPS on a small island, but after that really interesting things are introduced.

Another thing that was confusing were the graphics settings. HD textures are installed by default. The settings show that there is still VRam left, but the pack requires at least 12GB VRam. With less the game may start fine, until you open the map or something, then the frame rate can sink to 2-10fps. Without the HD pack the game still looks excellent, while it keeps a steady 55-60fps without glitches (RTX3080).

Apart from the missing introduction, this the best Far Cry so far in my opinion. An open world with absolute freedom, a truly huge map, and no mandatory immersion breaking mini games. You are forming a guerrilla army to liberate a Caribbean island from a dictator. As you grow in rank you get more privileges, NPC's start to recognize you.","Mostly Positive72% of the 15,575 user reviews for this game are positive.",rewritten cry beautiful huge detail ton thing pity lack proper introduction thrown roof trailer shown bit mediocre shooter small interesting thing introduced confusing graphic setting hd texture installed default setting vram left pack requires 12gb vram fine open frame rate sink 2 10fps hd pack look excellent keep steady 55 60fps glitch rtx3080 apart missing introduction best cry open world absolute freedom truly huge no_mandatory immersion breaking mini game forming guerrilla army liberate caribbean dictator rank privilege non controlled artificial s_emphasizedtart recognize

In my 6-7 years of playing WoW I never read quests, roleplayed, etc until Classic came out and I played with a friend of mine - we decided to play it how we wanted, and didn't want to be meta-slaves of sorts. The reason I'm mentioning this will make more sense later.

When starting FF14 I just wanted to come in with an open mind; the graphics were kind of jarring (compared to what I'm used to) and I could understand why people sort of didn't like the aesthetic of the game. That being said; I pushed on and just decided ""well, it's free and I'm bored so why not"". I also had a friend who SWORE by the game - so I had a lot of patience going in I think. Furthermore; the combat seemed slow (with a very long global cooldown) and limited spells but again; I was like lvl 5 - my expectations weren't very high.

As I went through my starting area and got accustomed with the UI/combat I was reading the quests and watching the cut-scenes and already I found myself getting interested/invested in characters such as Y'shtola or Urianger. While I would be lying if I said I knew what was going on; my friend re-assured me that if I paid attention it'd all pay off.

Little down the line; I got through the slug-fest which was ARR Post Patch(es) but during this time I honestly didn't mind it that much. Looking back (and watching my other friends play through it) I don't miss it, but at the time my friend reassured me that Heavensward and the following expansions are a night & day situation and that once this is over it's only up and up. On top of that; through the cutscenes toward the end of post patch ARR I had the sense that something big was happening in the plot - and I was right, and God was it epic. 

I then jumped into Heavensward, which was as promised; amazing (and totally a night and day experience). The story takes a huge jump and you can tell that the game was really starting to develop into a larger plot. I started playing a Ninja as I heard they were one of the most difficult classes in the game (and because I started as a Gladiator combat was quite slow) which I was very keen on. 

A few friends and I started an FC (equivalent of a guild in WoW) and a lot of them were either first time MMO players or just very casual. I told them I wanted to do some hard content as I heard FF14 Raiding content is super fun and challening. We jumped into the Trials first; Titan, Ifrit, Leviathan, etc all on minilvl + no echo and holy f*** at this point I was already having fun but the raids REALLY sold me. We also jumped into our first multi-fight raid (Raids are multi instanced fights rather than trials which are generally just 1 fight). We started on Coils of Bahamut minilvl and no echo and again; an amazing experience. Raiding in FF14 has been some of my favourite MMO moments across 8-9 years of playing the genre and I think that says a lot. We spent about 3-4 months playing together pretty much 10-12 hours a day (when we could and when we weren't working etc) and it was just like being young at High School again; which was surprising cause a game couldn't do that for me for a long long time - not even WoW anymore. 

After what felt like a 3-4 month non stop gaming session me and my FC took a break (a few stayed and played) but after 1-2 months we all came back and I completed Stormblood. 

Stormblood was great; the characters were awesome and some of my favourite moments (at this point in time) were actually from this expansion. I felt some of the hits in the story hit a bit harder than in Heavensward (except for one which I wont spoil which literally brought me to tears!) so it's safe to say I enjoyed this expansion. And now it was finally time for Shadowbringers.

Shadowbringers was just absolutely stupid in terms of Storytelling. The ups and downs, the twists, the character development, the attachment you feel to the characters around you, the story beats, EVERYTHING. Without spoiling anything by the time I finished Shadowbringers I was convinced without a shadow of a doubt that this story (despite never playing any other Final Fantasy games) was the best story-game I had EVER played. Specifically the finale of Shadowbringers in one of the last boss fights; it got to the cutscenes and I was on discord with my friend yelling like ""OH SHIT - LETS GO"" and the music kicks in and just absolutely unbelievable. 

Endwalker was more of the same; unbelievable story-telling and just amazing music, the scenery, the pacing, I could go on and on. 

This review now is getting long so I'll wrap it up; overall this game is amazing.
Here are some pro's and cons:

Pros:
- HUGE main story; 200-350 hours roughly of content 
- Simple but fun combat 
- No need to roll ALT characters (can have every job/class on once character and swap them as you play)
- Every raid/trial being relevant content (the amount of content is INSANE)
- Great art style (jarring to begin with for some; but just forget about it and embrace it for what it is)
- Friendly community (much less elitest than other MMO's I've played - but these people still exist)
- Great company - you can tell they LOVE the game (compared to other companies...) 
- Amazing additional content; housing/gambling/roleplaying/new-story-plus/achievements/transmog/etc 
- Every role/job is needed - META does exist but is not as punishing as other games, play whatever you want!
- SO MUCH SH** TO DO
- Great profession system 
- No DPS meters etc / no toxicity when it comes to raiding as can result in being banned (can be both a good and bad thing as discussed in many youtube videos/threads online) 
- Free trial is like so much content it's retarded 

Cons: 
- For people who don't enjoy story; there is a slight barrier to entry considering content is locked behind main story quests
- Combat is slow to start (long GCD's of 2.5 seconds) 
- A lot of user interface stuff (it gets introduced slowly; but can be overwhelming)
- Post A Realm Reborn can be suffering at the best of times 
- Not a lot of addon support (as mentioned in Pros) 
- SO MUCH SH** TO DO 
- Some people will tell you ""you have to play the game this way"" etc, just ignore them - they exist in every game.

I honestly can't think of many bad things to say the game apart from the stuff above. If you are thinking of playing a new MMO and want something fresh - honestly save yourself the time and don't try LOTR/Albion/whatever just play this game - it's unbelievably good and you will not regret it.

It's at the point to where I idle with this game open and just play a second game on the side while waiting out craft timers, because the craft timers are that long, craft timers that are this extreme should never be a mechanic in any game, this game wastes the players time, I would refund it if I could but unfortunately, it takes a good few hours into the game till you reach these extreme timers that make the game very hard to want to play.","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",mid late crafting timer long take 40 minute real life minute varies craft longer craft material stuff speed sleeping night speed craft example alone long take acquire food temporarily increase stats food buff important i_emphasizeddle open play side waiting craft timer craft timer long craft timer extreme never_be mechanic waste player refund unfortunately take good hour till reach extreme timer hard play

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Cant recommend the game anymore, uninstalling and cancelling my subscription.. Its been a year of the devs not caring about the players and squeezing them out of every cent, im tired. Broken updates that literally destroy the combat mechanics (for example, not being able to use your shield as a tank) take almost a month to get fixed, but they do still put out a new pet or cosmetic almost every week. Yeah, its not the same team, but if they put the money that goes into a bullshit amount of cosmetics into hiring another dev, thatd be better. but they dont. They act like they care about their community but their coms are almost non-existent and they even have the gall to say the players are being unfair when they call them out on broken updates that nerf everything but the new 2 or 3 things from the new expansion, so that you go and buy it to get the new powerful items. 

So, to summarize:

-Pay to win in the form of artifacts that are released ABSOLUTELY OP

-No care about the mechanics (Its like the eighth time they do deep changes to the whole combat mechanics, its been years of beta testing for them and they change and change.

-No real new content except for quests. We get a new zone (if you pay for it of course, and you also have to pay your subscription if you want to play the game because if you dont your inventory will fill in 10 minutes, the game becomes a logistics nightmare and you spend more time organizing than you do playing, and you OF COURSE also pay the game, which I think is worth it for the content it offers, but when you add the subscription and paying for expansions, they are nickel and diming every player and its wrong) but thats it. Its been so long since we had a new class.. But they do have the time to make fucking cosmetic animations to sell you even more.

-PvP is absolutely destroyed, even tho they fixed some issues with the servers, its just wack and the balance is non-existent

-PvE is oriented to catch new players, hook them up, then take a hot dump on their throat when they reach end-game. I'm not saying there isn't toxic end game players, there is, but they keep dumbing down the game and making years worth of effort null and void with changes that NO ONE even asked for, they say they do them because they want the game to be more inclusive and to help new players, yet those same changes complicate things for new players too (Go check the forums on the first combat update of high isle)

-They dont care about destroying the balance of the game if they can sell a new toy.. They will put out those aforementioned op items while nerfing everything else, even if it means destabilizing everything the players have learned until then. 

-They do not seem to have a QA team. EVERY. SINGLE. UPDATE. BREAKS. SOMETHING. I'm fucking tired of having to go check which character I wont be able to use each update because they either made a skill not work or bugged it so hard that if you use the character you would be exploiting a bug, even if you didnt want it, then get banned. Hell... For a month you couldnt fucking tank. Imagine if tanks in wow stopped working for a month. Imagine that. 

At this point I dont care who I'm blaming, maybe zenimax, maybe bethesda, hell, maybe even microsoft, I really dont care who is fucking up THIS BAD, but it needs to change, the game is losing people left and right and yeah, new people will come in.. But good luck learning end game without raid leads.. Ive been a raid lead for months, helping new people learn the ropes, then everything got nerfed and my work was even harder, I had good people dying because the devs ""forgot"" that healers are important too and that there were heal checks in the game.. Which mathematically couldnt be passed without trial gear.. And you needed to pass that check to get your trial gear.. See the problem? The devs don't play the game at all and act like the end game community is just trash.. The truth is there is some trashy people but the rest of the end game community has been giving this game their all for many years and we are the sole reason why new players can get into trials, because we do them for them, because devs cant be fucking arsed to even make a god damn tutorial of the game for the new players that covers more than the movement and some common keys. They are milking the hell out of the game and its players with 4 different ways of making money, again, game, dlc, subscription and microtransactions (and the game is now also p2w, either beicause of artifacts that you need to buy an overpriced dlc or becuase you can just buy gold with your crowns)

For bethesda: Im tired, you destroyed a game I loved and you know what? Good for me, cause I cant keep wasting my time on this, fuck your addictive mechanics, your continuous disrespect for the player base, you carrot on the stick behaviour.. You should be ashamed that you had so much potential and you just didnt have the balls to go against the higher ups that tell you do destroy the game, this new age of short term return on investment is ruining games, im out to play dwarf fortress, see ya.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",cant recommend anymore uninstalling cancelling subscription not_caring player squeezing cent im tired broken update literally destroy combat mechanic example not_being able shield tank fixed pet cosmetic week yeah not_the go bullshit cosmetic hiring thatd be_emphasizedtter dont act care community coms non existent gall player unfair call broken update weaken reduce effectiveness 2 3 thing major addition add feature mechanic powerful item summarize pay win form artifact released op no_care mechanic eighth deep change combat mechanic year pre release version available testing_emphasized no_real except quest zone pay course pay subscription play dont inventory fill 10 minute logistics nightmare spend organizing course pay worth offer add subscription paying expansion nickel diming wrong thats it_emphasizeds long class fucking cosmetic animation versus destroyed tho fixed issue server wack balance non existent versus environment oriented catch player hook hot dump throat reach not_saying behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner player dumbing year worth effort null void change no_one asked inclusive help player change complicate thing player check forum combat high isle dont care destroying balance toy aforementioned op item nerfing else mean destabilizing player learned not_seem qa single break fucking tired check wont able skill not_work bugged hard exploiting bug didnt banned hell couldnt fucking tank imagine tank wow stopped working imagine dont care blaming maybe zenimax maybe hell maybe microsoft dont care fucking bad need losing left yeah good luck learning large group player tackling difficult challenge lead ive a_emphasized large group player tackling difficult challenge lead month helping learn rope nerfed harder good dying forgot healer important heal check mathematically couldnt passed trial gear needed pas check trial gear problem play act community trash truth trashy rest community giving year sole player trial cant fucking arsed god damn tutorial player cover movement common key milking hell player 4 different way downloadable additional released initial launch subscription microtransactions p2w beicause artifact overpriced downloadable additional released initial launch becuase gold crown im tired destroyed loved good cause cant wasting fuck addictive mechanic continuous disrespect base carrot stick behaviour ashamed potential didnt ball higher ups destroy age short term investment ruining game im play dwarf fortress ya

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"I thought I'd leave a positive review since I've seen a lot of negative reviews calling this game unplayable; I loved Fallen Order and these reviews made me wait 2 months before buying Survivor to just try it out for myself, where I figured I could try to get the refund if within 2hrs the game isn't working for me.

Well I've gotten about 30hrs in and I've gotta say my experience has been pretty fun without any serious issues. I'm on a gaming laptop running Windows 10 with AMD Ryzen 7 4800HS with Radeon Graphics, this satisfies the minimum requirements but my CPU comes in just under the recommended specs, so on top of the bad reviews I was extra worried I'd have a bad experience. But I put all the settings to medium and the game has been running fine for me! It has only crashed 3 times in my 30hrs, once at my first death on Koboh and once when I first tried to fast travel, but neither have happened again since, and then once after a long 8hr session, but none of those seem to be too bad compared to what I've heard in other reviews. I'm a pretty amateur gamer so I don't really notice framerates and all that, I've never had great systems, so maybe others who are more experienced would notice more things that are off with it. But I came here to happily say the game is not in fact unplayable!  

But there it is, I'm excited to finish it off, the gameplay is a huge upgrade from the first game in almost every way, but I just wish the story was two times longer! Hopefully this means the issues are sorted out for most other folks too.

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"Listen, I'm new to armored core, I did not play the previous games, though I knew they were beloved. I had no real interest beyond they seemed neat and From software makes phenomenal content. So when armored core six got announced I decided it looked like a blast and I figured, why the hell not..

Holy shit.. This fucking game is high octane power fantasy madness. the build variety makes every mission interesting. Every time I got stuck on a mission or was having any difficulty I could go back to the shop and touch up my mech or sometimes completely redesign to beat it. 
I will say that if you go in blind to this game, without any prior knowledge, It'll probably kick your ass. I went into this game after watching a ton videos about its mechanics and what to do to succeed. It was still a learning curve, but still incredibly rewarding. 
On the story
dude... wtf, I've never felt so morally grey. Its oddly heartbreaking in a grand sci-fi sort of way and there are things I still don't understand, but I played through this game fully 4 times, and Replayed every mission a dozen more to S rank.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Let me first say that this is a terrible port.  If you meet the minimum or even recommended specs chances are you will not be able to play this game in an enjoyable state.  You will need something almost double the recommended to actually play this game at a stable framerate even on normal settings.  I've owned this game for a couple years & am only now getting around to playing it because it's just such a bad port.

That being said, this game is actually really good & I wish I could have played it sooner.  It isn't without it's faults, however.

[b]PROS[/b]
-Large Open World to Explore
-Lots of Collectables & Unlockables
-Fun Gameplay
-Good Story
-Ship Battles

[b]CONS[/b]
-Gameplay can be frustrating at times
-Collectables are mostly used as a ""Gameplay Time Extender""
-Some Story Missions are just kind of dumb or trial & error
-Earning Money relies on ""Kenway's Fleet""

[b]STORY[/b]

You play as an employee at Abstergo Industries, a private company built on Animus Technology that records & edits genetic memory data to make movies.  You are part of a team going through the Genetic DNA Memories of Subject 17 who's biological history makes him one of the most valuable subjects for Animus Technology.  As you ""play"" through his genetic memories you soon find that things are not what they seem.  An ancient conspiracy emerges about an age old war against Assassin's & Templars bordering on the deranged shows itself & you are soon tasked by your superiors with finding out about something called the ""Observatory"" as soon as possible.  Playing through the memories, you are in the role of Edward Kenway, a Privateer/Pirate of the early 1700s who's friends with Blackbeard himself.  You must use all yours & Edwards resources in order to find out about the Observatory & what power it holds.

[b]GAMEPLAY & FEATURES[/b]

The game starts off witha thud that turns into a bang.  Eventually, after 4 or so hours, you are in the actual meat of the game with your own ship, crew, & island hideout.  Everything is upgradeable, but not everything is useful.  Your house, for example, has about 3 upgrades, all of which do absolutely nothing.  You get multiplayer rewards for upgrading it completely.  Yea, that's what we want from our Single Player games, Multiplayer rewards.  Anyways, not everything is all bad.  You can upgrade your ship, your weapons & armor via crafting & add other new additions to your island hideaway like hookers, a bonfire & a tavern.  Most of which are still pretty disappointing.  I bought the bonfire thinking it would be this big epic burning man celebration on the beach, but it turns out it was just a camp fire with people around it.  Whoopie.  

Upgrading your ship is the most important thing you can possibly do in this game.  You get materials for it by taking down other ships or raiding plantations stockpiles.  Each ship you take down you can either add to your fleet, lower your wanted, repair your ship, or just sink the bloody thing.  Sinking is easier but cuts your booty by about half.

The Fleet is a sort of mini game where, each ship you capture can go on trade routes to earn money & random loot for your mansion to display or to equip on yourself or your ship.  I don't really like the idea of RNG loot systems, but this one's alright.  It's set up kind of like a Mobile game, where you take out enemy ships on routes, then send ships that are capable on the voyages which can range from 5 minutes to actual days to complete.  It's a waiting game, but it's also the best way to earn Money in the game.  I don't like that, if you don't use this minigame you are basically gimped for coin.  Money in the actual game itself isn't easy to come by & chests are filled with paultry sums that don't add up quick enough for what you need to buy.  In my travels in the game after about 40+ hours of gameplay I've maybe run across 40k total, while just sending ships out to do missions netted me over 100k by just turning the game off & waiting for missions to complete.

Combat & platforming is also a mixed bag.  Sometimes it works perfectly, other times it's janky as all hell.  At times, Edward will run wild clinging to walls & jumping off of every little thing you don't want him to, while others he does exactly what you were trying to do.  During combat, sometimes counters just don't work & you'll be stuck in a quick succession chain attack by one enemy.  Others, they will always work & you'll never get hit.  The biggest issue I have though is how poorly designed the combat system is in general.  Simply attacking an enemy takes about 4x longer to kill than a counter kill, so there's really no point in attacking first as it just leaves you open.  You're better off just countering or throwing a smoke bomb & instantly killing everyone around you.  There are those cool bad ass moments when you are on a freeflow combo killing spree that make attacking worthwhile but it's just a less effective way of dealing with enemies.

Then there are ship battles, which I must say are this games bread & butter.  Far more time was spent perfecting ship combat than the melee combat.  Starting out, you can't take on squat but as you upgrade your ship you will be able to take on the dreaded Man O'war vessels & even add them to your fleet.  Then there are the big Legendary Ships which are meant to be taken on only when you've fully upgraded your ship & those fights are doozies.  You get mortars, cannons, heavy shots, fire barrels, chain shots, & quick shots that target vulnerabilities you've made from other attacks.  Oh, and you can ram the crap out of other ships.  Once you get a big ram, you can pretty much monster truck your way over smaller ships with ease.  As you keep attacking ships, your wanted level goes up which summons Hunters, which get stronger & more frequent the higher level your wanted gets.  You can use your wanted level as bait to lure out better ships to add to your fleet or get more materials to sell or upgrade with.

The crafting in this game is basically copy/pasted from AC3.  You'll need to hunt animals & use their hides to add/upgrade your arsenal & defenses.  The difference is now, you can hunt whales & sharks.  The best way for me to describe these fights are comparing them to the big aligator boss fight in RE4.  You harpoon them, latch on & they pull you around & dive down to hide.  Then, they attack your ship if you don't hit them in time.  It's almost the exact same formula from that RE4 boss fight, just replace the big crocodile with sharks & whales.

There are also random events in the game like the White Whales or Trade Routes that give good coin or loot.  These appear as blue R-Boat symbols on your minimap & are available for limited times only.  Once found, they automatically share with anyone on your U-Play friends list so your friends can do them, too.  Not your Steam list, though.  So, if you have a lot of Steam Friends but not U-play the share feature is basically worthless here.

Finally, the collectables.  These range from simple chests, to missions, to Animus fragments & there are a ton of them.  Doing them all will take a considerable amount of time & probably extend gameplay by at least 3x.  I say this as I remember the one mission that put 3 animus fragments in jump off points that forced you to treck back through the entire Island again after getting each one.  Literally, extending gameplay of that one mission by at least 3x.  Some collectables do this, others are simply put on the path so you can get them as you progress.  I don't know if there's a reward for collecting everything, since I haven't done it yet.

[b]OVERALL[/b]

If you are looking for a great open world adventure game with a Pirate theme & have capable hardware, then this is worth the buy.  It's frustrating at times but the pros do outweigh the cons in the long run. Just be aware that this game isn't perfect.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"There is a lot of memery to be had in this game, and lots of people focus on that. There's a lot of strategy, lots of mechanics, etc. But what I don't think people highlight enough (at least on the top reviews) is the roleplay/immersive aspect to be had in this game. 

I'm gonna admit, I don't play super competitively. I have lots of mods, I usually make my first ruler rather strong (with a self-imposed 800 point cap rather than 400) but the actual roleplay in this game is out of this world. I love having kids, having favorites among them. I love having friends/best friends, and the events that have you interacting with them making me actually give a shit when they die. One event I had was when a random prisoner I had escaped and caused a scene. My character was relatively soft-hearted, so she found amusement in that and we became friends. I released her back to her life before long, and she went out and lived her own life and continued her adventures elsewhere.

I kept tabs on her, checked up on her every now and then. She wasn't a lord, wasn't even a claimant, didn't accomplish much else. But here was this random peasant who'd managed to befriend a mighty khanate, leader of mongolia -- and even though in game I never really interacted with her again, I just loved the story of it. I imagined that up until her dying day, we would write letters back and forth to each other. 

There are a lot of situations like that -- and I feel like there's a lot of value in playing that way. No, it's probably not 'meta' to give land to someone based on their accomplishments in your kingdom... but seeing that accomplished knight start their own dynasty, watching over their kids and seeing how they do etc -- it feels fucking good, man. I really could go on and on about this game, but whether you're new to the series or if you're a hardcore player, i'd recommend trying the game from this lens. Not what the gamerbrain in you tells you is ideal, but what might create an even better story for you, and invest you in the world you're building even more.","Very Positive92% of the 66,890 user reviews for this game are positive.",memery lot focus strategy lot mechanic t_emphasizedhink highlight top review roleplay immersive aspect gon na admit play super competitively lot mod usually ruler rather strong self imposed 800 cap rather 400 actual roleplay world love kid favorite love friend best friend event interacting shit die event random prisoner escaped caused scene relatively soft hearted found amusement became friend released life long lived life continued adventure elsewhere tab checked lord claimant accomplish else random peasant managed befriend mighty khanate leader mongolia never_really interacted loved i_emphasizedmagined dying write letter forth situation value no_it probably not_the effective popular strategy character build land someone based accomplishment kingdom seeing accomplished knight dynasty watching kid seeing feel fucking good man series hardcore recommend trying lens not_what gamerbrain tell ideal invest world building
230410,Warframe,"This game is evil.

At first, you will be astonished by the super cool graphics and character/weapon designs. You will say to yourself ""How can this be free?"" And for the first 20 or so hours, everything will seem fine. But then, all of a sudden, you will match up with someone who has a way cooler frame than you, and you will look in awe at them, and every cell in your body will tell you ""You need to become that guy"". But then after doing some research online, you will realise that his frame is no longer obtainable, so you have to trade with some dude, who has dedicated atleast 1000+ hours to this dark ritual of a game. So, gullible as you are, you will start to slowly farm rare items, to gain enough premium currency to be able to afford this ""Frost Prime"". Then, after 20-25 hours of grinding, you will start to question your own exsistence, as you have only garned about a third of the platinum you need to buy that goddamn warframe. And then, in your hour of darkness, the game will hit you with a 50% discount on the premium currency. And in this hour of darkness, where all your mental defenses have been stripped away from the countless hours of relic farming, you will succumb to the dark lords. But not only will you buy enough platinum to afford the warframe of your dreams, you will buy one of the most expensive bundles, As the dark lords, known only in the common tounge as Digital Extremes, had intended. Because who wants to save 5 bucks, when you can save 50?

You will powerfull for a time. You will feel as though nothing can stop you. Untill you run out of platinum, and the cycle begins anew. And thus in countinues for eternity.

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"Put simply, this is the best flight sim to date.  I play it on a single screen, 3 screen setup, and in VR and it works well in each.  I have more invested into this game than any other I am currently playing, when you factor in DLCs and Honeycomb flight controls.  I bought the Premium Deluxe for the extra aircraft...   It is worth every penny.

VR - my first experience in VR was in an F-18 over the San Juan Isalnds of Washington State, USA.  The bubble canopy gives you alot of visibility, and the experience was in the top 3 gaming experiences of my life.  That was with Oculus 2, and it may be enough for me to consider an Oculus 3 at some point.

The only gripe I have is feeling a little betrayed by MS/Asobo in not necessarily sticking to their long term plans with FS2020 in favor of FS2024, but if they deliver improvements to the level that 2020 is over FS X, then I will throw my monty at them for that too.  

9.7 / 10  only because some places the AI went a little off the rails, but then the modding community is HUGE.  Free and paid, so you can really tailor your overall world, or flight to flight depending on how much load time you want to wait for (it definitely takes a bit).  Way cheaper than owning a plane from my experience with a humble 172G, and the landings are way less stressful at my home airport in the mountains in the game too -_-

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"After nearly 3000 hours of playing time, im sorry to report, that this game development is going into the completly wrong direction.
- Developers are not listening to loyal players
- Features like map selection have been removed 
- Too many strange maps - who needs Karakin or Paramo? If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD
- Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split
- All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players
- The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets -  for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again

Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.

This game is utterly brilliant from its idea - Erangel is like the perfect BR map, weapon control is brilliant, but the way how PUBG is developing the game is just blatant and careless.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"[h1] At the time of this review I had 169 ;) hours in the span of two weeks and I still haven't even come close to complete the game. Also, completing the game is probably impossible.

[b]World 3 added A LOT more content, which wasn't out at the time I wrote this review.[/b][/h1]

This game being 100% free is the closest thing to robbery. On top of that, it's 100% playable if you are completely F2P. The fact that it's developed by a single person just blows my mind away. The guy is an active member of the community, listens, and is hilarious (protip: read everything in the game).

Legends of Idleon is the master of all idle games. I've dropped $50+ already and I'm easily going to spend more. The event deals are extremely worth it. If you were a fan of MapleStory, chances are you are going to love this game. 

There are so many things to explore and customize in this game, it's insane! Brace yourselves.

1) Damage Classes (more coming soon)
Beginner --> Journeyman 
Warrior --> Barbarian / Squire
Archer --> Bowman / Hunter
Mage --> Wizard / Shaman

Each of these classes have a unique specialization and they all level up independently. For example, warriors can mine or fish better, archers can craft items easier or catch bugs, mages can chop wood or do better alchemy, etc. When you are investing time into each task, their unique exp bar will take over. The best part is that, this way, the game promotes creating multiple characters with different classes that specialise in different things, while they all farm simultaneously. Every time you switch, what you'd be doing in the game changes and provides a great sense of variety.

2) Skill Classes
- Mining
- Chopping
- Catching Bugs
- Fishing
- Alchemy
- Smithing (crafting)

3) Tasks
In the two current worlds (3rd coming early May) that currently exist, there is a huge variety of achievements you can do to acquire merit points and unlock new crafting recipes.

4) Statues and Obols
Throughout your explorations you will acquire Statues and Obols that drop from monsters (you can acquire obols from alchemy too) that you can use to further enhance your build. Statues are applied to the particular character you use them on, while Obols have slots in 2 tabs, personal and family. 

5) Worlds
Currently there are 2 vast worlds (as mentioned next one is coming in early May) that you slowly unlock by killing a certain amount of monster in a particular map or by reaching certain skill levels (mining, chopping, catching, fishing).

6) Guilds
Their functionality is simple but heavily promotes working together to do your guild tasks, earn guild points, and unlock guild skills that further help your progress.

7) Items
- Armor (helmet, rings, amulets, breastplates, leggings, shoes)
- Weapons (spears/swords, bows, and staffs)
- Tools (pickaxes, axes, catching nets, fishing rods)
- Food (boosts certain stats and you have 2 slots available in the beginning)
- Trophies (cool-looking titles under your name that adds stats and effects)
- Premium Items (hats, chat rings, enhanced in-game features that make things happen faster)
- Bags and Shared Storage (you unlock inventory slots for both of them throughout the game)

8) Mini-games
Each skill (mining, chopping, etc) other than alchemy and smithing have their own unique little mini-game that you can play four times per day to acquire more drops and exp. Some are actually really fun.

9) Alchemy
Oh man, so many things here, you just gotta see it for yourself.

10) Smithing (crafting)
There are items that come from an auto-production system that works to build your exp for smithing and, thus, creating higher level items. You basically choose what to auto-produce, go farm, check the anvil, and auto-store all the produced items in your storage, profit.

11) Travelling
You can walk through a map and move to the next one when reaching the kill cap (kill X monsters to unlock the portal). You can also teleport anywhere you want once a day (you can upgrade this once for free or multiple times in the premium shop). This is only not-so-fun part of this game if you don't buy the ""+7 teleports / day"" premium item. But to be fair, it's really cheap.

12) Cards
Oh boy. Another fantastic aspect of the game. Each mob has a unique card that represents it and only drops (somewhat rare) from that specific mob. These cards have added stats that further help you customize your build (eg. +3% money, +5% mining efficiency, +5 base dmg, etc). You can equip up to 4 cards for free, then you can unlock 4 more slots for a premium fee.

13) Bosses
There are a few bosses in the game that drop some unique items, other than the final bosses of each world the battles aren't anything special.

14) Active vs. AFK
You can play the game actively and you can play the game afk, both work. There are builds that focus in better progress through AFK gameplay, and other builds that work better when actively playing. The option is yours.

NOTE: Just so you know, at this point I debated to stop writing my review because this game has so much friggin' content! And it's even done yet (it releases in a year)!

15) Star Signs and Constellations
Mid-late game content, accessed through a telescope and almost hidden little star drawings throughout the game. These constellations enhance your gameplay with bonus effects and stats that are unlocked by doing certain tasks (eg. farm afk for X hour(s) at Y map, reach X map with Y class) when you encounter those sneaky star drawings in a map.

16) Stamps
Throughout the game you will find or buy stamps (in-game currency) that enhance your stats (eg. +X defense, +X% smithing speed, etc.) for all your characters account-wide. 

17) Colosseum
It works like a Tower Defense game. You're placed in a small map, there's a timer, multiple rounds that spawn mobs, and you get to choose if you want to spawn the next wave instantly or wait. As a Barbarian (AoE auto-attacks), you'd go at the spot that the mobs spawn, activate auto-attack (spells activate automatically too), spam ""next round"", SLAUGHTER! Oh man, this is one of the most enjoyable things for me in the game.

18) Post-office
This is one the things I haven't unlocked yet, but from what I've seen it combines the concept of make and collect X items to receive Y reward. Seems kinda plain and monotone, but I haven't explored it yet.

19) Food
Food provides bonuses like:
+100hp if your health goes below 50%
+10% exp and has 80% chance to be consumed after killing a mob

There are some rare Food drops that are golden, which also stack (eg. 2 golden nomwiches give 12.4dmg instead of 6.8) and only occupy 1 Food Slot!

20) Vendors
They sell Rings, Amulets, Food, utility items (return to town scroll, skill reset shard), weapon / armor / storage / inventory upgrades, and stuff like that.

21) Quests
Personally, the least entertaining part of the game. I love the dialogue and the characters as they have unique and interesting personalities, however, the quests themselves are quite plain and monotone. Most of them are ""Kill X amount of Y monster"" or ""Acquire X amount of Y drop"". There are a few unique and fun ones, but nothing too special.

== My Idleon Experience ==
The game is absolutely fantastic if you want to keep yourself occupied with work or something else while you're using Legends of Idleon as a game of management. I set my characters to farm what I need for my next craft, or kill the mobs I need for a quest, or do a task for my guild. Then, IRL, I do work, hangout with the waifu, do the dishes, and lift weights. After all of those things that I [i]actually[/i] do, a few hours have passed by. I open up Legends of Idleon, I visit each character one-by-one, I get lost in the sea of drops that fall on the ground, my character glowing in a ray of light-beams while the EXP bar is going bananas with all my AFK gains, dopamine taking over my body with each single drop and level up... all in life is good again.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",169 hour span week close complete completing probably impossible world 3 wrote 100 closest robbery top 100 playable completely play developed single blow mind active member community listens hilarious protip read legend master game dropped 50 already easily spend event deal extremely worth fan maplestory chance love thing explore customize insane brace 1 damage class soon beginner journeyman warrior barbarian squire archer bowman hunter mage wizard shaman class unique specialization independently example warrior mine fish archer craft item easier catch bug mages chop wood alchemy investing task unique exp bar best promotes creating multiple character different class specialise different thing farm switch change provides great sense variety 2 skill class mining chopping catching bug fishing alchemy smithing crafting 3 task world 3rd early currently exist huge variety achievement acquire merit point unlock crafting recipe 4 statue obols throughout exploration acquire statue obols drop monster acquire obols alchemy enhance build statue applied particular obols slot 2 tab personal family 5 world currently 2 vast world mentioned next early slowly unlock killing certain monster particular reaching certain skill level mining chopping catching fishing 6 guild functionality simple heavily promotes working guild task earn guild point unlock guild skill help progress 7 item armor helmet ring amulet breastplate legging shoe weapon spear sword bow staff tool pickax ax catching net fishing rod food boost certain stats 2 slot available beginning trophy cool title name add stats effect premium item hat chat ring enhanced feature thing happen faster bag shared storage unlock inventory slot throughout 8 mini game skill mining chopping alchemy smithing unique mini play four time per acquire drop exp fun 9 alchemy oh man thing ta 10 smithing crafting item auto production work build exp smithing creating higher item basically choose auto produce farm check anvil auto produced item storage profit 11 travelling walk move next reaching kill cap kill x monster unlock portal teleport anywhere upgrade multiple time premium shop not_so fun 7 teleports premium fair cheap 12 card oh boy fantastic aspect monster enemy unique card represents drop somewhat rare specific monster enemy card stats help customize build eg 3 5 mining efficiency 5 base dmg equip 4 card unlock 4 slot premium fee 13 boss boss drop unique item final boss world battle special 14 active v keyboard play actively play keyboard build focus progress keyboard build actively note debated writing friggin release 15 star sign constellation mid late accessed telescope hidden star drawing throughout constellation enhance bonus effect stats unlocked certain task eg farm keyboard x reach x class encounter sneaky star drawing 16 stamp throughout stamp currency enhance stats eg x defense x smithing speed character wide 17 colosseum work tower defense placed small timer multiple round player enemy enter world mob choose player enemy enter world next wave instantly wait barbarian effect auto attack spot mob player enemy enter world activate auto attack spell activate automatically spam next round slaughter oh man enjoyable thing 18 post office thing unlocked combine concept collect x item receive reward kinda plain monotone explored 19 food_emphasized provides bonus 100hp health go 50 10 exp 80 chance consumed killing monster enemy rare food drop golden stack eg 2 golden nomwiches 12 4dmg 6 8 occupy 1 food slot 20 vendor ring amulet food utility item to_emphasizedwn scroll skill reset shard weapon armor storage inventory upgrade stuff 21 quest personally entertaining love dialogue character unique interesting personality quest plain monotone kill x monster acquire x drop unique fun one special fantastic occupied else legend management set character farm next craft kill mob a_emphasized task objective given non task guild irl hangout waifu dish lift weight thing i_emphasized hour passed open legend visit lost sea drop fall ground glowing ray light beam exp bar banana keyboard gain dopamine taking body single drop life good

I enjoy the AI part of the game. I think that AI should provide better loot and more money. I like the gun attachments when building a class. Proximity chat is also a great feature. Finally, I also like how the zone closes into small circles that conjoin at the end.

The Negatives:
The looting system is horrendous. A small portion of the loot gets stuck inside the wall or you have to put your screen in an awkward position to have the opportunity to pick up the weapon, device, or shield. This could be a problem that I am just having, but the crashing, massive stuttering problems, and server problems are pretty annoying.  We have run into multiple hackers using aimbot. The gulag system is terrible. I get so many teammates that do not seem like real people. The gulag should go back to the original state of a 1v1. If they decide to keep it a 2v2, they should make sure to prioritize people on the same team instead of putting us with a random person. The last problem that I have with the game is the audio. My footsteps are extremely loud. I usually cannot hear the enemy players if I'm stomping around.
 
My Personal Opinion:
At the current state of the game, I do not recommend it.

440,Team Fortress 2,"Into 2010, I learned of a game called The Orange Box. I was a filthy console peasant at the time who only played games for achievements. I booted it up on my Xbox 360 and didn't get what I expected. I thought of games such as portal and half life like stupid creations. I saw that they were probably some of the best games I've ever played in my lifetime. I was dumbstruck with how I could have missed these games for 3 years. After finishing portal, I played Team Fortress 2. From what I learned, It was an xbox live only game. I was disgruntled and I thought it was a bad game.

1 month later, I got xbox live 12 month card so I could watch netflix for as long as I pleased. I suddenly remembered The Orange Box. Out of curiosity, I played a match of 2fort (the xbox 360 version is still not updated to this day and still has 5 maps.) I was bewildered by its gameplay, and intrigued by its cartoonish graphics. I stopped being a COD fanboy due to this game. I remember my first kill was between me and another scout, as we swung baseball bats.

I played it for a long, LONG time. In 2011 I learned of Steam. I realized it was made by the company that made TOB. Estatic, I downloaded it on my shitty PC, not caring if it was a virus or not. I would later then learn this was a F2P game. I would be lieing if I told that I hadn't just about shit my pants about all the content in it. Although my PC lagged like a bitch, I played it in amazement from how different it is, so I sold my Xbox 360. I got a better PC and kept on playing.

I soon used the real purpose of steam and played Hotline Miami, POSTAL 2, The Binding of Isaac, etc. But I always came back to this. Soon I had logged 4000+ hours into this game. I lost my skills from this game and had also lost interest in this game since all Valve focused on was the HORSEFUCKING SHITEATING PENIS SNIFFING COCK ROBBING COW HUMPING BULLFUCKCOCKADOOKIE games known as DOTA 2 and CS:GO. I still miss the days when this game would be constantly focused on by Valve.

In the end, I quit TF2. I still love this game and always will, but it hurts to see it barely updated with the exception of patches. I had the dream of reaching for an unusual flaming teams captain, but I failed at trading and it was impossible for me to find good deals. A friend I have who started TF2 a year ago mastered the game in 100 hours. He gained 3 unusuals during his first 100-600 hours when it took me more than 3600. I am going to give him all of my valueable items. So in the end I want to go back to doing what I love, and its to playing many games.

Overall, I give this a game a perfect 10/10, and I'm not being sarcastic. This game changed my taste in all games, and I love it for that. This is why I recommend this game.","Very Positive93% of the 1,029,546 user reviews for this game are positive.",2010 learned called orange box filthy console peasant game achievement booted xbox 360 expected thought game portal half life stupid creation saw probably best game lifetime dumbstruck missed game 3 year finishing portal learned xbox live disgruntled thought bad 1 xbox live 12 card watch netflix long pleased suddenly remembered orange box curiosity 2fort xbox 360 version not_updated 5 map bewildered intrigued cartoonish graphic stopped cod fanboy due remember kill scout swung baseball bat long_emphasized 2011 learned realized company tob estatic downloaded shitty pc not_caring virus not_i learn play lieing told shit pant pc lagged bitch amazement different sold xbox 360 pc soon real purpose hotline miami postal binding isaac soon logged 4000 hour lost skill lost interest valve focused horsefucking shiteating penis sniffing cock robbing cow humping bullfuckcockadookie game known dota c miss day constantly focused valve quit tf2 love hurt barely updated exception patch dream reaching unusual flaming team captain failed trading impossible good deal friend started tf2 ago mastered 100 hour gained 3 unusuals 100 600 hour took 3600 valueable item love game perfect 10_emphasized not_being sarcastic changed taste game love recommend

Artillery and tank fire is devastating.   I died  at least 20 times before I even saw my first enemy.   I finally fired my gun after about two hours of playing.   And it took me about 4 hours of playing before I actually killed an enemy.  I appreciate it is difficult.  It makes any success I have more rewarding.  The game looks fantastic and it plays very well.  I am sure if you have any FPS online experience it will go easier for you.  Newbies should take baby steps and have patience.

Pros: 
-Great game for friends to play together. 
-Building mechanics 
-PVP & PVE (though its annoying at times)
-Good graphics that were just updated! Palm trees look great.
-Server versatility (Official, Community, Modded) gives multiple playstyles.
-Amount of map variation. 
-New content regularly. (Electricity, Hot air balloon, Minicopter, New weapons)
-Active Devs. 
-Community (Also a con) You can meet some pretty cool people on here. Ive made a few really good friends. 

Cons:
-Solo can be a struggle for a lot of people. Especially if you arent a PVP god. 
-Bugs still pretty common. Some that can ruin a wipe or hours of work if they happen at the wrong time.
-The devs priorities seem to be a little off of what the community is asking for. Instead of optimization and PVE 
  improvements (the aimbot scientists), they have been focusing on new content which creates more bugs. 
-Community - Almost as toxic as League of Legends. Racism runs wild even though most of them are literal children who 
  think they are being ""edgy"". Even the people that arent toxic are just intentionally annoying (Just dont keep your volume 
  all the way up if you want to have eardrums when you are done)

Despite the cons I honestly believe the Devs care and will address the issues eventually. And they are doing a really good job of keeping the game interesting and fun.

I never knew I needed getting random objects in facilities in my life until now. Has so much potential to be massive, but needs polishing around some points though. Couple minor and major bugs, but the gameplay dumpsters these negatives.

 Difficulty curve is perfect. You are meant to die and learn by dying. Perfectly punishing and perfectly rewarding. The look to the game is very unique and has the perfect balance of unsettling and visually appealing. Unironic jammers for some of the songs. Gameplay loop is almost perfect, has roguelike/lite feel, but lacks the actual progression of a typical roguelike/lite. Still, this game is insanely impressive and I am loving way more than I thought.

In the year 935, my sister and lover was murdered by my friend and brother-in-law. He burnt her at the stake with my babe in her belly. He was a powerful man, my sister married well, his family spread far across Europe with many of his kin in the most influential houses of the developed world.

I spent the next 350 years erasing everyone who shared his blood, starting with my niece and nephews. By the time I was done, his family was erased from history, lost to obscurity and time. All my focus and hatred had left my own family nothing more than a poor Duke, so heavily consumed by a hate he didn't understand that by the time it was all over he took his own life before he fathered an heir. Thus, I lost my own family to obscurity and time.

After gaining nothing and losing everything I pondered for a moment whether or not it was all worth it...

1085660,Destiny 2,"[b] TLDR: Silence Bungo, I do not wish to grind for rolls anymore, I wish to be happy... [/b]

[h1] The New player experience [/h1]
It's 2022. You decide to check out this hot and cool shooter called Destiny 2. You log in, make a character, and watch the intro. It's short, mysterious and the music swells as the title is revealed and you're instantly immersed in the world. You then proceed to shoot and disintegrate some aliens throughout the intro missions and perhaps think to yourself: ""Wow! I get to wield space magic and use a multitude of guns, this gameplay is awesome. I can't wait to play the rest of the game!"". As you put in some hours though, eventually, inevitably, it hits you: ""Wait, what am I supposed to do again? Whats the story? Who are these people? Is there a campaign I can play? Hold on what do you mean that intro was actually from Destiny 1? Where can I talk to other players? Should I buy an expansion? Which one should I get? Do I need a season pass? [strike] What the fuck is a zorpalod [/strike] ."" In short, its a bit of a mess for newcomers. For all its focus on an ongoing story and 'living world' through yearly expansions and seasonal content, the very nature of seasonal story telling (which are usually ~ 10 weeks) means you'll miss out on them if you were not playing then. Coupled with the content vault, where Bungie shelved/removed/deleted/dragged-out-behind-the-shed-and-shot roughly half the game around Beyond Light (2020) and will most likely continue to do so for older expansions (for the sake of game stability), means that it is difficult for new players to orient themselves in the game's world if they don't even have the opportunity revisit older content.

[h1] The Shootin' [/h1]
Admittedly, the game plays fantastically. No other game I've tried nails the feeling of popping some space demon's head with an over-sized handgun and incinerating his pals with lightning like Destiny, and to add the ability of experiencing it with friends no less. Moment to moment gameplay is awesome, and encounter design for more higher level content is usually pretty well thought out, and its the reason why most people stick with the game even if they might complain about it in the same sentence. Most importantly, Bungie knows this. They know they have lighting in a bottle, and over the years it has been proven that however much the very vocal Destiny community likes complain of things, they will still continue to put in hundreds upon hundreds of hours. If you understand that, then you'll understand why the game is monetized and priced the way it is. 

[h1] The Price [/h1]
Don't be fooled, its really a ""free to try"" sort of situation. With season passes lasting around 3 months and the big dramatic expansions coming yearly, you're expected to pay somewhere upwards of £80 pounds a year if you intend to keep playing and having things to do. Video games are an extremely cost-efficient medium and there are so many interesting games out there to buy for a fraction of the cost, giving you more value and enjoyment for the money you spend. Though what's provided by the seasons and expansions is often well made and interesting, it is hard for me justify their full price tag under any circumstances. Coupled with this is also the enormous amount of microtransactions present in the game, from skins to emote to ships and anything of the like. Look I get it, its a long lost battle against microtransactions in video games, but if an in-game emote costs roughly as much as an season pass and the rewards and activities (repetitive as they may be) associated with it, I can't help but feel a little ripped-off. At least a couple years ago one could say hey, at least a couple campaigns are free and playable, but those are long gone. Essentially, it feels like a subscription service and you should know what you're getting into. 

[h1] The Loop [/h1]
As is par for the course of the genre, the game eventually devolves into several repetitive gameplay loops in certain activities if you're trying to achieve some specific goal/item. There is a lot of things to do in the game don't get me wrong, but inevitably one may find themselves grinding for some particular goal, be it a good roll on a gun or whatever and just spend hours on it. In this case, Bungie is very good at making 'boxes' for the player to tick, and playing Destiny 2 sometimes makes me feel like I'm some hamster in a wheel thinking he's progressing somewhere, while simultaneously being afraid of missing out on timed content. It is what it is, and I suppose there is nothing wrong in finding enjoyment in that, but it is important to hold no illusions over what ~80% of the game actually is. 

[h1] The Closing Thoughts[/h1]
About the main reason I would recommend Destiny 2 to completely fresh players is the no cost of entry and its amazing gameplay. Try it out, the look and feel of the game is brilliant, and as long you are aware of what you are getting yourself into, you might even like it. But the price and nature of drip-fed content along with peculiarities too numerous to fit in this review such as the reliance on third-party apps/websites for basic functionalities like loadouts or LFG's leaves a lot to be desired. It does not help the fact that money spent on the game's expansions just feels wrong considering the inevitable removal of said expansions down the road. As I've mentioned before, most continue to play because they're just not much that compares to the way Destiny handles. 
If you are a returning player however, I would definitely recommend checking the game out again. It's in a fairly alright state at the moment, while some controversial mechanics like sunsetting are gone (though what has been sunset will remain that way), and you are probably used to some of Bungo's hijinks by now.","Very Positive80% of the 583,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",silence bungo not_wish grind roll anymore wish happy 2022 decide check hot cool shooter called log watch intro s_emphasizedhort mysterious music swell title revealed instantly immersed world proceed shoot disintegrate alien throughout intro mission perhaps wow wield space magic multitude gun awesome wait play rest hour eventually inevitably hit wait supposed whats a_emphasized series connected mission level form storyline play hold intro 1 talk player major addition add feature mechanic season pas strike fuck zorpalod strike short bit mess newcomer focus ongoing living world yearly expansion seasonal nature seasonal telling usually 10 week mean miss not_playing coupled vault bungie shelved removed deleted dragged shed shot roughly half light 2020 continue older expansion sake stability mean difficult player orient world opportunity revisit older shootin admittedly play fantastically no_other tried nail feeling popping space demon sized handgun incinerating pal lightning add experiencing friend no_less moment moment awesome encounter design higher usually pretty thought stick complain sentence importantly bungie know lighting bottle year proven vocal community like complain thing continue hundred hundred hour understand understand monetized priced price fooled sort situation season pass lasting 3 month big dramatic expansion yearly expected pay upwards 80 pound intend thing video game extremely cost efficient medium interesting game fraction cost giving value enjoyment spend provided season expansion interesting hard justify price tag circumstance coupled enormous microtransactions present skin emote ship it_emphasizeds long lost battle microtransactions video game emote cost roughly season pas reward activity repetitive associated help ripped couple year ago hey couple campaign playable long essentially feel subscription service loop par course genre eventually devolves repetitive loop certain activity trying achieve specific goal thing wrong inevitably repeatedly performing action gain resource particular goal good roll gun whatever spend hour bungie good box tick make hamster wheel progressing afraid missing timed suppose wrong finding enjoyment important hold no_illusions 80 closing thought recommend completely fresh player no_cost entry amazing brilliant long aware price nature drip fed along peculiarity numerous fit reliance third party apps website basic functionality loadouts lfg leaf desired not_help spent expansion feel wrong considering inevitable removal expansion road mentioned continue play not_much compare handle returning definitely recommend checking fairly alright state moment controversial mechanic sunsetting sunset remain probably bungo hijinks

730,Counter-Strike 2,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.

I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product 

Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).

Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.

It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).

Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).

Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.

If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.

In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]
PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a battle-royale, 100-players, open-world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo, duo, and squad (3-4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward, you hop off a plane, loot weapons, armors, and equipments from buildings, and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath.

PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle-royale game out there, yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known, PUBG has had a highly successful launch, securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle-royale PvP, look no further. You've struck the gold.

My claim is not without reason. The following is PUBG's pros and cons in my opinion:

[h1]Pros[/h1]
1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle-royale PvP games are mostly in Early-Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gathering as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game - PUBG is exactly the opposite.

2. Great gameplay concept. No pay-to-win and no grind-to-win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.

3. Non-toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team-only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.

4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no-scoping bozos. You have to plan out your movement very carefully and quickly since time is of the essence. Difficult decisions comes up often, especially in squad play (e.g. risk your life to revive your mate or run like hell to safety; Kill someone and give out your position to nearby players or stay quiet; Deciding your next 'safe spot', etc.) An enjoyable learning curve definitely exists - not too steep and not too lean. 

5. A shooting game that applies semi-realistic weapon recoil, bullet travel time, and bullet drop is always appreciated.

6. Various vehicles, weapons, weapon mods, clothings, and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. The weapon stats variety amps up the gameplay - It can be quite a challenge to engage in a firefight when you got the wrong weapon for the situation.

7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV, the game supports both FPS and TPS.

8. Minor performance improvements can get quite noticeable after several updates. Devs truly are working on the optimization issue. We can look forward towards better performance in the future.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
1. Currently, very performance-demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very unstable fps even on high-end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum - virtual RAMs can't help your 4-gigs-RAM PC. In terms of GPU, one of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from <30fps and extremely slow loading progress. Another friend with a GTX1060 suffers from fps drops during rain/smoke.

As a response to comments' feedback for my 1st cons list: The game is still playable on all those mentioned GPUs. I just want you to know that the game is not optimized well. FPS drops, crashes, and screen freeze will sometimes happen even on high-end rigs. It happens randomly - I don't measure the frequency.

[i]UPDATE: Although the game is still quite laggy, minor performance improvements are already noticeable after the latest updates. I no longer suffer from fps spikes with my GTX1080. Most performance issues are related to server lag instead of PC after June 27 update.[/i]

2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example, you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover, but 2 seconds later, blood spurts out of your chest, you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you, but then...okay you get my point

3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO's Competitive and Dota 2, you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in-game.

4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.

5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three, four RMBs to activate the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game - devs better fix this quickly.

As a response to the comments' feedback: I have to add that my statement about the terrible control is a rare occasion. Generally, 1, or 2 key inputs would be recognized. I would say having to press twice is much more common than 3/4 times like I said. But it does often take some miliseconds for the inputs to be recognized. My point is still valid: The controls are NOT reactive - horrible for a PvP game.

6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to drive

7. Door and movement bugs seem to be quite prevalent lately. Whenever I move a step ahead, the game throws me back 3, 4 steps backwards. Seems to be affecting the entire server whenever it happens. Invisible doors also prevent players from entering a building, throwing us outdoors whenever we try to enter a building. Similar to fps spikes, these happen randomly.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Don't lose all hopes because of my cons list - remember that this is an early access game. I know some of the cons can be too much to handle and disturbs the gameplay, but devs are very active in updating the game. I dare to conclude that PUBG is currently the best battle-royale MMOFPS/TPS PvP game out there. The current state of the game is more than playable. Definitely worth purchasing even when it's not on sale.

Well that's all I have to say about PUBG. Hope it can be of help to potential buyers!

[i]P.S: I already addressed my low playtime hours issue in the comments section. Please kindly read all the older comments if you believe my playtime hours is insufficient to write a review.[/i]

UPDATE: Never expected my review would go up top on Most Helpful for this game. So I've decided to [b]not[/b] take down this review after having more playtime hours. I'll update it if there're any significant changes.

UPDATE 2: This review was made before the era of the 'stream sniping' and the microtransaction drama. I haven't played the game for a while so I lack proper first-hand experience to update my review. With that said, keep in mind that this review is outdated.","Mixed58% of the 2,306,037 user reviews for this game are positive.",introduction playerunknown pubg battle royale 100 player open world mmofps tps set massive 8x8km land support solo duo squad 3 4 ppl play straightforward hop plane item reward dropped defeated enemy weapon armor equipment building survive thrilling versus bloodbath pubg obviously not_the massive battle royale stand pinnacle genre known pubg highly successful launch securing top seller good battle royale versus no_further struck gold claim not_without following pubg pro con pro 1 extremely active communicative developer vital player purchase play official release pubg constantly updated speculate major factor pubg s_emphasizeduccess battle royale versus game mostly early early development version not_yet complete year focused gathering player real development progress pubg exactly opposite 2 great concept no_pay win no_grind win apparel cosmetic pubg skill versus thrilling definitely fun play friend 3 non behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner community simply no_chat function switch voice channel good recommend teaming stranger obvious reason 4 highly demanding teamwork strategy hop plane recklessly no_scoping bozo plan movement carefully quickly essence difficult decision come especially squad play e g risk life revive mate hell safety kill someone position nearby player stay quiet deciding next safe spot enjoyable learning curve definitely exists not_too steep not_too lean 5 shooting applies semi realistic weapon recoil bullet travel bullet drop appreciated 6 vehicle weapon weapon mod clothing equipment scattered battleground aid task objective given non survival weapon stats variety amp challenge engage firefight wrong weapon situation 7 shooter not_recommended due limited pov support shooter tps 8 minor performance improvement noticeable update truly working optimization issue forward towards performance future con 1 currently performance demanding optimized run unstable shooter high rig minimum 6 gig ram absolute minimum virtual ram help 4 gig ram pc term gpu friend gtx980 suffering 30fps extremely slow loading progress friend gtx1060 suffers shooter drop rain smoke response comment feedback 1st con playable mentioned gpus not_optimized shooter drop crash screen freeze happen high rig happens randomly measure frequency laggy minor performance improvement already noticeable latest update no_longer suffer shooter spike gtx1080 performance issue related computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection pc june 27 2 computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player lagging badly due high base speculate expect huge sale boom resource support player example running cover enemy fire already reached cover 2 second blood spurt chest fell ground gasping air vision start blur scream squadmate magically heal bullet wound rubbing grass okay 3 monotonous similar csgo competitive dota 2 type unique relies encounter squad enemy 4 melee weapon terribly inaccurate aiming bit possibly caused computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection 5 control terribly not_reactive take miliseconds recognize lmb rmb command failing recognize command three four rmbs activate scope kind annoying weapon refuse shoot press lmb input recognition delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection vital issue versus fix quickly response comment feedback add statement terrible control rare occasion generally 1 2 key input recognized press twice common 3 4 time miliseconds input recognized valid control not_reactive horrible versus 6 vehicle flip easily difficult unrealistic drive 7 door movement bug prevalent lately whenever move ahead throw 3 4 step backwards affecting computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player whenever happens invisible door prevent player entering building throwing outdoors whenever enter building similar shooter spike happen randomly conclusion lose hope con remember player purchase play official release con handle disturbs active updating dare conclude pubg currently best battle royale mmofps tps versus state playable definitely worth purchasing not_on sale pubg hope help potential buyer p already addressed low playtime hour issue comment section please kindly read older comment believe playtime hour insufficient write never_expected top helpful decided not_b playtime hour significant change 2 era stream sniping microtransaction drama lack proper hand mind outdated

381210,Dead by Daylight,"I absolutely love this game. The design of (most) killers, gameplay, chase interaction and being able to play with friends or by myself.

I have invested 4 years of game time into DBD. Currently sitting at just over 4K hours total. I've played through all eras of the game and all the ups/downs bugs/problems the game has had. Pre this latest patch the game was sitting at its best point in terms of playability. It absolutely had a myriad of problems but they weren't game breaking and my love for the game helped me to see past them.

However, this latest update is an absolute spit in the face to anyone who has invested any serious amount of time into the game at all. The developers changed multiple things that nobody asked for, received the feedback that nobody liked it and implemented the changes anyway. I have been playing online games for years and BEhaviour are by FAR the worst developers at both time management, choosing what to focus their resources on and ESPECIALLY player feedback. They do not listen.

Even besides the changes nobody asked for and how poorly they were implemented this newest update has also not only has more incredibly unfun breakable walls added and a shitty UI but a myriad of literal game breaking bugs. Walls with no collision, areas of the map (auto haven bus) where the killer CANNOT pass through but the survivor can- which was completely fine last patch AND on the PTB (test servers).

The developers stumbled upon a cash cow and just release skin after skin, DLC after DLC, battlepass after battlepass with no care for the people who helped build their game. They balance the game to the casuals and do not care about their core playerbase as they constantly have new players coming in dropping money on DLC's/cosmetics. I do not want to target anyone specifically but they mention in livestreams that they ""use the wiki"" to know what certain perks do- they do not even know their own game. The lead game designer who I won't name is an absolute moron, his views on the game are INCREDIBLY bad and having someone like that helm the ship is HORRIBLY unhealthy for a good player experience.

For 4 years time players have been asking for a colorblind mode in order to be able to play the game as some people were unable to see scratch marks due to their condition. For 4 years we were told ""its not on our priority list"". Only when the community REALLY made a big fuss about it did they release that they were ""happy to announce we are working on colorblind filters"". They do not care about the player, only their image.
When the last absymal twins update game out riddled with bugs they were very quick to change Moris- something players have been asking to be changed for years, an incredibly easy fix. The only reason it was changed then was to take the spotlight away from how disgusting and unprofessional their released DLC was. I cannot state enough how little they care about their playerbase.

I absolutely love Dead By Daylight. But in its current state and with the way the developers handle their game I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Do not buy this product. This is now the second major update in a row that has come RIDDLED with bugs/problems. Please do not support this game.","Very Positive80% of the 512,225 user reviews for this game are positive.",love design killer chase interaction able play friend invested 4 year dbd currently sitting 4k hour total era ups down bug problem pre latest software fix bug balance add feature sitting best term playability myriad problem breaking love helped past latest absolute spit face invested serious developer changed multiple thing asked received feedback liked implemented change anyway online game year behaviour far worst developer management choosing focus resource especially feedback not_listen besides change asked poorly implemented newest not_only incredibly unfun breakable wall shitty ui myriad literal breaking bug wall no_collision area auto bus killer cannot_pass survivor completely fine last software fix bug balance add feature ptb test server developer stumbled cash cow release skin skin downloadable additional released initial launch downloadable additional released initial launch battlepass battlepass no_care helped build balance casuals not_care core playerbase constantly player dropping downloadable additional released initial launch cosmetic not_want target mention livestreams wiki certain perk not_even lead designer name absolute moron view incredibly bad someone helm ship horribly unhealthy good 4 year player asking colorblind mode order able play unable scratch mark due condition 4 year we_emphasizedre told not_on priority community big fuss release happy announce working colorblind filter not_care image last absymal twin riddled bug quick moris player asking changed year incredibly easy fix changed spotlight disgusting unprofessional released downloadable additional released initial launch cannot_state care playerbase love state developer handle cannot_recommend not_buy product major row riddled bug problem please not_support

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1][i][b]Arise now, ye Tarnished. Ye dead, who yet live. The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.[/b][/i][/h1]
Elden Ring is the best selling FromSoftware game, the 2022 GOTY and one of my favorite games of all time. Many think that Elden Ring is merely Dark Souls with an open-world twist, but trust me, it transcends that simplistic comparison.

[quote][b]Note:[/b] This review is entirely spoiler-free. Any potential spoilers will be concealed in black boxes, so feel free to read without concerns about plot reveals.[/quote]

[h1][b]The First Step[/b][/h1]
Elden Ring's character creation stands out as the best among all the previous Souls games developed by FromSoftware. The face visuals are more detailed, and there are additional customization features. The effort put into character creation really paid off, providing players with more opportunities to craft unique and distinct characters.

The opening cinematic in Elden Ring, a tradition in Souls games, left a strong impression on me. The art style, quality, and voice acting exceeded my expectations, making it one of the best introductions in video games.

For those new to this gaming style, Elden Ring may be challenging initially. While I, having played many Souls games, didn't encounter such issues, my advice is to be patient. The game's difficulty is fair. If a boss feels unbeatable early on, it means you're not prepared. Explore more, level up, get better gear—soon, the game becomes more manageable. Surprisingly, Elden Ring felt the easiest among the Souls games I've played from FromSoftware, at least until [spoiler]Malenia kicked my ass for 7 hours straight before I beat her...[/spoiler].

[h1][b]The Lands Between[/b][/h1]
Some folks argue that mixing an open-world style with the Souls formula messed up Elden Ring. Here's my take: it's a bit of both. Having a huge map is cool, but it's tough for devs because they can't just copy-paste empty areas. So, they filled it with stuff like ruins and caves. The downside? Some bosses start feeling a bit repetitive. I get it's hard to make a big map and balance it with creativity at the same time, but meeting the same mini-boss a bunch of times got a tad boring, even though I got used to it.

On the positive side, the open world showcases stunning landscapes with distinct vibes in each region. The immersive atmosphere, especially at night, is captivating. Elden Ring's design, featuring captivating night skies and distant, beautifully crafted structures, prompted me to capture numerous screenshots—an aspect I genuinely adore.

However, the open-world setup also poses challenges with quests. Side quests are easy to miss, especially for those playing blind. Elden Ring's vastness means NPCs can be overlooked without exploring thoroughly. While some give hints, it's not foolproof. Not everyone may value these side stories, but they play a significant role in the game, as I'll elaborate on in the next section.

The caves and catacombs scattered throughout the vast lands offer an enjoyable exploration experience, enriched with puzzles and mazes. I relished navigating through each one, and the inclusion of a cooperative element by summoning a friend to explore together adds another layer of fun to the exploration process.

[h1][i][b]❝I was able to live as my own person...❞[/b][/i][/h1]
Side quests in Elden Ring are essential for me, adding significant depth to the overall experience. Without them, the game would be less enjoyable. While some may not prioritize side quests, I encourage giving them a chance. Personally, when I invest in a game, I want to explore all aspects. Delving into NPC stories enhances the game's coherence, as these side quests are intertwined with the main lore. Skipping them means missing a deeper understanding of the story. While you can watch them on YouTube, experiencing them firsthand is incomparable.

The uniqueness of each NPC's story in the side quests was something special in Elden Ring. Going through them step by step and keeping track of each character's journey proved to be incredibly rewarding. Emotionally, these side quests had a significant impact on me, and I strongly advise against ignoring them if you decide to play the game. I know it's tough to keep track of all of them, but I managed by using Word and doing some Google research. I did get spoiled at times, but for me, it was better than missing out on these rich and engaging stories altogether.

[h1][i][b]❝The fallen leaves tell a story.❞[/b][/i][/h1]
Elden Ring's lore is truly beautiful and well worth delving into. The game is undeniably complex, especially for newcomers like myself. However, once you start paying attention to item descriptions and NPCs' dialogues, connecting the dots, the story unfolds into a masterpiece that's unique in every way. Initially, I chose to remain ignorant, avoiding YouTube videos and online articles to steer clear of spoilers. Still, I eventually had to seek out essential lore to grasp the basics without ruining the experience.

I stumbled upon a spoiler-free Reddit post explaining the fundamental lore, aiding my understanding of the game. Despite this help, my first playthrough left me perpetually confused—a familiar feeling I've grown to love from previous souls games. After completing the game, I turned to VaatiVidya's YouTube videos (the Souls lore guy) for a deeper perspective. This transformed my view, prompting a second playthrough on the same save file. Now, I appreciate the interconnected details; As an example, even the design and symbols on the enemies' armor carry meaning.

[h1][i][b]❝...I have never known defeat.❞[/b][/i][/h1]
Bosses are undeniably crucial in Souls games, determining the overall quality of the experience. While I acknowledged earlier that the game has repetitive mini-bosses scattered throughout the vast lands, the main bosses are a different story. Each is uniquely crafted, presenting a special and distinct challenge. Not all of them posed significant difficulty for me, except for two late-game bosses, but I genuinely enjoyed every fight, regardless of the level of challenge.

However, my disappointment lies in the lack of memorable soundtracks during boss fights—a departure from the impactful music in previous Souls games. Despite logging 178 hours (for now), I struggle to recall a single boss theme, even for the main encounters (the final boss fight is an exception). Elden Ring fell short of my expectations regarding the musical accompaniment to these pivotal moments.

[h1][i][b]❝Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.❞[/b][/i][/h1]
Elden Ring introduces fresh mechanics, such as Ashes of War and summoning spirit ashes, along with a wide array of weapons—an excellent addition to its expansive world. While the gameplay remains familiar to previous Dark Souls titles, the added features enhance the overall experience, making it feel even more engaging.

[h1][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/h1]
The game is so vast that there's a lot more I wish I could discuss in this review, like its online features and the different endings. However, I'll keep it short, especially about the endings due to steam limitations.

Elden Ring features multiple endings, and some players choose to end their journey with the default one, which I personally find less interesting. Therefore, I strongly recommend pursuing the other main endings, as they offer a much more captivating experience than the default one.

[quote]As I conclude this exploration of Elden Ring, I encourage fellow Tarnished to venture beyond the conventional and embrace the myriad tales this intricate world has to offer.

Pros:
Great classes & skill trees - (if you've missed the necro from D2 this will do the trick for you)
Intuitive interface with short learning curve
Good music
Nearly infinite class builds
Good crafting (item altering system)
One of the only ARPGs of it's type for Linux

[the following cons will have a '(beta)' at the end if it's only a problem because it's still a beta release and not expected to still be an issue with the full release]
Cons:
Occasional crashes (beta)
No cloud saves or hotkey character saves during gameplay (beta)
Missing textures compared to Windows version (beta)
Missing classes and skill trees (beta)
Performance issues, though it has improved since alpha (beta)
No voice acting for NPC dialog (maybe beta?)
No multiplayer (beta)
Character graphics don't always change with gear (beta)
Class dps/suvival balance issues (beta)
Minor bugs related to item drag & drop functionality (beta)

As you can see all of my gripes are related to the beta quality of the current release (0.7h at the time of writing).  For this reason I had to give this game a thumbs up.  It has so much potential, it just has to get to full release get to passed the headaches.  If you're a Linux user, and you like sponsoring games that weren't hatched from a giant corporation's rectum, I  would recommend laying down a few bucks for this one and putting up with the bugs for a while.  It's rare enough that anyone writing these ARPGs gives a damn about us Linux users.

1966720,Lethal Company,"Yeah the game is a total vibe, the lore that is not explained is kind of funny. It gets kinda spooky at times, confusing and very funny if you coop and use local voice chat. You're basically some wage slave working for some ""company"" you don't really know what it is. Your task is to gather scrap from weird alien planets. Literally go through some weirdly generated facilities with spookies in them and gather metal scrap, and other garbage.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"When I learned that Madden 24 was going to have cross-play for their online game modes, i was beyond excited to play madden as soon as it released. Specifically, I had 5 other friends that wanted to start a Franchise Mode. Well, of course EA being the dog shit company that it is, has not made cross-play compatible with Franchise mode, instead it is limited to their PVP money making formats. While this is the primary reason for my negative review, ill also mention they have not done anything to optimize performance, especially on PC, and the menu lag is unbearable at times. The game hasn't really been innovated upon compared to M23 and retains a lot of the problems that came with it. The positives are that rosters have been updated, and they changed the physics a bit in game. 

Whoever is in charge of Madden is an idiot. I don't understand why this game hasn't become a game service model where you retain and IMPROVE upon the existing structure. Then every year you have a new, dare I say, Season, where you reset everything. No, that would be too obvious, gotta make a completely new game every year (but not really)... morons.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"I'm originally a day one Xbox player with 5500hrs, I had gotten tired of being ignored as a player and bored of being maxed out on the game and swapped to PC. Sadly I've come to find that PC players are just as ignored as console when it comes to BHVR. 
Dead by Daylight is an incredible product that is trapped underneath the thumb of idiots who don't know what to do with it. Every update just adds more bugs than features.
At one point, years ago, Cote had described the game as ""no longer theirs, it now belonged to the community"" which at the time I thought was beautiful. Years later, however, after new hires like Ethan, the game has belittled, ignored, and straight up asked veterans to leave.
DBD releases ptb's to put up a front that they listen to the community while then releasing multiple patches like The Twins, and Mid Chapter 4.5 that completely ignore the complaints of the community. 

After how many new things broke today, I finally had enough that I was going to submit individual bug tickets to them for every bug they've been neglecting, only to find out they've updated their website to hide bug tickets at the very bottom and shrunk the box to a 5th of the previous size, while having added tons of pictures and ads for the game, and top centering a small FAQ style technical support for things already fixed. 

BHVR is a company that actively disrespects their community, herds morons like sheep into defending their actively bad decisions by posting occasional memes, and milks the game and its players by working minimally and at their own whim while we beg and plead for them to just acknowledge they heard what we have to say.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Sigh... this is the hardest review I've had to write.

This game is interesting, compelling, and original. The game mechanic is great. The CORE game mechanic actually changes from movement to stealth in a way I've never experienced, even in metal gear games. Its exhillerating being chased and killed as the survivors and its fun to run around killing as the killer.

Unfortunately, the game is riddled with bugs. This current update (2/13/2017) made the game unplayable. And that's not me bitching about minor changes in game play mechanics... its literally broken and won't launch. 

I've held off my review in hopes that the developers would patch the game so i can rave about it up and down. Welp the cows have come to pasture and I feel that after playing 120 hours of the game, posting on steam forums about bugs, participating in test servers, and emailing devs all to have a patch that renders the application completely useless i think I've earned the right to bitch about it. Hell, I'm a paying consumer so why not?

Yesterday I played this game almost all day and night long. In that day, after hearing about the new patch I logged every game I was able to get into and play as well as every game that crashed due to errors. 

My logs for yesterday are as Follows:
68 attempted games played
51 games that did not load, crashed, errored out etc.
17 games succesfully laucned with no errors and were played

That means the application worked correctly only 25% of the time. 

All I can say is to stay away from this game. Its not working anymore... and even on its best days it only worked 1 out of 4 times.

If you happened to purchase this game and enjoyed it as much as I did (when it decides to work), put pressure on those devs. Thier game, as fun as it may be, is a defective product.  IT needs to be fixed or WE need to be reimbursed. You pay thier salary... not Behavior, not StarBreeze... YOU!

PS, Devs... I will personally remove this post and give it an incredibly positive and equally lengthy review once the game starts working as it should. It is not my intention to keep people from buying YOUR games... it is only to keep people from buying BROKEN games.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"If you're new to Crusader Kings and looking for a place to jump in, this is where you'll want to start. But if you're someone who played the shit out of CK2, you're going to be disappointed at this game's current state.

Paradox have cleaned up the UI and stabilized the game engine. In terms of an upgrade, that's really it. Most of the new features won't have significant effects on your campaign. To name a few - baronies have been added to the game, but cannot be played or become strong enough to have any meaningful impact on your demesne. The new dynasty system is only interesting if you start as a Karling or intend to play a ludicrously wide build. Knights are a bit half-baked and the game, astoundingly, will not let your character become one. 

I followed the Dev Diary leading up to the release. When Paradox announced that China would not be part of the base game, they justified it as trading width for depth. This game delivers neither. The interactions between characters are frustratingly shallow compared to CK2's DLC. Never mind that you stole this man's kingdom, enslaved his wife, and executed his family. A few years of Sway schemes will fix that right up.

Beyond all this, the game has one mortal sin. CK2 allowed you to begin your campaign on any day between the years of 1066 and 1337. This equals out to 98,915 possible starting points. And that's just the base game! Each of these nearly hundred thousand days is filled in with as much historical detail as humanly possible.

Crusader Kings 3 has two (2) start dates that you can choose from.

Given Paradox's questionable business model, it's likely that we'll be buying CK2's richness back in chunks over the next five years. Maybe then, after $200 of DLC, this game will be somewhere near what we already have.","Very Positive92% of the 66,890 user reviews for this game are positive.",someone shit ck2 disappointed state paradox cleaned ui stabilized engine term upgrade feature significant effect series connected mission level form storyline name barony cannot_be strong meaningful impact demesne dynasty interesting karling intend play ludicrously wide build knight bit half baked astoundingly not_let followed diary leading release paradox announced china not_be base justified trading width depth delivers neither_the interaction character frustratingly shallow compared ck2 downloadable additional released initial launch never_mind stole man kingdom enslaved wife executed family year sway scheme fix mortal sin ck2 allowed series connected mission level form storyline year 1066 1337 equal 98 915 possible starting point base nearly hundred thousand day filled historical detail humanly possible 3 2 date choose given paradox questionable business model buying ck2 richness chunk next five year maybe 200 downloadable additional released initial launch near already

My RIG
Ryzen 7 5800X
RTX 3080 10GB VRAM
16GB RAM (running multiple apps in bg)
Ultra settings 2k res
Game is running fairly well, I see a lot of people complaining about game not even launching, IMO skill issue.
There are frame drops in some areas like in the forest it dropped to 90 or in town it dropped 80 from 120.
I feel hardly pressed to complain about it, because it's still smooth, unlike some other releases from last year that would be hiccuping hard even with DLSS turned on and whatnot (like for example Remnant 2).
This could still be improved but is not a major problem since the game is still playing smoothly.

IMPORTANT: Does not feature Ultrawide Support and max refresh rate is 120Hz

Done with performance talk.

I'll combine my demo experience from PS5 with what I played here.
The combat is very satisfying it's kinda of a meld of Platinum Games' and recent aRPG style Final Fantasy games.
Like Platinum games it has very fast paced and fluid combat with cancellable at any time attacks with big dodges (features the limit to the 3rd dodge being slower like in Darksiders for example, you can continue combo after dodging like in PlatGames' tho!).
The animations and character presentation is top notch also not unlike something you would find in a Platinum Games' title.
All characters feel very distinct and have their own quirks and gimmicks, some of them might feel familiar if you played Granblue Versus, like for example Gran/Djeeta feature a chargeable heavy while Narmaya also features a stance.
These gimmicks are at core of each characters gameplay and it is key to utilize them to maximize each characters' potential.
Where the game is similar to Final Fantasy is it features a similar skill wheel, when you hold R1/RB your X/Y/A/B buttons change functionality to allow for ""Skills"" which are self explanatory, starting from a basic fireball, heal or a big sword swing to something like a parry or a team wide buff.
Speaking of teams, game heavily leans on teamwork and has a lot of very interesting features that will be key to playing in coop.
Enemies have a Stun Gauge that when fills up you can activate a Link Attack simultaneously with another character (or in COOP with a player) and will fill a Link gauge that when full will buff the entire party.
This gauge is filled through other different means, one of them is Skybound Arts.
This is essentially a Super meter not unlike in a fighting game, once you're at 100% you can activate a Skybound Art which will deal significant damage HOWEVER
The more interesting part is that using Skybound Arts will fill other characters/PLAYERS Skybound Arts gauges that can be further combo'd and if all 4 characters use their Skybound Art they will activate Chain Burst.
This Chain Burst will not only damage but also stun the enemy for inexplicably long time and is key for getting higher ranks on your quests.
Mastering all these mechanics is the meat of this game and provides the depth and satisfaction to an otherwise already very competent aRPG.

Story? No comment, I have only 40 minutes so far but it seems at the very least interesting and the characters are very vibrant and likeable.
Even if the story turns out to not be great, the mechanics and presentation is already great enough to be at least a satisfying game,","Very Positive90% of the 19,808 user reviews for this game are positive.",early interested early rig ryzen 7 5800x rtx 3080 10gb vram 16gb ram running multiple apps bg ultra setting 2k re running fairly complaining not_even launching imo skill issue frame drop area forest dropped 90 town dropped 80 120 hardly pressed complain s_emphasizedtill smooth unlike release last hiccuping hard dl turned whatnot example remnant 2 improved not_a major problem smoothly important not_feature ultrawide support max refresh rate 120hz performance talk combine demo ps5 combat satisfying kinda meld platinum game recent arpg style final fantasy game platinum game fast paced fluid combat cancellable attack big dodge feature limit 3rd dodge slower darksiders example continue combo dodging platgames tho animation presentation top notch not_unlike platinum game title character distinct quirk gimmick familiar versus example gran djeeta chargeable heavy narmaya feature stance gimmick core character key utilize maximize character potential similar final fantasy feature similar skill wheel hold r1 rb x b_emphasizeduttons functionality allow skill self explanatory starting basic fireball heal big sword swing parry wide strengthen improve effectiveness speaking team heavily lean teamwork interesting feature key coop enemy stun gauge fill activate link attack coop fill link gauge strengthen improve effectiveness party gauge filled different mean skybound art essentially super meter not_unlike fighting 100 activate skybound art deal significant damage interesting skybound art fill character player skybound art gauge combo 4 character skybound art activate chain burst chain burst not_only damage stun enemy inexplicably long key higher rank quest mastering mechanic meat provides depth satisfaction already competent arpg no_comment 40 minute far interesting character vibrant likeable turn not_be great mechanic presentation already great satisfying
899770,Last Epoch,"I recommend the game to any ARPG fan, but it's a ""mild"" recommendation for now. The game has a lot in it, and definitely worth playing, but as I reached the endgame, some things started to bother me more and more. Below, I'll talk about three biggest issues I have with the game, but please keep in mind, as an Early Access game, things might change; I hope they'll change. 

[h1]Map Variety[/h1]
Last Epoch has no procedural map generation. In the endgame, the ""Monolith""s you choose will often feature the same subset of maps, along with same subset of enemy archetypes. You'll face similar enemies on the same maps over and over in other words. Sometimes, you get to play on the same map that you've just finished. 

In my opinion, in ARPGs, a map is a canvas, and having a different canvas' each time keeps things fresh by putting you under an illusion that keeps your mind away from the idea of you doing a repetitive task over and over. This is certainly not the case in this game. 

A proper procedural map generation is urgently needed in short. Without it, I get burnt out rather fast, and it could be the same case for you as well. Other aspects of the game has been keeping me from feeling the burnout so far, but I'm afraid I'll buckle before reaching 100+ hours just because of this reason alone. I've started making other characters to keep myself interested further.

[h1]Endgame: Monoliths, Echoes[/h1]
I like the base endgame, you select a monolith (storyline) that is available to you, and essentially design your own maps as you progress through echoes (maps). After each echo, you are given two options to pick from, which adds a modifier to the enemies, and may last a few echoes, stacking the difficulty up. I really like it. However...

At the end of the monoliths, you get to choose one blessing among three, and these blessings are drawn from their own pool, and has a power rating attached to them. They could be simple drop rate boosts, to a vital stat improvements that'll enhance your build. You need to complete 3 quest echoes, and while the first few monoliths are easy, the later ones require you to maybe go through 30 echoes in order to finish a monolith, or even more as encountering a quest echo is chance based.

The problem with this is, if you were after these blessings, you only get a chance after a long patience, and are at the mercy of the RNGesus to get a blessing you want with a good roll. If we could improve our blessings somehow; like incrementally raising their power roll for each completion, it wouldn't be a big issue for me as the long wait would yield something rewarding. But right now, the reward for completing a monolith could be extremely unsatisfying.

I hear you asking; is the game about loot, or is it about blessings? Well, blessings are part loot in essence, but let me stop being a smartass for a second. It is of course about the loot, further enhancing your character at the core. And the next part is dedicated to the itemization & crafting, specificly in the endgame.

[h1]Itemization & Crafting[/h1]
At first, the game might look like the complete opposite of the PoE, especially crafting. You use affix shards to add up to four affixes you want to an item, or improve their tiers up to tier five. You have support runes and glyphs that you can use to do different stuff, like removing an affix, randomizing affix values on an item within their tiers, and so on. However, with each crafting done on an item, you add instability to it, and higher instability may cause a fracture during crafting, at which point, the item cannot be worked further on.

When you get to the endgame, you realize that there is another rarity for items: ""Exalted"". The affix tiers go up to T7, but you can only craft up to T5. Exalted items are rare items that feature these higher tier affixes on them, and you can only get them as drops. This makes crafting more of a supplement; before this tier; it's a pre-determined risk & reward to progress your character further to the max, but with this tier, getting to the max is entirely at the mercy of RNGesus.

Some affixes are extremely hard to come by. From my experience, the class-specific affixes found on class relic items are extremely rare, for example. If you fracture (damage) an item while trying to add these, or shatter (salvage) an item in order to try and get your affix shards back and get nothing, it's extremely annoying. 

To put my experience in crafting for this game in PoE terms, you have ""orbs of annulment"" in the form of a rune, but the affix removed is one at random. Then you have ""exalted orbs"" in the form of affix shards, but the added affix is pre-determined, and the same affix shards can be used till you reach tier 5. Then you have ""divine orbs"" in the form of another rune that randomize the values within their tiers. However, every craft action will add some sort of instability, and the higher instability the item has, the higher chance a fracture may occur. Fracture is similar to ""corrupt""; cannot work on the item any further, and you may lose some affix tiers in the process if it is anything but a minor fracture.

Lets say you want to craft a good item. Due to the added instability, trying to craft an all affixes @T5 item from the ground up from a white item is highly improbable; the higher quality items, will have much less instability on them for the affix tiers they've got, and you'll have a better chance to craft the item through those. If you want a specific T6/T7 affix, you'll definitely need it drop anyway. So you seek an item with the affixes you can work with as a base, and try to add the affixes you want, remove the ones you don't want, or improve existing ones up to T5. 

If you are unlucky, a fracture occurs. You can use glyphs (crafting supplements) to have a chance to reduce the added instability, or mitigate the damage of the fractures. A minor fracture locks the items, major / destructive fractures lower the tier of some affixes in addition to locking them. 

During crafting, if the affix you want gets removed, or de-leveled, or if the item gets fractured before you are done with the affix you really want, the item is essentially bricked. And I've bricked way too many items without any wins in between as RNGesus told me to fuck off even with a 1% fracture chance. Yeah, I'm mad...

I really hope that the devs will add very rare crafting supplements that'll protect your item when you are working on it, or something like a very rare ""magic glue"" to put the fractured item back together, because finding a good base is a big hassle, and when you do find one, seeing it fracture is extremely annoying, especially if the fracture occured on a very low percentage, and/or on the last step of the crafting.

In short, crafting is still as dependant on RNGesus as any other ARPG out there, and you [i]will[/i] brick good items. There is a risk involved in crafting, and you'll experience extremely unsatisfying results, and reliefs here and there after a successful craft. Just because I have some negative views on the matter due to my bad luck (streak) doesn't mean you'll definitely have a similar experience.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I've listed (cried about) the points that I don't like very much about the game but could be improved. If some of the things I mentioned bother you, you might want to think twice; I want to highly recommend the game, but these things make it a ""mild"" recommendation for me. 

The developers seem to be listening to feedback, and not entirely disconnected from their playerbase or from their game like some other devs (*cough*PoE*cough*) are. As a game still in Early Access, nothing is set in stone. 

If you are in-love with ARPG as a genre, get it. It'll keep you busy for at least 20-30 hours even if you are not that into ARPG as a genre, in my opinion. A solid entry to the genre, I hope it won't get bloated over time.

1623730,Palworld,"fine until like level 30, then the grind is just becomes a pain in the ass
played in single player, changed to custom settings at like level 43 (more xp, higher catch rate, more resources gained, eggs hatch instantly)

you are permanently out of ore
you need ore for every single build/craft
the catch rates are a fucking joke considering how expensive the late game spheres are to craft (Legendary Sphere is 20 ore PER SPHERE)
the simple fix would be to just add an ore/coal farm, similar to the wood/stone farm, so I can actually build a base in a cool spot and not be forced to have 2 mining bases

this game 100% needs shared inventory for all bases, considering its designed in a way where you build mining bases for ore/coal
because currently its a pain in the ass to manually move all the items to main base, even with the carrying capacity maxed out

displayed catch chance HAS to be wrong

Raids need to either be fixed or removed entirely, it's pointless the way it is right now, defenses are lowkey useless

minimap would be cool to have ig

assigning pals to workstations hardly ever works, would be cool to just have a UI where you can assign them instead of having to do it manually

revives/heals would be cool, having to wait 10 minutes/sleeping at night is eh

pals getting stuck in/on objects and starving to death/becoming depressed happens way too frequently/medicine is too expensive to fix/replacing them is more efficient

2h+ for an egg to hatch is a joke
wanted to try the breeding, ended up just changing it to 0 in settings 

the only real way of getting xp is the first 10 catches of any pal? 

bullets are way too expensive considering you are always out of ore

building a base is cool, but the pals with just get stuck in a fucking wall and starve anyways

pals that can't fly need a buff when mounted

Anubis is the fucking GOAT

236390,War Thunder,"Tanks are okay until Rank 4, when the serious grind starts. Planes are easy to grind and you can get to rank 5 with sanity intact. If gameplay is all that matters then by all means play it, but if you care about how corrupt the company can be then beware.

List of some things they did off the top of my head:

- Sued an individual for using the domain name ""Gaijin.net"" even though the original gaijin.net predated the company by seven years.

- Threatened to ruin part of the game if players didn't help them abuse youtube's DMCA strikes against youtubers that showed bad things about the game.

- Completely ignores community balance suggestions, acts like their game is 100% balanced and that anyone who suggests changes is wrong.

- Gaijin support is not worth contacting, they find ways to circumvent their own policies.


Not that any of this affects gameplay, just thought people should know what kind company is getting the money.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"I have a long history with the Sims franchise. I started playing The Sims 2 when I was a child because of my mother (and, back in the day, even my grandmother played it). I remember The Sims 3 coming out. I've loved these games ever since I can remember, and they have a very special place in my heart. 

Buying this game on Steam was kinda useless, seeing as I already owned it since its release in 2014 on Origin (frankly, I just wanted to see those hours pile up on Steam whenever I get into the cycle of Remember Game Exists > Play Game Obsessively For A Short Period > Forget Game Exists, and I felt a little guilty about my, uhm, less-than-legitimate maritime exploration, to put it in a cute little ~metaphor~, of all of the DLC content over the years).

Now, would I recommend The Sims 4? Honestly, it depends. There are many different kinds of Simmers, and I don't think this is the most adequate for every single one of them.

Lore-wise? Girl, put on an eyepatch and go explore the Sims 2. If you're expecting fleshed out, non-half-assed stories, this will disappoint. (And it has. Why did they do the Caliente sisters this dirty? Why? I just wanna know...)

Building-wise? 100% MADE FOR YOU, BUY IT. I have never considered myself a builder, ever, but this game... Oh, man, it really boosts my self-esteem, not gonna lie. Whenever I make house I'm really proud of, I showcase it to every one. It's great! I think everyone can agree that this game has the best Build-and-Buy Mode that the Sims franchise has ever seen.

CAS-wise? Hmmmm, this one is tricky. Creating Sims is so fun, it's true, but without Custom Content? It's a no-go for me, thank you very much. I've recently discovered that a lot of people find the Sims 3 sims ugly, and that was honestly a HUGE surprise to me, because although the sims in The Sims 4 are much more aesthetically pleasing than in any of the other games WITH CUSTOM CONTENT INCLUDED, if I have to create vanilla sims? Nope. They're just kinda weird-looking, in my opinion, and I'd much rather play The Sims 3 if I'm not gonna include custom content.

Now, one thing that should go without saying is that EA IS VERY GREEDY. This isn't news to anyone, I know, but I'm just saying this to emphasize that if you're not planning on buying any DLC for this game you may as well just go on a lawless maritime exploration of it instead of purchasing it, because the base game itself is NOT IT. At all. It gets boring after a while. 

My strategy going forward is probably going to be: play game > forget it exists > remember it exists > get the cheapest pack I can > play game with its new features. The DLC is very expensive, though, and that is something to remember. The Sims 3, for example, is worth playing with just the base game installed, in my opinion, so if you don't like to get absolutely scammed into giving EA your money, maybe try that one? Just don't get the Katy Perry stuff pack if you do decide to buy DLC after all. It's not worth it, bestie.

(So, yes, while I know I am scamming myself at this point by monetarily supporting this game, I decided to do it anyway! It was an impulse-buy. But I digress,)

Overall, The Sims 4 has gotten a lot better since it started. It's had a few hiccups along the road, and that's without counting the Star Wars pack, because I refuse to acknowledge that it wasn't a random fever dream I had. But it has gotten better, and I'd say it's worth playing if you pick a few DLC that you think you'll enjoy, and some Custom Content to your liking! I'd also recommend some mods like MC Command Center or other story progression mods just to make the game more realistic and fun. The Sims 4 community is active as hell on places like The Sims Resource or even Twitter and Tumblr, so make the most of it for your modding and/or objects and clothing needs. If you're not going to be taking part in any of that, though, for some reason... I'd refrain from playing this game at all. The Sims 4 is like sliced bread. You probably don't enjoy sliced bread by itself, or eat it very often, do you? It's plain, basic, and boring! The community provides some extra ingredients. If you won't be making a sandwich, you might as well not buy the plain-ass bread.","Very Positive87% of the 127,522 user reviews for this game are positive.",long history sims franchise started sims 2 child mother grandmother remember sims 3 loved game remember special heart buying kinda useless seeing already owned release 2014 origin frankly wanted hour pile whenever cycle remember exists play obsessively short period forget exists guilty uhm legitimate maritime exploration cute metaphor downloadable additional released initial launch year recommend sims honestly depends different kind simmer t_emphasizedhink adequate single lore wise eyepatch explore sims 2 expecting fleshed non half assed story disappoint caliente sister dirty wan na building wise 100 never_considered builder oh man boost self esteem not_gonna lie whenever house proud showcase great agree best build mode sims franchise ca wise hmmmm tricky creating sims fun custom no_go recently discovered sims 3 sims ugly honestly huge surprise sims sims aesthetically pleasing game custom included vanilla sims nope kinda weird rather play sims 3 not_gonna include custom saying ea greedy news saying emphasize not_planning buying downloadable additional released initial launch lawless maritime exploration purchasing base not_it get boring strategy forward probably play forget exists remember exists cheapest pack play feature downloadable additional released initial launch expensive remember sims 3 example worth base installed scammed giving ea maybe katy perry stuff pack decide downloadable additional released initial launch not_worth bestie yes scamming monetarily supporting decided anyway impulse digress sims gotten started hiccup along road counting star war pack refuse acknowledge random fever dream gotten worth pick downloadable additional released initial launch enjoy custom liking recommend mod mc command center progression mod realistic fun sims community active hell place sims resource twitter tumblr modding object clothing need not_going taking refrain sims sliced bread probably enjoy sliced bread eat plain basic boring community provides extra ingredient sandwich not_buy plain as bread

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.

I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:

The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else. 

To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal. 

Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.

If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.

That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.

I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.

Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.

It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.

The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.

This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.

So that was a shitload of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.","Very Positive86% of the 1,043,127 user reviews for this game are positive.",starter edition mentioned temporary no_longer exists approval stand 30 sale price mean payng operator front hour inform clarify matter preface saying last mode multiple player interact compete real titanfall causing affected interested loss player abandoned server starter edition smart implementation fresh blood onto server cost entry previously high clear no_difference starter player regular player besides take unlock operator class starter player play server else play map unlockable operator available else explain starter briefly explain rather generously dole map operator included patch operator paid ubibucks desired make season pas practically useless launch offered minor privilege early operator access six privilege mean base segmented no_map operator acquire purchasing season pas downloadable additional released initial launch starter edition randomly assigns attacker operator defender along ubibucks purchase 2 additional operator choosing 4 disposal earns renown fake currency purchase operator weapon skin cosmetic starter player require 12 000 renown purchase operator regular player 2 000 call repeatedly performing action gain resource reach 12 000 a_emphasized mode multiple player interact compete real intrinsically fun repeatedly performing action gain resource reach reward fun play progression unlocks big player day lack thing progress towards cited reason stopped titanfall thing unlock glad operator 9 10 hour mainlined buying starter edition earned renown purchase sale 7 500 thousand left repeatedly performing action gain resource offset daily challenge offer extra renown operator sale rotation week operator awhile truly learn due nature thing balanced operator simply playstyle opposed signifigant advantage opponent close mastering 4 starting operator earned renown unlock bought couple play clarifying wanted glance looked evolution c waited year harshness indie modification alteration player fan nature insurgency far hard justify 60 purchase c 15 regularly go sale leveled field starter edition finally accessible address issue price mode multiple player interact compete real argument issue par year ut 2k4 quake 3 arena especially map continued refinement provided freely patch a_emphasized series connected mission level form storyline addition high budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter commonly attached modern shooter excellent balancing clash style failing teach meat teaching play exactly single 10 situation feature different operator showcase different skill gadget importantly pacing nature jumping mode multiple player interact compete real play mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal terrorist hunt lone wolf five play wish mode multiple player interact compete real playable bot add future already deadly bot single possibility definitely trained play a_emphasized mode multiple player interact compete real shooter especially experienced else market play slow spent prone sprint sparingly lean left button essential leaning corner die extremely fast 1 3 connecting bullet kill enemy habit reloading fire abandoned reload speed relatively slow bullet left clip kill 1 2 leaving vulnerable reloading slow pace time cause white knuckle tension matched thrilling rappel side building toss grenade window couple kill notice shrapnel left hole wooden wall score sneaky kill loss tense cause slamming fist tension make victory wild rush cheer loud action shooter chess s_emphasizedimple learn understand lifetime truly master high 10 expert high skill ceiling operator deploying blocking deployment angle burned memory dynamic option not_be prior mode multiple player interact compete real love lightning fast giant robot happen port port excellent offering option pc player expect scale low high rig 2 unique aa solution exclusive temporal ghosting issue address sub pixel aliasing unique solution half resolution applies msaa frame lost pixel addressing jaggies built twitch streaming feature natively support xbox 360 1 controller dualshock 4 offering option deadzones sensitivity controller play viable basically understand pc gaming no_hobbled ps4 port deal uplay annoying guess client launch top notice it_emphasized crash multiple gb ram install adware computer family aid expecting based heard simply open launch need closed close minor annoyance worst shitload word sound gushing exceeded high expectation 15 entry possible play wanted spread word fence explain wait hour

236390,War Thunder,"I've been playing for years, and some of my time isn't even listed on Steam. So with all that behind me, what do I have to say?

War Thunder is a hard game to learn if you want to be good from the start. It's not quite a simulator with 60 different keybinds being thrown at you, but over time it has certainly gotten more complex. Inconsistent mechanics and frequent ""balance"" updates can make the ground highly unstable even for more experienced players, depending on what they want out of the game.

What can you get out of the game? Considering how bland the main gamemodes become after a while, it's impressive how well War Thunder remains interesting, with a huge variety of vehicles to use, through different classes of tanks, planes and I guess, if you really wanted, ships, there will always be something to learn, and new ways to challenge yourself.

The grind is heavily reliant on players buying premium vehicles, making some more modern equipment immensely tedious to unlock for free, but the majority of the game is available for free.

In short: If you like war machines of any type, or are looking for an alternative to the standard FPS formula, War Thunder fits the bill, but it won't be without frustration at times. 
Fun, hard to pick up, hard to put down, easy to love, easy to hate.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"I finally feel like after 631 hours in game that it is time to write a review... 
Overall this game is amazing. It reminds me of my life growing up on sailboats on the ocean in Hawaii, minus the pirates, loot and krakens, lol .. 
It is a stunningly beautiful game.. So much detail and the graphics are phenomenal.. The quests are fun and creative and there's so much to do.. Even just island hopping and looking for loot is a good time.. It's also been super awesome meeting fellow 'pirates' from around the world.. It's a very social game which is a lot of fun.. I thought after reaching Pirate Legend and topping out in rank that the game would get dull or boring but there's always new events and commendations to take part in.. This game is anything but boring.. There is always something to do and enjoy.. 

However, like most games there are some downsides.. This game can be difficult to play solo.. Mainly fighting off enemy ships, galleon skelly's, doing some events, even some quests like vault quests can be difficult on your own... 

Another issue is the maps can be really hard to read and navigate in order to dig up treasure.. They don't have a lot of detail to them and some can take an hour or more to find..  A little more fine detail would be nice..

 Also, the sailing between islands is very time consuming at times.. Just sailing from one island in a quest to the next can take a pretty long time.. This isn't really a game you can plan to hop on for a half hour or so.. I have found it takes a good two hours to even complete a quest or event, so plan on spending some time in game when you hop on your ship..

 Another thing is there is no option for just PVE, which sucks when you would really just like to get on and play the game and not do PVP.. This is personally my biggest issue.. 
Sure, people will say 'This is Sea of Thieves! Not Sea of Friends!' yada yada... Yes, we all know this.. But it would be nice to have the option to just do PVE or just play with friends.. I have noticed a progression in my 631 hours playing of players being downright nasty.. I strongly feel like some get on not to rank up, do quests or events, meet new people or enjoy the beautiful scenery in the game.. No, their number one focus is just to attack people.. Not to even take their loot or their emissary flag, but just to ruin someone else's game, and waste hours sometimes that it has taken to collect that loot and finish a quest..
 People can even form an alliance with you, do a fort or quest with you and then once you've spent hours working as a 'team' turn on you, kill you, blow up your ship, and steal all of the loot you all just worked hard to get.. I have quit doing alliances after having this happen at least a dozen times.. Basically, no one is your friend.. Unless they are in your crew you should not trust them..
 It can just be pretty frustrating to have some jerks come along and attack you, even when you have no emissary flag up, no loot and your're literally just cruising around exploring.. In recent weeks since the game has been on sale I have played with at least a half dozen or more brand new players who we've had this happen to and they've decided to no longer play, even uninstalling the game altogether because they're just frustrated with putting in all that time and work for nothing.. I get it.. 
The latest one was an enemy attacking me saying 'Come on baby, come get me' and 'Come here sexy lady, take your shot' and just being really rude and obnoxious.. I try hard not to give a reaction since that's what they're wanting but it can be borderline bullying and Rare allows it.. So you really have to have thick skin sometimes with some of these nasty people..
 
  Lately, more often then not, I get off the game not reflecting on what a good time it was or how much gold I made or quests I did, or cool people I've met, but annoyed and angry because of repeatedly being attacked to the point I couldn't even really even play the game..
 I'll never stop playing but my biggest wish for this game would be to give the option to just play PVE or with friends if you're not up to constant battling.. Believe me, with the right crew a good ol ship fight is a lot of fun.. Your adrenaline goes crazy and it can be awesome.. But sometimes you don't want to play that kind of game, you just want to play a chill game, and it be nice to have that choice... 
Overall, this game is my favorite game to play.. It is so much fun.. I recommend it to everyone I know.. And every new season has great new additions.. I hope this review can help someone considering the game or new to the game to know what to expect!

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"Coming into CK3 as a longtime CK2 and EUIV player, I was slightly concerned about the content and playability of CK3. After all, CK2 in its initial stage was very limited, and it was through the course of very many DLCs that fleshed out CK2 to what it is today. CK3, being brand new, and (rightfully) with no expansions, felt like it would be in danger of being a pale imitation of its predecessor. 

However, now with over 40 hours in CK3, I can safely say this game lives up to everything that CK2 brought to the field and more! The UI is much, much more intuitive and new player-friendly. Furthermore, content that was added over a long period of time through expansions/DLCs like India and Tibet are in the game right off the bat and immediately playable! There are also many new, welcome mechanics, at least for people like me who like to roleplay their dynastic legacies or 'jump ship' so as to speak. Let me explain!

To start myself off in CK3, I decided to go with an old favourite, the Magyars. Leading the fore as Almos, I led the Magyars to migrate into the Carpathian Basin, snatching it from Bulgaria. Following this, I attempted to conquer enough lands to reform the Taltoist faith, but combined pressure from the Carolingian Kingdoms and the Byzantine Empire led to the death of Almos and poured cold water over my dreams of reformed Taltoism. As Almos's son, Arpad, I turned Catholic, and used 'holy war' as an excuse to conquer all my heathen neighbours despite being pagan just years ago. With Hungary formed and its borders secure, Arpad finally passes on. As the 3rd-generation King Szonuk, I noticed Bavaria was no longer in the hands of the Karlings, thereby breaking their tripartite alliance. I bide my time, building prestige, formed alliances with West Francia and the Byzantine Empire, and proceeded to invade and conquer Bavaria, creating the Austro-Hungarian Empire centuries before its supposed to exist. 

As Szonuk dies and my 4th-generation Arpad II takes the throne, I notice I am, in fact, able to claim the West Francian throne for my mother. So I invade my former allies without further ado and put dear mum on the throne. As my mother passes on and the throne of West Francia comes to my greedy little hands, the Austro-Hungarian Empire has surpassed even Charlemagne, and stretches from France to Hungary. My son, Szonuk II, through careful eugenics, is a genius, and my grandson, Arpad III, a HERCULEAN genius! Nothing can stand in our way now!

But wait. A killer roams the castle. I am shocked and horrified to discover my herculean genius grandson dead. Dead before he even has a chance to fulfil his glorious legacy. I vow to find the killer myself. Clearly, it must be a Karling loyalist, or maybe even a Byzantine spy trying to undermine my power. As I investigate, I get ever closer to the truth... and then receive a letter, from none other than the killer! The killer says they have been living under my nose this whole time, and that the truth will only bring me pain. I push on nonetheless... I must know the truth! And when I confront the killer... its...

... My son, Szonuk II! 

Why?! How?! it's your own son! My grandson! 

I am aggrieved. I disinherit him and put him in jail immediately. My successor changes to one of my other, more virtuous, less kinslayer-inclined sons. As I ponder what to do with my insane genius kinslayer of a son, the Pope's messenger arrives. A crusade, he declares, is to be launched into Jerusalem. Being the pious Emperor that I am, I of course, agree. To my surprise, my son qualifies as a beneficiary of the crusade, due to being disinherited. Hm. So be it. I free him from jail, force my son to be in the frontlines as a knight, and send him off to lead the imperial armies and hopefully die a virtuous death despite living as a sinner. 

The crusade against the Abbasids goes swimmingly. Too swimmingly. In a twist of fate, my sinful son becomes monarch of the holiest kingdom, Jerusalem itself. Well. So be it. He'll probably die defending the holy city once the Abbasids recover and launch their counter-assault. I have no inclination to help him. So, I click past the notifications, and...

... I accidentally click ""I wonder what kind of King he'll be?"" 

And now all of a sudden I'm the kinslaying villain disinherited by the Emperor, and sent to be king of a forsaken holy kingdom that i have no chance of holding. With a single demesne, with all my vassals and everybody in my family hating me because I'm a kinslaying nutjob. FFFFF-

Just as I consider ragequitting, I figure... Hang on, this might be the most interesting character to roleplay as yet. A kinslaying, lunatic-genius exiled from home and sent to die fighting for the cross to atone for himself. 

So I lean into it. I become the most insanely fanatical holy king ever. My first order of business is to imprison and revoke the titles of all my vassals from the contributing houses of the crusade. Now my demesne is full and my coffers are slowly filling up. Then, I befriend the Byzantine Emperor, bribing him with huge amounts of gold, most of it given to me by the Pope despite my lunacy due to my renowned piety (thank you, Your Holiness!) and swaying him with my evil charisma. 

I see that he has three sons. I marry my daughter (thank god I didn't kill YOU too) to the youngest matrilineally. Now we have an alliance. With the aid of the Byzantines I survive in the land of the infidels, and slowly expand by absorbing the smaller Islamic emirates around me, never lifting a finger and simply burning prestige to let the Byzantines do their thing and wipe out my enemies. Following this, I systematically kill off the very helpful Emperor's older sons. The first murder goes unnoticed. The second, unfortunately, is traced back to me. The Byzantine Emperor is very understandably heartbroken and furious with me. So I assassinate him too. 

Now my son-in-law is Byzantine Emperor, and he hates me for killing off basically his entire direct family. Sure, understandable. I check my daughter and see she already has two sons born to our house. Cackling madly all the way and out of my mind with stress, I commit suicide. 

Now I am my daughter. Over the years, I watch as my husband drinks himself to death, leaving the Byzantine Empire to my oldest son, who I groom into another herculean genius. By the time I pass on and play as my son, the Herculean Genius, Hungarian Catholic, Byzantine Emperor and King of Jerusalem Szonuk III, I look to the west and see our ancestral legacy, instead of imploding like I thought, has remained intact, and blossomed towards England and Scandinavia as well. As I look at the sea of Arpadys covering the map, I vaguely realize I've recreated the Western and Eastern Roman Empires.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Valheim comparisons, in general, aren't doing anyone any favors. I purchased V Rising because of all the reviewers calling it ""Valheim with vampires"". V Rising isn't remotely like Valheim, and I couldn't squeeze even 2 hours out of it. Valheim has good game mechanics, but a significant reason for its mesmerizing immersion is its art style. The musical score could inspire Dvorak or Mendelssohn, the subtle pixelation combined with masterful lighting makes it less like computer animation than impressionistic painting, and the creature design looks like it was taken from a 9th century tome. Only a shameless copy could hope to re-evoke the same feelings.

Enshrouded is instead its own game. The graphics are appealing, reminiscent of Immortals Fenix Rising. The voxel building & landscaping is innovative and fun. The map is interesting and large (although EA boundaries are discovered pretty quickly). If you want to explore a new world, or if you want to engage in veratile base building, Enshrouded may be for you. It is quite good. And the shroud mechainc I find quite compelling.

There are some immersion breakers, which hopefully will get addressed during EA. First, resource respawning is way too quick and without variation, much like Conan Exiles. Your character in the early game (which is all I know) seems overpowered. Mobile assets like animals and bosses frequently get stuck quivering in complex landscapes. You can't drop inventory items, but istead must delete them. The day-night transitions are beautiful, but seem too rapid. 

I find many of the criticisms less than generous, considering this is early access and not intended to be a Valheim clone. Even with its problems I find it more compelling than most AAA titles that debut at 2x the price.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"I did an updated version of this review on Medium. You can find it at this link. 

https://medium.com/@kurdtzdopelgangr1/bugfixes-wont-solve-cyberpunk-2077-s-problems-a41efb02ab3a

It's both longer and better. I consider it superior in every way to this steam review.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Six months ago when this game came out many people said, ""Underneath all the bugs, Cyberpunk 2077 is an enjoyable game with a good story."" 

I disagreed then, and I disagree even more now. With all the work CD Project Red has done in fixing bugs and implementing a functioning police system it's only become more clear that this game is shallow in many areas and shoots itself in the foot in others. 

At launch, this game was like a teenager's terminally messy room. It was so messy you couldn't tell what the room's layout was like underneath all the clutter. It could be that underneath this massive pile of dirty clothing up against the wall there's a bed, or a dresser, or it could just be one giant pile of filthy, stinky clothing. But six months later it's easier to understand the room's layout, and unfortunately the effort spent on fixing the technical issues has only accentuated that this game is mediocre at best. In spite of how awe inspiring and visually stimulating the city is, the game simply fails to take full advantage of it's setting. 

Cyberpunk 2077 needed to follow in Bioshock's footsteps, but instead it's more like any generic Ubisoft open world game. In terms of combat, Bioshock is a game that gives the player a ton of fun tools to kill enemies with in creative ways. Cyberpunk 2077 was practically begging for a similar combat system, but instead combat in Cyberpunk boils down to three repetitive options: hold tab and press the I Win button, sit behind cover and shoot the dumb bullet sponge enemies or sprint around with a melee weapon. The combat in this game is just not very satisfying or interesting. By the end of the game the combat left me with a feeling of extreme boredom that was only matched by the extreme boredom the gigs inspired.

The side missions are split between the ones CD Project's writers clearly had a story idea for  and the ones with almost no story that are about mindlessly killing everything that moves while also looting and interacting with computers. They attempted to break up this monotony with missions that require stealth if you want to make the full amount of money, but it doesn't alleviate the problem. The repetitive nature of the mindless combat side missions actively  diminishes the immersion that the visuals and layout of Night City create. It's a far cry from Rapture, where the environment, combat and quests all harmonize beautifully to keep the player firmly immersed.

When there's an actual story to engage with, the side missions do add to the immersion by contributing to the themes present in the game. But contributing a bit to the immersion and servicing the various themes is just about all they do.

Spirituality, the soul, life beyond death, fame, opportunity, corporate colonialism, cybernetics and transformation. The themes of this game, and how the player gets to experience them, are the one area where CD Project did a pretty great job. They're presented to the player constantly in a million small and big ways all over the city. The news you hear on the radio or see on the TV about the last vestiges of popular government being stripped away by the corporations. The constant oppressive advertisements that are literally everywhere you look. The vast fields of trash and discarded tech on the outskirts of the city. They're all aspects of the same system, a system of violence, consumption and lies that is designed to stomp out empathy. It's a system with only one truth: this world belongs to the corporations. Your presence in it is only tolerated insofar as you contribute to keeping the corps in power.

Night City is an elaborate trap set by the people at the very top of corporate society. It lures people in and grinds them into dust or turns them into controllable monsters. It's a slot machine of promises where all outcomes reward the people at the top and destroy everyone else. I think Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most hopeless settings in all of video games.

Unfortunately I have to stop complimenting Cyberpunk 2077 now, because this is where Johnny Silverhand comes in.

The decision to cast all around good guy Keanu Reeves as Johnny was incredibly savvy. Johnny Silverhand is objectively a human piece of shit with an ego so big that only the biggest and most evil corporation on the planet was big enough to match it. In a way, Keanu was the only person who could play Johnny because Keanu's real life likability was the only way to counterbalance Johnny's intense unlikability. In my opinion Keanu did a great job with the material. Whenever I talked to Johnny I was completely immersed, and the conversations I had with him were the highlights of the game for me.

Johnny has a character arc in this game. It's a pretty good one as well, which is a rare thing to find in a AAA video game. But all of the good work CD Project did with him throughout the game gets ruined by one thoughtless error. 

I hated Johnny throughout the game, in a good way, and I was antagonistic to him whenever I got the option. I didn't care that Johnny realized he had made a ton of mistakes, I hated him for everything he did when he was alive and for being a brain parasite that was slowly killing me in the worst possible way. I really enjoyed the experience of being able to hate a video game character because of who he was and not because the character was badly written. 

When I reached the end of the game and had to make the choice, I decided to go with Arasaka. Partly because I didn't want to get Panam and her friends killed and partly because Johnny hated that idea. I loved arguing with him at the end as they pulled the biochip out of my brain. I literally laughed out loud when Johnny tried to use Jackie against me as his parting shot. But it wasn't what I really wanted to do. I desperately wanted to just attack Arasaka on my own, fuck risking my friends and fuck Arasaka. But since it apparently never occurred to my character to do that, I didn't get that option. And then I found out that you can do it, but only as a secret ending and only if you were friendly with Johnny throughout the game. It felt like the game developers were punishing me for selecting options they had freely offered to me. They were punishing me for not liking this unlikable guy. 

It doesn't make sense to me that my character wouldn't consider attacking Arasaka on his own. V can choose to commit suicide, so why can't he consider attacking Arasaka without Johnny playing into it somehow?

It ruined Johnny Silverhand's character for me, and honestly it destroyed the last little bit of good will I felt towards this game. It was like having the rug pulled out from under me at the last second, I couldn't enjoy anything about the story anymore knowing how CD Project decided to treat my choices. I don't know if it was a deliberate choice by them or not, but it's baffling and I hate it. 

I can't recommend Cyberpunk 2077. I definitely hate certain aspects of it, but overall I don't quite hate it. That said, the things I like about this game are significantly outweighed by the things I don't. I can say this, though, I sincerely hope CD Project doesn't give up on Cyberpunk. I want them to keep trying, either by rebuilding this game from the ground up or making a sequel. The only way for CD Project to truly fail at this point is if they give up. For the things they succeeded with in this game, I'm willing to give them another chance. I hope they take it.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"Under normal circumstances, I like to finish a game before I review it. However, these are not normal circumstances. Rather, these are as abnormal as circumstances get. (Okay, I might be exaggerating… but still.) Even though I’m only part way through the third act of the game, I want to get this review done because (a) I want to get this written before the year’s end and/or this award season, (b) I’ll get a badge for posting it during the Steam Awards, and (c) it’s [i]Baldur’s[/i] fucking [i]Gate 3[/i]! You probably already know everything I’m going to say, so why wait?

So, yeah, what we have here is a game that is likely to win multiple “Game of the Year” awards, will be remembered in 2029 as one of the best games of the decade, and will be found on many peoples’ lists of the greatest games of all time. It is an absolute triumph in nearly every possible way, and we should all be grateful that it exists. That may sound hyperbolic, but I mean every word: this game could shake up the gaming landscape as we know it in ways that only benefit us as players. In a world of battle passes, loot boxes, and DLC, here comes [i]Baldur’s Gate 3[/i] with its dick swinging: a [b]huge[/b], complete game whose developers have no plans for DLC, whatsoever. Even EActivisionSoft will sit up and take notice when this game continues to exist in the public consciousness for a long time to come.

“[b]But slanderoid[/b],” I hear you shrieking into your monitor or phone or PDA or whatever, “[b]we get that you think the game is important, but is it [i]fun?![/i][/b]”

Let me answer your question with another question: What other game would have the player walk in on a goblin porking an orc in a barn and then have to kill them to keep them from ripping your team apart in a blue-balled rage? How about having the player talk a mad scientist into performing surgery on himself to avoid fighting him in a boss battle? How about letting a helpful but overly zealous bard pull out your character’s eyeball in an attempt to remove the Yeerk from their head, only to replace it with an eyeball he had in his pocket? Sounds like fun, no? …No? Oh, maybe I could have phrased it better: Yes. This game is fun as hell.

You’ll find all of that in this game. Or you won’t. Maybe you’ll find all different stuff. The number of different paths and events in this [b]huge[/b] game is genuinely staggering. Normally this is the kind of thing that would give me choice paralysis, forcing me to turn the game off and never come back again. [i]However[/i], since every choice leads to something interesting, surprising, or, yes, fun, I never really felt like I was missing out. Honestly, I just feel like I need to play it again some time and choose completely different options next time.

Okay, let’s run down the list of other great stuff in this game: this game is gorgeous, even on my ancient GTX 1080; the characters are believably expressive, adding to the immersion; the music is memorable; the voice acting is excellent; and narratively, this game is immediately gripping and never lets go. Basically, anyone who has a litmus test for what makes a good game, this game passes. It’s almost guaranteed.

The story would be nothing, of course, if it wasn’t full of amazingly badass characters. Every member of the player’s party comes with an interesting back story and a set of side quests that will determine their fate as the story unfolds. Seriously, even the suckiest character (Wyll) has a cool story. And, as you’re probably aware, you can romance any of the people on your team and you’ll learn even more about them. I haven’t even mentioned the hordes of NPCs that the player encounters throughout the realm that have full stories of their own.

Now, this wouldn’t be one of my reviews without sharing one of my objectively awful opinions that’s likely to leave you completely dumbfounded about how I manage to even play games at all. (Other than saying that Wyll sucks, that is.) So, here it is: I wish there was a setting to bypass all of the dice rolls during conversations. Not just the animation – the whole ass mechanic itself. As someone who doesn’t give two farts about D&D, the dice rolls just feel like a way for the game to keep my character from doing what I want them to do. I’ve been playing this for well over 100 hours (and I’ve only just started Act III, so I’m counting on another few dozen hours, at least) and I’m getting old enough that I’ve begun staring into the face of my own mortality, so I just want the decisions I make in the game to be followed through with – not checked against RNG to see if my decision would work out. In a world where Nabbit and Funky Kong exist, I don't think it's too much to ask... As it is, I’ve spent a great deal of time sitting in front of the loading screen after reloading my last save because a die roll didn’t go the way I wanted it to.

I’ll give you a moment to get your heartrate back to normal. Take ten deep breaths. Do you still feel like smashing your keyboard or phone or stylus or whatever? Okay, take another second. 

Did you get it out of your system? Okay, let’s get back to it.

I know that I was talking up the different, random paths the player can find themselves taking through the story just a little bit ago, but I think the die rolls would be better on my second playthrough. I’d love to see what kind of crazy crap happens when I fail a die roll for telling a bog hag to eat shit. But, on my first time through, I don’t want the outcome to be out of my hands. I just want to tell her to eat crap and let nature take its course without RNG getting in the way.

Okay, I’m done disparaging the fundamental mechanics of TTRPGs. However, I’d be an even crappier reviewer if I didn’t remind readers that this game is [b]huge[/b] with hundreds of different possible outcomes in any given moment of the game – so there are bugs. I’ve had the game crash several times, which was frustrating until I remembered to save early and save often.

Which brings me to one of my favorite features of this game that I haven’t heard much about. When I first started playing, I tried relying on the autosave to carry me through the game. This was a mistake – it only reliably autosaves when you enter a new map and the maps in this game are (care to take a guess?) [b]huge[/b]. Instead, the game allows the player to make manual saves [i]at any time[/i]. Have you been battling for way longer than you expected and now your mom is calling you downstairs for dinner? You can save if you need to. Are you in the middle of a conversation with an NPC but your cat has become a puke cyclone, so now you’ve got to step away and get mopping? Save. Are you in the middle of a date with your in-game romantic interest where you can see their nips and you want to come back to it again later – for science? Save, save, save!

I know it’s a silly thing to love about a game that is revolutionary in many ways but I’m a simple man. I’d love to see this feature show up in more games in the future. Autosave has come a long, long way but sometimes I’d love to be able to make manual saves whenever I want, too. I want it all!

Anyway, that’s enough rambling, I think. This game is fantastic. It’s my game of the year for good reason. (It even beat out [i]Resident Evil 4[/i], an outstanding remake of my favorite game of all time.) Barring financial or health reasons, everyone should play it. That means [b]you[/b]. [b]You[/b] should play this game. If you’re somehow still on the fence about playing it despite there being over 400,000 positive reviews of the game at the time of writing and, for some reason, this review is the one that is going to tip the scales: [i]play it, for god’s sake![/i] It’s worth every penny you’ll spend on it and many, many more.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 505,051 user reviews for this game are positive.",normal circumstance finish not_normal circumstance rather abnormal circumstance okay exaggerating third act written award season badge posting award c baldur fucking probably already wait yeah win multiple award remembered 2029 best game decade found people list greatest game absolute triumph nearly possible grateful exists sound hyperbolic word shake gaming landscape way benefit player world battle pass item reward dropped defeated enemy box downloadable additional released initial launch come baldur dick swinging huge complete developer no_plans downloadable additional released initial launch whatsoever eactivisionsoft sit notice continues exist public consciousness long b_emphasizedut slanderoid hear shrieking monitor phone pda whatever important fun answer question question walk goblin porking orc barn kill ripping apart blue balled rage talk mad scientist performing surgery avoid fighting bos battle letting helpful overly zealous bard pull eyeball attempt remove yeerk replace eyeball pocket sound fun no_no oh maybe phrased yes fun hell maybe different stuff number different path event huge genuinely staggering normally kind choice paralysis forcing turn never_come choice lead interesting surprising yes fun never_really missing honestly play choose completely different option next okay great stuff gorgeous ancient gtx 1080 character believably expressive adding immersion music memorable voice acting excellent narratively immediately gripping never_lets basically litmus test make good pass guaranteed course amazingly badass character member party come interesting set side quest determine fate unfolds seriously suckiest wyll cool probably aware romance learn mentioned horde npc encounter throughout realm story review sharing objectively awful opinion leave completely dumbfounded manage play game saying wyll suck wish setting bypass dice roll conversation not_just animation as mechanic someone fart d_emphasized dice roll 100 hour started act iii counting dozen hour old begun staring face mortality decision followed not_checked rng decision world nabbit funky kong exist t_emphasizedhink ask spent great deal sitting front loading screen reloading last save die roll wanted moment heartrate normal ten deep breath smashing keyboard phone stylus whatever okay okay talking different random path taking bit ago die roll be_emphasizedtter playthrough love kind crazy crap happens fail die roll telling bog hag eat shit outcome hand eat crap nature course rng okay disparaging fundamental mechanic ttrpgs crappier reviewer remind reader huge hundred different possible outcome given moment bug crash time frustrating remembered save early save brings favorite feature heard started tried relying autosave carry mistake reliably autosaves enter map care guess huge allows manual save battling longer expected mom calling downstairs dinner save middle conversation non controlled artificial cat puke cyclone mopping save middle romantic interest nip science save_emphasized silly love revolutionary way simple man love game future autosave long_emphasized love able manual save whenever anyway rambling fantastic good beat resident evil 4 outstanding remake favorite barring financial health reason play mean b_emphasized play somehow fence despite 400 000 positive review writing tip scale play god s_emphasizedake i_emphasizedt worth penny spend many_emphasized

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"It's important I preface this review with the following: I don't normally enjoy MMOs and I don't particularly like paying subscriptions to games.

The game however completely exceeded any expectations I had for it. I expected to play for a couple months and then be done with it. I'm still playing. I log on near every day, I have multiple classes past lvl 60, which NEVER happens in an MMO for me.

This game is gorgeous and stunning in not only character modeling, but animations, and atmosphere as well. The locations are breathtaking and I find myself just hanging out in places enjoying the scenery from time to time.

This MMO has a plot. It's a great plot. It's not totally flimsy like a lot of MMO plots, and heck, this one even ties into the original FFXIV. Well done. The characters are amazing and I really grew attached to many of them as a result.

Combat is enjoyable. As well it should be. As I found with most MMOs this game did have a slow start through the first 20-30 levels, but the story should be enough to keep you entertained, and its also great for getting those levels fast. The game also does not have to make a whole new character if you want to be a different class. You can level ALL the classes on the same character. It's amazing and I love that it does this, because I often want to play a variety of classes, but don't want to go through all the story questing again, or am far too attached to the one character to have to make a whole new one. Classes are also super varied despite falling into specific roles. My one issue is that queue times for finding Duty Finder groups is painstaking at non-peak hours if you are a DPS class.

The expansions never fail to disappoint. Heavensward and Stormblood are definitely worth picking up, and have been bundled together for your convenience. The new areas and locales are amazing to look at and adventure in.

All in all, this is the only game I will probably ever pay a sub fee for, and honestly, they deserve the money. This game is just that entertaining. I never regret spending my time playing.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Would i recommend it? Short Answer, YES!
Long answer , down below

Oh Lord, where to begin

Let us start with the most crucial Part for people that are interested in this Game.

Rethink how you play, Rethink how you want to engage this Game and most importantly:


Do what is most Fun for YOU!



I have to emphasize the Word Fun and You especially , because in the whole human efficiency part in us ""Gamers"" tend to suck the Fun out of Games or at least it tends to burn us out much faster in terms of MMORPG´s.


So What is FF14?

Best to be clear and honest , this is the ""second"" Iteration of the Game , because in their endless coporate Greed, Squareenix thought they could get away with publishing a broken Mess everybody hated. (I will not get into Detail with it but the whole Story behind it is wonderfull and has , mostly rare, a happy end)
Here a little Video to get more into Detail about the ""Old"" Mess:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWIrju3F6nU


But let History be History, the Game changed drastically and glorious.

We normally say Content is King, and for new players , it is not only 1 King it is a overwhelming whole Empire of Kings and Queens that is beeing thrown at you.

But as in a democracy , here you choose your King or Queen. There is a lot of Content , and a lot will have to be unlocked by the player, but that is kinda the whole magic about it.
to give a short lil sneakpeak what you can and will get:
-Quests  and alot of them (even if they are sometimes your typical fetchquest at a certain point they will allways kinda get you emotionally, trough cutscenes , music or the story of it)
-Instanced Quests (dungeon alike but focused on the story)
-Dungeons
-Trials (1 Boss ""raid"")
-Raids
-MSQ (Mainstoryquest)
-Ingame Themepark (Goldensaucer)
-Minion(pets)
-Mounts
-Glamour (Cosmetics)
-a extreme wide variety of Emotes
-Ingame Bard Job can play ""real music"" with different Instruments
-in certain areas of the game , mechanic heavy fights
-One of the best Crafting and Gathering Systems on the market
-and alot more that i might have forgotten (or haven´t even reached yet/unlocked)



So MSQ - Mainstoryquest in an MMORPG, really?

The concept of it is in general , to show you a nice decent story and on the ""Way"" of your Quest you unlock things naturally.
But from a perspective of a new player even this can tend to get overwhelming. (One thing people told be back then is FOCUS on the MSQ, only DO THAT)

The MSQ leads to wonderfull emotional moments , nice music , nice encounters , dungeons etc. But it also ""teases"" you do go further. 
The MSQ shows you an area , but then you get interested in a ""blue"" marked quest (the blue marked quest allways unlock stuff) so yeah you grab it and get into a dungeon , but then that´s not everything , you can keep going and find out more about Characters , their motivation and what happened.

It wants to be a Final Fantasy Game First
and a MMO second

Emotions are something , i don´t really ""feel"" inside of an mmo , there was maybe one particular scene in WoW (WoD) where a cinemativ kinda triggered an emotion , but that´s it.


But Boy oh Boy , if you are open for a Storyline and intense Characterbuilding and Growth and the Fact that you are really a ""Hero"" in a Game.

Be prepared for a Rollercoaster of Emotions. Once it clicks and you allow yourself to get immersed, then you try to go forth and go on with the MSQ.




So the Story is All Good then?

Honestly , it starts very slow. ARR (a realm reborn part) drags storywise exhaustingly long. It is not as boring as your normal mmorpg , but still it drags. But once you finished the ARR MSQ , shi* hits the fan everywhere. Emotion , Story , Drama , Feelz  , EVERYTHING just keeps getting bigger , better and much more intense.

Finally finished the MSQ , the expansions grow in quality, cutscenes , drama and there are certain points that will make you cry. And i am fine with that. (no other mmorpg ever done that)



Is it for WEEBS only?

Tough one , the whole cultural background is kinda japanese , some insiders are also Japanese , but the localization is Top notch. This goes for the English and also the German Voiceover/Text.
They have their wierd ""Fantasy"" words and dialect here and there , but it kinda fits to the game and the theme ( from a subjective point of view)

If you hate Catgirls/Catboys or Bunnygirls(no Bunnyboys so far) (for whatever reason), 
Then i suggest you take a 180 and avoid it.
Of course there is some wierd RP on certain Realms going on , but i have seen much much much much much much worse in WoW during some dungeonruns.....(yeah dranei female  char players get wierd shi* sometimes)

So if you like this kind of stuff or are indifferent towards it , then you should have no problem at all.





COMBAT!?

Yes , Combat exists, Combat is a crucial Part to progress in the Story and there are a lot of different classes/jobs to choose from. It is you typical Holy Trinity, Tank, Healer and DPS.

As slow as the Story starts , as slow starts the Combat. From the first point of View typical HUD , similarities to WoW and Everquest can be found.
in Detail it´s a tad more complex or ""will be"" more complex.

As you level up you get more and more abilities to use.
a Typical fight could look like this, you use a abilitie to punch somebody, GCD(global cooldown goes 2,5 secs)
you think, dear LORD 2,5 secs time to wait?

nope, in between this 2,5 seconds window you are expected to push another button or buttons, to keep on going , kinda weaving your OFFGCD abilities into your GCD abilities.

to make things more fun , the punch will be most likely a combo abilitie so it looks like this
Punch > offGCD button 1 button 2> different punch>offGCD button 3>super punch

It´s very simplified but i hope you get it.

While you try to ""perfect"" your rotation (btw all classes/jobs are kinda expected to make dmg even tanks and healers)
you also have to keep track of the combat/boss mechanics , most of the time in the very beginning shown by telegraphs , but some bosses just give you a hint when things will happen.

Now the wierd thing, the story , some bosses, dungeons, Trials, kinda also weave into the Story. So some Content will also make you feel intense Emotions towards encounters.

If you remember the Last fight in the oldschool Final Fantasy 7 , the rage , the hate, the feeling  this might happen with a few fights or in a similar Fashion in FF14. You will be a bit handicapped by your emotions , may it be anger , fear , hate, Lust or just pure Adoration of the Art.
(i died a lot of times because i just looked at my display in awe and told myself....Yep, that is Art!)




What´s the Community like?
hmm can only speak for the ""normal"" or ""casual"" crowd , the difference in this game is
it´s PG13. So no Swearing (at least not official in the ""tradechannel"").

The Rules are simple and kinda the same like in most mmorpgs , but Toxicity won´t be tolerated from the GM´s in terms of harassment.
This goes to such lenghts that the official Statement is , NO ADDONS ALLOWED , or to be precise there is no api integration build in for that.
and a DMG Metre/Parsing DMG is frowned upon in the casual/normal community but i heared it is beeing used heavily in Lategame Raids.

Officially Parsers are prohibited from the Devs but they allow it in terms of a grey area (if you harass somebody for bad dps or ""displease their enjoyment"" well , prepare for a bann)

Pros and Cons with dmg metres , don´t open that box of worms , to lengthy of a discussion.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Gonna just cut to the chase on this one, 

The game itself is fantastic, the world feels amazing and full of things to do but that is also a problem, if you play on a server with more than a few of you, the world will not regen its monsters, loot, resources or anything for that matter as its on a 2 hour refresh rate that can also have that timer reset if someone enters that area, this paired with the fact quests are not shared nor the progress and can cause issues for others to not allow them to finish them is a huge flaw in the co-op aspect, and well also this game was marketed heavy towards co-op and multiplayer even the launch trailer was co-op heavy.

I saw a review stating the game seemed more catered to the single player survival game, and i cant help but shake that feeling that this game is more appealing if played as single player as opposed to playing with friends.

If your a person who plays solo in survival games then i can openly recommend this game and hope that you enjoy, However if you play survival crafting games to play with friends, explore and farm materials, I cant recommend right now as this game seems to punish you for playing with others.","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",gon na cut chase fantastic world feel amazing thing problem play a_emphasized computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player world not_regen monster item reward dropped defeated enemy resource matter 2 refresh rate timer reset someone enters paired quest not_shared nor_the progress cause issue others not_allow finish huge flaw mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal aspect marketed heavy towards mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal mode multiple player interact compete real launch trailer mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal heavy saw stating catered single survival cant help shake feeling appealing single opposed friend play solo survival game openly recommend hope enjoy play survival crafting game play friend explore farm material cant recommend punish others

1245620,ELDEN RING,"I had never previosly played a From Software game before Elden Ring. I had very little experience with souls-likes, my only one being CODE VEIN which I had been playing on and off at that point, and never ended up finishing. By all accounts, this is not a game I ever thought I'd be interested in.

But there was so much excitement about it on launch. It looked amazing. A friend had taken a week off work just to play Elden Ring. And so on an impulse, I purchased it too.

Playing Elden Ring for the first time was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.

[h1]SETTING[/h1]

[quote]""The gold that enshrouds the heavens. The great tree which begets the pillars of light.
O Tarnished, hasten to the foot of the tree.""[/quote]

Elden Ring is set in an open world of the Lands Between. It's jaw-droppingly beautiful, diverse, and most importantly - very good at encouraging and rewarding exploration. I will not say anything more - it happened more than once that getting into a new area would leave me in awe, and it is really worth experiencing on your own with minimal spoilers.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3091274879
[h1]GAMEPLAY & COMBAT[/h1]

The gameplay loop in Elden Ring is fairly simple. You explore, you kill monsters, you get stonger by acquiring gear and levels, and use all this strength to beat big bad bosses to become the baddest boss of all - the Elden Lord.

Combat feels nice and smooth, and it's pretty easy to get the gist of even if you're new. You have your normal melee weapons, you have bows, you have magic... and each weapon also comes with a special strong ability called Ashes of War. And all of it works, and looks, and feels absolutely amazing.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2971836540
And if that's not enough, the game offers an ability to summon NPC spirits to aid you in battle - specifically in bigger fights and boss fights. This makes Elden Ring very accessible to newer players, who are trying it as their first From Software game. Don't get me wrong though - [b]it is still very challenging.[/b]

Best part - due to the open world nature of the game, if you're stuck somewhere, or just don't like the place, you can simply turn around and leave! Return later, or not at all, it's really up to you.

[h1]CONTROLS[/h1]

You can play with the controller or on keyboard & mouse setup, the latter of which works very well so you don't really [i]need[/i] a controller if you don't already own one.

...I'll actually go on a side tangent about controls. Unlike DS3, where it is impossible to get the UI to display keyboard controls, which makes playing on KBM an absolute headache of confusion, UI in Elden Ring fully supports KBM (you just... still need to find how to switch it because the controller controls are considered default, sigh), and the game itself is nicely* optimised** for KBM controls. 

(*not perfectly, just nicely)
(**you can do everything you can on the controller, you may just need a bit of time to figure out some Ashes of War with double component - there's some clicking trickery involved)

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]

[quote]""All I wanted was to fight. To fight, as a warrior, to the last...
So, Why? Why, O guidance of grace, will this door not open?""[/quote]

Elden Ring is a game that I really want to recommend to everyone... But I'm sure that, despite what I think about it, it might not be everyone's cup of tea (my boyfriend is still not letting me live that recommendation down...). But, if you enjoy beautiful worlds, poetic and enigmatic storytelling, and engaging exploration, and you aren't afraid to try something scary and new - maybe this is something you should really, really give a go.

Not only it respects it's audience, It's also an improvement over it's predecessor in every single way and stands alongside 3 as the best game in the series. 

Not enough people praising how a game that looks this good is running this well as well. I don't think I've seen many games look as stylish and as beautiful as this game does. The movements and combos are meaty, the sounds are punchy and give feedback, a real technical marvel.

I only wished there were more unlockables like the old school entries, it would feel much better unlocking the characters as you finish stuff as it also would give you an incentive to play more on the down times and to give more meaning to complete other modes. The online functionality is working perfectly, had absolutely no problems playing against strangers and friends alike, except for getting my butt kicked, but that's a granted.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"This is another Far Cry game. Just like the others. Minor things have changed but overall I'm having fun. Like ALL other Ubisoft titles, DO NOT BUY unless this is on sale. Ubisoft very quickly talked crap about Steam but as soon as their company is in trouble they come crawling back to the STABLE business that seems to do things above board instead of very publicly abusing their employees and forcing unnecessary DRM down our throats while re-releasing the same franchise almost yearly like an EA title. Ubisoft is disgusting.

I got this game for $15. That is the only price I would recommend this game at.

UPDATE: The story is WEAK. Red clouds all over the artwork is the poison they use slave labor to spray crops of tobacco (cancer cure). Sounds familiar... exactly how in FC 5 they sprayed BLISS all over crops while poisoning their slaves. More of the same crap. In the beginning, your character picks up their Machete off the corpse of Jason Brody, protagonist from Far Cry 3. It would be REALLY cool if there was some Bethesda-type back story to that but this is Ubisoft. Everything is superficial and face value. I'm having fun but don't get me wrong, this is just Ubisoft reskinning the last Far Cry game and selling it for full price ON TOP OF MICROTRANSACTIONS (not just cosmetics) for single-player games. 

Far Cry 7 will be ON THE CHAIN and you'll be able to earn your NFT ""Digits"" as you play and can probably bring that fancy gun NFT of yours from Farcry into a dozen different Assassin's Creed spin-offs!

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"In 2020 they launched CP77, the most anticipated/hyped game in the last 8 years.
Main Issues Sky-high rate of bugs, weird AI and graphics, optimization issues, more people enjoying on PC than on consoles.
cant deny its all true but everyone still wants to play this game.
The CDPR always have a promise for you, that can be a lie or an illusion but its there, just around the corner and its it keeps you going in this game.
its a game of cyberpunk genre dreams, and im a big dreamer.
(^^ above lines are taken and re-worded from 2018 E3 trailer)

Welcome to Night City where the city is full of bugs, items and trash to collect, T-pose players and NPCs, dildos and other sex toys to reflect the horniness of the gamers.

TLDR: Its a great game, yes with issues but enjoyable, if you havent bought it wait for 2 big patches promised by CDPR Team or when its on sale.

Back to being serious and reviewing the game, spoiler free:

+ Night City, its awesome, beautiful, have good amount of dark and grim stuff as per the cyberpunk genre.
+ Soundtracks/OST are awesome, be the Radio stations or the Music in background.
+ Main Story is great, with multiple endings.
+ both V (male and female) voice artists done a top-notch Job.
+ Keanu Revees as Johnny Silverhand is Breathtaking, he is the megalomaniac, will make you hate him as well love him(if you play some cards right).
+ NPCs are great with story, Jackie <3, Takemura, Evelyn, Claire, Judy, Panam, Rogue, Meredith, Misty, Viktor, Kerry, River - their side quests and interactions with them are fun and give more depth to their characters and backstory.
+ Vehicles look awesome, driving might be bit funny.
+ Cyberware is awesome and mantis blades with double jump are my fav.
+ Choice to play without a single bullet fired, either by sneaking or hacking your way through is commendable.
+ Cyberpsychos hunting and other side side quests are great, will keep you interested in game.
+ the weapons choices are vast, can up the fun with perks.
+ cool references and easter eggs in missions, side missions and certain items.

- Buggy, but hilarious ones too 
- AI is dumb many times
- Driving is shit, especially for AI and the races missions, rest love the bikes.
- optimization issues, my PC handled it on medium with around 30-45 fps.
- crafting system is bit odd, i have 5 johnny jackets now.
- no character customization after the initial build.
- Police/wanted system is weird, police will spawn behind you untill you die.
- certain dialogs or hud bars will remain stuck in the screen no matter if you load the game again or you start a mission.
- There is no headshot kills, but once you upgrade the guns or get better ones you can kill certain enemies with 1 hit headshot.
- interactions with romance options after that crucial missions and sex scene, is very less interactive and boring after sometime.

I admit they should have delayed the game more to finish it, but you snowflake gamers needed it badly and worse sending death threats to the development team they already crunching enough specially in the pandemic time, thanks to the CDPR bad management and investors. However, they have promised patches and providing regular hotfixes.  

No game or software is without bugs and issues, saying as a fellow soft. dev.
And please stop comparing it to GTA, this is a action RPG with guns and vehicles, first play skyrim, fallout or deus ex series. 
Mods are already out for extra fun or better game tweaks.

PS - your experience may vary please don't attack or send death threats to me, i knew this game would have not met the hype and kinda expected it to be a normal good game not a masterpiece like RDR2 or others.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Been playing ESO for nearly 2 years now nonstop. And here's what I have to say about it. To clear up any confuson, NO this isn't skyrim the MMORPG, that's what many assume about this game then leave dissapointed because of it. It's an MMORPG that takes place in the past, thousands of years before any of the maingame Elder Scrolls Games began. 

The Main quest is simple, you're the vestige a soulless person out to fight against Molag Bal, the daedric prince of rape and corruption to get your soul back. you meet some interesting characters who will aid you in that quest.  But like all TES games, the strength isn't in the campaign or the main storyline, but with the freedom it gives to the player. Now with One Tamriel out you're free to visit any available location on Tamriel given that you discovered the wayshrines for fast travel. if not you're free to explore and literally walk throughout the land. Enemy npcs are scaled to your level so you won't have to worry about stumbling upon Overpowered enemies...that is unless you're in craglorn or cyrodil which is designed for more skilled players. 

The crafting is amazing, from the begining you'll be able to teach yourself the basic skills in tailoring, smithing, provisioning, woodworking, enchanting, and alchemy. as for how skilled you get in one or all of those crafting skills, is entirely up to you and how much time you dedicate to it. but the payoff is worth it when you're in a higher level or in a guild. Need to craft an epic level hallowjack or stalhrim armor that makes you regenerate stamina for your super OP PVE Nightblade build? you can do it given the time researching traits, style motifs, and getting the necessary materials all available to you. Need to craft an xp boost because you don't want to spend 100 crowns for an xp scroll? get a psijic ambriosa recipe, max out your provisioning skill, and get the needed ingredients. the list goes one from there.

you'll also have in game guilds to join such as the fighters or mages guild. Each with their own unique storyline and rewards, to progress through the ranks you either hunt certain enemies or go out and search for lorebooks. 

you're also able to fully customize your character and dye armor and shields given that you unlocked some dyes by unlocking the required achievements. which will keep you playing the game many times on multiple characters to get. 

The game also has one of my favorite things, a roleplaying community which is something I never got to experience in the single player Elder Scrolls Games. you can have your character interact with other player's characters, go into political debates of Cyrodil, or go grave robbing, mercenary missions, mage school lessons, missionary work, give sermons, fight against other players, the list goes on.

Lastly to top it all off ESO is now introducing the playerhouse feature which can be earned through in game gold or crowns, meaning everyone can get it if you have the money IRL or not to own it. which i'm sure will add for even more hours into the game for those who have been playing it for a while now. 

The strength of the game is from the player's freedom of choice to do whatever they want in this open world MMORPG based on the already crazy and amazing Elder Scrolls Universe, and the amazing community and support surrounding this game. So grab a copy, make your character, and go out into this very unique fantasy world.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",eso nearly 2 year nonstop clear confuson no_this skyrim massively multiplayer role assume leave dissapointed it_emphasized massively multiplayer role take past thousand year maingame scroll game began task objective given non simple vestige soulless fight molag bal daedric prince rape corruption soul meet interesting character aid task objective given non te game strength series connected mission level form storyline storyline freedom give tamriel visit available location tamriel given discovered wayshrines fast travel not_you explore literally walk throughout land enemy npc scaled worry stumbling overpowered enemy unless craglorn cyrodil designed skilled player crafting amazing begining able teach basic skill tailoring smithing provisioning woodworking enchanting alchemy skilled crafting skill entirely dedicate payoff worth higher guild craft epic hallowjack stalhrim armor make regenerate stamen super op versus environment nightblade build given researching trait style motif necessary material available craft xp boost spend 100 crown xp scroll psijic ambriosa recipe max provisioning skill needed ingredient go guild join fighter mages guild unique storyline reward progress rank hunt certain enemy search lorebooks able customize dye armor shield given unlocked dye unlocking required achievement time multiple character favorite thing roleplaying community never_got single scroll game interact character political debate cyrodil grave robbing mercenary mission mage school lesson missionary sermon fight player go lastly to_emphasizedp eso introducing playerhouse earned gold crown meaning irl not_to add hour strength freedom choice whatever open world massively multiplayer role based already crazy amazing scroll universe amazing community support surrounding grab copy unique fantasy world
1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"As much as I want to like the game, and I was very generous by waiting until season 2 was released, there are still some glaring flaws this game has, unfortunately, and it still has not been fixed properly:

-Game Crashing bugs, not just for me, but for friends I played with, random crashes sometimes at that.
(there was an instance where I could not launch the game at all. Turns out, it was because I overclocked by GPU and it would NOT run until I either:
A) set the timings and clock speeds back to stock or 
B) underclock/undervolt my GPU that was already trying to run this game at 1440p for more than 144 fps. No, I do not need more than that usually, especially for another problem I'll bring up, but, its one of those things I would like to utilized based on what I paid for, both the GPU and the game (I bought the actual title, this review is just for Warzone 2.0))

-Lighting Bugs
(fixed for now, had an issue where the lighting would either be too bright to look at certain objects, to having an unwanted psychedelic effect, or will darken the environment in a certain area with limited lighting to the point of going pitch black when going inside of a building)
-Random Shooting Range bug where you cannot ADS correctly. It will appear a giant bullet will go into the optic.
-Blueprint being saved bug (this is known, but hopefully it will be fixed soon, whereas some blueprints were wiped from player's profiles that were saved)

And now some core gameplay mechanic issues (unfortunately it is a lot):

-Matchmaking experience can be harsh and/or unfair. Can engage in a gunfight, two players have the same gun, player A initiates the gun fight inputting the same amount of bullets, if not more, than player B, who is able to win said gunfight. Majority of the time, feels as though Player A has been either shadowbanned or ricochet'd when that player has a positive score the previous game(s). This is more apparent when both players have the same amount of armor on, and hit around the same parts of the body, somehow player B will come out on top despite them taking in 3 bullets already.

-Footstep sounds not playing when someone is moving behind me (moving including walking, running, and/or tactile sprinting. It is amazing how loud footsteps can be for the enemy to hear me or my teammates, but not so loud when they run. This also includes when another player parachutes before landing.)

-Launchers not performing consistent damage/blast radius. This is infuriating when someone is able to survive an RPG blast to the face. One launcher that seems to be consistent is the JOKR, however, the major and obvious drawback is that you'll need to spend 10 second for it to lock onto an area or vehicle, launch and hit the target.

-Weapon balancing has gotten worse. Before, the two meta guns in Season One dominated, which were the RPK and the Fennec 45/Vector. The RPK is an LMG that, for some reason, can outgun a Sniper Rifle, weapons that excel in long range engagement, in a game mode that can have you dealing with long range gunfights, maybe 35% of the time. And while the RPK is not as strong as it was in season one, it still is being used and abused with its TTK.
The Vector/Fennec, on the other hand, has received 'a' nerf, but not as much as it deserves. It shoots way faster than the tick rate of their servers could even fathom to support, but that will not stop players who will hose an unfortunate victim in a second. Like, the TTK as others mentioned, it is very short. Basically zero. There's a video out there that analyzed how fast the Fennec could kill someone, within a third of a second. It was ridiculously fast, and it honest is still as fast compared to other guns.
The game is not fun when you are using or fighting someone using two guns out of 59 weapons in the game more than half the time. It dulls the experience, leaving it up to RNG if all of your shots hit based on what the server thinks. There are 57 other weapons in the game I would like to use without me being shunned by the games weapon balance logic. They barely touched those two guns but either buffed some other guns slightly or nerfed significantly. I tend to use marksman rifles a lot, if not 'some' fast shooting guns. 

I tried the M13B, it is no where near the M13 in Modern Warfare 2019. While it can shoot fast, it feels too weak and not as accurate or can have much recoil control as the M13 could have in MW2019.

The LM-S, which seems to be the FAL in this game, is not as good as it was season one. It may have been the minimal damage added to armor, but it does not feel as strong as it did in season one. I cannot speak for the other two semi-auto marksman rifles since they added minimum damage against armor, but am not sure if that exists for the SP-R or SA-B. From what I know and can imagein, I don't believe both of those have minimum damage against armor.

They buffed the Lachmann 762 in terms of semi-auto, but nerfed it for full auto engagement. In close range engagements this has taken a hit in terms of damage, and frankly I feel as though it was an unnecessary change, along with the LM-S. 
The balancing has gotten so bad, that I had a moment of acceptance whenever I would get turned into Swiss cheese by a vector. Like, how could I be mad about a gun that just shoots more faster than the game would allow?

-Server reliability/performance is not as good as it could be. I believe I saw somewhere the servers were 20 tick, in a game where there's up to 150 players fighting in different parts of the map, let alone if they were using a gun that was not the Fennec. That does not bode well if I have high hopes I hid behind cover as someone shot me three times, at least on my screen it looks like in the recordings, and I get downed and need to be revived because someone curved a bullet around a concrete wall.

-Inconsistent Map Geometry hindering movement. Some areas of the map will have a strange or incomplete collision detection whereas my teammate may get stuck in a window and cannot move at all, or on the resurgence island a pond in the village area will not allow someone to start walking back on surface, despite the physical geometry portraying that one can stand up on land again.

-Random TimeOuts/Losing Server Connection. As I mentioned before, the server does not relay consistent connection, which, I may understand that it can happen to anyone at any time, but for some strange reason I see a pattern where it happens when I start having fun going positive with kills. And then the game decides to kick me, or lose my connection

-Sniping is not apparent in this game. As I mentioned above, an LMG can outgun a sniper. The only way to make snipers viable is to follow it up immediately with another weapon, notably by a teammate since switching to a gun that can shoot that far if you are sniping long range, could take longer than you have to survive taking 3-4 RPK bullets. I started using the Signal50 by the end of season one, it seemed fun to use, but of course the moment it starts to be recognized, it receives a nerf. The movement speed and sprint speed has been reduced, which like another sniper change in another FPS, but they also reduced its range. For a Sniper Rifle.

-The Last but certain not least, one more issue that doesn't seem like anyone is really trying to prevent or remove from the game, are the cheaters. This game is the easiest platform for cheaters to run rampant and there is little, to absolutely zero punishment or action done against the actual cheaters of the game. None at all that I've seen or for those I play this game with. For every match that I played with friends, at least one of us will run into a cheater, and then following suit, another one of us will, may or may not run into the same cheater. Why are we put in lobbies with cheaters? Is it because we've gotten 10 kills in one match, therefore we must be cheating?

686810,Hell Let Loose,"First off I want to say that I have never reviewed a game before in my life but this game has changed that. Nearly 2 hours in I was thinking I’d probably refund the game. I didn’t really understand the mechanics, couldn’t see anyone to kill and often got killed out of nowhere after wandering around the map for a long long time trying to find some action. Then I got talking in game to a few players and got caught up in their enthusiasm and missed the refund window so persevered. 

And I’m so glad I did. It’s complex, unforgiving, brutal, beautiful and requires teamwork and communication to get the best from it, but when it all falls into place it’s an experience like no other I’ve had playing and FPS. It’s immense, immersive, deep, tactical, terrifying and hilarious by turns. You can’t play this like Battlefield or CoD and it rarely rewards lone wolf activity behind enemy lines but when you’re in a good squad with a decent command plan it’s amazing fun and so rewarding when your efforts pay off with a point capture or even better a game win. 

I’ve found the community to be very friendly and helpful and always got good feedback when asking about a tactic or game mechanic. I’ve added to my Steam friends list with some of the team mates I’ve played with which is a first for me. And I often find myself on servers and in squads with familiar players.

 It’s early access so there are some issues but I haven’t found any of them particularly frustrating and the devs seem very approachable, active in the various places you’d hope and willing to listen and alter roadmap priorities as a result of player feedback. There’s a public roadmap and patches already out and in mid July a big update coming with a new map amongst other added features and fixes. 

I’d say this is well worth your money if you’re into something deeper and tactical with a great community and dev team. It’s frankly the WWII shooter I’ve always dreamt of playing and I can’t wait to see how it develops.","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",never_reviewed life changed nearly 2 hour probably refund understand mechanic kill killed nowhere wandering long_emphasized trying action talking player caught enthusiasm missed refund window persevered glad complex unforgiving brutal beautiful requires teamwork communication best fall no_other shooter immense immersive deep tactical terrifying hilarious turn play battlefield cod rarely reward lone wolf activity enemy line good squad decent command plan amazing fun rewarding effort pay capture win found community friendly helpful good feedback asking tactic mechanic friend mate server squad familiar player player purchase play official release issue found frustrating approachable active place hope willing listen alter roadmap priority result feedback public roadmap patch already mid july big amongst feature fix worth deeper tactical great community frankly wwii shooter dreamt wait develops

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"by far the best game in the sims franchise in terms of visuals, however, base gameplay is severely lacking. the sims 4 feels like a step down to it's predecessors and is absolutely a cashgrab. $900 for all the dlc? screw you ea. you can also tell that the targetted demographic has shifted by comparing the sims 2 and sims 4 trailers (worth your while, i recommend you do it). 

definitely play sims 3 if you are looking for gameplay, you won't find as much content in this game compared to the sims 3. the sims 4 is definitely more of a building game, whether it be designing houses or building sims. the gameplay is lacking in this game and a lot of features that were in sims 2 and 3 are missing from this game unfortunately. it seems the main focus in this game was simply visuals,

you can only play the base game for so long before getting bored and modding the hell out of it. dlcs are not worth it in my opinion. $40 for cats and dogs? fuck you ea.  i hope that this is not the beginning of the sim franchise's downfall as the sims was a massive part of my childhood and i'd hate to see 22 years of this franchise go down the drain thanks to the hands of ea.

overall, i do and don't recommend this game. the sims to me has been a big part of my childhood but unfortunately i will not continue to follow the franchise if it continues in the directive that ea has taken it now. it's definitely lacking and it seems the devs are busy milking as much money out of it as they can opposed to making a new addition to the franchise. there are still many bugs and many features that cost money that should be a part of this game for free, such as seasons or holidays. don't buy this game or dlc full price, it's absolutely not worth it.","Very Positive87% of the 127,522 user reviews for this game are positive.",far best sims franchise term visuals base severely lacking sims feel predecessor cashgrab 900 downloadable additional released initial launch screw ea targetted demographic shifted comparing sims 2 sims trailer worth recommend definitely play sims 3 compared sims 3 sims definitely building designing house building sims lacking feature sims 2 3 missing unfortunately focus simply visuals play base long bored modding hell dlcs not_worth 40 cat dog fuck ea hope not_the beginning sim franchise downfall sims massive childhood hate 22 year franchise drain thanks hand ea recommend sims big childhood unfortunately not_continue follow franchise continues directive ea taken definitely lacking busy milking opposed addition franchise bug feature cost season holiday downloadable additional released initial launch price not_worth

Additionally quick join just doesn't work. These are very likely to be fixed in the near future, but if you won't purchase a game that launches broken on principle, I respect that and want to enable you to  make an informed decision.

Now for the review proper:

This is by far some of the snappiest, most satisfying gun-play I have ever experienced. Damage makes sense and information, such as hitting an armored body part, is clearly shown and easy to parse. Quite frankly the mechanics and game play loop are the ONLY reason I feel this game deserves a positive review and its only bound to get better when I start playing with friends. Missions are hard, side objectives are compelling, and at least as of early game, feel very worth pursuing. 

Progression is relatively low quality, though, and is innately linked to a battle pass system. On top of that, the way the battle pass is designed makes it so you can pay for more progression options, thus opening the door to paying for power. Right now it doesn't seem to be directly giving power just an alternate path to the same perks on gear, but the potential is there and so very likely. 

Be suspicious, be cagey, these are some shady practices.... But seriously this is some top notch game-play and far and away my favorite shooter mechanically.","Mostly Positive75% of the 62,617 user reviews for this game are positive.",psa moment bug unplayable user not_one one affected quick join fixed near future purchase launch broken principle respect enable informed decision proper far snappiest satisfying gun play experienced damage make sense information hitting armored body clearly shown easy parse frankly mechanic play loop deserves positive bound friend mission hard side objective compelling early worth pursuing progression relatively low quality innately linked battle pas top battle pas designed make pay progression option opening door paying power directly giving power alternate path perk gear potential suspicious cagey shady practice seriously top notch play far favorite shooter mechanically

This game is soo much fun but if you live in asia and you dont speak chinese or japanese, you will get kicked or banned.

Racism is abundant in the chinese servers. Don't speak english unless you want to be called white dog. The server rule is written that no white trash english speakers allowed which I respect to follow. But I cannot play in other servers that will lag me to oblivion

1144200,Ready or Not,"[b]Early Access Period[/b]

I'm mind blown by how this was originally the alpha version of the game and later made the decision to release it as a Beta, It plays and is more optimized than most Triple A games that released in the past year. 

now let me get to the goodies [b]let's start with the beautiful visuals, the atmosphere, the lighting is beautiful the mix of neon lights and natural lighting is absolutely stunning, sound design is insanely immersive, the coop experience is absolutely outstanding especially playing tactically as a squad of 5. even with the lack of content the replayability appears to be infinite and this is just Early Access.[/b]

About bugs I actually haven't encountered any game breaking bugs yet in my 8h of playtime, although I do have some complaints both the AI and Matchmaking could use some work especially the AI. they just seem way to reactive and their movement feels off .they'd just sonic away and tap you, but these things are expected from an Early Access and will obviously get adjusted but still very impressive 

I can go on and on and brag about how perfect this game is, but seriously the developers achieved something spectacular here and if they remain true to the original concept this game could easily become one of the greatest games of all time and maybe even the next hit.

[b]1.0 Launch[/b]

Another successful early access game while 1 could argue it's gotten worse I feel like this was always the developers vision to make a hard tactical SWAT game and at that they succeeded. truly one of a kind game and a true spiritual successor to SWAT 4 which is 17-years old to date. The 1.0 update overhauled a lot of mechanics and introduced a lot of new content like A LOT, from guns to maps, cosmetics and the introduction of the new awesome AI system for your SWAT mates. it appears as AI in games is a relic of the old ages so many developers nowadays don't try to innovate on AI but VOID went all in into making one of best responsive and intelligent AI systems, they are active, reactive, responsive almost as if they were real players. while it still needs some tweaking when it works it really works.

Except that when the ride finally starts - someone shoots you in the face, steals all of your stuff, and tells you how much you suck at riding roller coasters. 

98% of your time is spent walking across the map, punctuated by occasionally getting shot at and using cool real world tactics. It's the serious adult's version of Fortnight without the ability to build forts. 

If you've got a decent graphics card, the game looks pretty great. The gameplay is heavily sound focused, but to a fault sometimes because your footsteps inside buildings can be heard by people queuing for the next round on a different server.

The game attempts to be as realistic as possible, while being sometimes hilarious. You can drive vehicles that are as loud as your footsteps in buildings, and there's a glider you can fly too which is pretty fun. Weapon drops are a fools errand and the cosmetics are... odd. 

Most of the serious players don't wear shoes and play as females - because I don't know why. Maybe bare feet make less noise, but bare feet isn't realistic so I have no idea what's up with that. 

There is a training mode which I highly recommend because one of the most important aspects of getting good at this game is the ability to switch  your loadout on the fly to adapt to whatever situation you're in. Encumbrance is kindof ignored, which is counter to the realism but that's neither here nor there so just look the other way.

It's a squad based game, but you can play solo as well. If you play in a squad as a noob, most people will be pretty nice to you, but are usually super serious. Communication is crucial in this game, so learn how to do proper call-outs and use the compass. Oh, and whatever you do, NEVER refer to customizing your weapons as ""crafting"". They very very much hate that. 

Also there's this thing called 'thirsting' which means that if you incapacitate someone you're expected to go after their teammates instead of just killing the person you incapacitated. Apparently this is a noob tactic and serious players will get mad at you for doing it. I just kill them anyway because I just spent 2.5 goddamn hours waiting for the roller coaster drop and you can eat my butt if you think I'm not going to shoot you in the goddamn face while you're down. 

Another bonus is that since the weapons are 'real world' you get to learn all the cool gun jargon. 

It will take you 100 hours to get the basics, then another 2000 hours to get decent. There are some great youtube tutorials to make that first 100 hours less traumatic.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"
  Heartwarming family friend game.
  A girl appeared from nowhere and helped me a lot, cool adventures together, that was lit.
  Met another girl in some ruins, we talked, met her pet wolf and did some errands for her.
  Met her mother who gave some lecture in her library.
  Met her brother which was super nice to invite me for his festival with some amazing fireworks, lots of cool people there.
  Met her other more fancy brother who invited me to join their family, nice hospitality with some snake bbq in his place.
  Asked her hand (btw many hands)... her father was a bit annoyed by it, something about rings or one specific, btw a lot of talking about THE right ring, had some disagreements, they got tired and then disappeared to get some rest.
  Married her.

 [b] 10/10 [/b] Would recommend
  
Obs: Her other relatives are a bit odd, serious woman saying it was the blade of her brother, looking for her brother ( pretty sure she is too overprotective ), her brother in the other hand... passed out (maybe hangover?) with some other guy singing ""Nihil Nihil Nihil"" in some weird bloody-messy mansion, the other ones were too old and too grumpy imo.","Very Positive92% of the 576,811 user reviews for this game are positive.",heartwarming family friend appeared nowhere helped cool adventure lit met ruin talked met pet wolf errand met mother gave lecture library met brother super nice invite festival amazing firework lot cool met fancy brother invited join family nice hospitality snake bbq asked hand btw hand father bit annoyed ring specific btw talking disagreement tired disappeared rest married 10_emphasized recommend ob relative bit odd serious woman saying blade brother brother pretty overprotective brother hand passed maybe hangover singing nihil_emphasized weird bloody messy mansion one old grumpy imo
2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Thoroughly enjoyed this game… I played all base content and DLCs to 99% in about 300 hours, which is close to the 450 hours I spent playing Elden Ring to completion with all but one ending.  Even without the DLCs this game is absolutely massive.  While repetition (puzzles, scenery, characters) does eventually creep in during the last 50 hours or so, the landscapes and locations are so beautiful and bountiful that going off script and simply exploring the map is as interesting and rewarding as following the quest-lines.  Due to the sheer volume of content, most interactions with non-essential NPCs are painfully bland, but they manage to keep things interesting with a healthy dose of humor and occasional absurdities.

World:
The open world scale and level of detail is on par with games like RDR2 and Elden Ring… with realism/fantasy lying somewhere between the two.  While the buildings and wilderness of AC Valhalla are surprisingly accurate for the time and place (~850-900AD), the game employs enough fantasy and mythology to make the environments and exploration a bit more interesting than the plain old Wild West.  And, while AC Valhalla does provide plenty of excursions to fantastical places that exist only in mythology or alternative history (some obviously inspired by Eldin Ring or God of War grandiose interpretations of 'common' places) Valhalla doesn’t quite reach the level of depth, diversity, and imagination that Eldin Ring or God of War gave to us.  Aside from enemy strongholds and other combat locations, there's plenty of 'filler' to explore from caves to castles.  With a few wonderfully creative exceptions, most of the enemies and bosses in AC Valhalla are simply modified, typically larger versions of, common animals and humans.  Still, while these boss encounters are less frequent and fantastical than similar games, they are always interesting and unique challenges to look forward to.  While there are no flying ponies or twister elevators in Valhalla, movement is surprisingly versatile and often as vertical as it is horizontal.  It’s as easy and as fun to travel along hilltops, treetops and rooftops, or the depths of caves and dungeons, as it is to travel by foot or mount. Despite scale, it's easy enough to travel between known locations and especially fun to explore and discover new locations without much wandering.

Combat:
Out of the box, Valhalla probably has fewer weapons and armor than either RDR2 and Eldin Ring, but a good deal of attention was paid to each from animations, attacks to appearances... and they are all are fun to use and combine.  Finding weapons and armor that both look good and feel good is a fun and fruitful endeavor that can be done early on.  While the combat isn’t as difficult to master as say Eldin Ring, there is a surprising amount of variety melee and ranged attacks with plenty of enchantments and abilities to spice things up.  I felt under-powered and struggled with every boss in Elden Ring except perhaps one or two, and it wasn’t until the very end of Eldin Ring I felt I had finally got 'gud' and mastered the strictly enforced combat mechanics.  While employing many of the same weapons and moves, Valhalla is a very different beast, at least on normal difficulty.  Valhalla is far more forgiving in combat, favoring a more ‘fluid’ combat experience, and in keeping it flowing.  A single combat encounter in Valhalla, aside from stealth assassinations, will involve a combination of tactics; from dodging, parrying and melee attacks to mid ranged bow and hatchet throwing.  And whether you approach an enemy encampment alone or with your clan, stealth mode or arrows a blazing, ultimate success is attainable almost equally regardless.  The player isn't punished or rewarded for choosing one play style over another.  I much preferred approaching large enemy encampments alone using stealth and strategy, rather than more aggressive approaches such as raiding them with my entire clan... which is probably more efficient.  The game may provide hints as to the most effective way to approach a situation, but generally any tactics can be used, alone or in combination, to equal efficiency or effectiveness.  Choosing the proper attack at the proper time becomes instinctual with enemy tells, and the combat is quite satisfying.  At some point however, nearing the ‘end game’ content, it becomes easier to overpower most enemies, including some bosses.

Content:
The end game and side quest content, even within the main base game itself, is as abundant as the main quests.  There are lots of sub quests and stories within stories which exists within their own quest lines adjacent to the main quest (conquering England).  There are numerous NPCs which offer side quests in the ‘real world’ and beyond, and plenty of additional enemies and bosses to continue challenging even max level players, well into the end-game.  The DLCs all provide interesting additions to story, locations, characters, weapons and armor and other inventory items, as well as some new abilities (some available only within the DLC locations).  While the first two DLCs (Siege of Paris and Wrath of the Druids) continue to expand on the main themes and core game-play of the main game, the newer ‘Dawn of Ragnarök’ is a bit larger, more detailed and divergent than the previous DLC;  Ragnarok more blatantly borrowing from more inventive inspirations like Eldin Ring and Elder Scrolls.  After completing 99% of the game, including the DLCs, there may easily be another 100 hours to reach 100% considering all the items yet to find and side quests still to follow.

Pros:
* One of the largest, most beautifully rendered, and detailed open world environments I’ve witnessed.  
* Combat mechanics are fun and fluid with a diverse range of play styles that can be easily mixed and matched.  
* Tons of content that strays into alternatives and absurdities often enough to keep things interesting.  
* Plenty of diversity in character appearance with plenty of weapons and armor, attacks and abilities to choose from.

Cons:
* The Ubisoft launcher is a piece of crap, no doubt about it, and unfortunately there's no avoiding it.  It disconnects regularly and can easily crash the game failing to save a screenshot to the cloud.  So while I wasn’t able to take any screenshots during my 300 hours for fear of crashing the game, the game by itself is solid and well optimized; no crashes or performance issues running the game itself on highest visual quality settings… problems only occurred where the Ubisoft launcher was concerned.  Unfortunately, this also means that none of the achievements are steam based and exist only in one’s Ubisoft account.  
* For a game of this size it would be unusual not to find some redundant filler... In particular, the NPC dialogue can be bland and boring at times, even providing story line options that are often vague and rarely have any affect on any outcomes present or future... For me, the pros made up for this con.
* I can also think of several improvements that could be made to the in-game menu systems, for example equipment and runes upgrades.","Mostly Positive71% of the 17,395 user reviews for this game are positive.",thoroughly enjoyed base dlcs 99 300 hour close 450 hour spent elden ring completion ending dlcs massive repetition puzzle scenery character eventually creep last 50 hour landscape location beautiful bountiful script simply exploring interesting rewarding following task objective given non line due sheer volume interaction non essential npc painfully bland manage thing interesting healthy dose humor occasional absurdity world open world scale detail par game rdr2 elden ring realism fantasy lying building wilderness ac accurate 850 900ad employ fantasy mythology environment exploration bit interesting plain old wild west ac provide plenty excursion fantastical place exist mythology alternative history obviously inspired eldin ring god war grandiose interpretation common place reach depth diversity imagination eldin ring god war gave aside enemy stronghold combat location plenty filler explore cave castle wonderfully creative exception enemy boss ac simply modified typically larger version common animal human bos encounter frequent fantastical similar game interesting unique challenge forward no_flying pony twister elevator movement versatile vertical horizontal easy fun travel along hilltop treetop rooftop depth cave dungeon travel foot mount despite scale easy travel known location especially fun explore discover location wandering combat box probably fewer weapon armor rdr2 eldin ring good deal attention paid animation attack appearance fun combine finding weapon armor good good fun fruitful endeavor early combat difficult master eldin ring surprising variety melee ranged attack plenty enchantment ability spice thing powered struggled bos elden ring except perhaps eldin ring finally gud mastered strictly enforced combat mechanic employing weapon move different beast normal difficulty far forgiving combat favoring fluid combat keeping flowing single combat encounter aside stealth assassination involve combination tactic dodging parrying melee attack mid ranged bow hatchet throwing approach enemy encampment alone clan stealth mode arrow blazing ultimate success attainable equally punished rewarded choosing play style preferred approaching large enemy encampment alone stealth strategy rather aggressive approach raiding clan probably efficient provide hint effective approach situation generally tactic alone combination equal efficiency effectiveness choosing proper attack proper instinctual enemy tell combat satisfying nearing easier overpower enemy including boss side task objective given non base abundant quest lot sub quest story story exists task objective given non line adjacent task objective given non conquering england numerous npc offer side quest real world plenty additional enemy boss continue challenging max player dlcs provide interesting addition location character weapon armor inventory item ability available downloadable additional released initial launch location dlcs siege paris wrath druid continue expand theme core play newer dawn ragnarök bit larger detailed divergent downloadable additional released initial launch ragnarok blatantly borrowing inventive inspiration eldin ring elder scroll completing 99 including dlcs easily 100 hour reach 100 considering item side quest follow pro largest beautifully rendered detailed open world environment witnessed combat mechanic fun fluid diverse range play style easily mixed matched ton stray alternative absurdity thing interesting plenty diversity appearance plenty weapon armor attack ability choose con launcher piece crap no_doubt unfortunately no_avoiding it_emphasized disconnect regularly easily crash failing save screenshot cloud able screenshots 300 hour fear crashing solid optimized no_crashes performance issue running highest visual quality setting problem occurred launcher concerned unfortunately mean achievement based exist size unusual not_to redundant filler particular non controlled artificial dialogue bland boring time providing line option vague rarely affect outcome present future pro con improvement menu system example equipment rune upgrade

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"This is my first ever review but the performance is so terrible I'm compelled to complain. I should have listened to the reviews and held off on buying the game but it was Summer Sale and I didn't want to pay $70. Even the $50 I paid wasn't worth this mess. What kind of game runs at 20fps with a rtx 4090? What computer were the devs using or do they think 20fps is good? 

Why does the game crash so much many months after release? I can't even run from one save point to the next without a crash. This game doesn't have autosave so if you crash in a cutscene or after a long scripted fight sequence, too bad you need to start again. Sucks even more for you if you can't even make it back to that boss fight or town because your game kept crashing along the way. This is completely unacceptable.

Just do yourself a favor and avoid this game until it's out of mixed reviews. It just isn't worth it at all.","Mixed66% of the 43,165 user reviews for this game are positive.",performance terrible compelled complain listened review held buying summer sale pay 70 50 paid worth mess kind run 20fps rtx 4090 computer 20fps good crash month release save next crash autosave crash cutscene long scripted fight sequence bad suck bos fight town crashing along completely unacceptable favor avoid mixed review worth

1203620,Enshrouded,"I’m playing alone, so this review will only pertain to solo play. As a class based RPG style survival-craft (you can even have tanks and healers) Enshrouded is probably at its best with a group. That being said, I am still enjoying myself and you might too…

Exploring the vast world is fun and fluid via your glider and grappling hook as you hunt for the various helpful NPCs to bring back to your base. Although I miss climbing and flying (PalWorld has spoiled me) you can talent into a double jump or blink. Speaking of, I love class based games with talent trees and feel it is a nice addition to have some actual RPG elements in this style of game. There are class complimentary armor sets and weapons to both craft and find along the way as well. Combat is a little clunky but it’s better than Valheims and I appreciate the dodge roll because enemies can be a real pain in the bum early on. 

Now let’s get to my favorite part of these games, the building! The nice thing here is there is terraforming as well as destructible environments, meaning you can dig down deep and even flatten the terrain. There is also voxel based building, so you can do a lot of detail block by block… which is both a perk and a curse for detail oriented builder perfectionists like me. 

To the devs, please let us turn off motion blur (perhaps I can in the ini file?) because even with a 4090 on max settings it looks like some greasy creeper either rubbed all over my glasses, or my screen. Also, I received this copy free for my podcast to review, but honestly, I would have picked it up anyway. It’s relaxing and I will play more.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"For $10 (relative to the rest of the games in this space), it's hard to justify this as a worthy contender.

Have you ever wanted to play more games in the Deep Rock Galactic Cinematic Universe (DRGCU)?  No?  Well, what if we just reused the voicelines, sound effects and sound track from that game and slapped a topdown view of it?  Are you interested then?

This game only really appeals if you're already a fan of Deep Rock.  I am, I've played hundreds of hours, it's great!  But this feels like a half-baked cash grab, admittedly only after a few hours.  Ignoring the difficulty being cranked way too high on launch, but it never feels like you're winning.  There's no moments of reprieve, and the weapons aren't satisfying.  So far, it's all bullets all the time.  Sometimes the bullets have electrical or cold effects to them, but they're bullets all the same.

Deep Rock Galactic Survivor doesn't hook you in with the promise that the content you haven't seen is fun, and keeps new characters and levels timewalled.  It's literally the same grind as in Deep Rock, except they were foolish enough to think grinding solo survivor games would be a pleasant experience.  You're never excited about the new gun you've unlocked or new character, and the zones just steadily get more annoying than interesting, so progression is simply a frustrating experience.

I played Deep Rock originally in one of the early access periods when it was a not great game, so I'm optimistic, but I truly just expect this game to continue to be a stinker and fade into obscurity in a few years.  There's nothing new here, and it's more expensive - go play another survivors game that's more fun and cheaper.","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",10 relative rest game space hard justify worthy contender wanted play game deep galactic cinematic universe drgcu no_well reused voicelines sound effect sound track slapped topdown view interested appeal already fan deep hundred hour great feel half baked cash grab admittedly hour ignoring difficulty cranked high launch never_feels winning no_moments reprieve weapon satisfying far bullet bullet electrical cold effect bullet deep galactic hook promise fun keep character level timewalled literally grind deep except foolish repeatedly performing action gain resource solo game pleasant never_excited gun unlocked zone steadily annoying interesting progression simply frustrating deep originally player purchase play official release period not_great optimistic truly expect continue stinker fade obscurity year expensive play survivor fun cheaper

440,Team Fortress 2,"In a land a long, long time ago, Team Fortress 2 would be a critically acclaimed first person shooter. Boasting its colorful characters against the dreary palette of the Badlands, this game offered to many a wonderful experience. Later updates would add cosmetics, weapons, and a ton of other things to sink your teeth into. Some of those updates are not as well viewed by the community as others, like the addition of crazier and crazier hats. In recent years, the community has felt somewhat negatively towards the team of developers and their updates for this game. Though, there is something important to remember...

We first saw those deranged mercenaries nearly a decade ago! This game has been alive and kicking for a long time, and I doubt that you will soon see a day where these mercs aren't defying laws of physics, common sense, and sometimes all laws in general. You won't find many other games with a soviet in love with a 300 pound minigun that he just lugs around like it's nothing. Nor will you find a quick-witted, caffeine-fueled Bostonian who dances around the battlefield, dodging rockets and bullets like a madman. This game is very outlandish, and incredibly enjoyable. Even after years and years of pushing a payload down a track to blow up the enemies... people want to come back, because although there's some basis and objectives for the game modes, you never play the same game twice. Every match is a total surprise. Even competitively, the 9 classes and variety in what you can play with, it will give you a new experience nearly every time you play.

Years of pushing a cart filled to the brim with explosives is a hard task. Thankfully, there are new faces, hats to wear, weapons to try, and a new experience to be had every single day.","Very Positive93% of the 1,029,546 user reviews for this game are positive.",land long_emphasized ago critically acclaimed shooter boasting colorful character dreary palette badlands offered wonderful update add cosmetic weapon ton thing sink teeth update not_as viewed community others addition crazier crazier hat recent year community somewhat negatively towards developer update important remember saw deranged mercenary nearly decade ago alive kicking long doubt soon mercs defying law physic common sense law general game soviet love 300 pound minigun lug nor_will quick witted caffeine fueled bostonian dance battlefield dodging rocket bullet madman outlandish incredibly enjoyable year year pushing payload track blow enemy s_emphasizedome basis objective mode never_play twice total surprise competitively 9 class variety play nearly play year pushing cart filled brim explosive hard task thankfully face hat wear weapon single

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"A fun game, with unskippable intros. Well worth the launch price I'd say, more than that I'm not sure.

Here is what I know from some limited play today and previous experience in the demo.

As an overall look, this game doesn't play like most other action-roguelite autobattler games, it doesn't seem to perform the usual twist or synergy weapon dynamics that most of this genre use to let the player go from struggle of ""barely holding them off"" to the fast and frantic ""armies die under my crazy magic fireball goose boots mwahaha!"".

This game is pretty much all uphill struggle. Sometimes you level up fast enough to feel like you're getting powerful, but it never lasts long.

BASICS:
You move with the WASD and/or arrow keys. Attacking is automatic when enemies are in range/line of sight. Digging is automatic as you press against rocks or resources, though I have noticed that sometimes it will stop if you don't keep pressing yourself into the thing that you are mining.

You spawn with a side objective such as ""mine morkite"", which is optional but rewards decently for completion, you should find resources and start mining everything available that you can until the boss spawns. Small minion-type bugs spawn frequently and wander toward you, your dwarf automatically attacks them, they die and drop XP orbs. Kill enough bugs to fill the bar on screen and the boss bug will spawn and come after you.

Bug spawn rate increases over time and you get more types appearing as well, especially as you hit the swarm timer milestones. If you take too long to kill the boss (a bit too busy mining are we?) all bugs get stronger, over and over again until you squish the big bad. Once the bossbug goes squish you get 30 seconds to escape to the drop pod amidst the remaining swarm, or it'll leave without you.

Once you reach the last level of the run there is a big boss to kill

PER-RUN PROGRESSION:
Collecting XP makes your per-run level go up, each level up gives you a choice of random upgrades and every so often you get to add another weapon to your arsenal. All weapons fire at the same time, each at their own pace and with independent aim and reload timings.

Some of the upgrades make your weapon(s) increase in level, and every so-many weapon levels you get to choose 1 of 2 random overclocks to add (if you have unlocked them for that weapon). Sadly sometimes these limited choices force you to change your weapon in a way you didn't want, but even an undesired choice brings its own benefits.

There are announced supply drop-pods which will provide unique per-run boosts such as gaining XP every time you take damage, and otherwise-unattainable benefits. These show up as a circular ping on the map if you are near the drop point. Upon reaching them you will need to A) clear all rocks and other fixed obstacles in the circle shown, and B) stay in the circle until the icon fills, which takes a few seconds. The drop pod will crush and push back nearby enemies, then just touch it to claim your free thingy.

Between levels you are afforded a chance to buy from a larger selection of upgrades using your gold and nitra (the red gold), as well as refill your health if you really need it. You can buy as many of these as you can afford and don't be afraid to reroll the remaining options if you have plenty of gold left.

META PROGRESSION (between runs):
As your class' meta/persistent level increases you gain access to more varied resources appearing in each run, and more weapons are unlocked to choose from when increasing your arsenal.

Meta progression is performed via the UPGRADE menu where you can improve different global stats such as overall reload speed, mining speed, critical hit chance and so on. These upgrades cost both credits and some of the unique resources you will find on your run, though you can also buy/sell resources within the upgrade menu if you have an abundance of one thing and not enough of another. The benefits provided from this menu are both diminishing and extremely expensive toward the top end. Definitely a feature in need of rebalance.

OTHER STUFF (notes):
The timer (it's a kill-counter) feels very tight at the start play, though no doubt that limit will become much easier to work with as meta progression is achieved.

Unfortunately at the start of a run it is rather easy to fall into a cycle where you are unable to damage the boss because there are too many minions in the way, and because you don't kill him fast enough all the aliens get stronger over and over, leading to more minions which just get harder and harder to kill. Don't hold off on killing the boss too long.

While supply pods are incredibly useful they can be positioned in really precarious places that get you killed, such as surrounded by A LOT of rock which you will probably die clearing if your guns can't hold back the swarm yet.

Take note that if you don't like the choices presented, most choice options in the game can be re-rolled (usually at the cost of a little gold) before you pick one.

Gold seems to be the king resource per-run as it is used for more things than Nitra.

Some of the best upgrades to focus on seem to be reload time (until you have a frequent stream of attacks going) and anything that will improve multiple weapons at once (sometimes you will miss the benefits of these if one or more of your weapons were forced into an elemental overclock, diverging your damage types). But don't overlook basic things like armour, move speed and dig speed too, especially if a rather large bonus pops up. It's not all about the guns....well okay its mostly about the guns.

Lastly, if you don't rock and stone....

381210,Dead by Daylight,"This is simultaneously the most fun, and most infuriating game I've played in a long time.

It's an asymmetrical game where one player is a powerful killer, hunting down 4 elusive survivors before they can start generators and leave the trial.

For an asymmetrical game, it's in a state where it's surprisingly balanced between the two sides. Either side has a few things that infuriate the other and certain killers are notoriously overpowered, or underpowered. Freddy Kreuger mains, for instance, must hate themselves to play that, and Nurse mains must just hate playing the game fairly.

New content is regular, 1 killer, 1 survivor, 3 perks for each side, and a map are released every 3 months or so, mid chapter balance patches occur, and cosmetics are regularly added. Recent content additions have, however, cut back on content. A new map hasn't been added with the last 2 additions, each of which only contained 1 character. They have also dropped the term ""paragraph"" which used to refer to 1 character being added and now refer to all DLC as ""chapters,"" meaning their roadmap now suddenly promises a lot less future content. They are also reworking an old tileset to have ""5 different configurations"" changing the layout but using the same buildings, meaning much less variation than original tilesets that have 5 completely unique maps built on them. 

Recent killer additions have been mediocre at best. The Legion (Dec 2018) was released and completely changed the chase dynamics for the killer, which was blatantly broken and had very little counterplay. They were soon nerfed into a state where they barely feel like they have a power any more. Since then, the Plague (Mar 2019) and the Ghost Face (June 2019) have powers that are overwhelmingly controlled by the survivor players more than the killer, making them incredibly frustrating and unrewarding to play. Due to their mistakes with Legion they seem scared to release killers that actually feel decent in the meta. Only one ""strong"" killer has been added in the last 2 years.

There are downsides however. While balance patches come regularly, they won't do anything incremental. Freddy is ridiculously weak, but they refuse to give him small quality of life changes that they have said he needs until they are ready to release a full rework of him. Meaning rather than sitting at a 'meh' stage, he sits in boring, weak and generally unfun. His upcoming rework has finally been announced in (some) detail, which, going off the most recent version we've heard, leaves a lot to be desired.

Pay to pay to keep paying. Buying the game will net you around one third of the cast. Many are also available through grinding, however licensed killers and survivors require further payment. Their perks are also locked to you, unless they are picked on the ""random"" weekly shrine. (The good ones rarely are.) On top of this, despite in game currency being used for cosmetics, anything they think looks good or will be popular is locked behind payment only. It's a dick move when you may have already spent upwards of $80 just to unlock characters.

Awesome, and incredibly angry, community, as you'd expect from a game like this.

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"[h1] Rockstar's Magnum Opus [/h1]

This game is a masterpiece. Although I used to ignore it because most people said it was slow-paced and lacked gunplay, I was wrong to do so. The game is indeed slow-paced but beautifully crafted. It starts slow with character introductions and basic mechanics, but the pace picks up after a few hours of gameplay. The environment, characters’ personalities and voices, and quests are all spot-on and perfectly implemented in the game. Even the horses are loyal companions that build an innocent and special bond with Arthur, despite him being a bad person in the story. The way they respond to our whistle and get frightened when seeing a predator, and Arthur calming them down are small things that impact the player.

The story is one of the best in the gaming industry. The wild west setting has never been done more perfectly than in RDR2 by Rockstar. It’s crafted so that every human emotion is expressed at least once throughout the whole game. The story depicts a group of bandits going through pain, sadness, pleasure, fear, and anger while telling a lot about loyalty and betrayal. As the quote says, [i]“Each Betrayal begins with trust” [/i]. This is shown in a captivating way that I won’t spoil here. Overall, this game will stay close to my heart for a very long time, and I recommend trying it without any bias.","Very Positive91% of the 493,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",rockstar magnum opus masterpiece ignore slow paced lacked gunplay wrong indeed slow paced beautifully crafted start slow introduction basic mechanic pace pick hour environment character personality voice quest spot perfectly implemented horse loyal companion build innocent special bond arthur despite bad respond whistle frightened seeing predator arthur calming small thing impact best gaming industry wild west setting never_been perfectly rdr2 rockstar crafted human emotion expressed throughout depicts group bandit pain sadness pleasure fear anger telling loyalty betrayal quote say betrayal begin trust shown captivating spoil stay close heart long recommend trying bias

Every duel is 3 turns or less, and involves your opponent summoning half the monsters in their deck and extra deck in one turn (which takes several minutes). Then, if you cant also summon 5 monsters to your side of the field with 3000+ ATK and effect text the length of an essay: CONGRATULATIONS! You lose. Also half the people in ranked are bots who do nothing. So half the duels you have to sit and wait for the bot to run out of time for their turn.

Just don't expect any deck you build to win a single game unless you copy a deck from the internet.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"OK, for context: I'm old, low-skill, and cheap.  I play on budget hardware, which means (apart from indies) I play mostly older games acquired on steep discount.

I think I got AC IV dirt cheap some years ago and finally got around to giving it a whirl.  My expectations were low.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  As mentioned, I'm old, and one of my all-time favourites was 'Pirates!'  Yes, I played it so long ago that Sid Meier wasn't yet famous enough for his name to make its way into the game's title.  If the Ubisoft team didn't look back at the old classic for inspiration, it sure feels like it.

Like Pirates! all of the different aspects of the pirate life feel almost like different minigames: sea battles, attacking forts, swordplay, treasure hunting... there is even the treasure fleet to find.  Where the game really shines is in the naval combat.  It's a blast.  It would be nice if you could sail different ships (I loved my trusty sloop in Pirates!), but the different ship's weapons you have at your disposal - long-range mortars, explosive barrels as mines, a ram, and regular broadside cannons - allow for different styles of play.

The parkour-ey stuff is meh... Other reviewers seem keen on the story, but it comes across as a bunch of mystical Dan Brown dreck to me.  Maybe it means more in the bigger AC universe, whatever, it's easily ignored.

So anyway if you're reading this and on the fence about buying this title - do it!  It is fun.","Very Positive88% of the 55,599 user reviews for this game are positive.",ok context old low skill cheap play budget hardware mean apart indie play mostly older game acquired steep discount ac dirt cheap year ago finally giving whirl expectation low pleasantly surprised mentioned old favourite pirate yes long ago sid meier famous name title old classic inspiration feel pirate different aspect pirate life different minigames sea battle attacking fort swordplay treasure hunting treasure fleet shine naval combat blast nice sail different ship loved trusty sloop pirate different ship weapon disposal long range mortar explosive barrel mine ram regular broadside cannon allow different style play parkour ey stuff meh reviewer keen come across bunch mystical dan brown dreck maybe mean bigger ac universe whatever easily ignored anyway re_emphasizedading fence buying title it_emphasized fun
686810,Hell Let Loose,"My first Steam review ever, that I'm writing here. Since I played a lot of Red Orchestra 1 / 2, all the way up to the Rising Storm Vietnam, I thought that was THE Fps for me, but after some consideration (watching tons of youtube and stream content) I decided for HLL. 
Even though I was skeptical at first, especially after reading some of the negative reviews, I still decided to go with it and the only thing I can say is: 'This game crossed (in a positive way) every single one of my expectations'. The maps are amazing with more to come, gameplay is really good (some minor bugs need fixing but that will happen very quickly), the community is beyond good (at least from my experience - made a few new friends with whom I play on a daily basis).
TLDR:
PRO'S: 
- Amazing immersion
- Amazing community
- Very good graphics
- Team work functions brutally efficient
- Feels like an actual battlefield (gore, TANKS pose a really big threat, MG's aswell)
CON'S:
- VOIP needs a bit of tuning imo, so that we can hear each other a bit better, when ''things get heated''
- Weapon sounds should pack a bit of a punch (also coming in a future patch)


I know I don't have that many hours invested into the game, but I sure am planning on investing a lot more! Without hesitation!
If you like WW II, team work and realism this is a gem for you right there! I would hearthly recommend it to anyone, because after a few hours you get into it and then things get fun! ;)

1449850,Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"[h1] 8/10 [/h1]
[h1] As a Duel Links former player and a fan of the Yu-Gi-Oh card game, I came to the following conclusion after a brief experience. I hope my opinion helps those who are still on the sidelines. [/h1]

It can be said that this game is one of the best video game works of Yu-Gi-Oh's physical card in recent years. Unlike Duel Links, which focuses on fast-paced combat and nostalgia for anime plots, just like its name, the game's duel rules are the orthodox ocg-rules, which can be said to be one of the most complicated rules in card games. A large number of cards, a wide variety of rules, all flowers are in bloom decks, unexpected situations, and reversal of life after death, are the biggest charms of Yu-Gi-Oh.

At present, the music, scene design, and animation effects of the game are still quite satisfactory. At the same time, new players can build their own deck at a very low cost, which is crucial to the player experience for a card game. The only shortcoming at present is that the cost of building a second deck after building the first deck is relatively high (except for some general-purpose cards). The characteristics of the game are also doomed to the existence of tiered decks. At present, the dominance of mainstream decks over the environment is still unshakable. Let us look forward to how Konami will coordinate and balance in the future.

Overall, I'm still optimistic about this game right now. For those new players, the learning cost of ocg-rules is too high, and new players may need a long transition period, and the Duel Link is still suitable for players who like Yu-Gi-Oh's animation and want to have a simple duel.","Mostly Positive75% of the 69,676 user reviews for this game are positive.",8 10 h1_emphasized link former fan yu gi oh card following conclusion brief hope help sideline best video work yu gi oh physical card recent year unlike link focus fast paced combat nostalgia anime plot name rule orthodox ocg rule complicated rule card game large number card wide variety rule flower bloom deck unexpected situation reversal life death biggest charm yu gi oh present music scene design animation effect satisfactory player build deck low cost crucial card shortcoming present cost building deck building deck relatively high except general purpose card characteristic doomed existence tiered deck present dominance mainstream deck environment unshakable forward konami coordinate balance future optimistic player learning cost ocg rule high player long transition period link suitable player yu gi oh animation simple

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Amazing game in which I have spent over 400 hours in, particularly Online. Made some investments with the Starter Pack, took advantage of double RP sessions at certain times due to work commitments in real life, and I think 2 Shark cards to top it all up. Got some nifty rides and choppers in-game to play with, and I was so looking forward to doing it over-and-over while listening to some of the finest selection of contemporary music via the in-game radio.

But lo and behold, just only made RP 102 yesterday by taking advantage of double RP week, only to discover I got banned TODAY. Yup, an abrupt, unexplained lock-out for the next 30 days. And NO, ABSOLUTELY AND ADAMANTLY NO, I have NEITHER used any hacks NOR installed any mods to my game. To add salt to injury, my progress was reset. My hard, unmodded work, all flushed down the gutter with no explanation given. And NO, I AIN'T very tech-savvy so I can NEVER understand mods or hacks, let alone use 'em.

Seriously, man... what the F? Was about to write a nice review for ya until I got unjustly banned, and with no explanation whatsoever. You fellas at Rockstar had better get your damn act together implementing a better system at detecting hackers or modders without wrongfully or unjustly and without any form of explanation subjecting paying customers to this, this debacle.

Goodbye Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. It has been fun playing through your saga, and I would love to do so again, but this bovine excrement is an ABYSSMAL turnoff. And hello Geralt, Vito Scaletta, and Noctis and gang.

P.S. Hope bankruptcy catches up with your sorry, greedy corporate selves. You know who I am talking about. Pray one day you don't get served a class-action suit for this debacle.

P.P.S. The automated response to your ticket submission for complaints ISN'T helping anyone. Whoever your customer support is, I hope you receive your just dues when the time comes.

P.P.P.S. Don't even think I will fork out my hard earned cash for Red Dead Redemption 2, even if it comes out on PC. It can rust in a box like those six-shooters of old.

[u]Single-Player Campaign:[/u]

The campaign is so freaking boring that it's crazy. Seriously guys all you had to do was redo the same amazing missions from the original MW2 and improve it a little bit. Why did you have to remove/change all the missions in the original and put boring stealth/craft missions here when the game is not suitable for those kinds of missions? I never thought that story is a strong part of the original MW2, but this is way below even in that regard. I can't believe how st*pid Activision is.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I started out absolutely loving this game. It had everything I was looking for in an idle/active game and kept me engaged daily. I originally thought that the 2 biggest problems with the game were that the developer was trying to push too much content without circling back to fix bugs, and the part of the community that was -in my opinion- a little too harsh towards a single developer.

For over a year I defended LavaFlame when players would call him a bad developer or say that he was making the game too p2w or trying to make money. It has a gem shop, sure, but one could still progress in the game without ever purchasing anything in it. Lava also made a post mentioning that he would be spending some time fixing bugs and adding needed quality of life changes. I was a little too naive with my optimism that things would continue going well. 

In the past 3 weeks alone he has added mechanics to the game that grossly promote the ""create the problem, sell the solution"" tactic many p2w games turn to. He promoted the release of World 4 as being ""more idle"" than the previous worlds, yet implemented mechanics that highly favor players with a more active play time. When asked if he would correct an early World 4 mistake he made that offered a very powerful bonus to a very small amount of the players, he told us he didn't want to hear about it. Any mention of the game being p2w in discord now gets you a ban, as does any criticism he feels is negative towards him or the game. The ""player suggestion"" and ""best suggestion"" channels in discord are a joke. 

Lava has 8 worlds planned for this game, which I would love to see, but his attitude is going to be the one big thing to keep it from happening. With the way things are going, he will drive away the majority of the community before making it to the end. 

If you still choose to play this game, here is some advice: Remember that being active takes you farther than being idle, despite this being labeled as an idle game. The developer has an ego that is too big, so don't talk negatively about his game unless you want to get banned. The game is turning more towards a p2w play style, so those without the ability to buy gems will start progressing even slower than a year prior.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",started loving active engaged daily originally thought 2 biggest problem developer trying push circling fix bug community harsh towards single developer defended lavaflame player call bad developer p2w trying gem shop progress purchasing lava post mentioning spending fixing bug adding needed quality life change naive optimism thing continue past 3 week alone mechanic grossly promote problem solution tactic p2w game turn promoted release world 4 world implemented mechanic highly favor player active play asked correct early world 4 mistake offered powerful bonus small player told hear mention p2w discord get ban criticism feel negative towards suggestion best suggestion channel discord joke lava 8 world planned love attitude big happening thing drive majority community choose play advice remember active take farther despite labeled developer ego big t_emphasizedalk negatively unless banned turning towards p2w play style gem progressing slower prior

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"[h1][b]May the FPS be With You[/b][/h1]

[i]The overview is relevant for the Jedi Grand Master level of difficulty, patch 7 and a 5900X/RTX 4090 based PC build (the game was played in QHD).[/i]

If you mentally attempt to ignore the technical issues, since practically it’s impossible, then we’ve got a brilliant sequel to a solid original. The sequel, which improves upon each (or almost each) separate aspect of the original. Unfortunately, a great game and all that grand and valuable work on correction of all the issues and problems of the first game was ruthlessly buried under such a huge pile of technical shit, that even over 5 months since the release were not enough to dig through it.

This is one of the worst PC releases of 2023 in terms of technical performance. The release day version of the game was simply unplayable on my system, which made me decide against ruining my impressions so I put the game off. Performance issues and bugs were addressed only to a small degree 4 patches later, however the real buzzkill were the constant crashes that still occurred every 10 minutes of gameplay. As time went by, I understood that no patches would actually remedy the situation, so I decided to push through against all technical odds. All kinds of bugs and fps drops were still awaiting me on my path and they proved to be the kind of pain that was annoying, but barely tolerable. I ran into corrupted save files twice. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starwarsjedisurvivor/mods/221?tab=files&file_id=738]Here’s the solution, in case you fall victim to it.[/url]

It was hell of earth, indeed. Naturally, I am giving this game a negative review simply because the technical aspect will inevitably impact your perception of the game. In fact, I strongly recommend against pre-ordering the trequel in the future, which is certainly already in the pipeline. However, I will try my absolute hardest to detach myself from the problems and describe [b]the game[/b], as I saw it.

[list]
[*]The first thing that catches the eye is that the sequel is tightly connected to the original. Not only by the continued story, but also by the mechanics, which could be unlocked through the Skill Tree in Fallen Order, while in Survivor they are available right out of the gate by default. This certainly plays into the authenticity and spares the devs from coming up with some iffy reasons for resetting the main character’s abilities.

[*]In regard to Cal and other characters in general, I believe that the events that are occurring around them have become even more personal, and, as a result, more emotional. Most of the characters have gone through various types of experiences which have drastically changed them, and that makes them more satisfying to interact with. I can’t overstate the brilliance of the key actors’ work: the dialogues and cutscenes, especially the most important ones in terms of story, are filled with passion, efforts and heart of the whole cast.

[*]Overall, the story is still one of the SWJ’s strongest suits. It takes a bit longer to ramp up compared to the previous game. Most likely it has to do with the more massive and densely packed playable environment, which is able to extend the time gaps between the significant story events. With that said, the high stakes, the expansion of the canon and a plethora of exciting moments would leave only the outrageously snobby players indifferent, in my opinion.

[*]The exploration aspect of the game has also been improved. This time the game rewards curiosity noticeably more frequently and with items that have more value than another poncho color: now you can find permanent health or force boosts, and also combat or platforming challenges that net you rewards upon completion.

[*]On top of the worthy rewards for exploration, the world traversal has become far more enjoyable thanks to the full-fledged fast travel system via meditation sites.

[*]Even though there’s still more than plenty of cosmetics scattered around the map, it’s more compelling to go after them, as the customization system in Survivor has become more complete compared to the original: now you can replace not just the Cal’s poncho, but his entire look. You’ve got various sets of clothes and hair styles to choose from.

[*]The combat system in the sequel reveals itself in a new light. It is significantly deeper and better than it was previously thanks to Cal’s carried over abilities, the implementation of the new ones in the broader Skill Tree and new Stances and Perks systems. Besides, in certain story bits you can fight alongside your partners and interact with them. All of that allows to create a large number of fighting styles and approaches to combat. My only gripe with the combat is the inability to switch between all stances at once. You can select only 2 out of 5 stances at the same time and swap them exclusively at the meditation sites. This design choice negatively influences not only the flexibility of the gameplay, but also the immersion in general, causing ludonarrative dissonance.

[*]Platforming is still here and remains a large part of the gameplay by adding variety to fighting and storytelling parts. According to my impressions, platforming is still imperfect, however it’s clear that its mechanics have been given a lot of attention and polish. You no longer fail to grab some sort of surface for no apparent reason and with 100% correctly timed inputs as often as you used to. However, it has still happened to me a few times nonetheless. Meanwhile, the platforming sections have become even more difficult, lengthy and spectacular in terms of direction. The grandeur of some of them truly take your breath away.

[*]The design of the map has become substantially more illustrative, schematic and simply more convenient, which is great news since the world has become vastly more complex compared to the previous game.

[h1]Minor cons[/h1]

[list]
[*]While the poor readability of the level design has become much less of an issue, it still leaves a lot to be desired, in my opinion. Platforming parts suffer from this issue the most.

[*]There are no games without conventions, but why can you use fast travel on any meditation site except for the one in the Mantis?

[*]The last enemy who defeats Cal gets marked with golden glow. Personally, I think it’s not the best choice for highlighting your slayer since the glow is permanent and can only be removed by landing a hit onto that specific enemy. The thing is that while it’s active, it’s rather difficult to read unparryable attacks, because enemies are supposed to glow red during this type of attacks. In these situations your only bet is to react to the pattern of the attacks instead of the special indicators. I believe that these two design choices aren’t very compatible. At the very least, instead of making the whole model of your slayer glow golden, they could’ve added this golden glow to the outlines of the model, so that the red indicator of the unparryable attack remains visible.[/list] 
  
[h1]Verdict[/h1]

[b]Paradoxically, my thoughts on the game are largely complimentary. However, the technical problems ruin not only the value of the work that has been done in the game and level design, platforming and other departments, but also the artistic value of the sequel. How is everything SWJ:S has to offer (and it has a lot of good things to offer) supposed to be enjoyed if the gaming experience is comparable to a torture? Survivor is a wonderful game, but an awful piece of program code. It’s a shame that you can’t separate the two.[/b]

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"[h1]Performance[/h1]
Let’s first get the elephant out of the room: Jedi Survivor is a good game, but I don’t recommend picking it right now because as of May 8, the performance is still far from good, despite recent patch fixing the game from unacceptable to playable. Frame rates are still all over the place in some areas and the game often looks like a blurry mess (1080P, all max setting, RTX and FSR off). There are tons of visual glitches, like every time starting the game, shader needs re-compiling and the game switches to a weird low resolution, not to mention gameplay glitches (achievement is also broken) and potential balancing issues, which all take time to iron out.

[h1]Movement & Puzzle/Platforming[/h1]
The predecessor Jedi Fallen Order has movement, environmental puzzle solving and platforming similar to Tomb Raider. Jedi Survivor doesn’t change these gameplay elements, yet they are improved. Movement is less like Tomb Raider, but more of its own thing since Jedi elements are much more integrated into movements and brings more variety. More importantly, movement is more natural and opens up more possibilities for platforming. Speaking of which, platforming and puzzle are more integrated into each other, meaning a lot of the time, puzzle is how to find a way to do platforming. I really enjoyed the puzzle/platforming sessions: you need to think and use a bit of skill to complete, but they never take you more than a couple of trials or a few minutes of thinking, reaching a good balance between being challenging and accessible. The only flaw is sometimes double jump doesn’t work.

[h1]Map Design[/h1]
Metroidvania design is inherited from the old game, acting as a major mechanic to level/map design, meaning some areas are locked until you acquire certain abilities. Like the predecessor, the game does a good job of encouraging players to go out of their way to explore, as there is always something outside the main path. Thanks to the Metroidvania design, even you have fully explored the map, after some progression, you can traverse back to explore the new layer of the old map, which is not only a smart way to add more content, but also makes the game more adventurous to those who enjoy exploration.

Despite going out the main path a little, each session is linear, but most maps are non-linear with a central hub design. A few of these hubs put together a large, interconnected area, and several of these areas form the big open world, with some separated and small linear areas scattered around. It sounds complicated but is actually very organized since most areas are “isolated” with only one way in and out (not one direction) except for the central hub, so there is no messy way crossing, mitigating the difficulty in finding pathes when traversing and backtracking. Additionally, the map system is vastly improved from the last game. It indicates pathes and shows unexplored areas (only those currently accessible) clearly, and acts as hints to puzzle/platforming. It, however, glitches out in some areas, showing used path as open path waiting to go. It also doesn’t show unexplored areas that are far out or hidden from the main path, which I suspect is on purpose.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
Combat is the major gameplay besides exploration and puzzle/platforming. Inherited from its predecessor, it features combat inspired by Sekiro, encouraging players to be more aggressive and good at parrying to break stamina. Compared to Jedi Fallen Order, combat is smoother, has a perk (buff) system, more combat skills and five different stances (move sets). It is a shame you can’t equip all stances at once, seeing how allowing Dante to change to every move set (from DMC 3 to 4) on the fly can have a significant impact on combat.

The combat system itself is solid, however, it is also plagued with “probable” glitches, which can be frustrating in some scenarios.
[list]
[*]Lightsaber throw often mistakenly registers as force attack.
[*]Hitbox is so massive and imprecise that horizontal attack can catch you in mid-air.
[*]Switching lock-on is slow and often doesn’t work as desired, especially when facing clustered enemies or there is some distance between two enemies (no response at all).
[*]Healing sometimes doesn’t kick in despite hearing the sound prompt.
[*] Sometimes one hit is (from enemy) registered as twice, and action might glitch out when close to arena boundary.
[/list]
Beating this game and its predecessor at highest difficulty, this game feels much harder for being much more reaction based. Combat rewards precise timing and input more than ever, reminding me of playing Vergil in DMC, but if your reflex is not fast enough, you get heavily punished, to the point where I think it relies way too much on quick reflex, like even fast-paced hack-and-slash games or proper souls-like titles don’t rely on it as much. I can only assume the highest difficulty was not properly play-tested, causing balancing issues.

[h1]Balance & Boss/Enemy Design[/h1]
A good example is the damage of RPG and charged-up shots, which is so ludicrous that you can die before realizing it (you take out those first, but the problematic lock-on makes it hard to do). But balancing is a glaring issue primarily because some non-humanoid enemy/boss designs are just offensively bad. They are inconsistent and way overly aggressive, attacking every three seconds when one hit can clean up over half of the max-out health bar, leaving little attack window and room for mistakes. They also spam unblockable and instant death attacks consecutively, so you can die in seconds if not react fast enough.

For those atrocious opponents, your strat is to get a hit or twice then evade and evade. You can’t go aggressive even a bit, as contrast to other enemies who you should be aggressive to, effectively turning the game from Sekiro to Dark Souls. I am not sure it is a good thing to change gameplay so drastically on different enemies.

Force Tear is challenges like secret mission in DMC and is supposed to be hard. However, it becomes a can of worms because in some of them, players fight against those horrendous bosses in duo or trio in a small arena. Duo/Trio fights are already notoriously hard to balance even boss is well-designed separately. Clearly, little thought of balancing is put into consideration when designing these fights, seeing how one boss blocks your vision and attack from another goes through its body hitting you, or how you dodge one’s attack, but at the exact moment evasion ends another one hits you. They are not fun at all.

[h1]Story[/h1]
What I like the most in Jedi Fallen Order is the well-written and relatable story, centering around the struggle and growth of several main characters giving each one a full character arc. Jedi Survivor really expects you to play the last game to see the growth and bond between main characters, because the story doesn't give much screen time to reintroduce these characters, or further develop any character besides Cal. It is not friendly to those who didn’t play or forgot the last game. More importantly, it fails to reinforce the bonds with the old crew and strengthen the bond between Cal and the new character Bode. Therefore, story events are just not as impactful and related as I’d hoped for. Dialogues are still well-written with tones fitting for each character and Cal’s growth is still well-crafted, but the story definitely feels water-down compared to the last game.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Bloomberg reports that Jedi Survivor breaks production record time. It is a compliment to the amount of content they managed to pack into the game, and the excellent level/map design that has the potential to score some awards in The Game Award. But it is pure irony in terms of PC performance, glitches, balancing and some of the poor enemy/boss design. I just wish the game come out at a more polished stage. It is a solid game after all and shouldn’t have left a bad taste in the mouth.","Mixed66% of the 43,165 user reviews for this game are positive.",performance elephant room jedi survivor good recommend picking 8 performance far good despite recent software fix bug balance add feature fixing unacceptable playable frame rate area look blurry mess 1080p max setting rtx fsr ton visual glitch starting shader need compiling switch weird low resolution not_to mention glitch achievement broken potential balancing issue iron movement puzzle platforming predecessor jedi fallen order movement environmental puzzle solving platforming similar to_emphasizedmb raider jedi survivor element improved movement tomb raider jedi element integrated movement brings variety importantly movement natural open possibility platforming speaking platforming puzzle integrated meaning puzzle platforming enjoyed puzzle platforming session bit skill complete never_take couple trial minute reaching good balance challenging accessible flaw double design metroidvania design inherited old acting major mechanic design meaning area locked acquire certain ability predecessor good encouraging player explore path thanks metroidvania design explored progression traverse explore layer old not_only smart add make adventurous enjoy exploration despite path session linear map non linear central hub design hub large interconnected area form big open world separated small linear area scattered sound complicated organized area isolated not_one direction except central hub no_messy crossing mitigating difficulty finding pathes traversing backtracking vastly improved last indicates pathes show unexplored area currently accessible clearly act hint puzzle platforming glitch area showing path open path waiting unexplored area far hidden path suspect purpose combat combat major besides exploration puzzle platforming inherited predecessor feature combat inspired sekiro encouraging player aggressive good parrying break stamen compared jedi fallen order combat smoother perk strengthen improve effectiveness combat skill five different stance move set shame equip stance seeing allowing dante move set dmc 3 4 fly significant impact combat combat solid plagued probable glitch frustrating scenario lightsaber throw mistakenly register force attack hitbox massive imprecise horizontal attack catch mid air switching lock slow desired especially facing clustered enemy distance enemy no_response healing kick despite hearing sound prompt enemy registered twice action software programming error cause unexpected behavior close arena boundary beating predecessor highest difficulty feel harder reaction based combat reward precise timing input reminding vergil dmc reflex not_fast heavily punished relies quick reflex fast paced hack slash game proper soul title rely assume highest difficulty not_properly play tested causing balancing issue balance bos enemy design good example damage role charged shot ludicrous die realizing problematic lock make hard balancing glaring issue primarily non humanoid enemy bos design offensively bad inconsistent overly aggressive attacking three second clean half max health bar leaving attack window room mistake spam unblockable instant death attack consecutively die second not_react fast atrocious opponent strat twice evade evade aggressive bit contrast enemy aggressive effectively turning sekiro dark soul not_sure good drastically different enemy force tear challenge secret dmc supposed hard worm player fight horrendous boss duo trio small arena duo trio fight already notoriously hard balance bos designed separately clearly thought balancing consideration designing fight seeing bos block vision attack go body hitting dodge attack exact moment evasion end hit not_fun jedi fallen order written relatable centering struggle growth character giving arc jedi survivor expects play last growth bond character screen reintroduce character develop besides cal not_friendly play forgot last importantly fails reinforce bond old crew strengthen bond cal bode event not_as impactful related hoped dialogue written tone fitting cal growth crafted definitely feel water compared last verdict bloomberg report jedi survivor break production record compliment managed pack excellent design potential score award award pure irony term pc performance glitch balancing poor enemy bos design wish polished stage solid left bad taste mouth

440,Team Fortress 2,"Well..

Ok, Ill admit, unlike other high profile folk that have more hours then me.. I have just under 2000 hours but have been playing this game for well over 10 years.. To be exact March 8th 2009. (as my badge says)

I may be a no one in the community, but I have been supporting this game since I first played. The game I would always come back to and call ""home"".

I, over the years have made friends, enemies, servers.. Learnt different modes, meta, styles, languages.. I have been through multiple events like, The Sniper vs. Spy Update, Classless Update, the big 119th updates update (no joke..) Solider vs Demoman, Scream Fortresses, Christmas updates! You get the point..

There is no sparkle to this game anymore, I cannot jump on a 118 ping New York server, late at night waiting for the Americans to get back online in the evening, me and Banksy taking on 2Fort as Demoman to kill all soliders so that the Demoman could have his own weapon? (Spolier: Solider won, welcome to the Gunboats..) Then finding out TF2 came onto Mac and people that had it, got the ear buds, that sold well.. 

To be fair, I could go on and tell my war stories, but that feeling when the family gets a new puppy and you get shut out as no one is interested in you anymore? This is exactly whats happening with TF2 (dev side).. I always check steam stats and there is always over 50k people playing, always top 10 on the chart but something is missing..

As part of the community, us loyal people that cherish this game, we are the backbone to this beautiful creation. You don't see Blizzard (well not all the time) not maintaining their beautiful creation and of course World of Warcraft is older then this.. Maybe because of the paid subscription, but I am sure that TF2 alone use to get more money as a free to play game at one point. (Jeeze I had to pay for TF2 over 10 years ago..)

I mean ok, fair play, you have a new game coming out.. whooptie doo.. Send all the cavalry towards that.. Yet instead to the people who grew up with TF2, old players and new players. People who have spent hundreds and even thousands of dollars for now a game which to me is dying.. Not the people's fault, but your own selves..
Jumping into a casual game (YOUR servers) to be greeted by not one sniper but three sniper ""bots"" that have their own way-points, spamming ""good shot mate"", aim botting, auto spamming chat so no one can see whats written as a wall of blank appears and calling no when someone votes them a ban. When there is 3 or more of them they win the no vote anyway..

When making your own stuff glitch gets patched.. finding glitches in the items_game text file gets patched.. Oh yeah I forgot that's your profits going down the drain.. But don't worry as bots and hackers are not, so were forget about it.. the game.. the people, who truly love and support this game..

Excuse the rant but for a game that still, to me at this dire moment, is still rocking the steam charts, this should be dealt with within a matter of days or weeks.. There are no new updates like the Solider vs Demoman.. The love for this game from you, just has vanished.. 

I will carry on playing as I still love this game and class this as home. But for now, don't expect me to dedicate my time or spend money on anything till this ""bot"" situation and other stupid stuff is dealt with.. and hopefully soon. With new updates that sparkle in my eyes.. And a new bloody weapon for the Demoman as I deemed the solider win was unfair. 
 
Do I recommend it to others? Oh yes, yes I do. But at the moment with the bot situation, other stupid stuff and the game at the moment being ""devless"". No.
But still download it, go onto the community servers, find a mode, map, server and enjoy. I will give it a thumbs up but really should be a thumbs down at this point of the games life.

**New Players** the first initiate is daunting, but play for fun, learn who the characters are and the history about them. I did and it got me 2000 hours, 10 years of play and a game I could call home. There are also comics about the game to if you like to read.

Good luck and thank you for the read.","Very Positive93% of the 1,029,546 user reviews for this game are positive.",ok ill admit unlike high profile folk hour 2000 hour 10 year exact march 8th 2009 badge say no_one community supporting call home year friend enemy server learnt different mode effective popular strategy character build style language multiple event sniper v spy classless big 119th update no_joke solider v demoman scream fortress christmas update no_sparkle anymore cannot_jump 118 ping york computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player late night waiting american online evening banksy taking 2fort demoman kill soliders demoman weapon spolier solider welcome gunboat finding tf2 onto mac ear bud sold fair war story feeling family get puppy shut no_one interested anymore exactly whats happening tf2 side check stats 50k top 10 chart missing community loyal cherish backbone beautiful creation blizzard not_all not_maintaining beautiful creation course world warcraft older maybe paid subscription tf2 alone play jeeze pay tf2 10 year ago ok fair play whooptie doo send cavalry towards grew tf2 old player player spent hundred thousand dollar dying not_the fault self jumping casual server greeted not_one sniper three sniper bot point spamming good shot mate aim botting auto spamming chat no_one whats written wall blank appears calling no_when someone vote ban 3 win no_vote anyway stuff software programming error cause unexpected behavior get patched finding glitch items_game text file get patched oh yeah forgot profit drain worry bot hacker not_so forget truly love support excuse rant dire moment rocking chart dealt with_emphasizedin matter day week no_new update solider v demoman love vanished carry love class home expect dedicate spend till bot situation stupid stuff dealt hopefully soon update sparkle eye bloody weapon demoman deemed solider win unfair recommend others oh yes_emphasized moment bot situation stupid stuff moment devless no_but download onto community server mode computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player enjoy thumb thumb game life player initiate daunting play fun learn character history 2000 hour 10 year play call home comic read good luck read
1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"First the good: This probably has the best graphics of any flight simulator I've ever played, especially considering that all the terrain is from satellite maps. It also probably has a very realistic flight model, but I'm not a pilot so I can't really attest to how good it is or whatever.  I do know it feels a bit different than X-Plane 11 though. Also for the same base price you can pretty much fly everywhere.  The only reason to pay extra is for a few extra planes and a bit more detail on some airports.

The downsides to this product?  Microsoft does all the updating and installing. The first time you start up the game you will wind up waiting an hour or more (depending on your download speed and the load on Microsoft's crappy servers) before you can even play.  This time gets added to your play time so good luck on that refund.  I mean, if there's a real need to refund or if you absolutely hate the download time, you're gonna have to argue with steam support about your play time.  If not for that, you could get a refund automatically under 2 hours of play time. 

Also, If you don't play the game for a long while, expect to start it up and find out there's a 30+GB update waiting for you, and no, you can't just let it update and THEN start up the game, it's back-ass-wards with the update after you launch. Also, it doesn't transmit one large compressed file and then decompress it and install it.  No, it installs in bits and pieces, so you'll see your download speed ramp up from 0 to whatever speed, then drop to 0 again as it decompressed the file and installs it, only to start over for the next file.   If Steam could handle at least the major updates this maybe wouldn't be so bad.

This game also depends on an internet connection to load the terrain graphics. In low detail areas where it's lots of open fields and trees it's probably not that bad, but with buildings you may not see a detailed structure right away depending on your internet speed.  The only good news here is that you can have it cache the local area if you're prone to flying in the same general area a lot.   This game is probably not safe for Comcast users (Data caps).

This game also takes data for things like the current weather, actual flight traffic in the area, and of course other players in the game.  

But another good thing about the game is the VR support.  I've managed to do a few flights in VR and it works reasonably well. I still prefer X-Plane 11 for the simple fact that I can control just about everything with the VR controllers but if your setup allows you to comfortably use the keyboard/mouse and a HOTAS, MSFS still works well enough.  The game is pretty rough on my poor computer though.  Even setting the Index to run at 80FPS and turning details down to medium on just about everything I still noticed a bit of motion smoothing type warping in game.

For reference I'm running this on a Ryzen 3950X, 64GB of RAM, and a RTX 3080. This should be more than enough computer for just about every VR game out there, but this is one of those games that the computer struggles on.  If you have a weaker computer and you plan to play in VR, you may want to set your settings even lower unless you can put up with an awful lot of motion smoothing.

But anyway, despite all of that, if you're a flight simulator fan (and especially regarding VR) then this is a no-brainer.  There's not really any other flight sim out there that competes at the moment, as far as graphics and world simulation goes.  X-Plane 11 doesn't perform much better but I don't think it takes advantage of multiple cores either so at least MSFS has that advantage.","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",good probably best graphic especially considering terrain satellite map probably realistic model not_a pilot attest good whatever feel bit different x plane 11 base price pretty fly everywhere pay extra extra plane bit detail airport downside product updating installing wind waiting depending download speed load crappy server play get play good luck refund real refund hate download gon na argue support play not_for refund automatically 2 hour play play long expect 30 gb waiting no_you as ward launch t_emphasizedransmit large compressed file decompress install no_it installs bit piece download speed ramp 0 whatever speed drop 0 decompressed file installs next file handle major update maybe bad depends internet connection load terrain graphic low detail area lot open field tree probably not_that bad building not_see detailed structure depending internet speed good news cache local prone flying general probably not_safe comcast user data cap take data thing weather actual traffic course player good vr support managed flight vr work reasonably prefer x plane 11 simple control vr controller setup allows comfortably keyboard mouse hotas msfs work pretty rough poor computer setting index 80fps turning detail medium noticed bit motion smoothing type warping reference running ryzen 3950x 64gb ram rtx 3080 computer vr game computer struggle weaker computer plan play vr set setting lower unless awful motion smoothing anyway despite fan especially regarding vr no_brainer not_really sim competes moment far graphic world go x plane 11 perform t_emphasizedhink take advantage multiple core msfs advantage
686810,Hell Let Loose,"[quote][b]Game Version:[/b] 4.25.3.0 (Early Access)[/quote]

It was 1944; we received an order to deploy on 6 of June at the Omaha beach. We would be part of the Operation Neptune, and our objective was simple; take Normandy from the German hands and start the liberation of France. However, nothing occurred as expected; the Germans had fortified the coast, already waiting for a change of attack. I was a simple medic on the field, and I will never forget what I saw that day.; because I got three guys on my team that decided to rush against the machine guns, and here the big boy needed to save them. It's not that I tilt in online games (lie) but there I was getting a bit... you know... unhappy. To help, my squad leader would just be saying, ""ok guy we need to push, let's go""; saying to the berserkers, in other words, you are cannon meat, continue killing urself.

Hell Let Loose, in a nutshell, it's a 50 vs 50 WWII themed tactical FPS. It's a game directed for someone looking for a more immersive experience than Call of Duty. It's not extremely realistic; anyhow, that's not the point; it can be immersive without being a full military simulator, like Squad or Post Scriptum. There aren't many elements on the screen, and all the weapons and gear are authentic. The maps are designed based on aerial photographs of real WWII battlefields; and to make the game deeper, Hell Let Loose uses the Vivox voice chat.

I referred before Squad and Post Scriptum, two phenomenal hardcore tactical shooters; but not the easiest to jump in, for their complexity. Hell Let Loose picks core these games, and make it simpler, or at least easier. For example, the respawn time is relatively quick. So if you aren't in the middle of an important point, there is no stress in dying, because in just 40 seconds you will be ready to go again.

To the surprise of many, Hell Let Loose is an Indie game; being the debut title of a small indie studio called Black Matter. The game is receiving constants updated and hotfixes (still in early access), and the devs are posting weekly ""Developer Briefing"", where the players can look at the game progression.

[h2]Colonel Bogey March[/h2]

The maps are all around the Western Front so far. They have an interesting and realistic design; however, at some point, they start to feel repetitive. There are changes in terms of terrain; anyhow, the buildings will not have anything new.  Also, some maps have structure mistakes, as can be seen in the print below. To the happiness of many, including me, it's coming to the game the Eastern front, that can bring new designs.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2373374990
Hell Let Loose counts with the normal conquest mode, where the two teams need to control points to end up winning the war. It's a usual mode in this type of FPS's. There is the need to formulate a strategy and put it to practice. Remembering that the conquests points are always rotating, and every game is a new challenge; being important to use your mic to contact your team. [b]There aren't berserkers in Hell Let Loose![/b] The best choice is to play as a team.

The game has already a good amount of different weapons. The shooting mechanics are clean; it's realistic on many levels, and there isn't the necessity to use a full charger to kill a player. Most of the weapons can put you down with a simple shoot. Anyhow, there is something still lacking; the mele weapons. Thankfully they are already confirmed, and there are already some images (can be seen in the Developer Brief #113 ). There are also other extra tools depending on the class that you choose. For example, a medic will have morphine to revive players, and an engineer will have tools to set barricades, mines, and others.

This last line leads us to the mobile warfare; something that I enjoy even not being close to the ideal player. There are three roles in the tanks - driver, shooter(?)*, and spotter(?)*. It's hard to take control of the tank, but for me, it's the tensest role of the game. Be in a spot where you just can see what is in front of you, in the middle of a war is hard, really hard. In the end, it's [i]enjoyable, but stressful.[/i]

Nothing can be just flowers, and Hell Let Loose isn't different. There is a main problem that I would like to point: the need to stop running or walking to reload. I believe that doesn't help the gameplay at any point, and sometimes can be a reason for someone kill you. One time I started reloading and in a matter of seconds, a huge bombing starts. [i]Why did I die?[/i] Because I couldn't move!

[h2]Holyrood[/h2]

The game counts with fourteen different classes, but four are extremely important: the Commander and the squad leaders (Spotter, Tank Commander and Officer). As can be awaited from a tactical fps, there is a hierarchy system; the Commander commands the squad leaders, and they command their respective squads. Many players don't care about this and just run to the objectives, but the idea is there, and thankfully most still follow. About the other classes, they mostly depend on the game condition. There isn't any problem in changing after dying or redeploying; however, every squad can just have one player for each role (medic, engineer,  and others). Being Rifleman, the unique that doesn't follow this rule (five players max). Each class has a different gear, following their respective role; it's possible to change gear, but I will be approaching this topic below when I get into levelling up. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2383169358
There are just two factions: Allies and Axis; but are represented only by the United States and Germany. But the devs already confirmed the upcoming Red Army (Soviet Army), and it's possible to see already some drafts. It was also confirmed the Imperial Japanese Army, the British Army and the Canadian Army. I believe that are great additions, but still would be better to add the British CommonWealth; not just UK and Canada; and the Italien Army.

Levelling up with a class or with the overall level will unlock different gear. Some roles can handle with new guns and weapons others sadly don't have that luck. But something all have in common: new uniforms, helmets, and faces to use. I still believe that every class could unlock a different weapon to use, but this soft customization gives an objective to level up.

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"Before you buy this game you must know that it's REALLY HARD.

I wanted to write a review as soon as i complete every achievement. After 104 hours in this game i cannot recommend this game to everyone, because sometimes it's a game about sitting for 10+ hours on a single boss, because your build sucks. After obtaining every single part in this game almost every single one becomes a joke, with few exceptions. Even after that this game still requires you to have some skill, because only few bosses in the entire game really tests your skills and not the build as some do (like infamous Balteus or Sea Spider. As soon as you complete the game they cant even hurt you properly because your body parts and weapons are much much better).

Aside all the ""difficulty whining"", the game is fantastic. Comparing it with the giants like Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 or Metal Gears' is not fair. Dialogues are boring for some people, cutscenes just waste your time with mechs dramatically falling from the sky every single time and you can't even see faces of the characters that are talking to you (well, to be fair, some notes that you collect DO show you some silhouettes of the characters but 100% of the time you are talking either with a cool logos or a mechs that fight you in that very moment). The last game with adrenaline mech fights was Front Mission Evolved in 2010 that had some similar ups and downs with this one (which in my opinion is the closest to compare if we are not talking about latest Armored Cores itself which i've never heard of until august of 2023. I think most of the players are in the same condition as me). And i'm glad i've discovered this series because if you are invested enough you WILL absolutely LOVE this game. After completing it once (completed it a total of 5-6 times) you WILL start listen to what characters are talking about, you'll start to appreciate the humor and the story even more. It's simple and because it's simple you won't miss anything and you absolutely should not. Story deserves your attention, dialogues will shine on your second and third plyathroughs (my god i can't stop laughing from Michigan insults and jokes), once you hear ""I won't miss"", the spine chills will get you every single time. It's not as good as some game giants but you won't be dissapointed once you try to give this story a chance! (Kinda reminds me of Spec Ops The Line, though in doesn't need 2 playthroughs. Mostly because of the vibes the story gives you)

Gameplay is fast, smooth, adrenaline-filled chaos with some epileptic moments that will hurt your eyes (its unavoidable) from time to time but once you find your way to fight - it will make you crave for more. For example: you can build strongest TONK build with 2 miniguns and 2 anti-""tank"" rifles and run around being a fortress on threads and complete the game without any problems (That was my first playthrough and some say that this build is cheese and they are right); you can build fastest ZOOMING mech with dual SMGs and few long range rocket launchers and be succesfull aswell (my 2nd playthrough); hell you can even create a monster with a fast body and stupidly heavy weapons AND beat the game (my third playthrough you guessed it alright), tho you will be overburdened like in fallout games but that doesn't matter it STILL WORKS. After obtaining every single part in the game you are not playing ""how to beat this MF that im stuck for 10 hours"" anymore, you now play ""admire and experiment"" game and to prove my words - paintjobs and customisations are HIGLY customisable. You can download emblems from other players and put them on you mech as decals, you can save your build up to 40 times, AND there are at least 5 pages with 40 slots each, have fun with your imagination! (And my advice, copy Ayre build because her mech have brightest lights among anyone else. Just pick her mech, go to paint, say yes and then quit DISCARDING the edits. I've stumbled upon this one by chance and it's sad you can't customise brightness of your lights).

Game will reward you if you invest your time in it. Even if you think that im psycho because i completed the story like 5-6 times - there are 3 different endings and all of them will leave you craving for more. Kinda stupid that you must complete the story from the very beginning to open the next but that might be me. In any case, great game! But if you came here for no-brain laughs or don't want get stuck on one boss because they are too hard for you (no thats not an insult, i consider myself as a bad player and that's just a warning. I don't want people to get frustrated because helicopter  made them stuck for two hours and made them refund the game after that. It's a fair warning because i've seen TOO MANY players that refunded the game and thinks its really bad. That makes me sad because despite its flaws the game is amazing).

Haven't tried the multiplayer but i've heard its fun. Mostly 1x1, 2x2 or 3x3 deathmatch mods. No Co-op tho but i think it would break the game. Hope the DLC will add this dark-souls-like (or Elden Ring) feature because game DOES include moments when you fight alongside with NPC mechs, for my opinion those are most fun.

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"There are stories, there are beautiful stories, and there are also stories that you will remember for a long time. This game has it all. The adventure leaves you with tons of things to do, a great story, a fun game, and most of all, something to do. You really care about the characters, the gang ""family"" becomes like your family, and when things get bad.. do you really want to help you. Of course, in the meantime, you can hunt, rob, kill and do whatever bad or dec you want, but you know that someone is waiting for you. And the finish will bring tears to your eyes for different things in many cases. It's an amazing, very realistic environment, My only regret was that I bought Red Dead Redemption 2 from the Rockstar Launcher the week it came out on the computer, I wish I had waited another 1 month and bought it on Steam, I've already bought the game now, it was a great feeling to finish this game again, it's really the best of all time.

1599340,Lost Ark,"You should not play this game because it is predatory. 

The executives at SG are wolves in sheep's clothing, all the pay to win problems in this game are because of them. 

The community, i mean the general populous (not you and your guild) is terrible. You cannot play with these people without having one sweat lord criticizing your every movement. Eventually you become the sweat lord and you start criticizing others. 

The home work is there because we create so many characters thinking it will ""feed"" the main. In a sense they do, but you have to pay big time to ""feed"" your main. 

It's a shame, the game play is awesome, the classes are awesome, some of the npcs are likeable. I regret my time with this game. If I could go back, I would tell myself to never play this game, that way I don't get tempted to sink my time into it for that next .001% upgrade. 

if you want to hope your grinding is enough to get that upgrade, then this game is the perfect bait for you. 

I'll be back to test out the balance patch for soulfist, but I probably won't get to play my class at the speed I like until I spend 500 bucks getting the gems or silver to roll my high level gems into the new meta skills. The game juiced me, juiced me until i had no juice left.

- Make sure to have a lot of storage, it takes a long time to get it started
- Just buy the standard version, the rest is quite useless as it's just extra planes that you can get for free as mods
And just a little bonus tip to make it more fun:

Pros:
- enormous player base
- beautiful graphics and smooth gameplay
- can play with friends
- weapons and clothing customization
- unique base building
- a lot of PVP action
- raiding enemy player bases
- different type of servers ( modded, vanilla, community, etc.)
- day and night cycle
- every month the game has a major update and all servers wipe
- large maps filled with monuments, caves, icebergs, ships, animals and more


Cons:
- you can get OFFLINE raided
- time consuming (especially if you want to play solo)
- weapon recoil requires dedication and practice (especially the AK)
- if you want to play solo get ready to be wrecked during your first 100 - 200 hours
- to craft items you need to find and learn blueprints (also time consuming af)
- you can get randomly kicked out of a server because of a TIMED OUT connection
- requires a decent gaming PC
- FPS optimization lacks in some zones of the map

Game looks great, plays well, and fighting ships and upgrading your ship to fight bigger ships never gets old.

One caveat: The game has some crap performance. Even after upgrading to a GTX 980 Ti, I was still only getting ~40 FPS.  UNTIL! I found a crazy fix that works. First, let NVIDIA control panel handle the VSync. The game's VSync is crap. Second, and it's really weird: After loading into the game, lock your computer. Then re-open the game window. This takes my perf from ~40 to ~60 every time. Don't know why. Doesn't make sense.

Check out the gameplay here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etQtlNT009k

Advantages:
1. The game looks very polished. Even the steps sound satisfying. It's clear what the game wants you to do but it doesn't hold your hand so you feel smart for figuring a puzzle out. The storytelling throught environment is impressive and the visuals are great.
2. It's scary! The first actual monster encounter is terrifying and even though we've seen tons of animatronic games already, this one seems to be different as the monster animations are amazing, it ducks to go through the doorway and gets in the vents. The monster's behaviour seems very promising for the upcoming chapters.
3. A very interesting mechanic (the grabby hands). It is VERY promising and I can't wait to see what the developers will come up with to surprise us. So far you can grab objects, flip objects, open doors and even softer your fall. I think this might become very interesting and complicated.
4. Cheap.

Disadvantages:
1. Bugs. Not a lot but if you like exploring (like me), you'll encounter them. You can see a couple in my video if you'd like.
2. Only 1 chapter so far. Very intriguing but not enough to tell whether the game is going to be good or not. So far seems incredible!

Overall:
I'd definitely recommend buying the game now since it has only 1 chapter. I'd rate the game now as it is 8.5 hugs till you pop / 10. I'd guess that it would get more expensive as more chapters come out so buy it asap. It's VERY promising and cool. The first chapter is short but quite impressive. Just do it, you won't regret it. Hope my feedback was useful! If it was - drop a like so it could be useful to other ppl too :3

1085660,Destiny 2,"Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.
I've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.
It's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.
I bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.
Forsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.
The game may be ""Free to play"" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.
Yes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:
Raids, high quality but the same ones every time
Strikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones
Dungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety
Seasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story
Crucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps
Gambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool
Seasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season
None of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.
And it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that ""by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps"" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.
And getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:
Overwhelming
Confusing
No sense of clear direction
All the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc
Why was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)
Any many more comments that made them not want to play the game.

I know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.
And i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.","Very Positive80% of the 583,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",clear come not_of hatred love near dear heart anger bungie handled series 1 1 high low inbetween love drought surge drop flop rise fall faced fact huffing copium truthful despite year genuinely recommend anybody not_in state user complaining not_being play constantly drought genuinely concerned direction bungie taking past recent downloadable additional released initial launch handled monetized treated veteran playerbase bought 100 special edition released bought hard earned 100 worth turned play 100 turned 0 average received no_compensation buying early except emblem emblem not_a potential season pas season started no_refund not_a piece compensation leaving forsaken best downloadable additional released initial launch released downloadable additional released initial launch brought d2 shitshow great relevant good tacked wiped code play sink hundred dollar downloadable additional released initial launch seasonal pass separate dungeon pass worth average season pas ask bungie wipe code month yes bring fun drip feeding month relevant change not_a fun play anyways raid high quality one strike fun repetitive year one dungeon similar problem fun repetitive lack variety seasonal not_worth season unless trying follow crucible shitty try excessively hard win succeed effective popular strategy character build hardly map gambit gamemode basically given map removed pool seasonal event fun damn season fresh year year one watching old favorite sunset not_like bungie d1 inspiration sparrow racing league player clamoring fresh bungie entice player stay bungie record stating designed srl strike map state willing effort willing strike map worth player painful tried onboarding horrible mismanaged held half locked paywall friend tried overwhelming confusing no_sense clear direction cool stuff locked paid downloadable additional released initial launch random booted seasonal season comment not_want play basically rant no_clear rime jumping topic to_emphasizedpic thrive bungie shown competent company quality product not_seeing compensation 100 watched vanish span
2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Assassin's Creed: Valhalla is the longest single player game I've played since Dragon Quest VII. 

You play as Eivor, a dude and/or lady person from Norway during the Early Middle Ages. Eivor's clan is attacked when he was a child and his parents are murdered, during his escape, he gets ganked by a wolf, but after seeing an appirition of Odin, calls upon two ravens to distract the wolf before killing it with an Axe. This gets the guy the name “Wolf-Kissed” a moniker that sticks with him for the rest of his life. 

I know that Ubisoft said that Eivor is canonically a lady, I do not care, I played as Alexios as well in Odyssey. You cannot take my wonderful European sons away from me. 

Valhalla is hard to talk about, the first boss of the game would be the last boss of any other game, in the first two hours you kind of already get the revenge plot out of the way, and then Eivor, his friend and leader: Sigurd, and their clan go to England to cause problems. So the game gets what would be the main plot of any other game out of the way and then just kind of becomes a neat Viking simulator for about.

Uh
100 Hours or so. 
Okay.

The main objective of Valhalla is to gain alliances from the major players in England during the 800s, you go around either by foot, horse, or longboat and travel to these places, meet new people, and then kill them. There is an overarching plot that melds into the alliance building involving another predecessors of the Templars known as The Order of the Ancients, who are a mix between the Templars, scientologists, and Atlantis theorists if the Atlantis theorists were actually on point. Like the order of Cosmos from the last game, you hunt these people down like rare animals and then make sure their picture shows up on a milk carton the next week.

It can be fun to hunt them down, sometimes, but for the most part, unless they show up in the main story, its just kind of busy work. Though there are situations where you might kill one on accident during a city brawl or something, which is always hilarious. They're actually a figure within the world, unless they're story related, so if you know where some of them are before hand, you can just get them while they sleep or something. 

Combat in Valhalla is another take on the combat they established in Origins, a game I haven't played yet. People call it a Dark Souls rip off because the default controls are L1/R1 related. But if you ask me, its more like the Witcher 3 than it is Dark Souls. I always end up trying to get as close to legacy controls as possible, Odyssey had an option for X/Y for light and heavy instead of L1/R1, but in Valhalla the option isn't there and you just have to fiddle with the controls yourself. It can cause some overlapping problems  but it is possible, and that's how I played from start to finish. 

Combat can be pretty fun, Eivor gets enough abilities and options that you are just spamming attack until the other guy dies. Unlike other games, light attacks don't drain stamina and can actually help you rebuild it, making this economy around when to use an ability or a heavy and then take that opportunity to recharge by, I don't know, drinking their blood mid fight or something like some sort of visceral Capri-sun. 

The story missions have a pattern to them, you go around tracking down certain clues or objects, help people, maybe fight a big battle, kill or stop the bad guy, and then go home. Its entirely carried by character interaction and plot hooks. Assaults can be fun, they play almost like a single player version of Breach from For Honor, which makes sense considering the developers and publishers. The most fun I had was tracking down and ganking people that had it coming, but there are also other things like raiding coastal settlements in your long boat and taking on assassination contracts.

Raiding is another side option, where you and your hand picked crew of Viking pals travel to distant shores and kill anyone that had the audacity of living there so you can take their food and PlayStation games. Its a game mode you have to do if you want to get an armor set that's tied to a quest. Raiding is kind of a crummy mode, I'm not entirely sure if settlements respawn supplies on the main map, but I know they do after some time during the actual raiding game mode. 

Other than that, there are a few other modes I can think of from the top of my head. There is a roguelite mode if you're into that, some of the DLC is cool, like the Asgard related stuff. Honestly, the updates are so intertwined with the main game that I sometimes had to look up what I was doing to see if it was vital to the plot. 

What else can I talk about? 

Weapon and armor inventory is a thing again in ACV, but there's less of a focus on making the big number go up. You have this dude in your main camp named Gunnar that can upgrade your gear so you can reinforce it further, so instead of having to find the best gear, you can just play fashion Valhalla and then upgrade what you like. Other than that, there's also transmog, so if you like a sets bonuses but don't like the look, there you go. 

The game takes place in 800s England, this is 400+ years after the withdrawal of the Western Roman Empire from the islands. The Roman culture left behind has degraded over the centuries, giving way to new cultures and the strife that come with it between the Anglo-Saxons, the Britons, Danes, Norse, and everything in between. Roman buildings, walls, and monuments have started to fall apart, and the new nations are building their kingdoms in the ruins of an old empire. Its a neat look, and its a time period I'm particularly interested in.
Other people say its boring, but the English countryside give me an almost nostalgic feeling, like going to the lake with friends, or that time you accidentally slugged a kid with a basketball and had to fist fight half his family. 

Honestly, these games are so weird to me. I have a theory that someone was told to make a contender against the Witcher and Dark Souls 3 (at the time) and had an idea for a quasi-fantasy historical RPG. Then they just slapped the Assassin's Creed label on it later on. Its an odd direction for a series to take and I know there's a big split between the people who like them and the people who dislike them. 

I've only played Odyssey and Valhalla, and I honestly liked both of them a bunch, Odyssey a bit more than Valhalla. But keep in mind, I don't really play modern single-player Ubisoft games, the most recent one before these was Splinter Cell: Blacklist back in 2013. The ubisoft formula hasn't really burned itself into me as much as it might have with other people. But, as a drooling knuckle dragger, I had a blast, and I'm going to miss Eivor a bit the same way I miss Alexios. Its the same feeling you get when you finish a book you like or a TV series you were a fan of ends. You can always go back, but its not the same as it was on your first go.

Assassin's Creed: Valhalla gets a “Too damn long” out of 10.

Human eyes take 30-45 minutes on average to adapt to darkness.

Special thanks to Barry Jack Pleasure for gifting me this game. Its okay, I'll keep your dark secrets.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"2.800+ hrs on record and still playing. What an amazing game! 

- The city of Los Santos is surrounding regions of riddled with fine details and wacky pedestrians. The world is feel so lived in thanks to the fact that there is so much hidden beneath the surface. I mean literally their secrets in the ocean if you're willing to explore them!! ;D Not only that though just hidden corners of the map, woods, mountains, there's always something weird turbine. Now of course the city of Los Santos feels unique and alive. You know with people bustling around, cars, traffic. Typical open world crime game stuff they have a really nice eye for detail down to homeless people sheltering themselves in the Hollywood upper class being themselves. GTA 5 is also unique for pulling up the less populated rural areas and making them feel like people actually live there not just like a boring flat landscape with a few trailers like many other games simply do it. No no no!! ;D By sandy shores in particular. Yes it's mostly trailer parks but with convenience stores, strip malls, parking lots and abandoned buildings. it really makes you feel like a place people exist in and not just a goofy parity. GTA 4 and 5 in particular just feel like convincing real places even if the majority of your interaction with people just blowing them up. 10/10

 - Multiplayer is so fun because it gives a real feel of being able to run around the city and do whatever you want. I think what makes this game work is that it has an incredible sense of immersion in city life. No other driving game or first person shooter that I know of gives you this much freedom. This game can give You a way to have fun!! ;D I like it so much. 

Give it a try. Who knows? You might like it too.

Sadly, it's just not a multiplayer game in it's current state as advertised. The game has server-based quest progression, meaning if 1 person kills a boss/completes a quest, another player is unable to do this and is now behind in quest prog and rewards. Apparently bosses do respawn after a few hours, but it just feels awful for a multiplayer game.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Preface: I do not have thousands, or even hundreds, of hours in The Elder Scrolls Online. There are plenty of reviews from seasoned veterans. I wanted to write this review from the perspective of a new player, because if you're reading this, that's exactly what you'll be. MMORPGs can be a make or break for people within the first dozen or so hours, even less sometimes. I've been playing MMORPGs since 1996; I started with The Realm, advanced to Ultima Online, and I've played World of Warcraft (WoW) for the last 11 years.

If we're going to compare The Elder Scrolls Online to any popular MMORPG of this era, it's most comparable to WoW in almost every single way. That said, it's a very vanilla WoW, hearkening back to the days of old, perhaps only as advanced as The Burning Crusade was (WoW's first expansion); not the new age, cookie cutter, infantile garbage it has turned into. The user interface (UI) is severely lacking, and learning even the basics of the game is incredibly daunting; I found myself struggling hard, especially with the map system, for the first few days that I played. Without add-ons, there's not even a mini-map on the UI, nor is there an experience bar. Be prepared to download a lot of add-ons if you plan on playing this title.

The world of Tamriel itself is ridiculously massive, with tons of exploration opportunities, achievements to unlock, caves to explore, dungeons to pilfer, waypoints (fast travel) to unlock, cities to visit, and an overwhelming amount of quests to complete. Regardless of whether or not you're into Elder Scrolls lore, this entire release is a prequel; so that will interest lore fanatics, and also lead in newcomers to the series. The graphics are excellent, a bit better perhaps than Final Fantasy XIV, and the entire world is beautifully detailed. If you're looking for a game to get lost in with immersion, this is the one. It also helps that every single quest is voice-acted, so there's a very minimal amount of reading for those that skip by reading quests if there's too much text involved. 

It should also be noted that players in this game are friendly, and are usually willing to help newcomers. Dungeon queues are exhaustingly long at times, but I found that requeueing sometimes gets an instant pop, making me wonder if the netcode or matching is bad. You can join up to 5 guilds at one time, and all of your characters will be put into each guild that you join; so you don't have to go out of your way to keep getting invited when you roll alts.

Crowns and the Crown Store are quite possibly the biggest downfall to The Elder Scrolls Online. Now, buying in-game items with real life money is a choice left up to each individual. You can buy mounts, pets, homes, furnishings, and a whole slew of other things, even items that help you level and so on. The thing is, everything is absurdly overpriced. The crown to dollar ratio is roughly 100 Crowns per dollar (at least in CAD), so let's say 1,000 Crowns is $10; doesn't sound like a lot at first, but consider that mounts range from 1,200 ($12) - 3,000 ($30) Crowns, and the nicer homes can go up to a whopping 13,000 Crowns ($130). Suffice it to say, unless your pockets run deep, you will need to give up the idea of attaining all in-game collectibles. Many of the Crown Store offers are also a pressured ""Limited Event"", which makes collectors succumb to non-refundable impulse buys, and none of these items can be unlocked by simply playing the game.

Though beyond the aforestated, many of the in-game mechanics are obviously handicapped to play in favor of making you want to spend your hard earned money in the Crown Store. For instance, mount stamina/speed/capacity; you can pay in-game gold to upgrade one of these three attributes every 20 hours, which will literally take 60 days PER STAT, PER CHARACTER, or you can buy them from the Crown Store in bulks of 10. If you want an XP boost, you have to buy XP scrolls from the Crown Store. If you want your own personal merchant to call upon while out in the wild, it's a whopping $50. Want to be a Werewolf or Vampire? If you can't find someone to bite you, it's $15. The list just goes on and on, and quite honestly it brings the entire experience down. Paying for DLC is cool, mounts yeah okay to a certain point, but when companies start purposefully handicapping in-game content to pressure players to buy upgrades with real money, that's scummy.

While The Elder Scrolls Online is a decently fun MMORPG, something about it lacks the addictive nature of other games of the same genre. The release is going into its second expansion, Summerset, and the level cap is still 50 (since launch), the Warden class came with Morrowind, but no new races have come about; save for the Imperial race, which has to be bought in the Crown Store for $10. That said, it's also a very large game, even just the base title can keep players entertained for thousands of hours through hundreds upon hundreds of quests, dungeons, raids, and world bosses. If you want to get the best experience that you can a monthly subscription will be needed, but it's not required. A monthly sub unlocks all of the DLC, rather than having to pay for it individually with Crowns, you get 1,500 Crowns per month, and a few other things including a separate, infinite resource holding bag for crafting. 

If you can look past the greed of the Crown Store, the lack of addictive gameplay, and the extremely vanilla properties of The Elder Scrolls Online, you may just have fun. It's refreshing to see an MMORPG without cookie cutter builds, and no catering to the masses to provide playability for everyone. It takes time to learn and get used to, right down to the most basic functions. More importantly, the questing is fun, and the world is massive. Prepare for a lot of clicking, though, at least until you get to a high enough level to use only your skills.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"What started out as a review turned into a life story.....Once upon a time...

I was planning on buying The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) base game from an online digital marketplace, then maybe pick up the Morrowind chapter later on ""if"" I could get into it. To my surprise when I went to check it out on Steam it was £9.99 ""WITH"" the Morrowind chapter included in the overall price. A nice little surprise. 
If you do decide to purchase this game I recommend creating an account on:

""account.elderscrollsonline.com""

 first, which you will have to do anyway in order to play the game as it's run through a 3rd party but it's easy enough. Just be aware though the “userid” you choose on the 3rd party site will be the “userid” displayed while you’re in game. 

After I finished downloading the game through Steam I did have a slight issue with the installation... I noticed a few other people who have written a review for this game have also had the same hiccup but it is easily sorted out by ""repairing"" when prompted. Also, another thing to point out, you can play ESO with a controller (I am currently using a wired XBOX controller) if you fancy sitting back and relaxing, while you play on your big T.V then I’d strongly recommend not using KB/M. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as the conventional “plug and play” you do have to enable it in settings-gameplay. Also, like Skyrim you can toggle from first to 3rd person with the touch of a button.

Now on to the best part... The game is truly TRULY beautiful, the colours are vibrant, stand out and feel genuinely warm. The Elder Scrolls Online really does a fantastic job making sure you feel completely immersed in the environment. For me, this is a huge plus! Personally when I am playing a game like this I want to feel like I’m no longer sitting on my sofa, in front of the T.V, I want to feel like I’m actually running around Tamriel, taking in the sights and sounds. This is what I mean when I stipulated I feel “completely immersed” and ESO does a hell of a job creating that escape into that magical fantasy world. 

As crazy as this sounds, one of my favourite things about not only this but every game or movie I play or watch is its soundtrack and wow!! The Elder Scrolls Online is on the money again!! In my humble opinion a great soundtrack can make or break a game. Just look at “The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt” as an example, an amazing soundtrack = amazing game… “ELEX” shit soundtrack= shit game LOL (I know these are just my opinions but you get my point lol). ESO’s soundtrack is really something special... I looked into The Elder Scrolls Online soundtrack and they created it over a few YEARS and honestly it truly is a masterpiece. Amazon’s review has it 4.5/5 stars. It gives you this warm sense of nostalgia as it contains music from Skyrim.

I was racking my brain thinking what game The Elder Scrolls Online reminded me of… I know I'm kinda showing my age a little here but it's a lot like ""Fable 3 crossed with Dragon Age: Inquisition"" with some of the grand designs of some of the buildings and the atmosphere but again this is subjective as it purely my opinion. 

The NPC's really blend in well with the environment and are able to create a truly unique atmosphere. Also, NPC's involved in the quests you partake in look amazing when you’re speaking to them. The body language feels genuine and the words are actually synced with the movement of NPC’s lips plus no crazy facial expressions like “Mass Effect Andromeda” LOL. 


DIFFERENT RACES, FACTIONS & CLASSES

Another aspect I absolutely LOVE about this game is the “freedom of choice” and the “character customisation”. It is head and shoulders above most MMORPG’s on the market today. As far as I’m aware you are able to choose between TEN different races with THREE different factions that looks like this:  

“Ebonheart” Pact Faction Races

Argonian (Reptilian),  Dunmer (Dark Elves),  Nord (Human)

“Aldmeri” Dominion Faction Races

Altmer (High Elves),  Bosmer (Wood Elves),  Khajiit (Feline)

“Daggerfall” Covenant Faction Races

Breton (Human),  Orc (Also known as Corrupted Elves),  Redguard (Human)

Imperials (Human)  I think you have to purchase the “Imperial Edition of the game” to get access to this class and I think Imperials are able to join “any” faction.

CLASSES

Dragon Knight
Nightblade 
Templar
Sorcerer

NOTE
 I was checking out benchmarks on YouTube so I would have a rough idea what kind of FPS I could expect when I ran into something I think 99.9% of novice, semi and pro gamers would be interested in. Check out 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKRnY0YLLbc

on YouTube. The difference between choosing the minimum settings in comparison to the maximum is “Night and Day” TRULY! The textures, terrain, rendering ect are all obviously superior on the highest setting. I personally did the test myself using the R9 390X and can attest & confirm the evidence of the results. As most are aware it obviously depends heavily on what GPU you’re running ESO on but “if” you’re GPU allows you to run ESO on the highest settings I strongly recommend you do as you won’t be disappointed. Also, if you fancy pushing your hardware that little bit further and tweaking your graphical settings to improve your average FPS check this out on google, it’s pretty cool. This is, however, for advanced P.C enthusiasts not novices (No offence intended).

https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/368986/mega-thread-eso-performance-tweaks-fps-improvements-stutter-free-graphics-tweaking

As I stipulated above I'm running ESO on my R9 390X and FX 8350 OC’ed @ 4.5GHz it truly looks AMAZING. It hardly puts any stress on my GPU at all which in my opinion is particularly impressive as my CPU is ancient (6+ years old) is more than likely bottlenecking my GPU. There is no stuttering, lag, tearing ect and my GPU temps are well within the respectable limits.

Honestly, I am struggling to find anything negative about this game... Obviously I am aware that there was a fair amount of problems when the game was initially released back in 2014 but given the amount of time from then to now I think it’s fair to say the patches and updates have done their intended job. One thing I will mention is this game can get REALLY expensive if you let it... True, it’s not a ""Pay to Win"" kinda game in the conventional sense but you do get the feeling with how slowly you acquire gold that it would most definitely be easier to just buy crowns (in-game currency) but that's something you have to search your own soul in deciding if it's worth it.

In my opinion the game is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing and what's more the customisation of your character is also another huge plus. 

Overall Score:
9.6/10 – Amazing!!

One final comment I wish to end with and for me was kind of a make or break, potential deal-breaker was the ESO community… This community, for me is without a doubt the best community I have played online with to date. If you need help and ask 9/10 you get it. An example, I went into a dwarven mine while I was lvl 2 or 3 and kept dying so I asked someone who I had never spoken to before, who was on his/her way out if they could help me. We went back through everywhere they had been before, with me.. So I was able to complete that quest. Proper top draw community!!

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"So Armored Core, never played a game in the series before 6 so I didn't know what to expect. After 100% it, the closest things I've played in my life to it are probably Mech Assault on the original Xbox and Ace Combat on PS2. From what I can recall (been ages since I played them) Armored Core has a similar style, in which the game is mission based and every mission has an objective to complete. Sometimes missions have multiple objectives or it swaps mid mission unexpectedly. Most of these objectives are combat oriented but there's a lot of variety between locations and targets so it never gets dull. Plus a couple other ones have very different goals with a somewhat odd use of the gameplay, so it keeps you guessing what type of stuff you'll have to deal with. One of the toughest challenges in the game is to S rank every mission, and that will surely make you change playstyles and builds for some missions. 

Game structure aside, lets talk about the pillars of the game: gameplay and customisation. First the gameplay, it's quite satisfying and fun. If you've ever watched a movie or an anime where you can't follow the action because the shots are so frantic and the characters move so fast, you'll know exactly what this game has the potential for. Only this time you're not watching, you're living it. I don't think anything else I've played has such a feeling of thrill and chaos as this game. Boosting left and right dodging dozens of missiles, rushing enemies down with the Assault boost and kicking the shit out of them (with a literal kick), tons of bullet/laser/explosion effects all around... You have to play it to truly understand how exhilarating it feels but the gist of the combat is that it's fast paced and very intense. One important mechanic that seems to have gotten added is a stagger threshold, both you and enemies can be staggered and when that happens you take Direct Hits (which deals a lot more damage). Imo it's a bit overtuned and I hope they increase regular damage while lowering stagger buildup a bit, but it works fine as it is. I just think it'd be more balanced that way, so here's hoping it gets adjusted. As for non combat gameplay, there's omnidirectional movement and it's really important to take advantage of that since some attacks can only be avoided by going up in the air for example. I've also gotta mention, your character feels both weighty and smooth to control and there is definitely a learning curve to mastering the movement. The first hour will have you fumbling the controls, while your 10th will have you zipping around effortlessly. 

As for the customisation, there's tons of parts to pick from. I do think there's balance issues but there'll most likely be more updates (at the time of posting new patch rolled out) to smooth them out. Iirc there's 300 or so different parts ranging from weapons to external or internal components of your mech (AC). I beat pretty much the entire game using dual SMGs, the Ludlow model, and the basic Pulse Blade melee weapon. I also added a Songbird when I unlocked it because I liked how strong it felt. Later on I saw everyone and their dog was using it according to internet talk... Finding out it was OP didn't deter me from using it though and it shouldn't for you either. The whole point of the game is to use whatever you feel like. There's no restrictions, even on a mission you're supposed to bring a certain weapon you can simply choose not to (and get berated by the NPCs lol).

Perfect segway into the next point, the characters. How are they? Well I'm sure by now most people know that Fromsoftware have made lots of memorable characters over the years, but even I wasn't expecting how charming the cast of AC6 is. It speaks volumes how people you never see in the flesh and mostly only communicate through briefings, short calls or even voicemails have such distinct and likable (and unlikable) personalities. And even when you do actually see them, well you only see them in their mechs. And quite honestly I find it a bit hard to distinguish their AC's details while in gameplay, the boss fights and Arena are the only places you can take a good look. But anyways going back to the cast, I think they're pretty good since they all have different motivations and allegiances that are fleshed out enough through the 3 different story runs, while still leaving some to imagination. A couple of them I really grew to like over the course of the game, even when in some runs you have to antagonize them. 

The last point I'll talk about (sorry pvp, but I only played a couple matches so I can't form an opinion) is the music. For the most part it feels more like ambient than anything and I'd be lying if I paid much attention to it on my first run. But it's the sort of soundtrack that grows on you. For example some boss themes that I didn't really notice while fighting for my life on the first run I started to really dig on subsequent ones. There's a couple standout tracks that captured me the moment I heard them though, Steel Haze and Cries of Coral in particular are stuck in my head. Made me wish I had gotten the Deluxe edition just for them.

To finish, I just want to say that 100% the game was 99% fun 1% pain. I didn't even get that deep into customizing for example and didn't replay missions other than to get other endings and S ranks so if you really get into it or into the pvp you could potentially get a lot more playtime than I did. As for me though, I miss these types of games. A solid 20h non open world experience that is just well paced and fun throughout. Then double that playtime if you attempt to go for all achievements. Much better than 100h bloated playtime games imo heh.

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"Red dead redemption 2. I don’t know where to begin! First of all the game is a masterpiece and is easily the best story rockstar have produced yet.

Story: the story seems simple enough from the outside but when you play the game you will find yourself immersed in the games amazing storyline and character, as the main protagonist Arthur starts as a brash, arrogant outlaw to an honourable character, and the side story of other missions are phenomenal.

Graphics: This game has easily the best graphics of any game rockstar has produced and arguably some of the best graphics in history.

Combat: the combat is amazingly balanced, as you can take the stealthier approach with knives and tomahawks and a range of melee and throwable weapons, or you can blow up everything in sight, the gun mechanics are amazing, the shooting feels very comfortable and has been polished brilliantly.

NPCs: this is one of the best parts of the game. The npcs generally act in a normal fashion and live out the days of those who lived in that time, it creates an amazing environment that fits the given time period it was set in, you can interact with anyone on the street and create conversations and build a reputation with individuals in the town.

Honour system: This system ranks how honourable you are among citizens and different levels unlock new equipment and perks. My favourite part about this is how cutscenes and the actual finale will change in regard to how honourable you are and even in game characters talk differently about you if you’re more honourable or a lot less honourable.

Conclusion: this game is a must have, it is the perfect game for anyone who loves any type of game because it is so diverse, it doesn’t matter if you like learning about your character or just shooting people, I guarantee you will enjoy this game!","Very Positive91% of the 493,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",masterpiece easily best rockstar produced simple play immersed game amazing storyline protagonist arthur start brash arrogant outlaw honourable side mission phenomenal graphic easily best graphic rockstar produced arguably best graphic history combat combat amazingly balanced stealthier approach knife tomahawk range melee throwable weapon blow sight gun mechanic amazing shooting feel comfortable polished brilliantly npc best part npc generally act normal fashion live day lived creates amazing environment fit given period set interact street conversation build reputation individual town honour rank honourable citizen different level unlock equipment perk favourite cutscenes actual finale regard honourable character talk differently honourable honourable conclusion perfect love type diverse matter learning shooting guarantee enjoy

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"[h1] A good looking mess [/h1]

I love Cyberpunk fiction, the original Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies of all time and I've been always a fan of the theming. When I heard of this back in 2013 it looked like the best thing ever, although even back then I had my doubts about the project, it seemed too ambitious.
I ended up getting this game on sale and while I had fun with it I gotta say that even at 50% off I cant recommend this mess and here's why.

[b]The good[/b]

First I'd like to mention what I enjoy the most about this game and that is the aesthetic. The vehicles, the interiors, the stores, the characters, the clothing, the different city districts, I loved how unique they felt and how well they fit the genre. The game looks great and the Cyberpunk atmosphere is very well done, that's what makes this somewhat unique and makes it stand out. Since the game has such great looking visuals and places I spent a lot of time taking screenshots and using the photo mode, depending on where you're at the game looks phenomenal. That was my favorite part of it, using the photo mode and trying a bunch of different style concepts, managed to create some very nice wallpapers out of it. The photo mode is very robust, letting you switch from 1st to 3rd person, move your character around a bit and even pose for it, I just wanted more focus related options and the ability to switch views during a cut-scene.
Another great thing about this game is the character creator, while it's not the most complex I've ever seen it gets the job done and gives you good enough freedom to create a good looking player or a hideous monster, for an open world game like this it's a great addition.
Some of the characters in the main story can be considered a highlight, I wish we could spend more time with them though, outside of missions.
The progression system is also worth mentioning, there are a considerable amount of perks to buy, a lot of them are useless but it gives you somewhat of a freedom, enough to change some game-play elements, like the gun-play, the stealth, the hacking. Making specific missions easier and a bit different.

[b]The bad[/b]

Ok, so despite having fun with the game I have to say why I can't recommend this mess. The game's all over the place, it [i]feels[/i] very rushed and like it has an ""identity crisis"", that's where most of the problems are. Sometimes the game wants to be a big open world sandbox, other times it wants to be those very story driven scripted ""walking simulators"". 
For the first couple of hours you don't get the scope of how bad things are, probably because the first few missions are HEAVILY scripted, even more than the usual, because of that not many glitches occur. To be honest the entire game's scripted ass hell but the beginning is even worse, like those theme park rides that are on rails. 
The devs market the game as being this awesome RPG where you choices matters with a bunch of different paths, such bull****. They give you the illusion of choice when you start the story, ""lifepaths"", but they literally don't matter, you'll just get a different prologue and some random dialogue choices throughout the game that don't make any significant difference AT ALL. The game's has half a dozen different endings but to get them only a handful of choices you'll make during the story will actually make any difference. The plot has its moments but I found it too linear for what they promised, like I said some of the characters are great, that was the only time I actually gave a s*** about what was going on. Too bad you can't change anything other than the ending.
In reality, it's all smoke and mirrors, at first it seems like the city is great and everything. As you progress you get to see how shallow and pointless it all is, the game doesn't have nearly enough variety to feel alive or make you come back to it. You always see the same cars on the streets, the same npc interaction and most of the side missions are very repetitive. The apartments you buy offer absolutely nothing, somethings you can only do at the starting one. The cars you own you can't even change or choose colors so if you end up buying a very cool car but it comes in brown or something boring there's no way around it. 
The character customization in terms of ""cyberware"" (the implants you use to enhance your character) is very limiting as well, there are a respectable variety of them and they do provide new gameplay features but they don't change anything in terms of looks, for a game that relies so much in aesthetic this is such a wasted opportunity. I wish we had more freedom in that department, like the NPC's with crazy implants and chrome, I want that!
And WHY THE HELL DIDN'T THEY MAKE A 3RD PERSON MODE?? Again, for a game that has so much going on in terms of aesthetic and looks (the only unique thing about this game) they sure got a lot of things wrong. So you customize your character, buy all these different clothes and the only time you get to see it is in the mirror or in the photo mode? I cant wrap my mind around that.

Ohh and the bug, how can I forget them, they're EVERYWHERE. There are all kinds of glitches, visual ones like textures not loading, blurry ads on buildings and some very weird ones , like cars exploding out nowhere, a bunch of npcs reacting with the same looped animation right next to each other, stupid pathfinding, people floating, npcs and vehicles clipping through objects , talking corpses, enemies with 0 health still fighting, the list goes on and on. Those glitches are not rare occurrences, they happen often and I have them all recorded. Fanboys like to claim they haven't encountered any ""game breaking"" bugs and they're not lying, but don't be fooled, while they're not technically ""game breaking"", they're VERY frequent and they come in all shapes and forms. A game that's been in development for such a long time with such high expectations and they couldn't get the basics of an open world, wow!

The marketing campaign they made for this game was a huge deception and the way they paid out early reviews was outright dirty. The devs knew what they were doing and they chose to release this rushed mess anyway, we cant justify it by it's current state, which is still a far cry from what it was advertised as. This game deserves all the hate it got and no matter how great they turn this game in the future it wont erase its tainted story and all the people they deceived into pre-ordering this joke. Nasty things like this in the gaming industry are becoming common and we cant allow this type of behavior.

If you're still trying to play modern games on 8GB RAM with a GTX 960 you're going to have trouble running this game. Minimum specifications means it's going to run, but performance isn't going to be great. My rig meets ""Ideal"" specs and I run on High-End settings (not Ultra) to keep my frame rate from tanking, and it still drops considerably in large cities or areas with lots of players. 

The graphics in this game are simply amazing though, there's no denying it. Last night I completed my first full IFR flight with ILS landing at night. It was amazing.

I would like to see actual radios incorporated with player-controlled ATCs, but that may come in future updates. For now there's an AI ATC that prompts you to respond by pressing a number to select your response. It works, but getting things like clearance to cross a runway are not there.

I've noticed a lot of the COMs frequencies don't exactly match what you'd find in SkyVector. Also, setting up an IFR flight plan doesn't set your NAV frequencies for ILS, even if you select an ILS runway approach, so you have to look them up and set them yourself, which is honestly fine with me. We learn by doing.

All in all I'm looking forward to the future of this game. I'm sure they're going to work out the bugs, autopilot certainly needs some tweaking (it tanked me into the ocean last night). Otherwise I think it's worth the money.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"[h1] Wake up Samurai, we've got expectations to burn [/h1]

I guess I'll pre-face this by saying, I'm not one of the people who religiously followed the production of this game.
My understanding of most negative reviews is: The dev's of this game left a lot of unfulfilled promises in its wake; in part because they had a deadline to meet, one not inherently their choice when you have investors on the line and consumers pushing for a release date. Crunching development hours kills games because of duress, a mistake CD PROJEKT RED has made in the past so honestly y'all should've seen that coming and adjusted your expectations accordingly, but anyway.

I didn't come into this with any of that extra baggage, my standards were metal arms, cool guns and a good story, so take that as you will. I'll tip toe around any spoilers and strike out the ones I can't so safe readin'. 

[b] Things I liked [/b]

[*] Soundtrack fucking slaps, most of it I STILL listen to.

 [*] The modern vernacular used in game/lore really tickles my lizard brain. I get stupidly high spikes of dopamine every time I hear V affectionately refer to someone as choom or threatening someone over eddies. I hate long dialogue sequences with no substance or life to 'em. These ones don't make me mash the skip button and suit the characters hella well.

 [*] Which brings me to the voice acting. VA's did a stellar job. You can really feel the emotions they're trying to project when the story hits its darker points. And trust me it gets fucking DARK. 

 [*]  Now it's not perfect and I hope they expand on a lot of things with free DLC later ; But the story despite its flaws (I'll get to those I promise) is very rich. I love stuff that's not afraid to tackle sadder topics as follows [T:W] [spoiler] Suicide, mental health, addictions of all kinds and the imminent fear of having no time left. Even slipped a hell'va lot of LGBTQ love in there. [/spoiler] I really connected with the main characters and their struggles, I laughed, I cried, the whole shabang.

 [*]  Not everything it was hyped to be admittedly, but character customization kept me content. The drip you can accumulate in game makes up for most of the shortcomings. Stupid as hell you can't change anything cosmetically about V's hair, face, etc after you've locked it in though. 

[*] Combat's fun, not overly complicated. Upgrades are a little simple for my taste given cybernetics is a big theme of the game buuuut.. I've done a few playthroughs by now, both melee's and hacker mostly. Gorilla arms and net-runner is my fave combo. Admittedly I wish there were more animations for finishers regarding melee and assassinations, but hey invulnerability frames are nice. I always had fun ripping open shit to sneak into somewhere if I didn't have the tech lvl to do it less aggressively. Any play-style seems viable which is a good thing in imho.

[*] Lotta content in terms of side quests, collectibles, achievements to grab, etc, etc. Honestly despite how many were evidently rushed, I really did enjoy a lot of the side lore. Night city and its residents really are a colorful bunch and I implore you give running around a go in regards to them; considering I did literally all of them I had a blast.

[*] This game when adjusted via your settings [ugly ass grain unnecessary] is breathtaking. When I tell you I spent so much time just admiring the care and craft put between the lines, I mean it. My folder is crammed with glory shots of V in front of mass chaos or beautiful sunsets and beside iconic characters.
 
[*] I love the HUD a lot not gonna lie, it's super clean now and they really showed some love to the overall system of your inventory, journal, etc with the past few updates. 

[b] Things I didn't like [/b]

 [*]  I played this game the day it dropped, copped the pre-order and by god, it was awful. Might as well have been a field to a swarm of locusts - shit was so buggy. It still is in some regards, walking on fences still insta-kills you out of nowhere, clipping at the wrong angle the same, etc. But is it nearly as bad as before? Nah. Occasionally still debilitating, one side quest in the Badlands for me is perma bugged and has been since launch Spoiler: [spoiler] No Fixers gig, pretty unimportant. BUT essentially Iris tanner either won't get in the car or in the one instance of desperation where I literally inched the car back to Dakota, with Iris Tanner walking behind it the whole way, the game wouldn't register that I brought both of 'em in contradiction to Iris' dialogue prompt thanking me for it. [/spoiler]. But at least my car doesn't bury itself engine first into the asphalt when I park it and explode insta-killing me anymore. If you can stand skyrim level hiccups you'll be fine, just remember to press F5 religiously for quicksaves.

 [*]  I love Keanu fucking Reeves alright, so this is in part forgivable because it's him ; but still fucks with my immersion that Johnny Silverhand has more of an identity and story glued to him than V does. V will mention things about themselves in passing occasionally if you pick the right dialogue, but its so vague and uninteresting compared to Johnny's you'd think he was the main character in all of this. 

[*] Sometimes your choices matter and sometimes they don't. Learn to expect the opposite every time, it's usually the case unfortunately. Now granted some minor plot heavy calls can be made, but the primary story seems set into a select amount of stone. Biggest example of choices not really mattering is the path you choose in the beginning. Corpo-cunt is empowering but seems like the only win all one in terms of dialogue. Street-kid fits the narrative that V spins in what little they disclose about themselves but again mostly changes dialogue not interactions. Nomad is- . . . Eh. More Panam for ya' but s'bout it. 

[*] Romance sucks and it swallows with teeth. Loved every option, especially the flings. But goddamn after your glory moment with each of the main choices, it's hardly impactful. In hindsight I think only 2 of them even make a the teeniest dent in what ending you might get/choose but it ain't much. Spoiler: [spoiler] Really hate the lack of reaction to V giving Johnny the reigns permanently. I would've loved some kind of contention or conflict to spring up and really make you consider this decision carefully. But nope. Empty space hopefully for DLC later. Tying into the lack of contention its kinda funny you can bang everyone in night city and someone like Judy or River just doesn't know somehow?? Cmon. Witcher did something goofy, y'all couldn't slap that here? [/spoiler] 

[*] It's the least of their problems at the moment, so I don't expect it at this point. But multiplayer might've been this games saving grace. At least if you're getting dicked about by bugs with the chooms, its fun vs frustrating.

[b] In conclusion... [/b]
If you want to support the devs, buy it at full price.
Is it currently WORTH full price though?
No. LMAO. I honk my clown nose every time I boot it up because I remember how I hashed out double the pre-order funds to gift this to my s.o as well thinking we'd be able to play together when they released a planned now presumably scrapped concept of multiplayer. 
SO. Get it on sale.
GG deals is a good place to check, I see it on there a lot for like 25-50% off.

Do I still play the game?
A little more every patch, I love watching the glow up, I've never had a problem with games that fall flat on release but aim to fix themselves given time. Plus as previously stated, despite my obvious criticisms, the story's alright. Revisiting the characters never bores me and Johnny has my whole heart. 

All n' all I think with a lot of love, polish and HONEST not CRUEL community feedback - this game will gradually become better. So if you're willing to hold out for better days, buy it at a discount. You'll enjoy the experience more than the majority might make you believe.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"The largest or at least the longest Ubisoft collectathon yet. It does get a bit ""same-y"" after a while, but if you are like me, it's just a fun action game, you play either as stealth or gung-ho head-on (or both for variation).
The story is as ridiculous as always, with twists and turns, betrayals and unlikely friendships.
Lots of side quests and mini games will keep you occupied for many hours.
The environment is a nice change from the sandy desert and mediterranean area, with green hills and forests of England as well as the Norwegian snow and ice.
A lot of different melee weapons can be combined for fun combat.
If you already bought and played the game from Ubidoft/EGS, and have enabled cloudsaves in Ubisoft Connect, you can continue using that save when launching from Steam. DLCs should probably match on both platforms.
An annoyance is that you can't rely on the Ubisoft launcher to keep the session going. As of this writing, you should start Ubisoft Connect seperately, and only then should you launch the game from Steam, otherwise it won't sync the save game.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"This is my first review on a free to play MMO, 

I have to say, for a pixel game, i have to say the controls are super easy, and one of the easiest games to learn to play a game. (Plus some funny NPC (Non Playable Character), Speech bubble texts to joke around with you). 

It was confusing at the start to learn the basics as i played alot of games in the past, this was a breeze for me to learn and understand the direction to go, if you're stuck you can type chat to players that run around doing their own things and ask for help/assistance (Join a Guild to obtain perks and bonuses, Even though at this point you don't get to do Co-op or parting up), it's mainly a single player combat system.

But loads of content and even an AFK feature (Meaning if you log off killing mushroom creatures at level 1) and hop on the next day you will log on and notice your character has been fighting the creatures OR even doing labor work (Chopping tree's/Mining etc) and get rewards for being away!. 

Which to me is great!, Because you can go away from the computer and do things and come back whenever you want too and collect the rewards that lay infront of your character!, 

There are even Classes and secret classes that can be obtain through difficult quest chains. But you can ethier be a Mage (Spellcaster), a Archer OR a Warrior!, and as you further venture on your questing you'll be able to learn Subclasses that relate too the class you've chosen. which unlocks even MORE abilities and upgrades!. Not happy with your skill points you put in? you can just drink a talent reset potion to re-put points into what you want too put in. 

I know this is a long review, i normally do short to the point. BUT this game to me has been and still is one of the best idle games out there. I've played many games and put in over thousands upon thousands of hours into them. but i can see myself spending alot of ACTIVE AFK'ing in this one which is one of the purposes to obtain rarer loot as you would not get when it's turned off!. 

I recommend this game as it's free and small download requirement, and a great learning curve for people who're wanting to give it their first gaming experience! or even Experienced and veteran gamers out there!. 

Thanks for reading my review to whoever reads.

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"First of all, English is not my native language but for practice I'm going to write this review in this lovely language, sorry if you see any mistakes.

I'll try to don't ramble too much even if it's going to be difficult but this game has a lot to talk. Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best game I've played in a long time, even one of the best I've ever played in my short life. It's not perfect, it has faults but it's a really good experience. 

I think Rockstar is the best making open worlds or at least making worlds that feel alive, not just look nice. The world is full of details, you are able to do a lot of things like hunting and fishing and those tasks feel really well made, even if I personally think fishing is boring like look a brick, this accompanied by a technique section really impressive, the textures, animations, lights, smoke, sand, and fog among others just look gorgeous and help the world looks much better. There are landscapes really beautiful out there, getting lost in the forest/dessert/mountains contemplating the nature is a delightful, even the city of Saint Denis in its industrial ""apogee"" it's beautiful, the light effects and fog at night ... are simply speechless. The animation of animals, people, everything help to feel that world alive. Unfortunately, I can pin one of the problems of the game here, the game is poorly optimized. Even if I have the recommended requirements and more, I can't make the game works at a stable 60 fps ( I don't feel many fps drops and it's totally playable ), some graphics option simply doesn't work or work badly. If you have a system that has problems with the minimum requirements I'm not sure if you are going to be able to enjoy properly the game. 

The Story, I think this is the best writing game of Rockstar so far, it's not excellent but really good, maybe a bit rushed in the development of the game, I say that because there are many part of the world that you don't see or experiment with Arthur. It shows a cruel and beautiful world of the pre 19th century. Arthur is such a good protagonist, his develop of character is ... personally one of the best things of the game, He changes like the world around him but, he is not alone, the other characters in the gang are so good writing, other better than other, but you can make a good feeling with those people. Even the secondary characters are good wrote, those you find in secondaries quest or strangers out there. There are decisions in the game but don't change so much at the end, even if there are 4 different finals available.

The gameplay is good, it feels good, the game is full of options, weapons, and stuff, the missions are the big point but, like a good video that I saw on youtube, it seems like Rockstars always wants to take you by the hand, nothing of improvising, we don't do that thing here, don't misinterpret me, the missions are super fun but maybe a bit of player control can help to be more fun.  I feel curious about some control riding the horse, I'm not sure if it is a bug or just a realistic mechanic, it's annoying though, when suddenly the horse run in circles.  

Now I'll talk a bit about the online, if you are going to buy this game thinking this is a Western GTA online, yeah it's something like that but nope. I played some hours it's fun with friends, I personally don't like the pvp component, I think the pve is more fun but that's my opinion. The online feels a bit empty, there are things to do but, not much, also there are many cheaters/modders than it seems Rockstar don't care a bit. The Strongpoint in this game is the campaign, that's all. 

In synthesis or something like that RDR2 is, in my opinion, the best Western open world over there, it's has a delightful world, an adult, cruel and sad  well made story, and an online not so good but fun with a lack of content. I hope Rockstar bet more games like this one. Thank you!

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"On my first day sailing my new captained ship (I named it Maurice), we were fighting a skeleton fleet and we're struggling. We still have enough resources to sink the skelly galleon, but we are definitely struggling as we are playing a sloop (the smallest boat with the least firepower). 

Then, someone came into our ship, saying that he's friendly and wanted to help us defeat the skelly ship since he said we've been struggling a lot. We were wary at first, but there's something about him that made him so trustworthy. It may be because his english is so nice and the way he talks is so friendly and inviting, so we decided to trust him and have him at the helm while the rest of us shoot/repair our ship. The guy came in with a brig, which is stationed on the other side of the skelly ship (also shooting at the skelly ship). 

Long story short, we sunk the galleon, and tons of treasure float on the sea. We haven't seen so much treasure before, so we thanked the brig guys for their help and asked them if they wanted to share some of the spoils. They declined, and asked us to just hook every treasure on our ship.

We then chatted a bit, about how their ship has a glowy red effects on the front. Taught us about factions in the battle for sea of thieves and had us join the opposing faction. Our ship now has a glowy blue effect in the front, and we got really happy since my ship (Maurice) looks so cool now. 

This is the first time I've met such nice people on the game, I thought, as all the people so far have been nothing but hostile to us. All the nice people we've met are either new to the game, or are semi-retired and they're just helping us out because we seemed new. These guys are on a whole 'nother level we thought. 

One last time, we offered them the treasure, at least to share since they deserved it. They have reaper level 5 emissiary too, which would sell really great. The conversation roughly goes something like:
""Look man, thanks a lot for your help, feel free to take any treasure from the ship we're happy to share""
""oh really? I guess I'll take some then. You know what I'll take?""
""What?""
""everything.""

I thought he was joking, I thought that bastard was joking. His friend on the ship started shooting cannons at us. I tried to jokingly negotiate with him, to let us go and we'll drop some treasure for him, but he did not budge. He dropped our anchor, set fire to Maurice, and sunk our ship. We didn't have the chance to fight back, since we're still mentally shocked after they killed us. 

He started shaming us by telling us to take one treasure and swim to the closest outpost, but I know that that's not worth it anymore. Told us to Alt+F4 and instantly rejoin to get all our treasure back. I don't know why I didn't even try to fight back at the time, and for once in my life I felt like a kid who just stepped out into the real world, like a baby who had his lollies taken from him. 

Some of the last words he said to me had burned me until this day: 
""It's Sea of Thieves, man""

Mental crisis aside, game was pretty good 9.5/10. Would appreciate PvE-only mode though

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"I've waited around 5 years for this game to release and i had very low expectations going in, tons of delays accompanied with lack of showcases really made me believe that this game was going to either flop really hard, or not even be released at all. So after spending a good amount of time with the game i can very confidently say that this is the most fun i've had playing a game in a good while. The story is engaging with beautiful cinematics, the combat is fast, fluid and exhilarating.. every character on the roster has a different move set and playstyle which really changes the way you approach each encounter. 

The OST is beautiful and they really incorporated granblue fantasy iconic art style into the world. There are a ton of little easter eggs that gacha players will really appreciate like when you walk around seeing all the duplicate NPC and rackams suicide move to name a few. The roadmap also makes me excited for the future of the game, excited to see faa in action and i can't wait to try out Siete and Song. 

Some improvements i'd love to see:
- Option to automatically hide the HUD outside of combat
- Option to resize HUD, there's a lot of screen clutter 
- Option to tone down effects, the visual vomit can be a little much sometimes

So i've just beaten the game, what happens now?

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Like Battlefield 2 or Project Reality, Hell Let Loose is a First-Person-Shooter wrapped up in a Real-Time-Strategy game that encourages teamwork and active coordination.

Beginners can jump in and get started immediately learning as a member of a small unit. Shoot, move, and communicate. As you explore the game mechanics, you can experience all of the multiple infantry and vehicle roles. Self-graduating to the role of Officer and eventually Commander, is where the RTS aspects skyrocket. 

The most rewarding for me is communicating with, and in some cases convincing, 49 other players to work together with you toward team goals and defeating the equally motivated 50-player adversary team.

Public matches are good, but community arranged events with coordinated battles, pre-arranged squads, well scripted tactical, operational, and strategic battle plans, and coordinated mass movements are truly epic.

The game developers are incredibly interested in community feedback and participation in the development process. I am really looking forward to seeing where the game continues to progress as it powers through early access.","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",battlefield 2 project reality shooter wrapped real strategy encourages teamwork active coordination beginner started immediately learning member small unit shoot move communicate explore mechanic multiple infantry vehicle role self graduating role of_emphasizedficer eventually commander real strategy aspect skyrocket rewarding communicating case convincing 49 player goal defeating equally motivated 50 adversary public match good community arranged event coordinated battle pre arranged squad scripted tactical operational strategic battle plan coordinated mass movement truly epic developer incredibly interested community feedback participation development process forward seeing continues progress power player purchase play official release
1599340,Lost Ark,"After almost 1700 hours in the game I call it quits. Lost Ark is a beautitful game with great combat, unique and fun classes but some systems and mechanics just ruin everything and take all the fun away. I played the endgame and have an army of tier 3 alts but it still doesn't change the basic problems with LA.

I hung in there since launch and I've been close to quitting more times but I really so much wanted the game to be a success but decision after decion out of my reach have reduced those chances little by little until I've reached the point where I am today. No more..I want to find a game where I can have fun and not be so frustrated over one unrewarding system after the other. I don't need another job, I want to relax and have a good time, something that has been less and less of the last months.

The icing on the cake is not AGS/SG's fault but I miss having the community feeling. The type of players it attracts don't seem to have a gamers's heart or be (oldtime) mmo players but just random players who want to play and be rewarded fast without any effort. So while it previously was fun taking my army of alts into hardmode content and Argos and earn a nice amount of gold (at least I felt rewarded for all the time and gold I put into them), completely disappeared with the influx of 1370 from one day to another when the power- and hyperpasses were out at the end of July.
The amount of selfish players who don't care about others, nor their own char or the gameplay just piled up until it started being a nightmare and another job to do those hardmodes. Where I could run a dungeon in 10 min before now takes maybe an hour with repetitive wipes because people can't be bothered to gear up their class with sufficent engravings or spend 2 min on watching a video about the mechanics. They expect however others to do  the work instead. Another fun feature that turned into a bitter chore.

The honing system was always a big thorn in my eyes. I accepted how frustrating it was for some time but after 6 months I'm so tired of being on an emotional rollercoaster over an unrewarding system that only has one purpose: to sour up your game time. The few successes you have cannot cover up for all the times you were utterly frustrated over the amount of mats, gold and time you channelled into this system.

Ability stones  - another awful system where you have to play casino and maybe win. If not you can go – like my friend just did – and spend 35k gold on getting pheons to buy new ability stones because they kept failing. Who in their right mind design a system that only wants to grieve their players? Stones should never cost anything but gold and the 9 pheons we just had from the event feels more like an insult to the face than anything else. Sometimes I even get a suspicion that the playerbase it being tested. How far can AGS/SG go..how much will the playerbase put up with?!

Classes being deliberatedly slow-dripping released  - is another mind buggling decision.
I get it – AGS/SG want to milk the game for as much as they can as long as they can  - but the arrogance behind is that they automatically assume everyone to have been on a super hype about the game right from the get go and expect players to be there for years and hence wait for more classes.
I only got to know LA right before the launch and despite I'm overall quite content with my bard (and other classes that I've played) I would of course have liked to try out the rest of the classes. However there is nothing that speaks for why I should wait around for a year until all classes from other regions are coming to our version.
That AGS/SG are refraining from giving the West all the classes there are in other regions just feels like another punishement or extremely bad planning – no excitement here about it. AGS/SG took that away already. It's just another annoying issue.

If AGS/SG want to earn dollars and euros so badly they should have done their homework better and prepared all the skins from other regions, so they were ready for the western version already from launch but LA West was skin starved and still is. Players have been literally begging for more skins in the cash shop over the months. Tons of opportunities wasted! 

Gold – somehow it seems there is enough of it for every gamer (in tier 3) if you put time and effort into it but those extraordinary limitations like removing gold from rapporting in starting tiers and limits to the amount of chars (currently max 6) who can earn gold seem so controlling and unnecessary. Why punish the players when AGS/SG should find more permanent solutions against botters and RMTers instead? Why take away the few things which could have sweetened up the game for all players, who have to put up with an otherwise very punishing systems. 
Also give me the freedom to level and run as many chars as I please. Let me earn more gold, if I put the time and effort into leveling up the chars.
The direction AGS/SG is taking to solve illegal gaming always involves more limitations and less enjoyment for the normal players these days.

I really don't know what kind of expert team that has been supervising the development of these LA systems but basically the premise in this game is the more the player suffer to achieve anything the better. It's supposed to motivate you. Maybe it works for some but not for me.
Maybe it's a cultural difference between Koreans, Russians and the West but there is no way I feel more fullfillment, excitement or enjoyment in the game  by being exposed to punishing mechanics on a daily basis. It's only aggravating and demotivating.

The game has some sweet features like Sailing, Strongholds, Adventure tome exploring, Rapporting, Mokoko hunting etc. etc. but they are sadly all minor and can't cover up for the big unfullfilling feeling and lack of joy the rest of the game gives you.

I'm sure I'm gonna miss parts of LA and I will keep an eye out for LA over the next year but for now my adventure ends. I've really got my money's worth of it but enough is enough.

So you want to try Destiny 2? I could easily recommend trying the game out to see if it is your cup of tea; just know the free to play is a lie. Nintendo said it best, this game is truly a ""Free to Start"" game, as soon in you will be hit with pay walls for content. This game runs on 3 player and 6 player activities, keep this in mind if you are playing with friends. Now what do you get with Free to play:

[h1]About Bungie[/h1]
When you play a F2P, it is all about the community and the developer, not so much about the game. Bungie has proven themselves to be a worthy developer for this franchise and future ones. They care about their community enough to provide a majority of feedback changes; however they are tone deaf to certain groups in the community. Their focus has definitely shifted from PvP quite a bit since Destiny 1, most of the paid content now is PvE. To be honest a majority plays the PvE so this makes since on the business side. They are completely against gatekeeping, and want all community members to enjoy all aspects of the game. Due to how their development structure is, it can feel like updates aren't arriving in a timely manner to address feedback, which is why the community has so much ire with Bungie.
[h1]The Community[/h1]
Majority of the playerbase for this game are die hard fans of Bungie, and we know what they are capable of, and thus hold them to high standards. Because of this you'll find a majority of the community has a love/hate relationship with the game. Most players are accepting of new players, especially myself I love to show people through their first time with new content and a good majority are. However like any community there is a good portion of the population who are toxic, which has shrunk significantly with the changes Bungie has made. Gatekeeping is one of the biggest topics discussed about the community, and I can say everything you heard is true. 
[h1]The 2%[/h1]
This community has a problem with Gatekeeping content over harsh requirements and generally are xenophobic, primarily at the end-game. The 2% of the community is completely unwilling to teach or have anyone new play the game as they already formed their niches. However this behavior, has been declining massively, I play with the 2% almost regularly and can say this has declined significantly enough that new players should not see this behavior anymore; unless you are unlucky.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Bungie has a large focus on making the game-feel be the best it can be. They love to recycle content, it is kind of their thing, but they like to do it in creative ways to make it feel fresh. If it ain't broke. Most will be turned off by that, but realistically you play a Bungie game for that solid gameplay, and if they added new content that is a nice bonus. They usually take a long time to perfect this game feel, which really hampers their development time considerably. If you been looking for FPSs that ""feel"" great to play, than you came to the right place. However the physics engine is extremely dated, and is due for a massive upgrade; which Bungie is aware of physics issues. 
[h1]My recommendations[/h1]
If you get into this game and decide to purchase any expansion content, I made reviews for each one with the lens of a new player in mind. But if you want my top recommendations, I would say Lightfall or Witch Queen are great start for players, each one however has it's own focus that I'd recommend reading my reviews on. Lightfall for the gameplay, Witch Queen for the Story. 

[h1]Strikes[/h1]
Strikes are pretty mind numbing, which Bungie has realized this and have mixed in seasonal content into the playlist. However it is still possibly one of their most mind numbing experiences, closely tied to patrols
[h1]GM/Nightfalls[/h1]
Do you enjoy dying in 1 hit? Dealing with bullet spongy enemies? Than this mode is just strikes, but beefed up to ridiculous levels. GMs are gatekept heavily by both Bungie, and the community; they are the hardest activity to get into. 
[h1]Patrols/Open World[/h1]
The open world spaces can range heavily, from highly detailed with secrets, to barren wastelands with no content in them. Generally newer content has focused on keeping these areas interesting with more secrets to discover.
[h1]Crucible[/h1]
PvP has improved, however a majority of PvP in this game is making builds that ruin the fun for everyone else, with 1 hit mechanics and other annoying things. However if you are the one dishing it out, it can feel like a power trip. PvP functions similarly to arena shooters with a loadout system, no weapons appear on the map, but they try to emulate that with Heavy ammo spawns.
[h1]Gambit[/h1]
Bungie's red-headed step child game type, a competitive PvE mode. 2 Teams race to kill a boss before the other one does. The mode can be fun, but matchmaking really ruins this gametype if you cannot get good matches.
[h1]Trials[/h1]
This mode is the one you hear streamers talk about the most, the pinnacle PvP activity. This mode is generally full of sweaty try hards who gatekeep the lighthouse from anyone who dares to try to go flawless.
[h1]Iron Banner[/h1]
A timed PvP event, which honestly is when the most creative builds come out for PvP. Iron Banner is definitely an experience that I think every player should try once since it is a time when most players don't try to run ""meta"" loadouts. 
[h1]Dungeons[/h1]
Dungeons are like diet raids, they are full of puzzles that are pretty simple to comprehend and are limited to 3 players. They can give you a taste of what end-game content is like.
[h1]Raids[/h1]
The pinnacle of end-game, not as hard as other games that have ""Raid-like"" events. Each raid plays differently, I usually compare raids to playing a custom game in Halo 3, as it has the same kind of feel as one. Bungie keeps their raids relatively simple to comprehend, however they are challenging, and I recommend any new player try to do one at least once; with a team that wants to teach.

[h1]The verdict[/h1]
Since this game is ""F2P"" I can easily recommend that you try it out and see if you like it first, what do you have to lose? I can recommend Destiny 2 to anyone who is looking for a FPS game to pass time or are tired of playing shooters that just don't feel right. As Bungie continues to curate content to remove the gatekeeping from the game, I hope to see that 2% go up even higher as new talent try this game, and decide they are up for the challenge.","Very Positive80% of the 583,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_free play easily recommend trying cup tea play lie nintendo best truly soon pay wall run 3 6 activity mind friend play 7 open world space 3 versus environment mode 1 competitive versus environment 3 versus mode versus event raid 1 dungeon rotator change daily bungie play play community developer not_so bungie proven worthy developer franchise future one care community provide majority feedback change tone deaf certain group community focus definitely shifted versus bit 1 paid versus environment honest majority play versus environment make business side completely gatekeeping community member enjoy aspect due development structure update arriving timely manner address feedback community ire bungie community majority playerbase die hard fan bungie capable hold high standard majority community love hate relationship player accepting player especially love good majority community good portion population behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner shrunk significantly change bungie gatekeeping biggest topic discussed community heard community problem gatekeeping harsh requirement generally xenophobic primarily community completely unwilling teach play already formed niche behavior declining massively play regularly declined significantly player not_see behavior anymore unless unlucky bungie large focus best love recycle kind creative way fresh broke turned realistically play bungie solid nice bonus usually long perfect hamper development considerably fps great play physic engine extremely dated due massive upgrade bungie aware physic issue recommendation decide purchase major addition add feature mechanic review lens mind top recommendation lightfall witch queen great player focus recommend reading review lightfall witch queen strike strike pretty mind numbing bungie realized mixed seasonal playlist possibly mind numbing experience closely tied patrol gm nightfall enjoy dying 1 dealing bullet spongy enemy mode strike beefed ridiculous level gm gatekept heavily bungie community hardest activity patrol open world open world space range heavily highly detailed secret barren wasteland no_content generally newer focused keeping area interesting secret discover crucible versus improved majority versus build ruin fun else 1 mechanic annoying thing dishing power trip versus function arena shooter loadout no_weapons appear emulate heavy ammo spawn gambit bungie red headed child type competitive versus environment mode team race kill bos mode fun matchmaking ruin gametype cannot_get good match trial mode hear streamer talk pinnacle versus activity mode generally sweaty hards gatekeep lighthouse dare flawless iron banner timed versus event honestly creative build versus iron banner definitely player t_emphasizedry effective popular strategy character build loadouts dungeon dungeon diet raid puzzle pretty simple comprehend limited 3 player taste raid pinnacle not_as hard game large group player tackling difficult challenge event large group player tackling difficult challenge play differently usually compare raid custom halo 3 kind bungie keep raid relatively simple comprehend challenging recommend want teach verdict play easily recommend lose recommend shooter pas tired shooter bungie continues curate remove gatekeeping hope higher talent decide challenge

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"Well, where to start?
First: Warzone, started to get bad when they changed the game map, leaving it worse than it was at the beginning of it, but it still had fun gameplay and few bugs, in addition to being optimized in a much more decent way than the original. current.
Second: The previous game started with skin trends, which was cool, because in the first game, the skins were well done and fun, for the most part, the weapons chosen for the skins were weapons that were actually usable and didn't have as many Pro Team packages.
Third: The weapons in the game really had correct damage, compared to this one, in the first warzone, you created the class with that weapon and it killed, today you create the class, one hour it kills, another time, it seems that it only shoots beans , it doesn't even kill a chicken, the weapon categories are unbalanced, the players' vests have become infinite, unless you get one of the crappy weapons that are practically insta kill, but not usable in practical terms for the game.
Fourth: the previous game had problems with cheaters, yes it did, however, there you saw the anti-cheat system working, in this one, in addition to the game being infested with cheaters, if you report it, you can end up being banned for ""false report"" , that is, the developer itself does this so that no one else reports the suspects, so as not to have the trouble to keep checking, at least that's what it looks like.
Fifth: Many, like me, spent a lot of money on skins, etc, on the other game, and what does the developer do? Throw everything in the trash, if you want something, buy it again in the current game, so far so good, it's the market, they have to make money, etc, so make decent skins, same complaint as in the second topic...
Sixth: Are we playing COD, or are we playing Fortnite, or something like that? Call of Duty is a franchise that I've been playing since 2003, having paused only in the futuristic era of the game, because in my opinion, it was horrible, and coming back in 2017 when they released COD WWII, which was bad too, but better than the futurists, now in this COD, even characters with superpowers have it, if those weapons that kill you and turn you into pieces, into lightning, explode you etc, now you have to deal with flying characters and the like, I'm sorry to say, but this game that in theory it was supposed to be for people over 18, this is becoming a game for people under 12, it just needs to cartoonize the scenario and you can now call it Call of Fortnite.
Finally, the game has serious optimization problems, it has many cheaters, many grotesque bugs, it is not fun like the previous one, the store has practically nothing decent, the devs in each update, which in theory was to improve the game, do the opposite and they shit on everything that ""worked"", the map is not bad, but it is not good enough like the first warzone, and the worst the DEVs do not decide which game mode to leave, each week or even in the same week , the game has a different mode and for those who play in a duo, they usually just get screwed. Play at your own risk, I don't recommend.","Mostly Negative32% of the 30,364 user reviews for this game are positive.",warzone started bad changed leaving worse beginning fun bug addition optimized decent original started skin trend cool skin fun weapon chosen skin weapon usable highly skilled experienced package third weapon correct damage compared warzone created class weapon killed today class kill shoot bean kill chicken weapon category unbalanced player vest infinite unless crappy weapon practically insta kill not_usable practical term fourth problem cheater yes saw anti cheat working addition infested cheater report banned false report developer no_one else report suspect not_to trouble checking look fifth spent skin developer throw trash far good market decent skin complaint topic sixth cod fortnite duty franchise 2003 paused futuristic era horrible 2017 released cod wwii bad futurist cod character superpower weapon kill turn piece lightning explode deal flying character theory supposed 18 12 need cartoonize scenario fortnite finally serious optimization problem cheater grotesque bug not_fun practically decent theory improve opposite shit worked not_bad not_good warzone worst not_decide mode leave week week different mode play duo usually screwed play risk recommend

1203620,Enshrouded,"My Short EA Release Review
Overall Grade: 55/100

Gameplay Mechanics: 4/10
- The game's controls feel a bit off at times, parrying can be very finicky, and often while jumping in combat, the jump won't happen
- Survival mechanics are bare bones, bordering on non existent
- The game does not balance challenge and accessibility, the game is so incredibly easy that it actually makes me dread fulfilling multiple gameplay systems due to boredom

World Design: 8/10
- The world is extremely immersive, and looks amazing, with some exceptions such as the voxel terrain often displaying extremely flat or cubed surfaces, such as a lava pool I discovered that was literally a cube the size of a building
- There is a nice variety of environments, each feeling unique, with the shroud (obviously) being the most noticeably eye catching
- The world encourages exploration well through many locations and landmarks to visit, along with many quest markers, unfortunately the rewards for visiting these locations is often a large let down

Resource Management: 5/10
- Resource management is not particularly difficult, compounded by the ease of many fast travel points
- Resource gathering can be very fun or very tedious, depending on location and source
- There is not much sense of pride I get in managing my resources in this game, which I usually get in other survival games, not sure what the cause is

Enemy AI and Threats: 2/10
- The enemies are so incredibly easy, that if they were changed into passive mobs, it would genuinely be difficult to notice
- There is absolutely zero sense of danger or urgency (outside of fall damage, I have died so many times to broken legs)
- There is no balance between passive and aggressive threats, as aggressive threats border on non existent

Graphics and Atmosphere: 8/10
- The game looks great, not hyper realistic, but what it is going for works
- The atmosphere of the game world really makes you feel like the world is yours to conquer, if only there was anything challenging inside it to conquer
- Day/night cycles are average, nothing to write home about, doesn't increase difficulty in terms of threats, but night is so dark it can get kinda spooky

Story and Lore: 5/10
- The narrative and backstory is average, nothing groundbreaking or particularly unique
- The story doesn't really mix with the survival aspects at all, feels quite disjointed, if the story was removed, the game would feel exactly the same
- Some bits of lore are intriguing, but the vast majority is easily skippable

Multiplayer and Social Interaction: 7/10
- Honestly it is a pretty bad coop game, largely due to the fact that combat, the main driving force of coop in survival games, is boring beyond belief, building is really the only thing worth doing with friends
- Coop with friends adds nothing to gameplay, other than having someone else to mock the game's combat with you
- It is appreciated that characters can be transferred across servers with little penalty, as it allows you to play solo when your friends are away, and coop when they're back, all on one character file

Technical Performance: 8/10
- Haven't run into any performance issues as of yet, but it must be noted I am playing on a powerful rig
- I have only come across a few bugs, one of which requiring a manual restart
- Game seems well optimized, but again, hard to tell on a powerful rig

Longevity and Replayability: 4/10
- There is a vast world to explore, but given that it is not procedurely generated, and instead handcrafted, while uniquely beautiful because of this, you will be discovering the same things on a replay
- There is no system in place to encourage any sense of replay value
- Combat is currently the driving force in any lack of motivation to replay this game once I complete it

Innovation and Uniqueness: 4/10
- The shroud is a somewhat unique concept in it's implementation, but aside from that, not much else stands out
- This game is quite strikingly just BotW but with voxel
- This game seems to lack innovation outside of it's great building mechanics, and unfortunately I do not see a way to course correct in this area as any change required would fundamentally change what the game has set itself as","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",short ea release grade 55 100 mechanic 4 10 control bit time parrying finicky jumping combat happen survival mechanic bare bone bordering non existent not_balance challenge accessibility incredibly easy make dread fulfilling multiple system due boredom world design 8 10 world extremely immersive look amazing exception voxel terrain displaying extremely flat cubed surface lava pool discovered literally cube size building nice variety environment feeling unique shroud obviously noticeably eye catching world encourages exploration location landmark visit along task objective given non marker unfortunately reward visiting location large resource management 5 10 resource management not_particularly difficult compounded ease fast travel point resource gathering fun tedious depending location source not_much sense pride managing resource usually survival game not_sure cause enemy ai threat 2 10 enemy incredibly easy changed passive mob genuinely difficult notice zero sense danger urgency fall damage died time broken leg no_balance passive aggressive threat aggressive threat border non existent graphic atmosphere 8 10 look great not_hyper realistic work atmosphere world make world conquer challenging inside conquer night cycle average write home increase difficulty term threat night dark kinda spooky lore 5 10 narrative backstory average groundbreaking unique mix survival aspect feel disjointed removed exactly bit lore intriguing vast majority easily skippable mode multiple player interact compete real social interaction 7 10 honestly pretty bad coop largely due combat driving force coop survival game boring belief building worth friend coop friend add someone else mock combat appreciated character transferred across server penalty allows play solo friend coop on_emphasizede file technical performance 8 10 performance issue noted powerful rig across bug requiring manual restart optimized hard powerful rig longevity replayability 4 10 vast world explore given not_procedurely generated handcrafted uniquely beautiful discovering thing replay no_system encourage sense replay value combat currently driving force lack motivation replay complete innovation uniqueness 4 10 shroud somewhat unique concept implementation aside not_much else stand strikingly botw voxel lack innovation great building mechanic unfortunately not_see course correct required fundamentally set

Pros
* Premium currency system is probably the fairest i've ever seen, earnable in game, either through the base progression system (warbonds) or found randomly in maps. worth noting too that the store armors aren't even remotely expensive, costing the equivalency of 2$ in the premium currency if you bought it
* bug blasting is fun
* If you get bored of bug blastin you can swap to shootin terminators, completeing changing the game
* nice in depth weapon/orbital assistance call in system + different armors+different guns makes loadout styles feel nice and varied
* global progress in the war against bugs make you really feel like your doing your part, liberating .0002% of a planet per mission. Im doing my part! 
*Each mission feels extremely varied due to differenet objectives/map layouts
*Difficulty scales up in a super fun, challenging way (enemies dont scale up in health, but new special enemies are introduced and you'll fight more of them)

Madden NFL 24 Superstar Mode Review: A Missed Opportunity in Football's Virtual Spotlight

Madden NFL 24's Superstar mode makes a return, but falls short of expectations, leaving fans yearning for more from this cherished feature.

Pros:

Reintroduction of Superstar Mode:
It's a positive move to bring back Superstar mode, catering to fans who enjoyed it in previous iterations. The familiarity is a welcome sight for long-time enthusiasts of the franchise.

Cons:

Lackluster Storyline:
The mode disappoints in terms of narrative depth and meaningful choice dialogs, resulting in a less engaging experience. The potential for a compelling story arc is left largely untapped.

Repetitiveness Takes Its Toll:
Repetitive elements within the mode diminish its enjoyability, making it feel like a chore rather than an engaging experience. Players find themselves in a loop, craving more variety and unpredictability.

Stagnant Commentary:
The recycled announcer lines contribute to a sense of staleness, highlighting a need for more dynamic and varied commentary. A fresh perspective on commentary would greatly enhance immersion.

Untapped Potential:
Madden NFL 24's Superstar mode could benefit from a more ambitious approach, akin to NBA 2K's open-world concept, offering greater player interaction and customization options. A deeper level of engagement and personalization is sorely missed.

Need for Innovation:
There's a call for a fresh perspective in the development team to infuse new life into this mode, as the current iteration lacks the spark needed to captivate players. Innovative ideas and execution are needed to breathe vitality into this once-vibrant mode.

Conclusion:
Madden NFL 24's Superstar mode feels like a missed opportunity in football's virtual spotlight. While it's positive that the mode has returned, the lackluster storyline, repetitiveness, and stagnant commentary leave much to be desired. There's a clear need for more innovation and ambition in the development process to elevate this mode to its full potential and reignite the excitement it once generated among players.

Some other things i forgot to mention. The way to earn Cred or XP is just down right stupid. That's where the repetitive comes into play. The training's never changes and are just down right boring and stupid and has nothing to do with football. Why would i want to throw at a target instead of a real receiver or defense to help me get better at reading the defense and what not. The combine is decent. Would've liked more little mini games.","Mixed43% of the 5,008 user reviews for this game are positive.",mode disagree care not_worth 76 superstar mode missed opportunity football virtual spotlight s_emphasizeduperstar mode make fall short expectation leaving fan yearning cherished pro reintroduction superstar mode positive move bring superstar mode catering fan enjoyed iteration familiarity welcome sight long enthusiast franchise con lackluster storyline mode disappoints term narrative depth meaningful choice dialog resulting engaging potential compelling arc left largely untapped repetitiveness take toll repetitive element mode diminish enjoyability chore rather engaging player loop craving variety unpredictability stagnant commentary recycled announcer line contribute sense staleness highlighting dynamic varied commentary fresh perspective commentary greatly enhance immersion untapped potential s_emphasizeduperstar mode benefit ambitious approach akin nba 2k open world concept offering greater interaction customization option deeper engagement personalization sorely missed innovation call fresh perspective development infuse life mode iteration lack spark needed captivate player innovative idea execution needed breathe vitality vibrant mode conclusion s_emphasizeduperstar mode feel missed opportunity football virtual spotlight positive mode returned lackluster storyline repetitiveness stagnant commentary leave desired clear innovation ambition development process elevate mode potential reignite excitement generated player thing forgot mention earn cred xp stupid repetitive come play training never_changes boring stupid football throw target real receiver defense help reading defense not_the combine decent liked mini game

Generally speaking the game is filled with helpful folks that will help you out as you learn the ropes. That said, the first 50 levels are a pain to get through due to how bland the story is. It doesn't pick up really until you're in the Heavensward expansion pack. From there, it's all uphill. The story takes off into a sprint and the combat jobs also start getting alot more fun to play. And if combat isn't your thing, don't worry. There's quite an active RP community for all types, and crafting is farm more involved than simply pushing a button. What you make can be considered garbage or useful all depending on the skills you use in making it. And the best part? You don't have to roll a new character to try a different thing.

1144200,Ready or Not,"Okay so let me start by saying that this game is not for everyone. If you expect a fast-paced shooter like Rainbow Six Siege then this game is the opposite of what you are likely looking for.

For people that enjoy intense tactical gameplay and slow-paced thought-through approaches this is one of the only games that comes close to what the SWAT series offered.

No sprint! (You can lower your weapon to move a bit faster but you can't just Leroy around)

Man I love that. Not being able to sprint makes the game so much more smooth to play in random groups. Everything takes a bit of time and you can think how you stack up and breach. 

Noone can really go Rambo and the ones that try it are send back to the spectator screen within seconds.

Gadgets are currently limited in choice but present the foundation of what you need. 

You got Gas and Flash Grenades as well as another LTL-Grenade named ""Stinger"". 

Breaching can be done by means of Explosives. Battering Rams, Breaching shotguns or just old-school kicking the doors down. You can also use door wedges to block off escape routes or entry points.

Equipment wise there are NVG, ballistic vests and helmets as well as gas masks and flash resistant masks.

Weapon selection isn't half bad with a few Assault Rifles, Shotguns and MP's to choose from with different sidearms to go with them. You also have LTL options like a pepper ball gun, bean bag shotgun and a taser as pistol gadget.

Map design is different and challenging while some are more detailed than others you can already see quite some attention to detail in the ""first"" level while others still lack a bit of ""life"" which the Dev's already commented on is getting added but they wanted some levels ready to be played with.

Each level comes with different scenarios, you need to follow general RoE and it's really tense trying to get everyone (including the gunman) out alive.

The game also adds some information that makes you want to take the shooters into custody like telling you that the shooters at the gas station are juvenile and the robbery went wrong.

It really hits the spot with tight and incredibly short firefights that are over within a couple seconds where 90% of the mission is spend going around, using every tool you have to avoid direct confrontation and you get rewarded for it accordingly. 

For it being an EA title I can only recommend this game for people that are looking for a slow tactical shooter like SWAT 4.

 (Which is really cheap to grab right now for only around 5€, just keep in mind that SWAT 4 is from 2005 and looks and plays accordingly. But it gives you a really good indication of what RoN will feel like, although RoN is much more unforgiving in reaction times. So if you are unsure if you want to invest into this game then go ahead and try this first.)

The game of course needs some more work to be done in terms of AI behaviour and some more levels / scenarios but if this is the first playable build in EA and we see regular updates after the holidays this game could become a true marvel of it's genre.

+ Movement is something else! It may begin to do a number on your pinky finger but once you get a hang of the moment controls, this is possibly the best platforming I've seen in a third-person shooter. High octane, to the point where sometimes I feel I'm getting motion sickness.
+ You can farm Prime parts to sell for Platinum, the ""premium"" currency, which means that, with some patience, you can actually get by in this game without spending a single penny of real-world money.
+ Most items have a ton of customization options ASIDE from the ability to recolor which you get from the very start without having a spend anything. Warframes? Recolorable! Weapons? Recolorable! Your own SPACESHIP?! YES! Recolor away! Pets, sadly, are a biiiiit harder to recolor, I think.
+ Very, VERY well-optimized. I play this game butter-smooth on my ages-old PC and wouldn't be surprised if it worked on my aging laptop.

CONS
- Very, very grindy. If you just craft a Warframe, it literally takes days (72 hours) before your frame is finished being made.
- You can... actually kinda follow the development as you progress through the game. Production value shoots up as you progress, showing that later content.Earth through Uranus feels very... ""samey"", where you're just progressing from node to node, junction to junction, and it will test your patience. Uranus/Neptune and above, though? You begin to actually get PROPER quests. With cinematics and everything. However, the game takes too long getting here... I feel that's why they plopped Cetus and Fortuna where they are now, to give new players a break from the node-to-node slog and overall content drought.
- Terrible customer support.
- There is very little info on how to progress past Uranus. So heed my words, when you hear odd sounds in Uranus sealab words... GET YOUR SCANNER OUT AND SCAN THE NOODLE MONSTERS!

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"[TL;DR - Strongly recommended at full price; other than some minor bugs, there are a bunch of companies who need as big of a kick in the pants as this is]

I never played Imperator: Rome and didn't hear good things, but I was underwhelmed when Crusader Kings III was announced.  I thought II was a really interesting concept but was really confusing for me to actually play; I thought Stellaris' game design was too simple in the same way a lot of people didn't like Fallout 4 (I think Stellaris would almost have made a genuinely great party game), and I figured this was going to be yet another Paradox DLC farm.

After a friend got this game near launch, I bought it on the spur of the moment and fell in love.  My biggest criticism of Crusader Kings 2 — I've already put many times its total hours into 3 — was not that it had a lot of information but that I had a hard and often overwhelming time finding it.  This game's menu interface, while noticeably imperfect and still with a lot of hidden pieces it's all too subtle about (I'm still finding new things hundreds of hours in) feels by comparison much easier and cleaner to use, which was probably the single biggest obstacle I'd had to enjoying the game.  II's tutorial was not only rather shallow but so buggy I couldn't finish it.  III's, which takes you through conquering Ireland step by step and is the game's closest thing to a standard campaign, doesn't have either problem except for a minor money bug and feels like a much gentler introduction to a very deep strategy game than was going on YouTube to learn how to play II (which is still an option here and is even welcomed in the main menu).  As a heads-up for streamers or the squeamish, the sexual overtones and depictions of disease, some of them truly terrifying like the bubonic plague, and war injuries are a lot more blatant here than they were in II, though the most extreme aspects of both can be disabled in the game options.

For those who didn't play II despite it now being free, imagine Risk but with Toy Story's or The Sims' premise, with thousands of pieces who are alive and have their own ambitions, personalities, relationships, and lifespans.  You play as a specific ruler whose decisions and influences impact your realm and others', from deciding how and by whom your children will be raised; to deciding where and with what excuse war will be declared (earning or faking those excuses normally takes a long time, which will still turn a lot of players away); to managing relationships with your vassals that might one day turn them against you.  The game takes place over a much larger scale, from Iceland to northern Africa to what is now Myanmar, than II did out of the box.  I love being able to play as my native India without needing to buy DLC, and the world map is now so large that entire crusades might pass by without your noticing.  Most of your interaction is through a complicated series of menus, but the results and consequences feel a lot more deeply personal than just being a standard bird's-eye war game.  Characters are identified through a combination of mix-and-match personality facets; aptitude stats across many categories from diplomacy to army management, each with their own subdivisions of skill trees; and traits that affect a person's health, abilities, and popular reputation.  Every character in the game has a religion, whether conservative or eccentric, and you can heavily customize what yours believes.

From a design perspective, this is my favorite implementation of religion that I've ever seen in a game.  Stellaris started its matches with a culture designer that was fascinating but felt too front-loaded, and Crusader Kings III's religion system works similarly except you have to earn it through a really specific style of gameplay.  Along with gold, you also juggle Prestige (how famous are you, even if other people might not individually like you; you use this to declare secular wars), Piety (religious reputation), and Renown (family esteem; you use this to buy savegame-wide perks but also to prevent unwanted successions).  Gold and Renown can be passed down to your heir; fame and piety cannot.  Piety, and you will need a lot even with specific discounts, can be used for reforming religions and making new sects, from major details like the morality of warfare to smaller details like whether your clergy and lineage are gender-restricted.  A lot of modern cultural freedoms (homosexuality, fornication) get placed in an interesting light when it's sometimes in your best interest to have your people act in a very specific way or put them in jail.  Your actual ""Culture"" (French, Greek, etc.) is basically just a tech checklist, divided up into chronological eras so you can't just rush end-game tech, but being able to change your culture through rare events leads to some really interesting loopholes that would unbalance the game if they didn't take so much work.

The Stress system, which penalizes you with health and stat restrictions for playing in ways that contradict your character's on-paper personality, makes for really interesting role-playing since it can penalize you in ways that narrative-driven games can't get away with (imagine BioShock if refusing to harvest Little Sisters could cause you to ADAM-starve to death).  You can influence which traits your children pick if you're the one raising them (you often have to delegate this), and thankfully the game generally doesn't have your children rebel against your choices unless you had no say in them.  Thanks to an update, there's also a nifty Dungeons & Dragons-like character designer that lets you pick your own traits, religion, and starting stats, with certain limitations if you care about achievements (by and large worth doing even as some are really difficult or luck-based), though purists can ignore this.  If you're new, make sure to turn on Ironman Mode, which auto-saves the game and disables save-scumming.

I didn't understand II's combat system, but I got the impression something interesting was there.  Stellaris' combat felt too simple by comparison except for the awesome spaceship designer, and while III's combat also feels simple (click your army on an enemy's and see which one dies first), the rest of the game makes getting to that point a lot more interesting.  Note that unlike in II, you can choose to spawn your entire military in one place instead of having it realistically coalesce and be vulnerable to having individual portions gobbled up, which is balanced out by armies sometimes taking a really long time to spawn in depending on circumstances.  Along with your thousands of peasant soldiers, you can also recruit a variety of units (bowmen, cavalry, etc.) with a basic system of strengths and weaknesses that also takes terrain into account, which you can mix with siege units for taking forts.

Most of the game's mechanics are really simple, usually clicking a button or watching a timer expire, but even if you'll see a lot of the same events through the generations and across campaigns (albeit with cultural and religious variations), there's still a ton of variety that a lot of games don't come close to approaching.  If you're unsure about the whole concept, I'd still watch a few videos since this isn't going to appeal to everyone, but if you wanted something more complex than Stellaris but more clearly designed than Crusader Kings II, this is a very welcome surprise.

Dark Souls 3 is probably my favorite Souls so far when it comes to gameplay. Combat is fast (not as Bloodborne, but just enough to make things more interesting), fluid and thrilling. Enemies are faster, more aggressive and smarter, too. This time, you have Weapon Arts, which are different skills and movesets for several weapons in the game, that when used, consume Focus Points.

Core Game is focus intensive resource management industrial revolution based city builder. Most of game focuses around trade and supply chains over multiple islands and regions. Combat is limited to Naval and Airship warfare on a mostly simplistic basis. Core game has a steep learning curve and takes easily dozens of hours to master. Visually beautiful but system resource intensive, will eat most systems with less than 16Gb of RAM late game. Game gets very crash happy with mods and has trouble launching from Steam on many Windows 11 systems. Can launch manually from game folder at least. For a game that is four years old it has more issues than solutions and steam is unwiliing or unable to fix this as of this writing. Steam support will not refund after two hours of play though learning the basic mechanics of the game takes around 10 hours. Overall this game is only for those that know they want this style of gameplay. I would recommend casual players to stay away from this title.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"TLDR: 8/10 Recommended. (If you haven't bought it yet, wait till Feb or March for the main patches)

EDIT: I get a lot pf people are quite ""passionate"" about this game. Reading the comments with my friends has become a great pastime. Here is my take. Yes it might not have met ALL your expectations, but this game ain't bad by any means. Hell it did not murder your family, or commit war-crimes in the middle-east. 

In all seriousness, my dad always used to say, that the Biggest Room in the world is the room for Improvement. Give it a chance. Maybe not now. Maybe someday. But do give the devs and the community a chance. Keep it civil folks. 

BACK TO MY DOGSHIT REVIEW (why is it one of the top ones? It ain't helpful by any means -_- ) :

117 hrs in, finally got through the main story and everything around. (Street Kid, Male V. Ended at Lvl 42 SC 50). 

Going to be honest, is the game buggy? YES. Is the AI absolutely whack? Yes Again. Performance? As of v1.05, quite improved but driving fast around the city, especially around your home can give a performance hit.  

But the story? It is worth every penny. It is worth experiencing. Keanu's performance isn't top-notch but it is enough to get you engrossed, keep you in. Plus, well its Keanu. Whoever did V has done a stellar job. The side characters, and their quests are a delight. 

Gunplay is a hit or miss. Enemies feel a tad spongy at the start to AR's while Handcannons and their tree is overpowered. And with the right mods, a single Overture or Crash shot going up 80K in a single HS crit damage. By the end, with legendaries, Enemies, bosses become a joke on hard. The netrunning and berserk are quite fun, and give stealth or an all out approach a variety of possibilities. 

Mantis Blades are a must and combined with double jump, are quite fun. Meanwhile Gorilla arms have their use only in fistfight brawls. Projectiles and Monowire are good, but Mantis Blades are just that good. Pretty sure you look like a cyberpsycho gone rogue, but hey, it is fun.

And Night City. What can you say about it, that hasn't been said. What a creation. The world design, from the badlands to heywood, it is gorgeous. You will absolutely love it. The Soundtrack is just perfect, whether you are driving with Royal Blue, Vexelstorm on the radio. 

Overall, this an extraordinarily beautiful mess. AI and the NPC interaction leave a lot to be desired, but the foundational NC is exceptional. The main story is amazing and side quests are top-notch. Recommended for the story. 8/10 with the hope that mods and patches bring Night City and the Story the credit they belong.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"So I wanted to write a review about Helldivers 2 after playing for 8 hours and sleeping on it.

TL;DR; good game, bad progression caused by MTX. Would recommend picking it up on 50% discount if changes to  progression are made.

The game itself is fun. As in the core gameplay of dropping on the map with a team, completing objectives and killing enemies and then extracting. Objectives are pretty varied (although most of them are from Helldivers 1) and so are the enemy  types. Besides there are different planets with different weather conditions, time of day and different effects, such as “slower weapon firing rate” or “or obscured vision because the is a giant flying bug creature that you can kill”.  So far I’ve been fighting only bugs, btw. Didn`t feel like moving to robot planets yet. There are 2 factions at the moment, but they might add another one since the first game has 3.
Oh yeah there is also a kernal 

However, despite being positive on the matter of core gameplay, progression leaves a lot to be desired.
Helldivers 1 had a very simple progression system: You level up, get weapons and skills, complete Planets(missions) to get new stratagems(essentially those are airstrikes, heavy weapons, and other types of support you call in when on mission) and while on mission you collect samples. Once you collect ten samples you get 1 research point that you can use to upgrade weapons and stratagems. The cost of upgrade varies from 1-5 research points. You can also get various cosmetic items like armor and capes for completing highest difficulty planet. The armor, mind you, was purely cosmetic.

Now in Helldivers 2 things get complicated.
Stratagems are locked behind levels and requisition points. You get requisition points by completing main and side mission objectives and you have a chance of finding them at POI on the map during a match. So you get a pretty stable flow from every mission.
Stratagems are upgraded by spending samples which there are three types now. No more requisition points. You must find them on mission and extract with them. You also drop them on death, but they can be picked up again.

Primary weapons, sidearms, grenades, armors(which have stats and passives now), newly introduced boosters, and, potentially, future stratagems can only be acquired from warbonds. Warbonds is a glorified season pass system. First warbond is unlocked for free, but consequent warbonds, which will come out once every month, require you to unlock them with Super Credits. Once you unlock a warbond you get a multiple pages with 8 positions on each page. You can unlock said position with medals, which you get by completing missions and have a chance to find at POI on the map during a match. You must spend a certain amount of medals to unlock the next page of warbond. Besides aforementioned equipment warbonds also include cosmetics.

Now, how do you get Super Credits? Well that’s where fun begins. Apparently, you can get them by “just playing the game” as some shills/bots on forums like to say. What it really means is that there is a low chance to find SC`s at the POI on a mission. There is no guaranteed way of earning them, besides  purchasing them with real money and getting some from warbonds. So unless you wanna pay I wish you luck tardwrangling randos into checking every POI on the map. Also there is a mission timer. Once it runs out you lose access to stratagems which means you cant respawn anymore or call for any type of support.

Warbond costs will vary, but the only purchasable one at the moment costs 1000 SC`s. Official rate of earning SC is 10-40 per hour. I got 50 in my 8 hours of “just playing” so do the math how long it will take to unlock this warbond. Now, to be fair you get 750 SC`s from the first warbond(which is the only free one we will get) and by the moment you finish it you will probably have enough to afford the premium one, but you will run into problems down the line anyway since it is confirmed by devs that not all warbonds will contain SC. And unless you are paying up or turning this game into you second job you can forget about the super shop which has 4 items on 48 hour rotations, that include armor which has stats and passives now, mind you.","Mostly Positive75% of the 62,617 user reviews for this game are positive.",wanted write helldivers 8 hour sleeping tl dr good bad progression caused mtx recommend picking 50 discount change progression fun core dropping completing objective killing enemy extracting objective pretty varied helldivers 1 enemy type besides different planet different weather condition different effect slower weapon firing rate or_emphasized obscured vision giant flying bug creature kill far fighting bug btw moving robot planet faction moment add 3 oh yeah kernal despite positive matter core progression leaf desired helldivers 1 simple progression weapon skill complete planet mission stratagem essentially airstrikes heavy weapon type support call collect sample collect ten sample 1 research upgrade weapon stratagem cost upgrade varies 1 5 research point cosmetic item armor cape completing highest difficulty planet armor mind purely cosmetic helldivers thing complicated stratagem locked level requisition point requisition point completing side objective chance finding poi pretty stable flow stratagem upgraded spending sample three type no_more requisition point extract drop death picked primary weapon sidearms grenade armor stats passive newly introduced booster potentially future stratagem acquired warbonds_emphasized glorified season pas warbond unlocked consequent warbonds require unlock super credit unlock warbond multiple page 8 position page unlock position medal completing mission chance poi spend certain medal unlock next page warbond besides aforementioned equipment warbonds include cosmetic super credit fun begin apparently shill bot forum mean low chance sc poi no_guaranteed earning besides purchasing real warbonds unless wan na pay wish luck tardwrangling randos checking poi timer run lose access stratagem mean cant act enemy reappearing world defeated anymore call type support warbond cost vary purchasable moment cost 1000 sc official rate earning sc 10 40 per 50 8 hour math long unlock warbond fair 750 sc warbond moment finish probably afford premium problem line anyway confirmed not_all warbonds contain sc unless paying turning forget super shop 4 item 48 rotation include armor stats passive mind

To be honest the game is pretty good, you can do a lot of things in it, you can build houses, make your own character, even yourself but the game feels pretty empty without those dlcs and all the content for game and I just don't see the point in buying them all, possibly because you're rich and don't know what to do with the money anymore. The game would be much better if you didn't have to put a fortune into it. There was loads of content that I just loved, being able to have a kid to take to daycare and more, content with pets but I just don't see the point in buying them, I'd rather use a way to get them all for free even though I can't play it on steam but much better than throwing money away, now let's give a little review of the game.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"I do recommend this game, but, to be honest, it's quite a soft recommendation. Crusader Kings 2 is my most played game. I spent countless hours having fun in it. I've already spent over 120 hours playing this one, and I've had fun. Compared to CK2, I find this game much more playable. I'm not sure I'd say it's easier, but it's certainly a smoother playing experience. The objectives your character should be aiming for are much more obvious, and it's a lot easier to do things like fabricating claims. I think the game is very playable, and quite arcadey, in this respect.

Unfortunately, I also think this game lacks a LOT of the things that made CK2 great. Granted, many of those things came in the form of DLC, but still, I don't think this game improves on anything enough to be worth buying if you own and love CK2.

I suppose my review boils down to this:

I do recommend this game. It is a lot of fun and you can whittle away the hours playing it quite nicely. However, when compared to CK2, it lacks a LOT of content, a LOT of depth, and it's missing the spark that CK2 has. CK3 adds 3d character models to replace CK2's portraits, but these models seem lifeless. Where a portrait in CK2 was a glimpse into what a deep character would have looked like, CK3's models feel like caricatures. The art is nice, but they pull silly poses, and all the characters in CK3 are predictable and boring. Everyone feels the same. Or, rather, it feels like there is three or four characters perpetuated over and over again. Because of this, when you play CK3 you will play roughly 3-6 characters before realising you're repeating yourself, and the game very quickly loses any charm it had.

Every mechanic in this game is like a shallow but pretty version of a system in CK2.

I wholeheartedly recommend this game to someone who is quite a casual gamer, who wants something smoother, easier to get in to, and with less depth. If you want a deeper experience, then I recommend CK2 instead. The characters in CK2 feel living, and because of that, the world feels living. You never know what is going to happen. It's like a simulation of a medieval world. This game is like a bundle of relatively fun minigames. It's fun, but it's missing the heart and soul that made CK2 so good.","Very Positive92% of the 66,890 user reviews for this game are positive.",recommend honest soft recommendation 2 spent countless hour fun already spent 120 hour fun compared ck2 playable not_sure easier certainly smoother objective aiming obvious easier thing fabricating claim playable arcadey respect unfortunately lack thing ck2 great granted thing form downloadable additional released initial launch t_emphasizedhink improves worth buying love ck2 suppose boil recommend fun whittle hour nicely compared ck2 lack depth missing spark ck2 ck3 add 3d model replace ck2 portrait model lifeless portrait ck2 glimpse deep looked ck3 model caricature art nice pull silly pose character ck3 predictable boring feel rather feel three four character perpetuated play ck3 play roughly 3 6 character realising re_emphasizedpeating quickly loses charm mechanic shallow pretty version ck2 wholeheartedly recommend someone casual gamer want smoother easier depth deeper recommend ck2 character ck2 living world feel living never_know happen medieval world bundle relatively fun minigames fun missing heart soul ck2 good

----
Add 50 hours to whatever my Steam play time is.

Last Epoch has a strong foundation with its individually customizeable active skills and long lists of passives. Generic gear can be modified and upgraded, and stat-locked epic gear enhances or enables builds without necessarily being best in slot. A lot of love went into trying to make enemies different from each other, and you'll notice yourself anticipating their behavior at mid-to-high levels in order to avoid their attacks.
Combat moves at a slower pace than most other games of this type, especially when you start facing end-game scenarios with stacking damage modifiers. I get the impression that the devs want you to be choosing the right skills during a fight instead of keeping everything on a cooldown rotation, but your mileage will vary depending on your build. Getting one-shot to a crit is a distinct possibility, especially late game. Defenses have been reworked several times to try and address these situations with the lead dev saying there are plans for a last big pass on defense mechanics using everything they've learned before v1.0.

The game doesn't have the visceral feel of combat of PoE or D3, even with new animation improvements. Sometimes I feel like I'm playing a spreadsheet, but it's a fun spreadsheet. If you're the type that enjoys theorycrafting, this game has it in spades. There are plenty of skills that offer underwhelming choices, but every other week seems to bring new tweaks and balance changes to the trees. Each class has a distinct playstyle, further highlighted by a choice from three subclasses.

This is one of the few hack'n'slash ARPGs I can play with a controller, which is essential to me due to a nerve injury. It's not a great setup right now, but the devs have said that they intend to have full controller support, and given their track record of constant improvements and forum interaction, I believe them.

With its main systems in place, the game is now undergoing major rebalances for items, skills, endgame mechanics, and just about everything else. If you're looking for a polished experience, this ain't it. If you wanna sit down and figure out how many weird ways you can make a melee mage or pacifist paladin, this is the spreadsheet for you.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"I have not even finished the story for this game and I severely believe I don't even need to, the gameplay loop for this game is too good. 

I went into Relink thinking it'd maybe be a decent multiplayer experience at best, but what I ended up finding was an incredibly fun game with so many great intricate systems. The best way to explain the gameplay is to say, ""what if your turn based rpg was an ACTION RPG"", AND IT ENDED UP WORKING SO WELL? 

Even after skimming like 7 out of the 19 available characters (as of the date I'm typing this up), it is so incredibly clear how much effort and thought was put into customizable special abilities, unique character mechanics and combos, and general team synergy.

It should be noted that I MAY have gotten fortunate, this game allows you to recruit new characters that are entirely unique to each other and you are given the opportunity to recruit 2 very early in the game with Crewmate Cards. I've been following this game for about a year or two now, so I instantly new I would love Vaseraga, the resident high skill high reward high dps tank of the game. I love this character and his gameplay, but I can be certain if someone doesn't get a similar experience early on in the game, the experience will definitely be lacking. 

As far as I know, these tickets are given to the player steadily through the story, as well as being rewards in the Monster Hunter-like quests system that becomes available after the tutorial mission, but it seems to get more of these quests, the story is necessary to play through.

As for the story itself, I can't say I entirely care for it! It has moments where it has a lot of fun with itself, but for the most part it takes itself very seriously, and what it takes very seriously is SERIOUSLY campy. This is for the most part an intensely cookie-cutter anime turn based rpg storyline that I severely doubt will ever change my opinion on it, even as I'm only 5 chapters into the game. But I seriously don't care! I appreciate the amount of effort put into the game and it's story as a whole, but I also really appreciate the amount of effort put into allowing me to skip every cutscene I'm not in the mood to sit through!

Last part I'll comment on for now is the party system, I really did not expect it to be so satisfying to play with, even in a single player state. I can only imagine how great this game would feel in multiplayer, and even then I have yet to have issues with the ai whatsoever. 

If you're a fan of games like Monster Hunter (but hate how long hunts can take), or crave something akin to Genshin's party system in a fully fledged multiplayer system, maybe interested in the fantasy anime rpg elements, or even love the chaos but synergistic gameplay of DMC or Bayonetta, seriously type into your little youtube search bar and look into the game, because I seriously believe this gameplay would be worth your time and money, ESPECIALLY at full price.","Very Positive90% of the 19,808 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_even finished severely believe loop good maybe decent mode multiple player interact compete real best ended finding incredibly fun great intricate system best explain turn based role action role ended working skimming 7 19 available character typing incredibly clear effort thought customizable special ability unique mechanic combo general synergy noted gotten fortunate allows recruit character entirely unique given opportunity recruit 2 early crewmate card following i_emphasizednstantly love vaseraga resident high skill high reward high damage per tank love certain someone similar early definitely lacking far ticket given steadily reward monster hunter quest available tutorial quest necessary play entirely care it_emphasized moment fun take seriously take seriously seriously campy intensely cookie cutter anime turn based role storyline severely doubt 5 chapter seriously care appreciate effort s_emphasizedtory appreciate effort allowing skip cutscene not_in mood sit last comment party not_expect satisfying play single state imagine great mode multiple player interact compete real issue ai whatsoever fan game monster hunter hate long hunt crave akin genshin party fledged mode multiple player interact compete real maybe interested fantasy anime role element love chaos synergistic dmc bayonetta seriously type youtube search bar seriously believe worth especially price
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"TLDR: Very nice player-focused MMO. Extremely story-driven that will take you from start to level cap just following the storyline. Borrows a lot from signature aspects of other classic MMO's to make it a welcome home to a broad spectrum of MMO players.

Initial Thoughts;

I got burned out on MMO's. Got too old, raid schedules too heavy, the gear grind too tiring, ect, ect.

But even after years and years of MMO's going back to Ultima Online and Asheron's Call to Everquest, Sims Online, WoW, Dark Age of Camelot all I really wished for in the end was just some place to enjoy being with others in a no-stress, non-toxic,  AAA MMO gaming environment.

Honestly think I found that here in FFXIV online. In many MMO's I had to run multiple accounts just to do everything. In this game one character can do everything. So no constantly repeating quests with each character, no double subscription fee's, and a real enjoyment of just bonding with one character and one set of quests and inventory.

Yes, it's ""buy to play"" with a tacked on subscription. But I'm okay with that. Helps to weed out griefers and bots. 

And yes, it  has an expensive cash shop that can be considered ""pay to win"" as it offers things to instantly raise someone's level to 60, which means you might have some tanks and healers running around that don't know how to play their class roles and end up getting everyone killed.

But I can ignore that since you can do everything on one character anyway, and raiding/pvp isn't the end-all focus of the game.

It has housing like in Ultima Online, completely customizable and just about as scarce as UO in its heyday.

It has sudden events pop up all around the zones like in RIFT where the critters or such go bonkers and you have a quick little 15 minute battle events to wipe out the incursion and restore things back to normal, with everyone getting a percentage of the reward based on their actions.

The game does have guilds, guild housing, raiding, and instanced dungeons with player que's.  A crafting system that's viable all the way to end game, auction house, holiday events, mounts, dyeable armor/clothing sets, the list goes on and on.

It's a fun MMO where you can do what you want, when you want and each of those being a viable gameplay experience all its own be it adventuring or crafting professions, each with its own set of destinctive gear. Can't really ask for more that that; an MMO where you can play alongside others but still play your own game your way.","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",nice focused massively multiplayer extremely driven cap following storyline borrows signature aspect classic massively multiplayer welcome home broad spectrum massively multiplayer player initial thought burned massively multiplayer old large group player tackling difficult challenge schedule heavy gear grind tiring ect_emphasized year year massively multiplayer ultima asheron call everquest sims wow dark age camelot wished enjoy others no_stress non behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner aaa massively multiplayer gaming environment honestly found ffxiv massively multiplayer multiple account no_constantly repeating quest no_double subscription fee real enjoyment bonding set quest inventory yes play tacked subscription okay help weed griefers bot yes expensive cash shop considered pay win offer thing instantly raise someone 60 mean tank healer running play class role killed ignore on_emphasizede anyway raiding versus t_emphasizedhe focus housing ultima completely customizable scarce uo heyday sudden event pop zone rift critter bonkers quick 15 minute battle event wipe incursion restore thing normal percentage reward based action guild guild housing raiding instanced dungeon que crafting viable auction house holiday event mount dyeable armor clothing set go fun massively multiplayer viable adventuring crafting profession set destinctive gear ask that_emphasized massively multiplayer play alongside others play
899770,Last Epoch,"I feel like I've played enough to form a well educated decision on this game. For reference I've played/still playing quite a few ARPG's for many years(Lost Ark, diablo 2&3, POE, Grim Dawn, Champions of Norrath, dark alliance 1&2, and quite a few others).

Last Epoch, is definitely one of my favorites, but does have it's own issues. I do understand that it's still technically in beta, so some of these are a bit understandable, such as some of the graphical issues and bugs that need to be cleaned up before launch. I'll list a few of these briefly just for reference.
- Certain models become stretched and spaghettified randomly throughout the game
- Can be extremely laggy at times and performance drops at varying times
- As of writing this one of the quests at the very end of the story where you have to talk to one of the snake people is bugged and won't register as you having talked to them, despite exhausting all dialogue options. This is the biggest one to me as it halts progression completely and keeps you from finishing the story. 

There's more bugs obviously, but these are the most consistent or biggest one's I've found.

Now to the actual substance of the game. Story is meh, but I don't really care for the story much in an ARPG. I will say that I think they would benefit greatly by finding a better way to level alts rather than going through the entire story again. POE also does the story thing and everyone hates it, and it's been complained about for years and years and years. It would be nice to see them come out of the gate with a better system. Diablo 3 had one of the best methods(if not a bit ridiculous at times) of leveling alts in my opinion. I'm not saying to have it where you kill one creature and gain 30 levels, but having an adventure mode you can level in with boosts to XP gain would be a smart move.

Yes, Last Epoch does have a respec system that is FAR better than say  POE, which is greatly appreciated, and is great for leveling. But they run in to the same issue towards endgame as POE does where if you don't have a full build worth of gear already to swap to, you might as well just completely start fresh with a new character. This is due to the power creep towards the endgame(, so you end up respec'ing your character and being unable to do any content with it. 

The power creep can happen pretty quickly in the endgame, not as much as POE, but it's still pretty noticeable. I can also see them running into the same issue that POE has in it's endgame and playerbase. If you browse randomly through POE streams right now you'll see every single person using the same 2 builds, because content becomes almost impossible in the later stages of the endgame if you are not running the top meta builds. I find this to be really boring and is one of the reasons I stopped playing POE recently, is the lack of viable builds for later stage content. Last Epoch does have A LOT more build diversity as of right now, but the power balance between certain builds is massive. It also becomes very min-maxing of gear once you get to empowered rifts, which feels really bad and is really boring to farm endlessly for gear with a slightly higher roll of stats than the last. 

I think Last Epoch had the right idea during the leveling phases where power comes mostly from your levels and skills rather than gear, and I think they should keep that in later stages of content. Adding some sort of character scaling in the end game outside of gear would be a lot more beneficial, and then keeping gear and uniques as ways of changing how skills work instead of them just being stat blocks.

On the topic of gear, the drop rates are atrocious  for character viable gear. They definitely need a system that affects drops based on class, much like Diablo 3 ended up doing, but it also seems like the gear dropped favors certain stats. Minion stats seem heavily favored, even if you're not playing a minion character/build, and cold damage/freeze rate drops on a majority of items. Being a strength based character and having most gear drop as intelligence or cold damage can be frustrating. 

Yes, there is a crafting system in Last Epoch, and it is definitely better than any other ARPG crafting system that I've seen, but it still needs improvements. Certain things I don't even interact with because it's simply not worth it, such as the one to remove a random affix. 9-10 times it's going to be the one stat you absolutely needed that gets removed, it's simply not worth it. There's also still quite a bit of randomness to the forging potential that gets used. There's nothing more infuriating than finding a piece of gear with 22 forging potential and 4 decent affixes, and upgrading one stat twice and now it has all tier 1 stats except for one and 0 forging potential, even when using a glyph of hope and now it went from having great potential to being useless. I will say however the ability to upgrade uniques is definitely nice, but it'd be nice if it wasn't so random at times. 

I think that endgame playtime should be spent more because there's a wealth of content rather than simply farming the same stuff over and over and over chasing down a rare piece of gear with a certain combination of stats. That's one thing I will give POE over Last Epoch and Diablo, there's a wealth of content you can do even if you can't do high endgame content. A lot of this simply comes from being around for so long, but I would like to see Last Epoch add more types of content. The dungeons and arena is a nice start though. 

On to the very best part of Last Epoch, the classes and skills. I love the classes and skills system in last epoch. At first I was worried that there wasn't as many skills as POE, so there wouldn't be as many possibilities. This was actually not the case, and actually fixed one of the biggest issues I had with POE. In POE you have hundreds of skills, but you don't actually have tons of options. You pick maybe 1-2 and a movement ability, and then all of your other skills  are passives and auras that just reserve all of your resources to give buffs to your 1-2 skills. Then you run around for the entire rest of the game pressing 1-2 buttons over and over and over and over again. That's it, that's the entire game. With Last Epoch however, you have 5 skills that you pick out, all of which that get used constantly while you're playing and form this cohesive build. 

It's one of the most rewarding feelings to start with an idea for a build and actually watching it take form and adapt as you level it up. My first character I wanted a rage crit berserker barbarian character that attacks very fast, crits a lot, and leeches health back. So I started building that, went with the Primalist and eventually spec'd into the druid. As I played though it eventually did evolve into a bearserker, utilizing the bear transformation, but it still did what I set off to do. It gained a lot of rage, crit alot for big damage, and leeched life back to me. I had an idea for a character, I built it as I leveled up, and was able to take it to endgame content without any issues. This is  what's fun about ARPG's and is what it should be about. I also found tons of other builds I want to try just from playing that first one. I'm now 9 characters in and not even close to done with builds I want to try. There's so many different build options with viability for almost all of them.

Overall Last Epoch is a bit rough around the edges in some areas, but is fantastic in many others. I do feel that it's between Diablo and POE in complexity and diversity, but feel it beats both in many regards.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.

Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"While it has the potential to become a good game, it also has some flaws and missed apportunitues (currently). I was hoping for more interesting/funny voicelines that might add to the lore or make you chuckle. So far i've only heard quotes out when i pick up legendary upgrades. Keep in mind that i don't have a lot of time in this game yet and i might not have unlocked some of the things.

One of the things i'd like to see added is more things to do. By that i mean your character shoots automatically at a chosen target while your mouse sits still. It would be nice to be able to click and focus whatever aimable weapons i have on a detonator, for example. Another thing that make me sad is Bosco. How come there are no upgrades to our little mining companion? I don't actually know if he scales with your level or something but even on stage 1 i don't even feel like he's doing anything. But you know what Bosco can do besides shooting? Mining. And you can't order him to mine, another thing you could be doing while your character shoots automatically. Rockets should be added as a weapon to Bosco too. You could make them on a long cooldown but make them powerful enough to get you out of some situations.

Another, ANOTHER thing i want to see in the game is movement gear. You mean, Scout, one of the fastest classes in the original game doesn't have his grappling hook!? It would definitely be useful and fun to use. For example, you could use it to dodge a Dreadnought's jump if you don't make it in time, or go through the tunnels you dug, the lava floors, the exploding flowers to lead enemies there. (I don't have everything unlocked yet. Maybe other classes do have them, like Driller's Drills.)","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",potential good flaw missed apportunitues currently hoping interesting funny voicelines add lore chuckle far heard quote pick legendary upgrade mind not_have unlocked thing thing thing shoot automatically chosen target mouse sits nice able click focus whatever aimable weapon detonator example sad bosco no_upgrades mining companion scale stage 1 bosco besides shooting mining order mine shoot automatically rocket weapon bosco long cooldown powerful situation another_emphasized movement gear scout fastest class original grappling hook definitely useful fun example dodge dreadnought tunnel dug lava floor exploding flower lead enemy unlocked maybe class driller drill

What makes this one better than the other titles in the series?

Its setting is gorgeous and fun. The Caribbean islands are presented beautifully, and you get to be a pirate. You sail on a ship singing sea shanties and siring cannons. Sorry, ""firing"" cannons. The cannons fire in an arc and land where you put your target. When you arrive on land again, you are bothered by the fact that the floor is stable. Stupid floor. There, you can run across roof tops, shove as many people as you like, and dive into haystacks. And then you get to shoot people, which is very satisfying when you don't feel like getting into melee combat.

Like other Assassin's Creed games, there's a meta-story going on outside the Animus. In this one you get to run around an office being ""that guy"" and making everyone hate their lives. I did not finish the game but I still left satisfied.

Highly recommended.","Very Positive88% of the 55,599 user reviews for this game are positive.",assassin creed big bunch icon icon thing watch cutscenes assassinate hoard item parkour sequence make title series setting gorgeous fun caribbean island presented beautifully pirate sail ship singing sea shanty siring cannon firing cannon cannon fire arc land target arrive land bothered floor stable stupid floor across roof top shove dive haystack shoot satisfying melee combat assassin creed game effective popular strategy character build animus office hate life not_finish left satisfied highly recommended

2161700,Persona 3 Reload,"Got exactly what I paid for, Persona 3 given Persona 5’s budget and tech. Gorgeous to look at and engaging to play. I’d recommend this to newcomers and people who haven’t played the original, with the caveat that this doesn’t emulate the experience of the original game, this is Persona 5 telling Persona 3’s story, this is not a remaster of Persona 3. For some people that makes the game better, for some worse; I’m neutral.

For new additions, theurgies are stylish and brutal ""ultimate"" attacks that kind of break combat for me. I’m really not sure if combat was designed around them or not, but I always felt like I was cheating when I used them. Especially by the end, completing your compendium grants an attack that basically one-shot everything with the exception of [i]that[/i] infamous secret boss.

The Japanese voices sound just as I remembered them, the soundtrack does not. I like the new tracks, (“It’s going down now” might be my new favourite battle theme), but tracks that were “remastered” sounded significantly weaker than the originals. I don’t think the new singer is bad, I think she’s got a higher pitch voice than the songs were intended for. Mass Destruction and the credits theme especially were upsettingly poor, and those are two of the most famous songs from the original.

While I found the new additions a little weak, I still loved my time with Reload and if it weren’t for the surprisingly high spec requirements, I’d recommend it as the definitive version of the game. (I do not care for the answer or femc).","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 7,943 user reviews for this game are positive.",exactly paid given 5 budget tech gorgeous engaging play recommend newcomer original caveat emulate original 5 telling s_emphasizedtory not_a remaster make worse neutral addition theurgy stylish brutal ultimate attack kind break combat not_sure combat designed not_but cheating especially completing compendium grant attack basically shot exception i_emphasizednfamous secret bos japanese voice sound remembered soundtrack not_i track favourite battle theme track remastered sounded significantly weaker original t_emphasizedhink singer bad higher pitch voice song intended mass destruction credit theme especially upsettingly poor famous song original found addition weak loved high spec requirement recommend definitive version not_care answer femc

1085660,Destiny 2,"Edit: I have seen the developer update about the state of Destiny from Joe Blackburn. When the changes and future plans leading up to the next DLC take effect, I will be updating this review.

Edit 2: Last played on June 26, 2021. I have since uninstalled the game with no plans of returning anytime soon. Anyone who gets triggered by my review, it's at your own expense. Happy reading.

TL;DR: largely NOT free-to-play, core content removal, planned obsolescence, lack of play-testing and playerbase neglect, has left a large amount of current players feeling disrespected and disinterested.

As much as I love playing this game, to eager, new players thinking about getting into it: DON'T. With the developer's design decisions removing a large amount of the game's content, putting it into a ""content vault"" for use in the future, in the game's current state, that ""free to play"" button on the store page is a lie. A majority of the game is currently locked behind a paywall, with many core activities only accessible if players buy the DLCs. There is no reduction in price for the DLCs from Bungie's side for this lack of content, so, buyers beware. You will be paying full price for DLCs that had about 80% of its content left unplayable or removed.

Last year, Bungie implemented ""sunsetting"" gear, a.k.a. the concept of planned obsolescence in the game. It is already in effect. 2 out of the 3 latest DLCs have [expired] gear that is unusable in the current season. This gear will be updated to have a new expiration date next season, however, the [expired] gear that players collect now, will not have their expiration date(s) updated. Players who invested time into obtaining gear that they want from the activities in the 2 earlier DLCs, have to grind for it all over again. No reduction of material costs to upgrade gear have been taken into account for the introduction of sunsetting, removing any incentive to continue the grind. Destiny 2 content creators on YouTube have also eaten their words. After initially supporting the idea of sunsetting to reduce powercreep, a majority of them now agree that it is bad for the game.

With the new DLC, Beyond Light, the developers introduced a new playable subclass, Stasis. Basically magic space ice wizardry. In the game's PvP modes, these new subclasses are absolutely over-tuned. From a FPS player's perspective, Stasis has disrupted the core of FPS gameplay, by literally allowing players to be frozen where they stand, allowing for easy frags. Slowing, as a game mechanic, also causes players to not have their shots registered to hit their target, even when they have their sights directly on them. It was obvious that they released the new subclasses without play-testing, to trap new players into buying Beyond Light. Also, they removed several PvP maps, with no new modes, entirely neglecting their PvP playerbase. How about that, a regression of content, in a live-service game.

I will continue to see this game through. But if the above sounds like good decisions made by developers who respect your time invested into their game and know what you want as a player, and not a game in its death throes, I envy your blissful ignorance.","Very Positive80% of the 583,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",developer state joe blackburn change future plan leading next downloadable additional released initial launch effect updating last june 26 2021 uninstalled no_plans returning anytime soon get triggered expense happy reading tl dr largely not_free play core removal planned obsolescence lack play testing playerbase neglect left large player feeling disrespected disinterested love eager player developer design decision removing large putting vault future state play button page lie majority currently locked paywall core activity accessible player dlcs no_reduction price dlcs bungie s_emphasizedide lack buyer beware paying price dlcs 80 left unplayable removed last bungie implemented sunsetting gear k concept planned obsolescence already effect 3 latest dlcs expired gear unusable season gear updated expiration next season expired gear player collect not_have expiration updated player invested obtaining gear activity earlier dlcs grind no_reduction material cost upgrade gear taken introduction sunsetting removing incentive continue grind creator youtube eaten word initially supporting idea sunsetting reduce powercreep majority agree bad downloadable additional released initial launch light developer introduced playable subclass stasis basically magic space ice wizardry versus mode subclass tuned shooter perspective stasis disrupted core shooter literally allowing player frozen stand allowing easy frags slowing mechanic cause player not_have shot registered target sight directly obvious released subclass play testing trap player buying light removed versus map no_new mode entirely neglecting versus player_emphasizedbase regression live service continue sound good decision developer respect invested not_a death throe envy blissful ignorance

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"When I hit 10 hours of gameplay, I said I would write a review. Then it was 100 hours. 250. 500. Finally, I told myself if I could play 1,000 hours of Sea of Thieves by my anniversary in the game (Nov 25th, 2020), I would write the review. Here I am delivering that promise early. So, do I recommend Sea of Thieves? Yes. 100%. Absolutely. Sea of Thieves is not only my favorite game that I am playing now but has quickly become my favorite game I have ever played. Amongst my crew, there has been a joke that Sea of Thieves is not a game, but more a lifestyle. If you fall in love with this game like me, you will fully understand what this means. But is Sea of Thieves right for you?

I. What is Sea of Thieves?
Sea of Thieves is an adventure sandbox game where you craft your own adventure -- where no two play sessions are ever the same. One day you could be running Gold Hoarders, doing X marks the spot maps, hopping island to island in search of glittering gold. Suddenly while sailing to Crooks Hollow, the water turns black. The Kraken. The next day you could be running Reaper chasing another Reaper into the Shores of Gold for an hour and a half for what turns out to be a f*****g ancient goblet. The adventure and story to be told is yours and always unexpected.

The nature of Sea of Thieves is PvPvE. This means that you will have emergent threats like Skeleton Ships, Megalodons, or the fearsome Kraken. There are world events like forts where you fight through waves of skeletons to claim a vault of treasure, Ashen Winds where you fight a fiery boss, and skeleton fleets that have you putting your naval skills to the test; however, there is always looming the possibility that other player pirates might have their eyes on that same treasure. It cannot be avoided, you will run into other players in Sea of Thieves. (PvE servers will never happen.)

Player interactions can be the most amazing moments, or events that cause you to break your keyboard. I have met great friends, amazing communities, and some of the most salty, homophobic, and racist individuals to walk the planet. I don’t want this to scare anyone though because the number of good encounters far outweighs the bad ones. If you do have a really toxic encounter, I highly encourage clipping the events and sending a player report into Rare (their support system is one of a kind). 

II. Is Sea of Thieves Right for You?
Do you want to be a pirate? Do you love adventure? Do you have friends to play with? Then this game is absolutely for you. While it is not required to have other players to play the game, it is much more enjoyable with company. My crews and I have had such incredible and epic adventures that we will reminisce on them months after they have happened. With friends, you will write your stories of gold and glory. On the other side, I am also a player that enjoys the solitude of the seas and will solo sloop. This play style hardens you to the game and will make you a much better pirate. Beware though, you will sink. A lot.

“Sink or be Sunk”. Remember these words when playing this game. You will sink other ships, but you will also sink. No one is immune. Sea of Thieves can be a rough game, but if you get good at the game, it is one of the most satisfying feelings possible. Everyone starts somewhere, and you as a new player will probably end up sunk a lot while you learn to ‘get good’. Do not lose faith you sweat lord in training you.

If you are the type of player that enjoys griefing and/or using hate speech, then please move on. As mentioned before, Rare does not mess around with player reports. I have had two really horrendous encounters and on both occasions the crews were suspended fast (the last one taking all of 3 hours from submit of report to email saying they were suspended). I will find you, and clip you, and report you, and then hunt you down until you leave the server. That is a promise.

III. What Does Sea of Thieves Do Well?
Graphics: 
The graphics in Sea of Thieves are just stunning. It is the most beautiful game, nay art, I have ever seen. I dare say the in game water looks more beautiful than real water. There are times that my crew is slightly intoxicated and just staring into the sea as the sun sets below the horizon. I have never taken so many screenshots and clips than I have in Sea of Thieves. Your pirate might look a little weird, but you will grow such an attachment to your pirate that it becomes a bond. I love my strangely long torsoed old man pirate very much. 

The World:
In the game you will visit different regions of the Sea of Thieves that all have their own look and personality. You may go to The Wilds which looks gloomy and eerie with the worst storms in the game, or the Devil’s Roar with its active volcanoes that rain ash and molten stone onto unlucky ships. You may also go and take a break in the tropical paradise of The Shores of Plenty. Alongside the main map are areas you can only get to by doing the “story mode” Tall Tales. The world of Sea of Thieves is rich and alive, with water that thrashes your ship around and shifting winds that require you to maintain your mast position to travel faster. 

IV. What Does Sea of Thieves Do Wrong?
Hit reg:
""In areas of intense action, players may find themselves firing shots or landing strikes that do not cause damage to their targets. While small improvements continue to be delivered during our regular updates, we are continuing to investigate and identify further improvements to improve the player combat experience.” Expect to see this forever.

Bugs/Glitches:
With any game there are things that need to be ironed out, and Sea of Thieves is not spared from that. I have been rocket launched off a capstan, had a meg flip my ship six tiles North on death, been stuck in emotes to crewmates (this one is actually really amazing). You will rage and cry with laughter at some of the bugs in this game. Beware to Steam players though, every other update seems to cause a tab out delay bug where if you tab out/in, there is a 3 second delay each way. 

V. Conclusion/ TLDR
Sea of Thieves is the adventure that you make of it. You will sink, and you will learn from the times you get sunk. Never give up, because there is no other game like Sea of Thieves. It truly is the best game ever made. As the Great Pirate Lord Ramsey says, “It’s not about the Gold. It’s about the Glory.” May the wind be in all your sails.
10/10 Must Buy. 

– DaFoool 

What was Hour 1,000 Day like?
I thought it important to describe what Hour 1,000 Day on the Sea of Thieves brought me. My crew mate and I sank, and got sunk. We encountered toxic players, and angels. We tried to lure out some spice by doing a Fort of Fortune. Upon finding a tucker in a barrel on top of a water tower, we performed an incredible kill by feigning ignorance while “searching” the tower as my partner got a sniper shot ready for the blunder bomb that I delivered after (he was a great sport about it all.) He came back once and after a great fight, we sank him. At the end of the night, after depositing our karma crates on the pier of Golden Sands, we noticed a brig coming to sell from an Ashen Winds event. We scuttled our ship and hid. They turned out to be the most incredible kids who loved the game (one of their “big bwudas” introduced him. Awe!) We emoted, the kid gave an amazing toast in the tavern, and we let them shoot us out of the cannons while we logged midair. I can’t express how amazing and truly wonderful this game really is. Be a good person, treat others with kindness, and remember, on the other side of the pirate is a person. Cheers!

381210,Dead by Daylight,"I can't say it's a good game, mostly due to the vast majority of its player base, survivors and killers alike, trying to get under your skin to make you as angry as they are. 
I don't blame them. This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that.
Take it from someone who 100% DbD twice. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.

Hell, let me teach you how:

You'll need:
-1 lb Bucatini pasta
-1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed
-8 oz sliced mushrooms
-1/2 onion, chopped
-2 cloves garlic, minced
-1/2 cup dry white wine
-1 cup chicken or vegetable broth
-1/2 cup heavy cream
-1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
-2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
-2 tbsp olive oil
-Salt and pepper, to taste

1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.

2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.

3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.

3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.

4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.

5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.

6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.

7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.

1623730,Palworld,"[h1]Not for the faint hearted, this game let's you eat your Pal, yum [/h1]

[h3]Storyline[/h3]
The story begins with the MC entering Palworld, a magical place filled with charming landscapes and adorable creatures called Pals. 

At first, everything seems perfect, with Pals and humans living together in harmony. The Pals, with their unique abilities and lovable personalities, work alongside humans.

However, this peaceful balance is disrupted by a group of poachers who threaten Palworld's harmony. As these poachers target the sanctuaries of rare and endangered Pals, a danger emerges, forcing you to confront the darker side of this once-idyllic realm.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
Palworld provides a diverse and colorful gameplay experience in its imaginative universe. 

You catch Pals with some sort of Pokeball and have to free those that are captured by poachers. One funny aspect is that you can even capture these humans (poachers) in the same balls. However this is frowned upon and not ethical. But it's perfectly fine to kill these poacher. Makes sense.

As you dive into this open-world survival and crafting adventure, you'll encounter a variety of  fun activities:
[list]    
[*]Companion Dynamics:
Pals, your adorable companions, play crucial roles in exploration, farming, and battling poachers. Each Pal has unique skills and quirks, making them valuable allies.

[*]Versatile Roles for Pals:
Experiment with different Pals and their skills for effective strategies in various tasks.

[*]Survival:
To survive requires certain steps and challenging decisions—sometimes, even making the tough choice of EATING your own Pals when the situation demands it. Yum.

[*]ARK similar level system: 
Earn experience through various in-game activities, such as hunting, crafting, or exploring. Leveling up grants access to new abilities and items.

[*]Craft Armors & Weapons:
Gather materials to craft armor and weapons needed to face challenges.

[*]Exploration and Mounts:
Travel the world on your Pals by land, sea and sky.

[*]Combat system: 
You can bring along up to six Pals, with one of them fighting by your side. Whether it's confronting poachers, engaging in battles with other Pals, or exploring dungeons and taking on challenging bosses.

[*]Building and Automation:
Build structures and automate tasks with the help of your Pals.

[*]Multiplayer Mayhem:
Enjoy online co-op play with friends, facing challenges, battling foes, and trading Pals. Future updates will introduce player versus player (PvP) gameplay.[/list]

[h3]Graphics & Sounds[/h3]
Palworld looks really good with its stunning graphics. It has vibrant meadows, tall mountains, and mysterious dungeons, all designed with beautiful colors and details. The smooth transitions between different areas make exploring feel exciting.

Some of the Pals might look a bit strange, unnatural  or creepy; it seems like they tried to make them look like Pokemon, oerhaps to an extent that comes across as trying too hard.

The game has a day-night cycle that adds to the gameplay. The changing lighting conditions create different atmospheres, making the game world more interesting. Whether it's a sunrise or a moonlit night, Palworld has diverse beauty.

Fun sound effects add to the overall experience, making the game even more enjoyable.

[h3]Final Verdict[/h3]
The adorable Pals are the stars here, each one bringing joy (or nightmares). The charming visuals tell a story, from lively landscapes to the little quirks of your ""cute"" companions. Who wouldn't love a Pokemon lookalike with a machine gun, riding on your head?

But there's more to Palworld than just its cuteness. It offers a fun gameplay experience where you can farm, build, and explore with your Pals. Mount them for long journeys across land, sea, and sky, adding an extra layer of charm to your adventures. 

While this game, might not be for everyone, and it's long-lasting appeal remains uncertain, I still highly recommend this game.

7) K/D ratio 0.25
8)smile :)
9)Deploy
10)die

the game tried its best to make it as realistic as possible gotta use brains and stay in cover

will update at 20 hours


UPDATED AT 20 HOURS:

process:

1)check map
2)deploy
3)check map
4)rush to defend/push
5)find place with cover or use smoke grenades
6)impatient shooting at moving trees
7)heal, because trees shoot back
8)die
9)Medic is 10m away,9m,8m,7m,6m,5m,4m,3m,,,,medic is dead
10) press F to give up
11)back to step 1

LESSONS:

1)This game has nothing to do with K/D ratio
2)Need to capture objectives on the map to win
3)My microphones costed twice of what the game did
4)yes you need microphones, you can still play without them (alone) or in a squad where none use them, but to feel the stress of the game, you need microphones.
5)friendly kill is not at all tolerated in this game,you can apparently punish your friend for killing you, it will add 10s to their deploy time(ones). making your friend stare at a black screen for 10 extra seconds for killing you in cold blood is justice.
6)Get ready to see a lot of crazy things, 
my fastest death time is 00:00(instant deploy die)
Got killed by artillery 4 times at the same spawn place simultaneously, (deploy die deploy die deploy die deploy die.)
7)yes, get ready to die a lot, around 50 times/ match if you dont know what you are doing.(around 30/match for me now) :D


Will update again in my process of discovering this game :D

1245620,ELDEN RING,"So, I came into this game as a person who hates the Souls-genre. I'm not that good at combat in video games as I typically like games where you can just hack or slash your way through everything. So when Elden Ring was announced and talked about pre-release, I was like ""Nah, i wont like it."". Fast-forward to when it released I was watching a few friends play it and it looked amazingly fun. So I was like... I gotta bite the bullet and try it.
Lo and behold it was the best decision ever! Elden Ring while a souls-game has a feature to it that actually made it a lot more comfortable for me to play than any other souls game: It was open world without a defined path you have to take. Sure, the grace sites tell you WHERE you should go, but you can generally ignore them. Also sure, you have to beat certain things in order to ""win"" the game, but you can like ignore that for a really long time and just explore. I had so much fun exploring the game and just messing around with magic that it really didnt feel like a souls game until like mid-game. That's when the bosses started to get really punishing for me. However, I only had to really call in my friend like three times? One of those times was just because it was like eleven at night and I was exhausted and just really wanted to get past the boss.
So, honestly, without going further into it and allowing you to explore on your own, YES get Elden Ring, even if you typically hate Souls games. This game is literally the souls-genre redone in a way that almost anyone can get into it. One last thing to mention before i peace out, but I have REALLY bad ADHD to the point where it's rare that a game actually keeps my attention. I was absolutely hooked from start to finish with this game.","Very Positive92% of the 576,811 user reviews for this game are positive.",hate soul genre not_that good combat video game typically game hack slash announced talked pre release nah wont fast forward released watching friend play looked amazingly fun ta bite bullet lo behold best decision soul comfortable play soul open world defined path grace site generally ignore beat certain thing order win ignore long explore fun exploring messing magic didnt soul mid boss started punishing call friend three time time eleven night exhausted wanted past bos honestly allowing explore yes typically hate soul game literally soul genre redone last mention peace bad adhd rare keep attention hooked finish

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Ok so I knew from the get go that I might run into some issues playing this. However, my current rig (i5 8600k, 2070 Super, 32gb RAM) at 1440p is by no means obsolete or even underpowered for the vast majority of titles. My thoughts were that I should be fine if I drop everything to medium with some tweaking here and there. Expectations did not meet reality. 

Like almost everyone else reviewing this game, I encountered poor FPS of around 30-50 in the opening scenes. Those frames aren't great for a still relatively powerful GPU and CPU at medium settings, but it's liveable. However, its the stuttering that has killed the experience for me. If it stayed at around 45ish I could see myself enjoying it whilst I (begrudgingly) waited for patches to smooth it out. But the frame rate fluctuates HEAVILY to the point of giving me motion sickness - something which I rarely get from games. 

Several reviewers have stated that the changing graphical settings does little to improve the stuttering experience, which is true. However what's weirder after tweaking around the settings I found that no matter what graphical settings I tried (low, medium, high), along with AMDs FidelityFX 2.0 (performance, quality, off etc) there was no change in FPS. Low settings with performance FidelityFX gave me exactly the same performance as high settings without FidelityFX. As far as I can tell the CPU and GPU just are not being utilised properly.

So in conclusion, I cannot recommend the game in this state. Maybe they'll smooth it out in the coming weeks. But that's also a F-you to PC gamers who haven been shafted so many times in the past with broken releases.  

Supposedly the PS5 version runs a lot better (but still not fantastic) in performance mode. So if you're lucky enough to own a PS5 and desperately want to play this, maybe get it on there - just know that Sonys attitude to refunds is...not great.","Mixed66% of the 43,165 user reviews for this game are positive.",ok knew issue rig i5 8600k 2070 super 32gb ram 1440p no_means obsolete underpowered vast majority title thought fine drop medium tweaking expectation not_meet reality else reviewing encountered poor shooter 30 50 opening scene frame great relatively powerful gpu cpu medium setting liveable stuttering killed stayed 45ish enjoying whilst begrudgingly waited patch smooth frame rate fluctuates heavily giving motion sickness rarely game reviewer stated changing graphical setting improve stuttering weirder tweaking setting found no_matter graphical setting tried low medium high along amd fidelityfx 2 0 performance quality no_change shooter low setting performance fidelityfx gave exactly performance high setting fidelityfx far cpu gpu not_being utilised properly conclusion cannot_recommend state maybe smooth week f pc gamers shafted time past broken release supposedly ps5 version run not_fantastic performance mode lucky ps5 desperately play maybe sonys attitude refund not_great

236390,War Thunder,"War Thunder is an interesting free-to-play, (largely) realistic third-person combat ""light simulator"" centered around the pre-WW2 to Cold War period that can provide a brief degree of entertainment. It is held back by an excessive amounts of bugs, poor map design, and an extremely slow grind that would make gacha games blush.

As a free-to-play game, it is almost expected that it be a bit of a slow burn, but War Thunder pushes the limit on what is considered an acceptable time sink. While originally designed with only WW2 in mind, its content has since expanded in recent years to include a whole host of modern vehicles, ranging from those designed in the 70s to more recent additions being as recently created as 2014. These vehicles have all largely supplemented the game's initial developmental focus upon the WW2 era, and the Steam store screenshots are more than happy to show them off within an instant.

The showing of these vehicles upon the page is less to display recent content additions and is instead meant as a means to attract an unaware customer. The game attempts to lure the player in with these shiny toys, and then greets them with an overwhelmingly large page of vehicles that must be researched. Never fear, though - progression is quick. The player is given a modicum of the game's premium currency (which can - but shouldn't - be used to speed up progression) fairly early on, and the beginning of each nation is largely forgiving and hands-out vehicles like they are nothing.

This, however, is not the norm. While most nations are largely tolerable for the first-half of their respective ""tech trees,"" they very intentionally begin to slow down after about the halfway point. At this point, unlocking vehicles will take you days if not weeks (in actual playtime no less) at a time as the grind slows to a halt. The game pushes not only their Premium Account system (which cuts the grind in half effectively), but also attempts to goad new players into purchasing premium ""vehicle bundles"" that will allow them to skip the grind and immediately get into the real ""meat"" of the game - the modern tanks. While some players may argue that the lower-to-mid tiers are more fun (for the most part, they really are), most of the game's development effort and much of the community's focus has been upon the modern vehicles for quite some time, and this seems unlikely to change. 

Moreover, this game's learning curve is incredibly steep, filled to the brim with poorly explained mechanics, and is permeated by a community that is largely unwilling to teach players. Newer players are treated as punching bags for more veteran players to bully or as fodder to give them a small dent in the monumental grind they have to complete to unlock their next tank. Default controls are quite poor, leaving several gameplay-critical components totally unbounded. Some beginner nations are far more powerful than other ones. Many maps are poorly designed, and even more of them have spots that will allow more senior players to very literally spawn trap and spawn kill players consistently. Being good at War Thunder has far more to do with knowing how to exploit map flaws and sheer memorization that it has to do with something like aiming or mobility utilization. 

As a final addition to a game summary that should have already put you off by now, War Thunder is infamous for bugs. Ranging from audio bugs that will pierce your ears to visibility problems defined by one's graphic settings, War Thunder is an unstable experience. New mechanics are often added without thought of the repercussions, breaking long-standing mechanical norms or simply flat-out damaging the game's performance. 

With that said, the game is notable for being able to run on just about anything, and it is certainly an accomplishment. Instability is an issue, but the game will boot and run on just about any hardware you put it on. This is assisted by a robust graphics menu that provides (arguably) a little bit too much customization over a player's client. The most recent patch has lessened this fact, but an improved graphics engine is largely welcome to someone such as myself, who has fairly decent hardware.

Overall, though, War Thunder is a grind-fest slog that puts in the bare minimum in order to retain your attention. For your own sake, don't give it a go - it will try and suck you in, and you will be put into an infinite cycle of grinding that will never end. None of this game's skills are transferable, and you are better off putting both your money and time into a game that respects you as a customer.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1449850,Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"Instead of making this review a meme, I thought I would genuinely tell you what you;re getting yourself into. Yeah I wrote a review longer than the bible, tl;dr at the bottom.

Gameplay:
Literally everything is fine, the animations look good, the game itself is the nicest looking yu gi oh game i've played. 

It feels nice to play and everything works well.

The real issue:
You will either sink hours into this game or you will be turned off by either the state of the game(not the game's fault) or the way to obtain cards. The game gives you enough gems to start and make a complete deck but afterwards gems are generally harder to come by. My advice is honestly just to go to Master Duel Meta and look at the current tier list of good decks and make one of those so you can get gems though doing your challenges. Don't feel inclined as the main point is to have fun but if you wanna make the decks you want then you need gems and to get gems you need to win and play a lot doing challenges.

Also you can scrap cards you get from packs to craft the cards you want so that makes it easier to get all your ash blossoms and Baronne De Fleur to make your opponent cry.

The Dueling Experience:
I casually played yu gi oh and various yu gi oh games and thought I understood the card game very well. Nope your opponent is gonna special summon 14 monsters a turn and lock you out of using cards before you even get something on the board. I've adjusted well. As a regular plat player trying to grind to diamond, this is gonna be the experience. This game only has ranked so if you want a more casual experience you can make custom rooms with friends or try to join randoms I guess? Either way you'll see a lot of locking down and taking away your ability to play the game kind of games. If you play for a bit you'll definitely adjust and be able to play through your opponent and win, it just involves learning the key cards of the popular decks and formulating strategy. 

They do have solo mode that teaches you the basics and lets you verse some pretty mediocre archetypes but gives you cards and gems for doing it so I'd say it's worth running though but don't expect a fully fleshed out solo story mode or anything from this.

TL;DR

Pros:
-Good feeling dueling
-Good starting amount of gems to get you going
-Card Scraping system to get cards you want
-A LOT of cards
-Good way to introduce yourself or get back into yu gi oh if you don't mind some commitment to learning

Cons:
-State of yu gi oh(jk jk but definitely off putting for new players)
-Less gems after your initial burst(its a free game so that's fair)
-No Casual mode only ranked so expect tough competition
-Not mentioned but a really wack banlist that isn't updated as much as it should be tbh.
-Solo mode is definitely a side feature, don't expect to play this game exclusively solo.

Hope this helps. have over 300 hours across 2 platforms and this is what I've experienced since the day 1 launch. Great game, love it to death but definitely be aware of these things and give it a go.","Mostly Positive75% of the 69,676 user reviews for this game are positive.",meme thought genuinely yeah wrote longer bible tl dr bottom literally fine animation good nicest yu gi oh feel nice play work real issue sink hour turned state not_the fault obtain card give gem complete deck afterwards gem generally harder advice honestly effective popular strategy character build tier good deck gem challenge inclined fun wan na deck gem gem win play challenge scrap card pack craft card make easier ash blossom baronne de fleur opponent cry dueling casually yu gi oh yu gi oh game thought understood card nope opponent gon na special summon 14 monster turn lock card board adjusted regular plat trying grind diamond gon na ranked casual custom room friend join randoms guess locking taking play kind game play bit definitely adjust able play opponent win involves learning key card popular deck formulating strategy solo mode teach basic let verse pretty mediocre archetype give card gem worth running expect fleshed solo mode tl dr pro good feeling dueling good starting gem card scraping card card good introduce yu gi oh mind commitment learning con state yu gi oh jk_emphasized definitely putting player gem initial burst fair no_casual mode ranked expect tough competition not_mentioned wack banlist updated tbh solo mode definitely side expect play exclusively solo hope help 300 hour across 2 platform experienced 1 launch great love death definitely aware thing

1778820,TEKKEN 8,"NAMCO WILL BE ADDING A MICROTRANSACTION STORE TO THIS PREMIUM, $70 PRICED TITLE WITH EARLY ACCESS TO DLC CHARACTERS (OF WHICH ARE NOTORIOUSLY OP ON LAUNCH) IF YOU OWN THE SEASON PASS!
surely im over reacting, right? surely publishers wouldnt abuse your ""support"" to weasel their way into *more* money per 'customer' right? lmfao.

games fun, im going to get many hours out of this game like i did 7. its what brings me back to fighting games. however i greatly dislike this trend of releasing content, or even the entire game, as 'early access' for the more expensive versions. or in tekkens case, every DLC character will be accessible 3 days early for season pass owners. i thought the penalty for buying every character individually was that it totaled over the cost of the pass, not ""eat this characters shit because you cant lab his tricky moveset"". considering eddy gordo, a classic tricky character, is the first DLC character. this is a bad thing.

love the game, but i sincerely hope this business model dies before it does any more damage. we dont need more games being predatory and shitty.


thanks for the jesters! its really funny this is receiving those. i bought the deluxe edition, so i have the pass. i will always think getting preferential treatment because i bought the big pack in the form of early access is a genuinely bad thing for everyone. not surprised kids these days will hand wave this away.","Very Positive90% of the 10,387 user reviews for this game are positive.",namco adding microtransaction premium 70 priced title player purchase play official release downloadable additional released initial launch character notoriously op launch season pas surely im reacting surely publisher wouldnt abuse support weasel per customer lmfao game fun im hour 7 brings fighting game greatly dislike trend releasing player purchase play official release expensive version tekkens downloadable additional released initial launch accessible 3 day early season pas owner thought penalty buying individually totaled cost pas not_eat character shit cant lab tricky moveset considering eddy gordo classic tricky downloadable additional released initial launch bad love sincerely hope business model dy damage dont game predatory shitty thanks jester funny receiving bought deluxe edition pas preferential treatment bought big pack form player purchase play official release genuinely bad not_surprised kid day hand wave
1938090,Call of Duty®,"Yeah.

I mean you already know what I’m going to say. 

I really can’t recommend it, even if it’s to play with friends and hang out, that’s the reason I bought this game in the first place.


-Conclusion-
After putting in a good amount of time into this game I can safely say that the developers actively hate their community and the lack of respect for their player base is far too apparent. This is doubly so from what it looks like a lack of meaningful updates for some time. Extremely disappointing, I know Indie games that put up more of an effort, especially for a studio with this many employees and sub studios in tandem. Maybe if they increase the time it would take to release a game by 2? 4 years? It would at least give them some time to put quality into their work although I doubt it would help. Anyways, ranting aside. For your own sake don’t buy this game, especially for 70 USD.

-Campaign-
The story is nothing to write home about, just revisiting characters from previous games.
Although they left massive plot holes and controversies in the story and it’s so weird playing through it, it genuinely makes no sense at times. The campaign has lot of petty lame bugs that force you to do a full restart of the mission (The prison break one for starters as you get stuck on the rafters, not able to rappel down, wasting about 20 minutes of your time.) They did have some slower more methodical sections which I appreciated but they were too far between, only time the campaign felt interesting. End mission was pretty much a letdown for me, nothing to write home about.

-Gameplay and Internal systems-
Comparing this game to 2019 it’s really improved in some respects where I did not expect. The gun customization was outstanding along with the tuning (Although it doesn’t really do that much, especially when the game first came out.) Along with the refined gunplay, Feels good enough for a modern cod. Recoil feels balanced and harder to control for certain guns which are a nice touch. The main menu design is disgustingly bad, not a surprise though as it was designed by the same dudes who made the UI for HULU. The spawns feel really unfair, sometimes spawning you in front of enemies or behind them which leads to really cheap kills. Games frequently crash, especially with parties.  Overall, the gameplay is decent, but far too inconsistent to be enjoyable. 

There are some new maps but there is not a lot of variety, Player skins and paid weapon skins do not transfer over, a lot of content from the previous games are just forgotten about. It’s like their *MANY* internal teams don’t learn game to game. Though the objectively worst part about this game easily, is the SBMM. It’s so horribly predatory pitting whole stacked squads up against one good player and a whole bunch of casual or newer players. Simply isn’t fair, and you can really feel it when you solo queue into a 6v6 after having a really good game, or even a decent game. The matchmaking is purely based on this idiotic ranking system, Which you’re not able to see because the game hides a massive amount of stats for you. It doesn’t even prioritize ping, so you often go up against very laggy players out of your country. Cash shop works perfectly well as always and without fail, about the only complete feature in this game.","Mixed57% of the 529,504 user reviews for this game are positive.",yeah already recommend play friend hang bought conclusion putting good safely developer actively hate community lack respect base far apparent doubly look lack meaningful update extremely disappointing indie game effort especially studio employee sub studio tandem maybe increase release 2 4 year quality doubt help anyways ranting aside sake especially 70 usd series connected mission level form storyline write home revisiting character game left massive plot hole controversy s_emphasizedo weird it_emphasized genuinely make no_sense time series connected mission level form storyline petty lame bug force restart prison break starter stuck rafter not_able rappel wasting 20 minute slower methodical section appreciated far series connected mission level form storyline interesting pretty letdown write home internal system comparing 2019 improved respect not_expect gun customization outstanding along tuning especially along refined gunplay feel good modern cod recoil feel balanced harder control certain gun nice touch menu design disgustingly bad not_a surprise designed dude ui hulu spawn unfair spawning front enemy lead cheap kill game frequently crash especially party decent far inconsistent enjoyable map not_a variety skin paid weapon skin not_transfer game forgotten internal team learn objectively worst easily sbmm s_emphasizedo horribly predatory pitting stacked squad good bunch casual newer player simply fair solo queue 6v6 good decent matchmaking purely based idiotic ranking not_able hide massive stats prioritize ping laggy player country cash shop work perfectly fail complete

Now before all else is said, it is a good game, if it wasn't I wouldn't have put in so many hours elsewise. But save your cash until they've fixed a majority of the bugs and optimized it a bit more.

Update: It's actually really pleasant to play now. With the Phantom Liberty update/overhaul on nearly every gameplay element we have a lot more options for playstyle and otherwise. 

-Lot of changes in the attributes and perk system

-Cars now are worth spending money on since you can do drive by's outside of scripted missions plus some come with it's own mounted weapon system (Delamain combat mode is still not a thing reee).

-Cyberware/cyberdeck has a lot more options and upgrades but with the added caveat of a point system attributed to each part you can bolt onto yourself. Can't go full David Martinez unless you dump 20 points into the tech tree plus spend some points on perks. Oh and cyberware is the main source of armor in the game now.

-Clothes are almost purely a cosmetic thing with the exception of things like a chest rig giving you faster reloading, armored vest giving more armor, etc. Just recycle clothes for more upgrade components plus they'll still be in your wardrobe if you have a certain fit in mind for V. 

-attachments for guns can be upgraded to legendary finally plus there is a lot more of em. Side note, iconic guns themselves are almost never modable (mixed bag for me, would be really nice to change the scope out on the snipers like overwatch)

All in all the base game is worth the price tag and that goes double for Phantom Liberty.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

30hrs in and I've only progressed a little bit in the Main Story. Max of my time is spent doing side quests, exploring, parkour, screenshots. The Night City actually offers a lot to do. The recent patches & the anime did wonders for the playerbase and game. I wonder what would have happened if it didn't have a rough start. Excited for what the game has to offer ahead in my journey.
Have a great time, chooms.
You are in for a preem time of your life playing this game. Go for it.

Edit: Finished the game(100%) it took me around 100Hrs. And it was all worth it. Never faced any issues or gamebreaking bugs. One of the best RPGs now.

The entire game is endgame content. You really only need one character since they can max out every single job (class) and you can freely switch between all of them once you learn them. You main is your alt.

Player housing.

The community is lively and they make their own events. Main cities are not instanced, so it doesn't feel like a wasteland. You'll make friends easily enough and have house parties. You'll have a team to raid with and mount farm with.

If you're willing to spend money, character boosts, mounts, etc. are much cheaper than what we're normally used to.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Edit 12/2 - It's been a while since I first wrote this, so adding an update section at the bottom.

--Original Review--
Sea of Thieves is the distilled essence of adventure. You start the game up, grab some supplies with your friends, load up your ship, and set sail to see what fate awaits you.

I offer this game an easy recommend under a couple of conditions. The first is that you like the chaos of unknown adventure, and the second is that you don't mind when it all goes pear shaped.

Sea of Thieves has you being a pirate on the ocean with other players, sailing from island to island, fighting skeletons, ghost ships, digging up treasure, solving riddles, delivering cargo, and fighting sea monsters. And you never quite know what's going to happen next on your adventure. There's plenty of things to chase, and you'll never be without a task for long if you care to pick one up from one of the vendors.

One important design choice that you should be aware of before jumping into this game is that every session is a fresh start. You spawn in with your ship and bare bone supplies, there's no progression between sessions aside from cosmetics you unlock. (Which is also the only thing you unlock, more on that below). While this can be a bit of a bummer, it's actually quite freeing. Every time you launch the game you're given a new ship, new supplies, and an ocean full of treasure to explore. Truly, you have nothing to lose. Until you find treasure, that is. Then you have something to lose. The game is simply fantastic at giving you a unique adventure every time you sail, solo or with friends. And it's shockingly easy to play solo if you desire, the smallest ship, the Sloop, is very solo player friendly if you wish to be an asocial pirate.

The only progression in this game is cosmetics. Anything else you get exists solely to get you, you guessed it, more cosmetics. This makes the cash shop a little weird. But hey, the upside is that nobody is going to beat you because they have a better sword, ship, or guns.

The game recently started a battle pass system with season one. The pass for season one is frankly a little underwhelming. I'm willing to give it a pass since the game is quite enjoyable without, but you're not missing out on anything exciting by not getting the pass.

--Update--
Since it's been a fair while and four full seasons since I first wrote this review, I felt it was time for an update. Overall, I still stand by the original review, with the same disclaimer that you have to be able to accept the wins and losses both in this game. It certainly can be frustrating at times but much like the ship, you have to let it roll off you like water. If you let the bad moments cling to you like barnacles, then you'll be just as scuttled as your ships.

Season Five just launched, and after a middling Season 2, Content Packed Seasons 3 and 4, Season 5 could be called the quality of life season. There's a decent chunk of new content (though nothing like the previous seasons, which is a reasonably high bar; 5 story missions in season 3, and roughly 8 or so new explorable lootable areas for season 4?)

The biggest quality of life change in S5 is being able to quickly and easily transfer resources from barrels and storage crates without having to open the interface. This along probably would have given me another 100 hours in the game, but they also decided to add a buried treasure system! Indeed, you can bury your treasure to create a treasure map. Then, you can put that map up on the quest board at any outpost! Other pirates can take this, and if they successfully sell your treasue...boom! You get rewarded too. How fantastic is that?

It's even better than that though. You can take up to five treasure pers per in game day from the board (this amount is pretty reasonable I feel, the days go quickly in the sea of thieves), and these other player maps will contain buried treasure of their own. Of course. Quality of treasure may vary, as it could be anything. Though there are commendations to encourage big, fruitful treasure maps. Really, it's a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.

The best part of the whole treasure map system though? They're saved on your quests table as an item called a Map Bundle. What's that mean? It means if you sink, you lose your maps and need to recover the bundle. Or that other people could steal your maps. Or you could steal their maps, I guess, if you're a jerk. While the idea that you can lose your treasure maps may feel a bit unfortunate, it's lovely design because it means they're transferable, you could gift the map bundle, or simply leave it at an outpost when you're done for someone else to find. It adds excitement in that the treasure you buried could be yoinked by a boarder and carried away. Or that you could recover your stolen bundle to regain your rightful treasure. It adds another layer of things for pirates to bicker and barter over, and it means that should things go bad for all involves, the treasue may be lost to all.

The game has been at it's best when it balances the thrill of gain with the risk of lose (even though the sting of loss can be quite painful, it's something we must learn to accept). Remember, the whole ocean is open to you, so long as you go in with the attitude that what happens, happens.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",12 2 wrote adding section bottom original distilled essence adventure grab supply friend load ship set sail fate awaits offer easy recommend couple condition chaos unknown adventure mind go pear shaped pirate ocean player sailing fighting skeleton ghost ship digging treasure solving riddle delivering cargo fighting monster never_quite happen next adventure plenty thing chase never_be task long care pick vendor important design choice aware jumping session fresh player enemy enter world ship bare bone supply no_progression session aside cosmetic unlock unlock bit bummer freeing launch given ship supply ocean treasure explore truly lose treasure lose simply fantastic giving unique adventure sail solo friend s_emphasizedhockingly easy play solo desire smallest ship sloop solo friendly wish asocial pirate progression cosmetic else exists solely you_emphasized guessed cosmetic make cash shop weird hey upside beat sword ship gun recently started battle pas season pas season frankly underwhelming willing pas enjoyable not_missing exciting not_getting pas fair four season wrote stand original disclaimer able accept win loss certainly frustrating time ship roll water bad moment cling barnacle scuttled ship season five launched middling season 2 packed season 3 4 season 5 called quality life season decent chunk season reasonably high bar 5 mission season 3 roughly 8 explorable lootable area season 4 biggest quality life s5 able quickly easily transfer resource barrel storage crate open interface along probably given 100 hour decided add buried treasure indeed bury treasure treasure task objective given non board outpost pirate successfully treasue boom rewarded fantastic five treasure pers per board pretty reasonable day quickly map contain buried treasure course quality treasure vary commendation encourage big fruitful treasure map box chocolate never_know gon na best treasure saved quest table called bundle mean sink lose map recover bundle steal map steal map guess jerk idea lose treasure map bit unfortunate lovely design mean transferable gift bundle simply leave outpost someone else add excitement treasure buried yoinked boarder carried recover stolen bundle regain rightful treasure add layer thing pirate bicker barter mean thing bad involves treasue lost best balance thrill gain risk lose sting loss painful s_emphasizedomething learn accept remember ocean open long attitude happens_emphasized

1599340,Lost Ark,"Although it has been almost a month since I quit this game, I'm going to write this review in the hope that new players will have a basic understanding of what they are about to get themselves into. Not saying that you shouldn't TRY the game (it's free so why wouldn't you), but I hope that by the time you reach the point in the game where you feel like you need to swipe your credit card or start feeling the need to keep playing the game even at the cost of neglecting your real life responsibilities, you'll be able to make an educated decision on whether you want to keep p(l)aying or break yourself out of the vicious cycle that is Lost Ark's gameplay loop.

TL;DR Lost Ark is a well-polished game with amazing action combat, fun classes, and stunning visuals. However these pros are only meant to draw players in whereby they will fall prey to the dev team's intentionally predatory pay-to-win mechanics, slog through hours of doing the same repetitive tasks on six or more characters every day, get verbally abused or gatekept by a toxic elitist community, or get randomly banned from the game for no reason. This game is not intended for your average Joe who holds a 9-5 day job and only has 2 hours on average to play games every weekday; it is targeted to either single rich people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to throw truckloads of cash at the game, or single poor people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to play this game for 16 hours every day.

Korean MMOs are notorious for their top tier gameplay, stunning visuals and graphics, punishing amounts of grinding, and pay-to-win mechanics designed on the philosophy that rich people should always dominate poor people in every aspect of life. Lost Ark unfortunately is no exception to this doctrine. As a new player, upon starting the game you will immediately be wowed by the game's fantastic graphics, polished zones, and fun action combat. But don't be fooled; you are the fish that the devs want to catch and the pretty graphics and amazing gameplay is the bait that they use to hook you in. The story of this game is mediocre and is mainly just generic medieval fantasy garbage that you've likely seen in many previous MMOs or other RPG games. The bad guys of the world are even just generically named as ""demons"". After reading through a few lines of story dialogue you will very soon become lost and confused with regards to where the story is going and eventually you'll just end up skipping the majority of the quest dialogue.

The early game from level 1-50 mostly consists of you following the main story quest while doing countless numbers of generic ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" side quests. In between there are dungeons that you will both run through as part of the main story or optionally as part of a side quest. These dungeons are well designed, but unfortunately you won't be able to team up with anyone to run them because the early game is completely devoid of real human players. Your only companions at this point are the hundreds of bot trains that run around each zone with impunity.

Reaching level 50 as a new player will likely take anywhere between 8-40 hours of gameplay, depending on whether you're speedrunning through each zone or taking the time to stop and smell the roses. Once you hit level 50 you'll enter what the game refers to as ""Tier 1"" of progression. There are currently three tiers of progression: 1, 2, and 3 (the current highest tier). This is where you will establish your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark, which will consist of doing your daily two Chaos dungeon runs, daily two Guardian runs, daily three Una's tasks (which are again either ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" quests), and weekly three Una's tasks (which are again mostly just ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" except scaled up).

The progression from Tier 1 to Tier 3 has been streamlined since the game release but is still quite a chore to slog through, especially since at this point in the game you are unlikely to have encountered a single human player. Guardian runs are nearly impossible to solo as a new player and will basically be unplayable as there are no human players to run them with. Chaos dungeons are just braindead solo instances where you mash as many buttons as you can to kill as many mobs as possible while picking up loot. You will log in to do your dailies but once your dailies are done, your vertical progression for the day is capped and there is nothing you can do except wait for the next day for your dailies to reset.

For the next 50-100 hours you will slog your way from T1 to T2 and T2 to T3 by doing the same repetitive daily routine of chaos dungeons, fetch quests, and kill quests. The whole time you won't meet a single real human player until you reach T3. But T3 is also where the real grind starts. You thought what you were doing up until this point was repetitive and boring? Nope, you're in for the grind of your life. This is also the point at which the predatory pay-to-win mechanics of this game start to show. Upgrading your gear is RNG-based, and as you go higher not only does the chance of succeeding drop significantly lower, but the cost of each upgrade attempt skyrockets to the point that farming your dailies on a single character will not be enough to make any sort of meaningful progress in a reasonable timeframe. You will have two choices at this point: 1) create alt characters and push them to T3 so you can farm more dailies on each character (daily rewards are per character, not per account) to get more materials to upgrade your main character; OR 2) pull out your credit card. Most players will do a combination of both, resulting in them not only spending an unhealthy number of hours playing the game every day but also an ungodly amount of money on the game just to overcome the artificial barriers put up by the devs preventing you from participating in the best content that Lost Ark has to offer, which is the Legion Raids.

By the time you progress far enough in the game to meet the minimum requirements to run your first legion raid, you'll find that nobody wants to take you because the majority of players in this game are already far ahead of you and don't have the patience to teach you the raids, which are actually quite challenging and require you to fail a few times so you can practice. After all, the players that still play the game at this point are hardcore gamers who have 20+ alt characters that they need to farm dailies on every day, so every minute that they spend teaching you and not farming their alts is a minute where they are not making gold. The barriers to playing the most fun content in this game are so high that it is impossible for anyone to surmount them unless they play with a large dedicated group of friends or are willing to empty their entire bank account.

If you still have not quit the game by now you will most likely be forced to when AGS (the publisher of Lost Ark) permanently bans you for violating their code of conduct. The ban will happen randomly and without warning, your appeal will be automatically denied, and no explanation for the ban will be given. This is because Lost Ark has the worst infestation of bots and RMTers that possibly has ever existed in an MMO up to this point, and AGS is so incompetent that their efforts to lessen the problem have only ended up making things worse. Legitimate and innocent players get banned on a daily basis while blatant RMTers who have been around since the game's launch stream themselves buying out the entire Lost Ark economy in broad daylight and still go unpunished.

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"Aesthetically, one of the greatest players in NBA Franchise History. The Tim Duncan of video games. This thing is freakin’ hard though, brother. I’m steadily getting through it, but it’s not quite the difficulty I was expecting on the first playthrough (versus NG+) based on how it was marketed, so I can see how dudes could get ticked off by it. You jump from battling Level 1 Pipsqueaks to Shotgun Surgeons on a whim. It’s not the greatest of pacing for many.

You HAVE to beat the boss at face value. No summons, no co-op, no difficulty select. You just signed up for Sekiro 2, playa. If you’re looking to have a laid back time and play mech dress-up, you can’t, and that can suck! I feel like I’m playing like my house is gonna explode if I lose, and while that’s fun sometimes, I definitely expected a difficulty similar to Normal/Hard in Ace Combat 7, or even past Armored Core games like 4a. I was using builds I found satisfying, but had to switch to some cheese tactics if I got stuck, and the encounters were STILL tough.

All in all, I’m very much having a good time, but as someone who doesn’t play souls the most often, I gotta accept that I’m gonna get two piece’d out here.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Its a great game with a lot of good stuff to do, although I recommend having friends and not playing solo

But this comes with a warning as well. You will have hours of progress taken from you from other people. People will hunt you down and bully you for literally no reason. The community (mostly) isn't toxic, but it is highly encouraged to hunt other people instead of working on your own profit. Even making an alliance is flawed, as you only get half value on things other members sell. Speaking from experience, you simply have to put up with the fact someone can come along and ruin your day at any time. It's quite unfortunate, some of the best parts of this game are with other crews, but you have to treat others with so much caution that fun interactions are few and far between. If these things are a dealbreaker, then I don't even blame you, and I recommend you either find some friends (preferably skilled ones) or avoid solo at all costs.

Also, you can have public ships, but I wouldn't trust those with my life, outside of arena

Edit: because people seem to be misunderstanding, I have no problem with people focusing more on the pvp than the pve, and targeting other players for profit. What I do have a problem with, however, if often people will just outright assault you, even if its clear you don't have any loot on you, and sink everyone they see for the sake of sinking people. it drives new players away, and just makes it even harder to get people to trust you. The fact that I have to warn new players that you can and will get bullied for literally no reason should be enough of a point, but the fact people still use the ""Its Sea of Thieves not Sea of Friends"" excuse for them not robbing, just murdering for no reason really drives home how some of the playerbase are, and how badly they want to feel in the right for attacking people for no reason.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Dead by Daylight is a very fun [spoiler]and sometimes toxic as hell[/spoiler] 1 Killer vs 4 Survivor survival horror game with unique and interesting mechanics.
Each Killer has their own unique power and playstyle to it and each Survivors and Killer will have teachable perks that can be unlocked in their own individual progression bloodweb to ""teach"" the perks to other characters you own to let the players to be able to create their own build and perk combos.

[h1]-Game Objective-[/h1]
[b]Survivors:-[/b]
The goal of the game for the Survivors is to repair generators around the map to open the exit gates and escape the trial.
Survivors can bring items that are beneficial to their survival like flashlight to blind the killer momentarily,med-kit to heal yourself/other survivors,and using the environment to escape from the killer's chase by dropping pallets to stun the killer,and looping the killer to waste time so that other survivors can help complete other objectives in the meantime.

[b]Killer:-[/b]
The Killer will need to use their own power and scratch marks/blood trails left by survivors to track and down the survivors and hooking them to sacrifice them to the entity and ultimately preventing the Survivors from escaping the trials.
A hooked survivor will not be able to escape unless saved by a teammate or successfully unhooking themselves from the hook with a 4% chance or by using other perks.

Pre-conclusion mini-rant:-
[spoiler]Sometimes some players are going to be pretty toxic when playing dbd,there are some players who uses map exploits,teaming up with the killer,sandbagging, BM'ing or insulting others in the post game chat,and as a newbie killer,when matched against good survivors will be very frustrating as u will feel helpless against some god loops and tiles that u simply cant counter while you slowly see ur gens being rushed by other survivors and just feel like you cant do anything....but,theres no other way other than to git gud,develop better mentality and gamesense to counter the gap between.[/spoiler]
no matter how much ranting I did,I still love and enjoy playing dbd<3

[h1]Conclusion:-[/h1]
Dead by Daylight is a very good game to play with friends or by urself,and if u enjoy this type of survival horror game or being indecisive on whether or not you should get it,I'd say give it a try and make that decisive strike!

916440,Anno 1800,"[h2]A Brief Summary[/h2]
Anno 1800 is a real time strategy game set during the industrial revolution, focusing on the development of supply chains and logistics between multiple islands. Profits from internal sales and trade can then be used to subsidize the less profitable construction and military supply chains that enable the player to expand and enforce their claims against competitors. While the supply chains are never very complex, the game is slowed down by its obtuse trade route system and extreme lack of instructions on its core mechanics. In spite of its flaws, Anno 1800 generally provides a satisfying level of complexity and progress with little downtime.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2][b][u]City Development[/u][/b]
Each residence will supply workers that can be employed to harvest and process goods. Most goods are consumables which can be supplied back to the island’s population to fulfill their needs, increasing the number of workers per residence and boosting approval. A fully supplied residence can then be upgraded to house workers of the next tier, unlocking new supply chains to support them. Higher tiers bring more complexity, profit, and power. Unlike other colony sims, Anno 1800 is somewhat unique in that workers and storage don’t need to be placed in any particular pattern to mitigate transport time. This pushes the player to maximize the value of their space by packing in the buildings as tightly as possible. The game provides tools to edit and copy blocks of buildings to minimize the effort required to expand existing sectors, leaving the player to focus on new developments.

[b][u]Colony Management[/u][/b]
Warehouses serve as portals into an island’s total inventory, effectively linking nearby structures to the stockpile. To transfer items between islands, the player needs to set up shipping routes. Different islands often have access to different resources that are necessary for certain supply chains. For instance, hops cannot be grown on the player’s starting island and are a mandatory part of the beer supply chain. Further, the island attractiveness system and the space needed for farms push the player to export their low-level and polluting industries to other islands. Concentrating wealth on one island allows for more advanced supply chains and a higher profit margin provided the player can form a robust shipping network. Like most aspects of the game, the player is rewarded for thinking ahead to plan and defend their goals.

[b][u]Naval Supremacy[/u][/b]
With the introduction of steel and weapons factories in the worker tier of citizens, players can begin constructing warships to control the seas. The smaller gunboats are effective at pursuing trade ships, but can be completely deterred by frigate escorts. A Ship of the line carries twice the firepower of a frigate, finding its niche in locking down channels and conquering new areas. While the settlements owned by competitors can be razed, their coastal batteries are able to outclass anything a ship can carry. Large settlements, however, will typically crumble without regular shipments from their colonies. Ships are slow to produce and mobilize, but their costs are more than justified by the value of the trade they can secure.

[b][u]Influence[/u][/b]
Influence is a limited resource that can be allocated to control various aspects of the game to benefit the player. While players with a larger population will have more influence, it comes with a larger area to secure. Every ship and coastal battery consumes influence, as do claims on islands and the ownership of competitors’ shares. A large military and merchant fleet may come at the expense of economic and civil bonuses. The tax gains from propaganda can conflict with the player’s ability to claim new islands. Influence serves as an adaptive budget that can be allocated across both the player’s military, economy, and empire to support their strategies over the course of the game.

[b][u]Difficulty[/u][/b]
The difficulty options in game impact a number of factors that significantly influence the game. The easiest difficulty has larger islands with more plentiful resources. More importantly, the easy rival players are rooting for you, offering donations and alliances without being prompted. The easy difficulty can help an inexperienced player fudge their way through the campaign without cutting out the core mechanics. Higher difficulties are then used to explore worlds with fewer resources, forcing conflicts and demanding more of the player. The cast of characters used on such difficulties is adapted accordingly to be faster, more ambitious, and opportunistic. Though it’s pretty clear that the NPCs cheat to some extent, their capabilities are believable and they are well characterized through their actions. Ultimately, the difficulty options are done remarkably well.

[h2]Problems[/h2][b][u]A Lacking tutorial[/u][/b]
Formally the in-game encyclopedia has a single entry describing what lifestyle needs are, while the campaign demonstrates the early supply chains. [i]That’s it[/i]. Notably, the player is not taught essential mechanics like how to colonize new islands nor are they offered any explanation as to where the money comes from. Spoiler—it doesn’t come from either external trade or even taxes. The bulk of the money is generally obtained by passively selling goods back to one’s own population. Like many things, the details are left to be discovered by hovering over elements in the various menus in the game or, more likely, looking up guides online.

[b][u]Moving Items[/u][/b]
Trade routes can be set to move a specified quantity of items from one island to next on repeat. Though demand is usually measured in items per minute, the trade system offers no prediction to the average throughput of any given route. Should multiple routes pull items from the same island, extra capacity in any of them will suffocate the others. To make matters worse, there is no control to make a one time transfer from one port to another, or even offload the unique contents of a ship when it arrives at its destination. Despite being a game about logistics and supply, it is extremely painful to move items from wherever they are in the player’s territory to where they are actually needed, slowing things down and generally inhibiting the player’s economy in ways that are prohibitively difficult to resolve.

[b][u]Slow[/u][/b]
The amount of fiddling required to move items results in delayed construction and poorer coordination between the player’s islands. The wasted productivity then becomes a substantial loss for one’s treasury, further restricting development. All the while, the player needs to stop to manage the supply and demand charts on top of the flood of reminders that, somewhere, a ship is under attack. While setting up a new supply chain is relatively quick with the necessary resources on hand, constant distractions and logistical difficulties easily inflate what would be fifteen minute tasks to hour long affairs. As a result, the quantity of supply chains and level of management needed to debug them takes up enough time to largely invalidate the upper half of the technologies in the game. Alas, the game is certainly an active experience.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
Anno 1800 is generally a good and capable game. While it does a poor job of communicating its mechanics, the game supports the player with excellent NPC competitors in its difficulty options. While there are a lot of tasks that require the one’s attention on a moment to moment basis, the player is almost always actively planning and engaging with what it has to offer. There is a constant progression and anticipation for greater things throughout the game. The logistics are pretty frustrating though. It’s pretty good, though far from perfect.

1449850,Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"Right, so my played hours suggest this is a good game and it is - to an extent, so why do I not recommend it?

As you'll see from a lot of other reviews, people like to complain about meta-sheep, it not being the Yu-Gi-Oh they remember, etc etc and they're somewhat correct.

What a lot of people fail to understand is that in any game, there is going to be a meta strategy, the absolute best way to play or approach a current format. But, and this is important, copying a deck you find online doesn't mean you know how to play that deck, there is still strategy that goes into a turn and you still need an understanding of what your deck does and does not do. Sometimes you'll get into a match-up your deck just doesn't handle well. Well, maybe they'll make a mistake you capitalise on, maybe you know you have one out in your deck and you try to Heart of the Cards it to the top of your deck. Maybe you'll just scoop and go next. Every duel is a learning opportunity, even those you lose, try to understand why you lost and not just ""my opponent comboed for 5 minutes and I couldn't do anything"", look at the board state at the end of the game (you've got the replay immediately after finishing, pause at each step if you want and read each card), join one of the many Discord servers around and ask what you could have done or why you couldn't do something.

I don't recommend this game if you want to play the Yu-Gi-Oh you played in school 20 years ago, that game is gone. Now we have Synchro Summons, Xyz Summons, Link Summons and of course, Pendulum cards and summons (those are those cards your friends send you and go ""LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID TO YU-GI-OH!"" - Pendulum isn't going to break in and steal your lunch money, you'll see it a handful of times climbing in Ranked - if at all).

2024-01-11 - Update to the above statement, as of January 2024, Superheavy Samurai has received it's support cards, this deck does use Pendulum cards. They may infact steal your lunch money, the deck is quite strong.

If you're active within the TCG/OCG or have some familiarity with the game as it stands now (LoTD players, I'm looking at you) or even if you're willing to set aside your assumptions about how this game is structured, this game is great. If you don't want to pay, hey, its one of the best F2P gacha's going, with a roughly ~6000 gems per month on offer all for free, you just need to be willing to login and get them (through Login Rewards, Missions and Event Rewards). For a translation of how much 6000 gems is, 1000 gems = 10 packs. I don't know any other gacha game that would give you what is essentially the equivalent of 60 summons per month, it might be out there but claiming this game is P2W is quite blind to how generous it is (though its not as generous as it once was at launch).

Does it have flaws, yes. We could definitely do with maybe some of the event banlists being permenant. Some older formats could be nice. But for the most part, the flaws present in the game as it stands are those present within the game on paper too, this isn't Duel Links.

TL;DR: Play this game if you are actually interested in learning how to play the modern game or already know how. Otherwise, unfortunately this game just isn't for you. 

P.S. Solo Mode is your friend, the game wants you to learn how to play, let it teach you.","Mostly Positive75% of the 69,676 user reviews for this game are positive.",hour suggest good extent not_recommend review complain effective popular strategy character build sheep not_being yu gi oh remember etc_emphasized somewhat correct fail understand effective popular strategy character build strategy absolute best play approach format important copying deck online play deck strategy go turn understanding deck not_do deck handle well_emphasized maybe mistake capitalise maybe deck heart card top deck maybe scoop next learning opportunity lose understand lost not_just opponent comboed 5 minute board state replay immediately finishing pause read card join discord server ask recommend play yu gi oh school 20 year ago synchro summons xyz summons link summons course pendulum card summons card friend send yu gi oh pendulum break steal lunch handful time climbing ranked 2024 01 11 statement january 2024 superheavy samurai received s_emphasizedupport card deck pendulum card infact steal lunch deck strong active tcg ocg familiarity stand lotd player willing set aside assumption structured great pay hey best play gacha roughly 6000 gem per offer willing login login reward mission event reward translation 6000 gem 1000 gem 10 pack gacha essentially equivalent 60 summons per claiming p2w blind generous not_as generous launch flaw yes definitely maybe event banlists permenant older format nice flaw present stand present paper link tl dr play interested learning play modern already unfortunately p s_emphasizedolo mode friend want learn play teach

1599340,Lost Ark,"After 6000 hours I decided to stop playing. This is a few of my thoughts.

Great combat and graphics, other than that everything is horrendous.

The systems are badly designed, annoying to navigate, too many RNG layers to force to spend your money if you don't want to have a second job playing the game. Progression is a grind fest. Too much time required to keep up with the game. To be more precise, you can play completely casually, but you'll need to go through the grind fest again if you want to play another class/character. 

Amazon support is, according to my personal experience, is completely incompetent. They won't solve your issues if they didn't cause it in the first place. For example, according to their policy, every transaction in the game has nothing to do with Amazon if it's not a bug or system error. So if you somehow lost your things (dismantling, misclicked or somebody got on your account somehow) they won't lift a finger. 

Furthermore, if you somehow disconnect during a daily event (Adventure Island, for example) and lost your rewards as well as your entry for no reason, tough luck. 

Every time you contact support, they will say something like ""due to technical limitations, we do not have access to xyz functionality. So we cannot help you.  We hope you understand"" most of the time.

This my experience after over 6k hours, if you can deal with these issues, have fun!","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",6000 hour decided thought great combat graphic horrendous system badly designed annoying navigate rng layer force spend progression grind fest required precise play completely casually grind fest play class amazon support according personal completely incompetent solve issue cause example according policy transaction amazon not_a bug error somehow thing dismantling misclicked somebody somehow lift finger somehow disconnect daily event adventure example reward entry no_reason tough luck contact support due technical limitation not_have access xyz functionality cannot_help hope understand 6k hour deal issue fun

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"Somehow this game got worse over time.  It had less issues in early access.

The OC servers haven't worked in months. When asked about it they blatantly removed the OC servers, and now you don't get a choice for which region you want to connect to. So as someone in who lives in Australia, I'm forced to play on servers in Asia or the USA with higher latency.

Then there's the general gameplay bugs. You can easily clip on something while driving and then your vehicle is destroyed. This type of bug has never been fixed.

Other random collision issues on objects when shooting, sometimes you think your shot should clear an object, but because a collision model wasn't done correctly, the bullet will hit something else. Especially prevalent around window frames, the top of fences and walls.

The general player base is terrible. There is no region filter, so a lot of people get stuck with players who don't speak the same language. I've been demanded by Chinese players to speak Chinese on an Australian server.

These are some basic ideas that should have been implemented at the start back in early access.

1. Have a language preference. You should be able to select your native language, and get paired with other people on the same team who speak your language. This will solve the issue of having team mates you can't communicate with. 

2. Default to the server with the lowest ping, but also give the choice for server selection.

3. The ability to report bugs through the player death cam. You can only report cheating in the current state of the game.

Please don't give this company your money. They don't deserve it.

I do like the concept of a battle royale game, but I'm sure another company will do a much better job. This is what happens when you only care about money instead of improving your product. I have no idea how they can call this a proper launch, it's like the game never left early access.","Mixed58% of the 2,306,037 user reviews for this game are positive.",somehow worse issue player purchase play official release oc server worked month asked blatantly removed oc server choice region connect someone life australia forced play server asia usa higher latency general bug easily clip driving vehicle destroyed type bug never_been fixed random collision issue object shooting shot clear object collision model correctly bullet else especially prevalent window frame top fence wall general base terrible no_region filter stuck player speak language demanded chinese player speak chinese australian computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player basic idea implemented player purchase play official release 1 language preference able select native language paired speak language solve issue mate communicate 2 default computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player lowest ping choice computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player selection 3 report bug death cam report cheating state please company deserve concept battle royale company happens care improving product no_idea call proper launch never_left player purchase play official release

PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.

The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.

PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.

I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.

PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem.
But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. 
The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.

Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.

Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.

And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content. 

In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.

Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.","Mixed58% of the 2,306,037 user reviews for this game are positive.",boy oh boy qualified write comparatively low hour early 2017 popular pubg extremely polarizing hate t_emphasizedhere reason this_emphasized mainly focused giving snapshot obviously ultimate verdict not_this worth 30 usd concept great battle royales play battle royales simple pubg focus realistic skill based weapon handling obviously not_a simulator sense realism weapon physic bullet drop bullet velocity shotgun spread reasonable difficult learn alone master unless game similar dayz arma 3 not_going variety weapon map tactic purpose address primary issue includes reading review issue hacker delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection desync poor optimization bad support break pubg major us unauthorized illegal method gain advantage problem following pubg corp company owns fighting hacker release hundred thousand maybe million banned lifetime killed someone aimbot half remember looked kill feed suddenly saw 15 left 2 minute shotgun watching deathcam saw naked man holding shotgun spinning rapidly direction shooting wildly halfway across killing hacking problem but_emphasized not_as big problem read review oh die hacker literally 90 stuff slander hard believing review last three month 900 game track stats closely killed obvious us unauthorized illegal method gain advantage twice_emphasized reported time time message day telling reported banned inherent problem understand difference good hacking easy cry aimbot someone killed auto burst assault rifle 100 meter maybe god tier 3000 hour belt hacking no_longer huge gamebreaking issue not_be stop buying next delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection desync history problem lost game desynced fault developer crappy internet connection last three month experienced major desync maybe maybe delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection anymore internet connection bigger chance ruining delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection desync t_emphasizedhink broken poor optimization big terribly optimized especially shooter gtx 1080 70 shooter moderate setting able fix others problem others justification popular long poorly optimized tough deal finally poor development support different opinion developer next pubg corp care player usually focus releasing obscenely expensive skin conclusion pubg flawed divisive recommend issue mentioned usually overblown hate know hooked 3 hour t_emphasizedhink be_emphasizedcause big issue be_emphasizedcause t_emphasizedhe reading hope help
1203620,Enshrouded,"This is a fun, Valheim like survival/adventure game (no eating/drinking to stay alive, you just get buffs) with a whole lot of potential. Personally if you are not to sure about this game just wait for the purchase, but I have been waiting for a game just like this one for a while and I have certainly been enjoying it. 
The multiplayer gets too much hate, this is not a game meant for random people and I don't know why people are pretending it is. With 1-2 friends that are coordinated and don't rush quests there is not issue. If you want to play with more than a few people then issues might arise, but once again just don't rush quests alone. 
The combat is fun, much more fun than Valhiem's, but still needs a bit more variety. I have by no means fought every enemy but most are pretty similar and not too difficult. The skill tree is fine, not to complicated (maybe a bit basic). 
The building is more enjoyable than Valhiem's with much more customizability and depth. The only issues with space (you have a limited area to build than can be moved around) I could think of, is once again when you have too many people playing. The world reverting is a bit odd, but it keep the resources from being a super long grind (like Valhiem's). I think that chests shouldn't respawn, instead everyone on the server should have personal chests but it's not too much of an issue. I see people complaining about cheesing runes with grinding chests and salvaging the loot but it's YOUR choice. If you want to cheese, go for it but don't complain about it. The puzzles are the same for me, yes you can technically break all the doors down and avoid the puzzles but that's not a fun way of playing the game. Don't complain about cheeses when you don't have to do them yourself.

All in all the game is fun, it certainly feels like an upgrade to Valhiem. More depth is needed with characters and biomes and the server-tied quests probably need changing. I would recommend playing it but its not a game you should feel to bad about not getting (yet).","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",fun valheim survival adventure no_eating drinking stay alive buff potential personally not_to wait purchase waiting certainly enjoying mode multiple player interact compete real get hate not_a meant random pretending 1 2 friend coordinated rush quest not_issue play issue arise rush quest alone combat fun fun valhiem need bit variety no_means fought enemy pretty similar not_too difficult skill tree fine not_to complicated maybe bit basic building enjoyable valhiem customizability depth issue space limited build moved world reverting bit odd resource super long grind valhiem chest t_emphasizedhe act enemy reappearing world defeated computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player personal chest not_too issue complaining cheesing rune repeatedly performing action gain resource chest salvaging item reward dropped defeated enemy choice exploiting mechanic strategy gain unfair advantage complain puzzle yes technically break door avoid puzzle not_a fun complain cheese fun certainly feel upgrade valhiem depth needed character biome computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player tied quest probably changing recommend not_a bad not_getting
1085660,Destiny 2,"(EDIT: people cant read or understand my point so this Review has turned into a full essay.)

I love this game. i have read every lore book, done every raid and play every class. the lore, gun/ability play is fun, the art and design is beautiful, and the build crafting and player expression are all a chefs kiss out of 10. which makes it all the more frustrating that i can't wholeheartedly suggest this game to friends who would like to get into it.

the new player experience is absolutely abysmal, and such a poor representation of the game at large. 
I have friends that wanted to get into d2 over the year due to the release of WitchQueen and LightFall, and only a Quarter of them made it through the absolute SLOG that is the tutorial. and with the update and the addition of guardian ranks its only gotten worse. Before i could just Sherpa new lights half way through the tutorial and the game would open up, but now with GR its literally 1984. new lights don't unlock sub-classes, Armor mods, sub-class fragments, and fragments till Guardian rank 4. Speaking of aspects and fragments. Did you know, that in order for a new light to gain, every aspect, fragment, and BASIC ABILITY, for EVERY LIGHT-CLASS, they would have to gather 975,000 GLIMMER. its absolutely absurd for a new player just starting. especially if you consider that not even a year ago you got over half those things for free when you started the game.

Let me make this clear: my point isn't ""every new player should be raid ready with 40+ exotics and S+ builds 2 hours into the game"" if you think that's my point you are illiterate. my point is ""NO GAME NEEDS 1 HOUR+ OF TUTORIAL."" this game is not that deep. its not that complex and it does not a tutorial that doesn't even touch on the games even slightly nuanced mechanics. And frankly calling it a tutorial is being generous, its a check list of arbitrary tasks.
this game needs a tutorial that shows new lights how to figure themselves out in terms of builds and gun play, and gives them a glimpse at what the game can offer at large. i would say shooting new lights through a revamped/reflavored strike would be better than what we have now. 
And people comment and act like this tutorial ""fixed the issue of new lights not knowing what to do"" and i still get blueberries like juancarlos2013 rank 6 with a kovostov, blue armor, and no fragments in a nightfall asking me ""hey man, what do i do now?"" its goofy.

which leads me to the Guardian Ranks, The GR could have been an expressive tool for players to identify how far one is into the game and make it easier to tell which players are the best of the best, with raids under their belt, and accolades to match, and which players are fresh to the game with only blues to their name and in need of help understanding the game. GR should have been this games equivalent to the sprout system from Final fantasy online, a system that helps more experienced players better identify newer players so they can either help them or give them leniency depending on the activity. But instead its another useless flex number that at worst even makes it difficult to identify new lights.

Till these things are fixed i cannot in good conscience suggest this game to any new players or even people who might want to get back into the game.","Very Positive80% of the 583,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",cant read understand turned essay love read lore book large group player tackling difficult challenge play class lore gun play fun art design beautiful build crafting expression chef kiss 10 make frustrating wholeheartedly suggest friend abysmal poor representation large friend wanted d2 due release witchqueen lightfall quarter absolute slog tutorial addition guardian rank gotten worse sherpa light half tutorial open gr literally 1984 light unlock sub class armor mod sub class fragment fragment till guardian rank 4 speaking aspect fragment order light gain aspect fragment basic light class gather 975 000 glimmer absurd starting especially consider not_even ago half thing started clear large group player tackling difficult challenge ready 40 exotics build hour illiterate no_game need 1 tutorial not_that deep not_that complex not_a tutorial touch game slightly nuanced mechanic frankly calling tutorial generous check arbitrary task need tutorial show light figure term build gun play give glimpse offer large shooting light revamped reflavored strike be_emphasizedtter comment act tutorial fixed issue light not_knowing blueberry juancarlos2013 rank 6 kovostov blue armor no_fragments nightfall asking hey man goofy lead guardian rank gr expressive tool player identify far easier player best best raid belt accolade player fresh blue name help understanding gr game equivalent sprout final fantasy online help experienced player identify newer player help leniency depending activity useless flex number worst make difficult identify light till thing fixed cannot_in good conscience suggest player

730,Counter-Strike 2,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in  the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5.
It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time. 

Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006. 

We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland.
However, due to insufficient capacity (private life)  of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.

I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.

After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again. 

CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).

Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get. 

Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me. 

If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.

However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.

I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community. 

Best Regards

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"   Rainbow Six Siege In 2020: Still, A Solid, Tactical Shooter


Since its rocky and rather turbulent release, by some estimations, Rainbow Six Siege has evolved to become a stable, streamlined shooter, with a wealth of slickly implemented systems.

In the congested and highly competitive market of live service games, often it can be hard to stand out. Not least so, if a game belongs to an oversaturated genre, dominated mainly by colourful, larger than life, arcade-style battle royale shooters, such as Fortnite and Overwatch.

Even so, Ubisoft's firm focus on dynamic realism, with a direct enthesis on intense, tactical team play, gives it a distinct advantage over its more popular competitors in the field.

In no uncertain terms, Siege failed to hit the ground running when it first hit stores worldwide. In truth, when Siege first graced the scene, it had a strong foundation upon which to build, but lacked any real substance. A far cry from the finessed, final product we have today.

So, what makes Rainbow Six Siege such a supremely satisfying shooter today. Let's take a more detailed dive into some of Sieges core constructs. One aspect that shines through is its diverse and inclusive character roster. Initially, the base game offered players a choice of 20 varied operators.

But ever since launch, Ubisoft has continued to flesh out its rich roster with each passing season. As of today, there are an additional 32 or so operators. Each of which possesses unique personality traits, with contrasting characters models and cultural backgrounds.

 As a direct consequence, Siege now represents more countries and cultures than ever before and this newly adopted approach to diversity is a welcome addition. Ideally, it would be good to see more games follow in Ubisoft's footsteps. At least in this regard. That said, I realize that it could be just wishful thinking, on my part.

Unlike its contemporaries, Rainbow Six Siege has a gamut of great gadgets to test out in the field. Each one tinkering with the game's metadata to some degree, in inventive ways. The by-product of this clever, meta-meddling leads to richly rewarding outcomes.

Things like Maverick's blowtorch allow you to melt away walls, creating sneaky shortcuts and sly escape routes. Thus, cutting off portions of the map as you close in on the unsuspecting target.

Meanwhile, the eyenox visor, used by intelligence expert, the Jackal, allows you to track enemy movements on the fly. Hence, detecting the footprints of any hostiles in the local vicinity. This increased element of awareness with the aid of an enhanced interface cooks up some satisfying kills. But more importantly, it's a tonne of fun to use.

Then there's defender Mozzie, who can send enemy drones’ haywire, with a battalion of little bots that hack and disable enemy sentries. In truth, these are just a few examples. But really, Siege is brimming at the seams with inventive concepts and quirky ideas. All of these helps each of the game's characters feel authentic. But equally, the operator's vastly diverse pool of roles and abilities give Siege a timeless feel.

As a result, very rarely will a sense of monotony kick in, with each intense firefight unique from the next. You never once feel the farce of familiar territory. And that perhaps is Sieges stand-out achievement.

And that speaks volumes about the tireless work Ubisoft has done behind the scenes. At least, since release. It pleases me how Ubisoft has retained a sense of realism, synonymous with the franchise. While along the way, adding a wealth of cool gizmos and gadgets.

It may have taken some time to get going, but Rainbow Six Siege is coming into its own. Some might say, at just the critical moment. 

All in all, Rainbow Six Siege has surprised even me. Overall, as the gift that keeps on giving. Mainly, thanks to its devoted development team, that continue to push out new features. Thus, keeping things fresh, with a constant stream of smartly innovative updates. But also, the game's die-hard player base, that has stayed loyal through thick and thin. In effect, during the good times and the bad.

As a result, Rainbow Six Siege; much like a fine wine, matures with age. And over time, it has become a more all-round, accomplished shooter. Yet above all else; after a somewhat slow start, Siege stakes its claim as a gratifying alternative to the generic ground-pounding gunplay currently on the market.

Even as we venture into 2020, I can think of no better substitute shooter for those after an intense, ultra-realistic experience. If that sounds like your bag, the truth is, there's nothing to lose. So, gear up, and get out there on the double.

I understand this game is focused on PvP because everyone is a pirate, and stealing and fighting are just a part of the pirate life, but there is no way to prevent griefers and outpost campers who ruin hours of work you put in treasure hunting and just enjoying the game. I don't play this as often as I'd like to because I get really into the game, rack up some treasure, and have some lazy player waiting at the outpost for me to dock ship and cash in my loot. How can you even enjoy the game if you don't actually put in effort? In addition, there are players who will grief you many times over, so much that you're spawn camped and griefed immediately upon respawning to your ship. It absolutely ruins the game, and there should be some rules against outright toxicity. If someone is playing the game for fun, to treasure hunt and collect titles, they should have every right to report players who take everything they've spent hours gathering and destroying it, and further demolishing any enjoyable aspect of the game.

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"This game is truly a masterpiece. While no game being really ""perfect"", RDR2 is quite close to it.
The graphics is magneficent. Voice acting is phenomenal, never thought I would stop and enjoy hearing the NPCs' dialogues. The world is massive and there is always something new to discover or some details that I might have missed because the attention to detail in this game is unprecedented. Being able to grow out Arthur's Beard and hair, and even styling it at given length is incredible!

The story telling is also a big part of it. It is truly a sad story with excellent writing, though I understand the story being strictly scripted and there is always one outcome. There are also tons of content like side missions which I equally enjoyed. 

My most memorable immersive experience was to sit by the campfire with the gang and a bottle of Whiskey in my hand. Everyone was jolly singing together for a hot minute. And then there was Javier who played with his amazing guitar. It was quiet, peaceful, I took my time and appreciate the moment. This is a slow-paced game that not a minute I ever regret spending.

No such game has made me so attached to a fictional character like RDR2. It showed me to appreciate the moments with those who are with you, because you will never know when they could be taken away. Why did you have to do this to me, Rockstar…","Very Positive91% of the 493,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",truly masterpiece no_game perfect rdr2 close graphic magneficent voice acting phenomenal never_thought enjoy hearing npc dialogue world massive discover detail missed attention detail unprecedented able arthur beard hair styling given length incredible telling big it_emphasized truly sad excellent writing understand strictly scripted outcome ton side mission equally enjoyed memorable immersive sit campfire gang bottle whiskey hand jolly singing hot minute javier amazing guitar quiet peaceful took appreciate moment slow paced not_a minute regret spending no_such attached fictional rdr2 showed appreciate moment never_know taken rockstar
1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"Rockstar Games is known for setting benchmarks when it comes to their open world titles. Red Dead Redemption 2 is their best work to date, without a doubt. Unquestionably beautiful, vast and detailed. It breathes life. From the tiniest toad to the scary Grizzly bear, everything feels alive and convincing. It's an environment so well crafted that it makes you wonder whether it isn't a real world within your own computer. Non-playable characters have their own lives, with a routine that they follow religiously just like we do. Some do hard work, some drink all day, some mourn their loss(es). It's hard to believe it's just a video game. I remember when Skyrim had something similar and people couldn't believe how insanely realistic it was. Imagine that, but twice as convincing. That's RDR 2 for you. They feel so alive that you feel bad for killing them with your plethora of period-accurate weaponry. 
Evidently, a game is not solely made of environment and their inherent goodies. That's where the story mode comes in. And, as many of you may know by now, either from YouTube or any of the media portals you routinely visit for the daily dose of gaming news, it's a masterpiece. Storytelling is not an easy craft, but they have visibly dominated it after decades and decades of duly delivered benchmarks of how an open world game should be. They make it seem easy, almost as if anyone could do it. Memorable characters, insane character development just like we like it and then fantastic endings based on your own decisions. As linear as it may be, forcing you to do things their way rather than setting your imagination free and letting you decide how to approach a mission, it still allows you to take certain decisions that will shape the moral values of your character, therefore leading it to a specific outcome. Games don't often get the whole moral debate right, understandably so, because they are empty characters with a pre-recorded set of phrases and reactions that can't resonate with you. But Arthur Morgan is different. It's a rather captivating individual, that feels real. Real enough that you will often find yourself questioning whether to kill or spare someone, or if you should or not help that person in need. And inevitably feel the pain of uncertainty of the future - or the lack thereof - that lies ahead. 
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a western beyond all westerns. An adventure you can dive in yourself, and watch your character grow through all the hardships of the outlaw life. A novel-like main character that is a criminal, killer, cruel and savage but also a human being like all of us. And humanity wins, in the end. Arthur learns what it is to be human, and there is no better teacher than life itself. 
Would I recommend Red Dead Redemption 2? It would be a crime not to. As flawed as it may be in certain aspects like the slightly truncated gameplay, the typical Rockstar linearity and the underwhelming online mode, the story is something out of this world. It truly outstands. Goes above and beyond the average video game storytelling. It's something you've got to experience to understand. A must-play for every gamer out there.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Update #1: the game is fine, turns out I'm just depressed
Update #2: turns out the game was actually slowly but steadily becoming a steaming pile of garbage and with update #1 I've just gaslighted myself.

Old review:
I can't force myself to play this game anymore. I loved it. I really did. But it looks like game designers don't respect my time that I've put into Destiny 2. 

For the last few years I suffered from anxiety-depressive disorder. I lost all interest towards anything in life. After I started playing during Season of Opulence I immediately got hooked up. Destiny 2 taught me to be passionate towards something again. Since then I played every single day. I remember realizing that I didn't have much time to get MMXIX title, but I really wanted it so I immediately started learning all raids that were present in the game at that moment. I had a notebook where I would draw encounters and write down strats for every role because I didn't want to be a dead weight for my raid group (I didn't have anyone to play with so my only option was LFG). I successfully learned and completed all raids in under 1 month and it was amazing. I had so many great memories: first Flawless ticked in Trials of Osiris with my friend Blue, endless Gambit grind for Reckoner title with my girlfriend, weekly raiding with lore discussions and readings with my clan Guardian.FM Cryptarchy, raid challenges with LFGs, Niobe Labs, day one DSC completion, and many many more. 

But I don't like where this game is going. Strikes/crucible/gambit are boring and don't have any meaningful rewards. Once you learn the raid and have all loot from it - it becomes boring too. Seasonal content is beyond boring. Bright Dust economy is broken (not to mention that they cut your bright dust income every year). There's literally no endgame. Sunsetting was eye-opening experience. I have so many favorite weapons that I just can't use anymore, even in low level content. I also never understood power level grind every single season. Also cheaters in Trials and Survival. If only you knew how many of my tickets got ruined on 7th game by cheaters. Time gated and time restricted content is annoying. It looks like management is trying too damn hard to keep you logging in for any reason even if you don't have anything meaningful to do. This game had so many opportunities to be great but it just never happens. Management keeps promising that great things are coming but every time we end up with the same annoying design philosophy and practices.  

Sorry if anyone finds this write up annoying. I really had to get this off my chest. It hurts me that I have to stop playing Destiny 2 but I also feel relieved.","Very Positive80% of the 583,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",1 fine turn depressed turn slowly steadily steaming pile garbage 1 gaslighted old force play anymore loved look designer respect last year suffered anxiety depressive disorder lost interest towards life started season opulence i_emphasizedmmediately hooked taught passionate towards single remember realizing mmxix title wanted i_emphasizedmmediately started learning raid present moment notebook draw encounter write strats role dead weight large group player tackling difficult challenge group play lfg successfully learned completed raid 1 amazing great memory flawless ticked trial osiris friend blue endless gambit grind reckoner title girlfriend weekly raiding lore discussion reading clan guardian fm cryptarchy large group player tackling difficult challenge_emphasizeds lfgs niobe lab dsc completion many_emphasized strike crucible gambit boring meaningful reward learn large group player tackling difficult challenge item reward dropped defeated enemy it_emphasized boring seasonal boring bright dust economy broken not_to mention cut bright dust income literally no_endgame sunsetting eye opening favorite weapon anymore low never_understood power grind single season cheater trial survival knew ticket ruined 7th cheater gated restricted annoying look management trying damn hard logging meaningful opportunity great never_happens management keep promising great thing annoying design philosophy practice find write annoying chest hurt relieved

[We then pan to the BLU SOLDIER standing at the board]

BLU SOLDIER:
A RED SPY is in the base?

[The BLU SOLDIER grabs his shotgun and dashes down the corridors of the base as ""Intruder Alert"" plays in the background]

ANNOUNCER:
Protect the briefcase.

BLU SOLDIER:
We need to protect the briefcase!

[We now see the BLU SCOUT trying to enter the room containing the briefcase by pulling on the locked doors]

BLU SCOUT:
Yo, a little help?

[BLU SOLDIER pushes BLU SCOUT aside and approaches a numerical keypad to attempt to access the room]

BLU SOLDIER:
Alright, alright, stand back son. [HE tries a combination] One. One. One. Uh...One!

BLU SCOUT:
Come on, come on...

[We now see the BLU HEAVY rushing down the hall at full speed, minigun in hand]

BLU HEAVY:
INCOMING!

[All three mercenaries scream at the top of their lungs. They all burst through the door which has fallen due to the BLU HEAVY's large body mass. The screaming calms as the BLU SCOUT pushes himself up and lands his arm on the briefcase]

BLU SCOUT:
Hey, it's still here.

[The BLU SPY clears his throat. We then pan the scene to see him at the entrance of the room carrying the corpse of the BLU SNIPER]

BLU SPY:
Gentlemen?

[The screen changes to the ""Meet the Spy"" title card for 4 seconds]

[The scene returns to the room containing the briefcase. We see the BLU SPY walk slowly towards the desk holding the briefcase]

BLU SPY:
I see the briefcase is safe?

BLU SOLDIER:
Safe and sound.

BLU SCOUT:
Yeah it is!

BLU SPY:
Now tell me. Did anyone happen to kill a RED SPY on the way here?

[The room goes silent for a second]

BLU SPY:
No? Then we still have a problem.

[The BLU SPY drops the corpse of the BLU SNIPER on the desk in front of him revealing a butterfly knife engraved in the BLU SNIPER's back]

BLU SOLDIER:
And a knife!

[The BLU SCOUT grabs the butterfly knife from the BLU SNIPER's back and starts to fidget with it]

BLU SCOUT:
Oo-oo-oo-ooh yeah, big problem. I've killed plenty of spies. They're dime-a-dozen backstabbing scumbags. Like you! [The butterfly knife cuts HIS finger] OW! No offense. [HE sucks on the wound]

[The BLU SPY takes the butterfly knife, closes it, and hands it back to the BLU SCOUT]

BLU SPY:
If you managed to kill them, I assure you, they were NOT like me. And nothing...NOTHING! Like the man loose inside this building!

BLU SCOUT:
What're you? President of his fan club?

[The mercenaries share a good laugh. The BLU SPY stops after a couple of seconds]

BLU SPY:
No. THAT would be your MOTHER!

[The BLU SPY drops a pile of photographs on the desk. Most of which is pornography including the RED SPY as well as the BLU SCOUT's mother]

BLU SCOUT:
What the--

[The BLU SCOUT stammers as the pornography is flashed on the screen. After five photographs are shown, we are back to our scene]

BLU SPY:
Indeed. And now HE is here to f*** US! Now listen up, boy. Or pornography starring your mother will be the second-worst thing that happens to you today.

[The BLU SCOUT is angered. Behind him, the BLU SOLDIER and BLU HEAVY are looking at the pornography]

BLU SOLDIER:
Oh! [HE shows BLU HEAVY the photograph in HIS hand. The BLU HEAVY looks in awe]

[The BLU SCOUT snatches the pornography from the hands of the BLU SOLDIER and BLU HEAVY as ""Right ]

BLU SCOUT:
GIMME DAT!

[We now pan to the BLU SPY smoking a cigarette near the window of the room]
BLU SPY:
The spy has already breached our defenses.

[The scene changes to the RED SPY running down the corridors of the BLU TEAM's base. The RED SPY hides behind the wall and sees the BLU ENGINEER next to his sentry. The RED SPY begins running towards the sentry and slides a sapper under it, destroying it]

BLU ENGINEER:
Sentry down!

[The BLU ENGINEER is shot and falls into the next room. The RED SPY walks into the room and fires another shot.]

[The scene returns to the BLU TEAM's briefcase room. We see the BLU SNIPER's corpse]

BLU SPY:
See what he has done to our colleagues!

[The scene changes to the BLU SNIPER camping in a treehouse. The BLU SNIPER turns to see the RED SPY and swings at him with his machete. After missing a few swings, the BLU SNIPER is cut by the RED SPY's knife. The RED SPY finishes the BLU SNIPER off with a backstab then pushes him out of the treehouse window.]

[The scene changes to a closeup of the BLU SPY's face]

BLU SPY:
And worst of all, he could be any one of us.

[The scene changes once again. We see the RED SPY and the BLU MEDIC deuling]

BLU MEDIC:
Raus, raus!

[The RED SPY locks the BLU MEDIC in a vulnerable position and disguises as the BLU MEDIC]

BLU MEDIC:
Nein...

[The RED SPY, now disguised as the BLU MEDIC, chops his hand into the BLU MEDIC's neck, killing him. His glasses fall from the air. The disguised RED SPY catches the BLU MEDIC's glasses and puts them on]

[The scene changes one final time to the BLU TEAM's intelligence room]

BLU SPY:
He could be in this very room. He could be you. He could be me. He could EVEN be--

[The BLU SOLDIER shoots the BLU SPY in the head with his shotgun]

BLU SCOUT:
Woah, Woah, Woah!

BLU SOLDIER:
What? It was obvious. He's the RED SPY! Watch, he'll turn red any second now...

[The room goes silent for a moment. The BLU SOLDIER then hits the foot of the BLU SPY's foot with his shotgun]
BLU SOLDIER:
...Aaaaany second now. See? Red! No, wait, that's blood.

BLU HEAVY:
So we've still got problem.

[The BLU SCOUT is seen taking out the butterfly knife from before and walking towards the BLU HEAVY and BLU SOLDIER]

BLU SOLDIER:
Big problem. Alright, who's ready to go find the spy?

[The BLU SCOUT goes into smoke and, once out of it, he is revealed to be the RED SPY. He is now behind the BLU SOLDIER and BLU HEAVY with his knife above his head]

RED SPY:
Right behind you!

[As we see the ""Team Fortress 2' title card, we hear the BLU SOLDIER and BLU HEAVY being stabbed and dying. The title card then disappears and, as ""Chou-Fleur"" begins to play in the background, we see the RED SPY sliding the pornography to the side, now revealing a less vulgar picture: The RED SPY and SCOUT'S MOTHER holding hands on a balcony. The RED SPY picks up the photograph]

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"Disclosure bought this game on sale for  14$ usd.

If you enjoy messing around in an open world sandbox shooter this should deliver a satisfying experience. 
If you expect a substantive narrative, coherent game play systems & loops, an overall well put together experience you will be disappointed. 

As someone who played trough Far Cry 3-6, New Dawn & Primal, this game delivers nothing new or interesting expect for more of the same content with slightly more confusing unnecessary systems,

This game has literal mini game arcade machines, dominoes, Rooster* fighting, vast amounts of gear, bullet types, weapons, vehicles and it all leads to nothing because the game rewards bonus resources for completing missions/targets stealthily so you end up using the same silenced rifles and pistols with armor piercing bullets looking for head shots anyways. The enemies are supposed to have different weaknesses but if a camp consist of mostly every type of enemy, and they all are weak to a the same bullet type, why would you bother trying to manage switching bullet types. 

It's like non of the developers(or more likely game leads) played the game and realized the incentive structures they put in.

Throughout the story all you will be thinking is, why isn't anything I've put effort into part of the story. Where was my ""amigo"" when I got knocked out by the cliche doctor with sedation syringe. Why can't I attack the lions island with all the stealth gear I unlocked instead of stupidly walking in there with no gear and a practically useless soldiers uniform which won't work when you get past the first guards anyways. 

It's a shame because some parts of the game are really cool, the side stories, treasure hunts, special locations etc which should be giving you some special reward or gear are sidelined by 10+ material types and different currency which a allow you to skip a lot of that content. It's clear effort(and money) has been put towards the game but it incentives you to skip it in favor of less interesting minigames(special operations, rooster* fighting, bandidos) that allow you collect the previously mentioned resources more effectively. Why are these things in the game? Because every other open world game has them? What purpose do they serve here expect fast forwarding you through the interesting parts of the game?

Also minor-ish music pet peeve, What is up with the music in some parts of the game? Clearly money was spent on producing tailor made tracks about fictional Yara but instead in what should be the most climactic moment in the the story(final mission) it's overpowered by standard uninteresting action music. I ended up turning off the BGM music and realized there was no sound design. Like literally no sound design, it's supposed to be the most climactic final ending of the guerilla story line, and I realize I can't hear anyone but myself fighting because I was supposed to be excited by hearing the same 20 second standard action music loop over and over again. 

Finally I'll leave with with quick notes. 
- Why does the personal vehicle driver take ages to get out of the vehicle? Driving competes with the fast travel mechanic so it should be quicker to get going. 
- Why are amigos in the game if they aren't incorporated in 90% of vehicles, storyline etc? So much missed opportunity here.
- If you want to have tons of different gear in your game, give players incentives to manage them. The map is already split up in regions but every single outpost, vehicle checkpoint feels the same. Why not designate different environments for different types of enemies so the player feels motivated to change up their loadout as they pass through the map.
- I can kill every enemy in a military outpost without raising the alarm or being detected, but if I don't optionally keep an enemy alive while I free up the hostage or hack a computer I won't get the bonus? Who thought of this?
- The game is cluttered with less interesting notes, why put the effort into notes about random checkpoints, etc when you are likely to just skip reading them as they pop up on your map anyways. They are just clutter.

[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
Here’s a fraction of my clumsy gameplay, which showcases, albeit partially, the core gameplay of AC6.
https://youtu.be/2tcYVv3j4N4
[list]
[b]Cons:[/b]
[*]After all these years, briefings are definitely far from the best storytelling method. 

[b]Pros:[/b]
[*]Satisfying skill-based combat system;
[*]Flexible mech customization system;
[*]About 60 diverse missions;
[*]Magnificent boss fights;
[*]Exquisite soundtrack throughout the whole game.

[b]Neutral:[/b]
[*]Three playthroughs are required to see all the story bits, elements and variations;
[*]At first the interface may appear to be overly cluttered; however, in practice it displays only the necessary information – nothing more, nothing less.
[*]Two types of collectibles (mech parts and logs with extra story bits) are scattered around the levels.[/list]

[i]My impressions of AC6 are based on the 3 consecutive playthroughs (all missions, all endings).[/i]

[h1]Where there’s Coral, there’s Blood[/h1]

I would like to kick things off with the story. Unlike in the majority of recent games from this studio, the story is delivered directly and, more or less, clearly. Though, AC6 hasn’t fully evaded From’s signature style, which lies in its mysteriously elusive sheen that envelops almost the entire narrative here. Regardless of which ending you might aim for, you will be [b]TOLD[/b] a story that may not reach for the stars, but is a perfectly coherent and understandable tale. That’s exactly where the main narrative problem lies. No matter how interesting or epic the unfolding events may be, the absolute majority of the plot information is delivered to the player through stylish, beautifully designed, but boring interludes, in which the player is often monotonously [b]TOLD[/b] about something. Moreover, quickly grasping the twists and turns that the main characters and corporations undergo will be challenging for a newcomer to the series. This is despite the fact that they did not appear in previous parts of the series. Who are they? What is their goal? The exposition is oversaturated with introductions and dumps a ton of information on the player in a short period of time.

In general, the gameplay loop and narrative structure in the game follow this pattern: briefing before the mission > mission execution > summary/main characters' commentary > customization of the mech (optional) > briefing > mission > results > repeat until a somewhat directed cutscene. However, even these rare clips don't shake things up too much because they either focus on general surroundings or close-ups of mechs. Exciting and/or dynamic actions are few and far between in these clips. I understand that this was the case in the previous 15 installments of the series, however, that doesn't serve as reasonable justification. It's still a somewhat sub par way of story delivery for a AAA game in 2023, especially one that truly set out to tell the stories in a straightforward and clear manner. [url=youtube.com/watch?v=buqlmuzbzmc]You can see for yourself here (spoilers, obviously).[/url]

I have to give credit, where credit is due: even though Rusty, Walter, Carla, Ayre, and other characters are, for the most part, mere voices, I was still able to establish a pleasant emotional connection with them during the playthrough, and their clashes were able to capture my interest, which strikes me as something paradoxical, considering the main method of storytelling.

Also, it's worth keeping in mind: for a complete playthrough from a story perspective, i.e., to achieve all endings, it's necessary to beat the game three times. Each subsequent playthrough not only allows you to unlock and complete missions that were unavailable to the player in previous runs but also provides an opportunity to look at the unfolding events from different angles. This is a rather controversial decision. Yes, it allows for a better understanding of and connection with the characters, their relationships, and the world in which all of this takes place, but not every player will be willing to complete the game three times, especially considering that the majority of the missions remain unchanged.

[h1]Combat and Customization Systems[/h1]

These two systems are closely interconnected and go hand in hand throughout the entire game because, depending on the build, the optimal battlefield behavior pattern changes: a player can pilot a light and fast AC, allowing for the use of heavier weaponry, or, conversely, be slow but sturdy; you can literally turn into a tank or become a mech on four legs; equip a machine gun (or any other weapon from the insanely extensive list) into your right hand and a shield/spear/sword, etc. into your left hand. The game offers many tools for melee combat. Besides, no one will look down upon you for dual-wielding. Perhaps you're as much of a fan of Max Payne as I am?

Although this comparison is not very accurate, to be fair. The thing is, you don't have to manually aim at the enemies here. Your AC automatically targets enemies; you can only choose targets and switch between them when you're locked on. However, this doesn't make the game less skill-dependent, contrary to your initial thoughts. The foundation for showcasing skills here lies in the ability to pilot your mech correctly, primarily in terms of movement, spacing, and timely shooting, along with a properly assembled loadout.

Equally important is the constant focus on monitoring a bunch of different values and indicators: the amount of ammunition and remaining energy, which is spent on dashes and accelerations, indicators of overheating and cooldowns for certain types of weapons, the number of remaining 'medkits' (only three are handed out for all missions, but only sometimes they can be replenished), and, of course, the reserves of remaining armor and an analogue of the Posture bar from Sekiro, which is displayed for both you and your opponents.

Also, the game features an Arena. By the name, everything is clear – 1x1 battles against various types of AC. An excellent mode for replayability, where you can hone your skills, try different loadouts, but most importantly, acquire the so-called 'OST Chips.' Essentially, these are skill points that are spent on passive upgrades for your mech and several active abilities.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

[b]In summary, the gameplay and the combat systems, in particular, are the selling points of the game, and they are executed at the highest level: refined mechanics, still a deep customization system (it was even more complex in the previous games of the series), glorious arenas and locations from a visual standpoint, epic boss fights that are unlikely to be forgotten even upon a single encounter. AC6 is a brilliant representative of action games.[/b]

[i]P. S. It's nice to see how Miyazaki-san's team occasionally deviates from Souls games in favor of the clearly secondary projects for the studio/publisher, yet refreshing nonetheless, such as Sekiro. This time they brought back Armored Core. Would that imply that we can expect a sequel to Ninja Blade or, perhaps, should they even consider venturing into a new IP in some genre that is unusual for the studio? After all, FromSoftware developers are adept at deviating from familiar formulas, as they have demonstrated with these excellent games over the past few years. It would be great to see more of these experiments.[/i]

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Great game which I just came back to after some time off, unfortunately to discover they changed the privacy policy while I was away.

 Definitely not buying any DLCs or ESO plus, as you can get the extra money by selling my personal info instead.

Sells your personal info to anyone with the cash, including: ""username, name, demographics and other characteristics or descriptions, email, address, telephone number, and other contact information, account credentials, communications preferences, billing and payment information"".

 Change the privacy policy if you want a positive review, and also give me some compensation for this breach of trust (not a refund, actual COMPENSATION for copy and pasting my personal details all over the internet). Pretty annoyed that I paid for this, for you to later decide it wasn't enough and try to get that extra cash out of my personal details too.

Update: Yes, I still play the game as pointed out by the commenters, no I won't be supporting them by purchasing ESO Plus which I might otherwise have happily purchased, or the DLCs. I expect free games to sell my information, not subscription services - especially when they aren't that cheap.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I supported this Hell Let Loose since day one on Kickstarter and I was looking forward to it more than to any other game, but the devs just trashed everything it was worth buying for.

When I read the Kickstarter campaign of HLL almost two years ago I was really hyped for this game, it sounded like a good alternative to Post Scriptum (which is bascially a WW2 aquivalent to the game Squad). Especially the game mode where the whole map is divided into capture sectors was a refreshing mechanic and turned out to be a lot of fun during the first backer alpha. The game was quite barebones but met my high expectations.
Apperantly some players didn't like the slow tactical approach and complained in the forums about that there was too few action. 
The devs then decided to, as they said, ""temporary"" limit the map size for the next alpha until vehicles find their way in the game.
In the following playtests the map size wasn't adjusted any more and the devs announced the smaller map size to be their standard from now on.

After that they also trashed the whole game concept (their only game mode at this point) and replaced it with a normal capture mode (Conquest with specified cap order). That leads to much more action while the teamplay suffers from it. Also flanks are not worth it any more as the map size is too limited, so you will most likely get spotted very early on. If you once make it somehow, your self placed spawn points will be trashed by the game itself if you lose a caputure point when that spawn point is behind enemy lines now. What the .... ? This is some horrible game design right there.

The game really lost it's whole point when the devs decided to give up their vision of a slow tactical ww2 game. I don't know what has driven them to such decisions but it probably must be a combination of complaining casual gamers and the publisher (who was announced to be their publisher some months ago).
HLL has become a boring, action focussed mess like a Battlefield game on slightly bigger maps. This is just a huge disappointment.

I'm aware that my opinion most likely doesn't represent the majority of players, but I just wanted to warn potential buyers who were expecting a tacical and teamplay oriented ww2 game like it was advertised in 2017 on Kickstarter.

I really wanted to like this game - and I did - until it has fallen victim to the mass market.



EDIT: Because some people say the devs announced more game modes or even that the old game mode will return: I know what the devs are saying, but you should ask yourself why they would remove a working game mode from the game in the first place. You must be really naive to believe that the old game mode will return in it's previous form. Especially because the new (much smaller) maps are designed for the current game mode and I highly doubt they'll inrease the map size afterwards. The one and only map that was made for the old game mode was St. Marie.

I didn't give this game a negative review because it doesn't fit my type of games (I wouldn't do that cause it's not fair in my opinion), but because it was advertised as something that it's not anymore now.

And by the way: Insulting others or me does not support your arguments, you just make yourself ridiculous. You can have a discussion but there's no need for insults.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"TL;DR: This review focuses on The Sims 4 DLCs because I believe they're necessary for a fun experience, but they're expensive. If you can't or won't spend twice the cost of the main game on DLCs, I can't recommend the game.


I won't go into detail about how The Sims 4 works because most people know how these games function. But, I want to mention that this game doesn't have an open world like The Sims 3, and the worlds are much smaller. However, the game has decent content, but it can feel empty without DLCs. So, if you plan to buy The Sims 4, I recommend purchasing a few DLCs. It's costly, but I think it's necessary to enjoy the game.

Below are some DLCs that I recommend, but only if they're on sale (at least 30% off). I only recommend DLCs that I have played or know are good.

Tiny Living Stuff: This is a cheap and fun DLC. It allows you to build super small houses with compact furniture, making it possible to fit 5 to 6 houses on the same lot. It's unique and adds a new dimension to the game.

Seasons: This DLC adds four seasons with holidays, new items, and activities. It also adds new weather and ways to die. (Pro tip: you can kill your simmers really fast in a frozen pool.)

Get Famous: This is a decent DLC for its price, especially when it's on sale. It's great if you care about fame and money, and you need this DLC to become an actor.

Get To Work: This DLC is a must-have, as it adds active careers to the game, the option to become a store owner, and hospital visits.

""Cats & Dogs is the only DLC I own but unfortunately cannot recommend. I felt compelled to mention it, as it's typically the go-to expansion pack for new players, and with good reason - it was highly regarded in previous Sims titles. However, in The Sims 4, it adds little content beyond cats and dogs and is plagued with numerous bugs. Adopted pets often become stuck, leaving players struggling to figure out how to properly care for them.""

In conclusion, I like The Sims 4. It's more alive in interactions than any of the previous Sims games, and the building and character creation is user-friendly. However, the cost of DLCs is quite steep, and it's frustrating that some of them aren't worth the price.","Very Positive87% of the 127,522 user reviews for this game are positive.",tl dr focus sims dlcs believe necessary fun expensive spend twice cost dlcs recommend detail sims work game function mention open world sims 3 world smaller decent empty dlcs plan sims recommend purchasing dlcs costly necessary enjoy dlcs recommend sale 30 recommend dlcs good tiny living stuff cheap fun downloadable additional released initial launch allows build super small house compact furniture possible fit 5 6 house unique add dimension season downloadable additional released initial launch add four season holiday item activity add weather way die highly skilled experienced tip kill simmer fast frozen pool famous decent downloadable additional released initial launch price especially sale great care fame downloadable additional released initial launch actor downloadable additional released initial launch add active career owner hospital visit cat dog downloadable additional released initial launch unfortunately cannot_recommend compelled mention typically major addition add feature mechanic pack player good highly regarded sims title sims add cat dog plagued numerous bug adopted pet stuck leaving player struggling figure properly care conclusion sims alive in_emphasizedteractions sims game building creation user friendly cost dlcs steep frustrating worth price

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"The biggest positive for me is that it's DRG and the charm of a brand that I like a lot is very present.
As a horde survival game it's pretty mediocre and due to the lack of unique upgrades and variation it becomes pretty same-y after a few runs.

Percentage based stat upgrades just don't give you the satisfaction that the unique upgrades of other games bring, which come with significant modifications to weapons and overall playstyle. While a 10% damage upgrade makes the hit number a few digits bigger, it's just not really the same feeling.

In these types of games I'm looking for a bit of power fantasy somewhere down a run. In DRGS I'm mostly being chased around by way too many enemies that feel sponge-y and most of the time don't die because of my weapons but due to a chain of Bulk Detonators exploding, which have stacked up over 3 hordes.

It's still a moderately fun game to play, but if I had to look at it from the perspective of someone not invested into the DRG franchise, there are lots of other options in this genre that are a lot more satisfying to play.","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",biggest positive drg charm brand present horde survival pretty mediocre due lack unique upgrade variation pretty run percentage based stat upgrade satisfaction unique upgrade game bring significant modification weapon playstyle 10 damage upgrade make number digit bigger not_really feeling type game bit power fantasy drgs m_emphasizedostly chased enemy sponge die weapon due chain bulk detonator exploding stacked 3 horde s_emphasizedtill moderately fun play perspective someone not_invested drg franchise lot option genre satisfying play

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"Initially I bought Call of Duty for 6v6 (because I never liked Warzone 1.0) but found myself bored of 6v6 relatively quickly. Not long after a few friends of mine convinced me to play quads with them, and so I did. And I loved it. It is fun when it works (which is almost never). Warzone 2 in the sense that it is played is a lot more fun for me than Warzone 1.0 ever was, and I think the map is genuinely better in a lot of ways, though of course it could do with some improvement.

HOWEVER, and this is why I am giving this a negative review; the game is completely broken. Both Warzone and 6v6. If I could go back in time, I would not give Activision Blizzard a single £. 

Some of the bugs present in Warzone are as following, 

• ""Disconnected from Steam""- happens at least 2-5 times in a few hours session - very annoying bug that almost always (in my case anyways) happens when you are doing well in the game and stand a chance of winning. Regardless, super annoying and the fact that it has not been adressed yet is outrageous. 

• ""Dev Error 657"" - no idea what this is, but it pops up about as frequently as you get the aforementioned crash/disconnect. It usually also happens to everyone in the party at the same time and you need to back out and try again. Another annoying bug.

• The looting is completely broken and bugged out the wazoo. Impossible to grab loot and often times you find yourself having to position yourself in a very neat manner in order to get the ""F to pick-up"" prompt. Annoying as hell and have been the cause of my death a few times at least. 

• Servers are horrible. Rubber banding, lagging, high ping, all normal and frequent. 

• Hit registration is awful. Damage is clearly not tracked properly. 

• PC performance is sh*te. Stutters on even high end hardware. Optimisation is sorely needed. 

• Recon drone is bugged. Sometimes if you use the drone, once finished, you are unable to ""leave"" the camera position and rendered stuck. 

• NPCs keep spawning in ridiculous numbers after completing the stronghold, basically constantly ticking damage on you. 

• HUD disappears after using airstrikes. 

Honestly, the list is endless if I really wanted it to be. But, TL;DR, the game is fun when it works, but really bad when it is bad. The potential is without a doubt there, and because of the fact that Warzone is free, I will hold my tongue, but I highly, highly recommend that you do NOT spend a single buck on this game be it in the form of battle pass, operators or the full game. The fact that a billion dollar company that ALLEGEDLY worked on this game for 3 years with more than 3000 developers and then it releases like this is unfathomable for me. The sheer audacity to release skins and bundles but not hotfixes for the game that is in dire need of it is just proof that they could not give a single toss about the state of the game so long as people keep buying CDL Power Ranger skins.","Mostly Negative32% of the 30,364 user reviews for this game are positive.",initially bought duty 6v6 never_liked warzone 1 0 found bored 6v6 relatively quickly not_long friend mine convinced play quad loved it_emphasized fun work never_warzone 2 sense fun warzone 1 0 genuinely way course improvement giving negative completely broken warzone 6v6 not_give activision blizzard single bug present warzone following disconnected happens 2 5 time hour session annoying bug anyways happens stand chance winning super annoying not_been adressed outrageous error 657 no_idea pop frequently aforementioned crash disconnect usually happens party annoying bug looting completely broken bugged wazoo impossible grab item reward dropped defeated enemy time position neat manner order f pick prompt annoying hell cause death time server horrible rubber banding lagging high ping normal frequent registration awful damage clearly not_tracked properly pc performance sh te stutter high hardware optimisation sorely needed recon drone bugged drone finished unable leave camera position rendered stuck npc spawning ridiculous number completing stronghold basically constantly ticking damage hud disappears airstrikes honestly endless wanted tl dr fun work bad bad potential doubt warzone hold tongue highly_emphasized recommend not_spend single buck form battle pas operator billion dollar company allegedly worked 3 year 3000 developer release unfathomable sheer audacity release skin bundle not_hotfixes dire proof not_give single toss state long buying cdl power ranger skin

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Do not, under any circumstances, buy Madden until they actually rebuild the game from the ground up. This is quite literally the same game they've been putting out since they moved to the Frostbite engine in 2017, with the devs continuously building on their spaghetti codebase. The UI is very obviously the same and just as cumbersome, except now it takes 5 seconds for anything to happen after you select something. Great. It genuinely baffles me how the game can get buggier and worse every year with the marketing being 'we fixed everything wrong with the game and added things that were in FORKING MADDEN 05 for your nostalgia'. Like somehow adding things that never should have been removed in an incomplete capacity warrants a $70 pricetag. I genuinely feel scammed out of my money. I put ~170 or so hours into Madden 23 (felt great about getting the last gen version of that /s) and it still somehow feels better than this.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"I want to continue to love this game, the controls, movement & weapons are excellent and overall gameplay is super enjoyable... but the matchmaking will ensure you're never actually having fun.  It's a sweatfest nightmare now.  You'll be paired against absurdly high level people so far above your rank and skillset you'll question if the matchmaking is genuinely broken.

It also seems most of the OG devs have left Respawn (including the main map designer) as evidenced by (in part) the complete and utter lack of communication between the studio and community. Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle.  Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates. 

This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc.  Don't buy them, seriously.  $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous.

236390,War Thunder,"I genuinely once believed in Gaijin to be a reasonable company that would put aside moronic and neanderthalic greed in place for a game that could bring in a larger audience and expose to a larger audience the appeal to being an armchair weapon and vehicle historian. However ever since 2012 my hours used in this game have only proven me wrong as time has gone on, I've unlocked almost every vehicle, every achievement, and yet everytime I play this game I feel like a battered house wife in an abusive relationship with a husband who sells his wife just to make his own business gain more profit. As such I always have strong feelings for when a change is implemented and when the game is ""rebalanced"" for the sake of ""fun"". The game isn't fun, the game is in fact a chore to play. You genuinely have a better chance to get a part time job and just buy a T-72 irl, that's how much the grind is in this game. By the time you would have spent 5 years irl saving up money to buy a soviet armored car, you would have gotten the same vehicle in this god forsaken game. The game always remains with potential to become far grander in scale and if anything far more entertaining in execution. However, gaijin as a company is no worse in greed than EA. EA by comparison, has far more respect from me than Gaijin simply due to their transparency to their choices and their greed, I at the very least am given an explanation as of to why such changes are applied to an EA game, however with Gaijin it's just radio silence no matter the change. One day you will have a new vehicle working just fine, and the next patch the vehicle is upside down and flying into the sky just like the 1.64 patch with the flying upside down churchills...

1778820,TEKKEN 8,"[h1] Tekken 8: A Masterpiece of Pugilistic Excellence [/h1]

[b]Greetings, combatants![/b]

Starscream here, taking a brief respite from the chaos of war to share my thoughts on the latest installment of the Tekken saga: Tekken 8. In one word, this game is [i]amazing[/i].

[hr][/hr]

[b]Pros:[/b]

- The roster is like an army of Decepticons, each fighter unique and formidable.

The fighting mechanics are smoother than a well-oiled Cybertronian joint.
The visuals are as stunning as witnessing the awakening of Trypticon.
A plethora of moves and combos, like the tactical brilliance of a Seeker squadron in battle.

[b]Cons:[/b]

There are none, for this game is a flawless victory, unlike any conquest Megatron ever dreamed of achieving.

[hr][/hr]

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I have played this game since mid-2021, before the World 3 update.

I have spent.. I don't know, probably around $200-300 on this game? It's hard to say, I used to insta-buy packs when they popped up in game.

I spent so much money on this game because the Developer, LavaFlame2, was incredibly communicative and community-conscious in developing his game. He was always clear and decisive in his statements.

Then came the dreaded ""Pet Followers"" update. Lava, without any sort of notice, dropped an update in which you could roll in a gacha system to get a ""Pet"" that completely shattered the previously carefully curated game balance.

Now, most detractors have said ""It's a solo game, there's no leader board, no competition, who cares?? Get over it and stop playing if you don't like it"".. those posters are technically correct, but the issue is Lava spent YEARS pretending not to be this kind of developer. He literally edited statements out of his Steam page about the game ""not being pay to win.""

I spent money on this game because I loved Lava's attitude, approach, and message.. but sadly, he has chosen to cast off the community he built over the last several years. He is now chasing the quick buck via an unforgiving monetization system. You can't even gamble in the new system with the old currency.. I have ~6000 gems and can't roll for the broken ""pet"" because there is suddenly a new currency.

I could honestly have forgiven all of this, and waited to write this review for weeks/months after the aforementioned update, if Lava had just communicated with us. If he said ""Listen, I'm so sorry, I know this goes against what I stated previously, but I need to monetize this way for X/Y/Z reason"", I would have understood, forgiven him, and continued to spend the very limited budget I have for games on his projects.

Please.. I beg of you.. if you are some random Steam user reading this review, RUN and give your money to devs that aren't disingenuous snakes. Lava has seismically changed his development philosophy and REFUSED to engage with his own playerbase about it.. please don't be part of the next wave. LavaFlame2 should fail, because he saw the pain and confusion in his own community and was silent. To this day, MONTHS later, he has been completely and utterly silent about this controversy, despite very public statements from some of his older, most dedicated players. 

I don't count myself among the ranks of ""most dedicated,"" not by a mile. That said, I am a casual player that loved this game and spent more on it than I should have, and NEVER will spend again.

252490,Rust,"[b][u]Day 1[/u][/b]

I seem to have woken up on a mysterious island, I don't remember much. All I have is a rock.. I'm scared.
There seems to be no sign of other humans. I do not have any food or shelter yet, however, I was able to obtain a few logs by hitting a tree with this rock multiple times.. What a mysterious island.

[b][u]Day 2[/u][/b]

I have found a chicken, some more wood, and a few stones, I was able to conceive an amateur, handmade axe, it only took a few seconds to make, so I was able to kill the chicken too. I have also gathered a fairly large pile of wood, I might be able to build a makeshift shelter, but for now...
Tonight I feast.

[b][u]Day 3[/u][/b]

Today is the day, I will finally build a shelter, I can feel the warmth of a warm bed and fire already. I haven't felt this good since I was a child, playing with my toys, I remember one toy more than most, it was called a ""Steam"", ahh, the good ol' days.
I will be home soon. 
I promise.

[b][u]Day 4[/u][/b]

I'm sorry.
I have killed a man.
It all happened so fast, he was holding a gun, I was debating on making peace with him, but he seemed the brutal sort.
And all of his gear, it was... Enticing.
He must have had a family, but I am becoming selfish it seems, I don't care about the man that I have killed.
All that I can think of is one thing, not my family, not his family...
But tonight I feast.

[b][u]Day 5[/u][/b]

I've come across a small, abandoned town, there seems to be a lot of loot within the area.
The only problem is that I obtain a heavy dose of radiation if I go into the barriers.
I have a choice: Obtain what's necessary to survive and die from radiation, or live on how I am now.. In poverty.
I think I'll live.
Just for a while longer.

[b][u]Day 6[/u][/b]

I saw a man today, outside of my cabin, he was naked and he had a rock.. He seemed to have been yelling incomprehensible jibberish, he must be insane.. I remember when I was like that.
I still am in a way.

[b][u]Day 7[/u][/b]

I don't know what to do.
The man that I saw yesterday came into my cabin while I was asleep, he held a rock to my head and struck..
My life flashed before my eyes, stupid reflex, I grabbed my journal.
Remember when I said that I was coming home? Sadly my dear, you'll have to meet me in heaven.
I am bleeding out. I am in god's hands now.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"To start this review Im going to say that this game is not for everyone, while I do think everyone should try this game out, I am certain that there will be a lot of people who dont like this game. So I'll go through Pros and Cons first then just like a paragraph of other info.

Pros:
-Relatively cheap for the mileage you can get
-Blast with friends whether your good or not
-Great graphics
-Active devs
-About 30% of the community is actually very nice
-A lot of operators to fit your playstyle even if it fluctuates like me
-Plenty of maps to learn 
-Rewarding gameplay

Cons:
-Bugs and exploits can happen sometimes
-Ubisoft servers are trash most of the time when an update comes out
-A decent amount of the community is toxic
-Stressful and sometimes harmful gameplay
-Very high skill ceiling
-Ranked is very tense (Is sometimes a good thing)
-Casual is usually chill but sometimes people team kill or are dumb which can be annoying
-Very hard to learn
-Requires a huge amount of game sense

Conclusion:
I love this game personally and I started playing it right at the end of operation health which if you dont know was an entire season of the game taken to fix bugs, glitches, and exploits. This game has evolved heavily over time from a mediacore CSGO spin off to a very unique and fun FPS with millions of players platform wide. As with all character based games like overwatch and League Siege has a tier list and everyone has a main. I personally dont bother with the tier list on operators and I just play who I find fun or who I think will be great for the situation. My mains fluctuate a lot you could have asked me my main last week and I would've said: ""Fuck yeah dude Bandit main for life I inject heroin directly into my veins every day dude"". But this week it would be: ""Naw dude fuck Bandit, Echo main for life! I love sitting in the objective jerking my fucking cock"". But that's just me there are probably plenty of people with more stable mains. So yeah this game has a lot of stuff good and bad personally I love it I would recommend it to people who are into these kinda games. And if you buy it and love it or want someone to play with hit me up I have like 2 people I play it with and this game is so much more fun with friends.","Very Positive86% of the 1,043,127 user reviews for this game are positive.",im not_for certain dont pro con paragraph info pro relatively cheap mileage blast friend good not_great graphic active 30 community nice operator fit playstyle fluctuates plenty map learn rewarding con bug exploit happen server trash come decent community behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner stressful harmful high skill ceiling ranked tense good casual usually chill kill dumb annoying hard learn requires huge sense conclusion love personally started operation health dont season taken fix bug glitch exploit evolved heavily mediacore csgo spin unique fun shooter million player platform wide based game overwatch league tier personally dont bother tier operator play fun great situation main fluctuate asked last week fuck yeah dude bandit life i_emphasizednject heroin directly vein dude week naw dude fuck bandit echo life love sitting objective jerking fucking cock probably plenty stable main yeah stuff good bad personally love recommend kinda game love someone play 2 play fun friend
1449850,Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"As someone who used to love Yu-Gi-Oh, I actually enjoy the newer mechanics like Link monsters and such. However, the current state of competitive Yu-Gi-Oh has left me wanting. It feels like the game has become solely focused on having the precise exact counter to your opponent's combo. If you fail to draw your out, get ready to watch your opponent spend 5 minutes or more doing their combo, setting up multiple negations and counters, watching them go through the motions can last for what feels like an eternity. Then your turn and the rest of the match just becomes more of a spectator experience than an actual chance to play the game. It's less of an actual interactive player versus player card game and more of who gets the chance to solitaire first.

I'm sorry to say but I find it difficult to recommend Yu-Gi-Oh to anyone in its current state. It has transformed into one of the more frustrating time wasting modern card games out there. However, I suppose if you're willing to download and duel friends with some fun goofy decks then there's still some fun to be had somewhere in there. Otherwise it's just best to steer clear of this game.","Mostly Positive75% of the 69,676 user reviews for this game are positive.",someone love yu gi oh enjoy newer mechanic link monster state competitive yu gi oh left wanting feel solely focused precise exact counter opponent combo fail draw ready watch opponent spend 5 minute combo setting multiple negation counter watching motion last feel eternity turn rest spectator actual chance play actual interactive versus card get chance solitaire difficult recommend yu gi oh state transformed frustrating wasting modern card game suppose willing download friend fun goofy deck s_emphasizedtill fun best steer clear

I gave Warframe a shot. Sci-fi, rushy, run, gun and blade. Battle your way over generic enemies through generic structures or planet surfaces. Was fun, was free and that was it all.

2017
I, a forgotten tenno, came back to Warframe for another battle. I realized story fragments, enjoyed the narratives and understood some of the content and features. I saw that warframe can be whatever i need from a game. I took what i needed. Challenges, levelling, collecting loot and earning new equipment. Progress was satisfying. I saw that i delevoped and became a better tenno. I saw that Warframe changed and became a better game. But the possibilities made me fear the effort i would need to reach the stars. And after a while, in which i tried to reach perfection as a tenno, i abandoned Warframe again.

2019
The urge to serve a greater good is strong in me now. A tenno came back after he found his inner self on a journey of loneliness. I know the challenges and more will be there to come. I know my enemies and more will be after my soul. I know the way to perfection and more obstacles will be there to overcome. A tenno needs patience, mercy and will to understand this game and to see what lays beyond the obvious. A universe full of diverse content and a storytelling which brought tears into my eyes.

236390,War Thunder,"The game itself is great, but the business model it uses is utter garbage.

The game has beautiful graphics, is very well optimized, gameplay is great, the damage system is the most realistic ever made.

But then the devs business model steps in. They want you to spend money on it, of course that's natural, nobody works for free. But you can't purchase the game. You may purchase only a handful of ""special"" vehicles.
In a regular microtransation game business model, you are forced to grind to have items that you could have by paying extra money. If this is included in a game you already paid, many consider this itself a bad business model that does not respect the player's time and is bad game design. If it's included in a F2P game and the amount of money required to purchase all times by far exceeds the quality of the game and the market's average price, then it's considered pay to win. 

And what Gaijin Entertainment does? They DOUBLE IT DOWN, they make you pay so you can have the ""privilege"" of GRINDING LESS. But you still have to grind in one way or other. And it's no small amount of grind either. See the slug on their company's logo? That's an excellent allegory to the slugish progress you make in this game. After some point of the game, you are not allowed to have bad luck. If you kill less than two or three enemies in a match, you will lose money. If you kill 5 or 6 enemies AND your team wins the game, you MAY gain about 2% or 3% of the money you need to purchase the next vehicle.

Here is my current situation for example: I have a Tiger I tank. Every time my Tiger gets destroyed, I lose nearly 2500 to 3000 silver lions to repair it. Killing an enemy gives me around 1000 to 1200 silver lions, and you get about 3000 lions bonus if your brain dead teammates can actually help you to win the match. So I am forced to have a K/D ratio of 3.0 on every game so I can DREAM about buying my desired $170,000 Panther tank someday. After spending about 20 hours this weekend playing this game, keeping a positive K/D on most games I made about 80k lions. In two days of heavily grinding I got barely HALF of what I need to get ONE tank. And I am not even in the MIDDLE of the game, while endgame tanks costs over one million lions, so I can only expect things to get worse unless I start paying HUNDREDS of dollars to get premium currency that will still not grant me access to these vehicles in any way, and will just make things maybe SLIGHTLY easier. Even if killing moer advanced tanks will give me more money, repairing my more advanced tanks will also cost more moneys, which makes the game`s pace not change. So if I ever dream of unlocking all tanks so someday I can play with the Leopard II, I still need to sink 400 hours into this game, or pay the devs about 100 dollars of Premium currency to reduce my grind to ""just"" 200. And that's just one tank segment of one faction.To get access to all tanks in the game it would cost THOUSANDS of dollars plus THOUSANDS of grind hours, or if I wanted to remain not paying anything, maybe 20k hours? Yeah, imagine thinking it's okay to spend more time grinding in a game than you need to get a college degree.


Losing is part of every game, but this game punishes you by wasting your time and potentially taking away your money if you were iressponsible enough to spend it on this crap. Everytime I get a lucky kill by accidentaly flanking somebody I feel bad because I probably made somebody's day worse by pushing their progress back and I didn't even feel accomplished.
The entire game is designed around mining your earnings and make you spend money. You need to buy shltty vehicles you don't want to advance to the next tier. You need to purchase shltty vehicle modifications you don't need to have access to the ones you want. For every new vehicle you buy, you need to spend money so you can INVENT FIRE STINGUISHERS AGAIN. Everything. Everytime. Everywhere, you need to spend your money. You are not even entitled to choose the maps you want to play. You can choose ONE map out of the map rotation IF you accept to pay for their shltty subscription service. And there you go. Playing on a map you hate. A map deliberately poorly designed. You take a wrong turn. Your tank falls into a ditch, and guess what? GUESS WHAT? You must spend money to repair it.
Like, you have a Panzer IV Ausf. G, then you ""want"" to go to the Panzer IV Ausf H  (like, even if you don't want you have no choice, you are forced to researcha and purchase every useless vehicle in the tecthree to unlock new ones) Ausf. G you must research EVERYTHING again, despite the  Ausf. H being literally just the  Ausf. G with some useless armor plate skirts added.

Ah, and you must pay for the AMMO you use. That's serious.
I wonder how long it will take until they decide to charge us for the FUEL of the tanks. Or to pay wages to the tank crews. Like, they can use the excuse that they are trying to make the game more ""realistic"", and make you need to pay wages for the crews, pay for their dental plan, for their children's colleges. "" Wellcome back, your crewmember Hans has suffered a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital. 40k lions have been taken from your account to pay for his medical expenses"".

I would gladly pay $60 to play this game with at least all WW2 tanks.
But all their offers are laughable. They are right now charging 30 dollars for a shitty T-34 tank and people are buying it. Yes, you heard right. A SINGLE vehicle that is just a slight upgrade of an existing free version.

And yes, there is also the famous Russian bias. The devs are russians, and they are shamessly nationalistic and not afraid of trying to make their nation look the best. And how they do this in a game which takes pride of it's extremely realistic vehicle stats? If they lie about the vehicle specs people will just check them in Wikipedia to call them out. What they do? Simple! Match them in anachronic fights. The IS-2 only saw action in 1944, mostly fighting against Tiger II tanks and Jagdpanzers. So you make it show up early to fight 1942 Tiger I, Panzer IVs, and Shermans instead. The PT-76 was one of the most useless tanks of the Cold War? A light tank that could barely hold itself against infantry? Well then just make it show up TEN YEARS earlier to fight early WW2 tanks. But yet it all backfired. In this poor attempt to overcompensate their insecurity and irrational patriotism, the devs just accidentaly showed how bad Soviet armor was, by proving that is completely possible for a SHERMAN to kill Cold-War Soviet tanks. Hilarious.
I don't know about the Air Battles mode (I refuse to touch that mode with a ten foot pole. I'm h ere only for the tanks). But I heard from friends that Soviet planes are capable of ridiculously unrealistic feats.

On this state, I would refuse to spend 10 cents on this game. I just want to get a nice mug of black cofee in a rainy day, sit back and relax, drive my Tiger across the green hills while I listen to some classical music and calmly try to spot enemies with my bynoculars, and this is currently not possible with all the grinding pressure the game currently has.  I will come back again in a few years, maybe people will start to get tired of this game. Now there are no more new tanks to add. I don`t think they will be adding more modern aircraft because I doubt a game that prides itself of it`s realism would want to make F-15s and MiG-31s dogfight. (A F-4 vs. MiG-21 is the most modern dogfight you can get. More modern aerial warfare than that is basically just dots beeping in the radar and getting shot across the continent). Hopefully this game's development cycle will end soon, people will start to leave due the lack of new content, and the devs may reduce these ridiculous grinding requirements to attract people back. Until then, I would not recommend anybody to waste their time with this grindfest. Go play games that respect your time.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

[h1]🎩Small-talk:[/h1]
[i]Is the game even balanced?[/i]

[b]Smalltalk[/b]
Now many people do have questions about balance in asymmetrical games. Games like Friday 13th had the problem of the Killer being too strong while the newly released Resident Evil Resistance is a cakewalk for the survivors. Dead by Daylight on the other hand actually managed to become a truly balanced game. Back in 2016 and 2017, it was clearly a Survivor focused experience but with many updates, they managed to create a very pleasant and truly balanced experience.


[h1]🎮Gameplay:[/h1]
After almost reaching 400 hours in Dead by Daylight and reaching Rank 1 as a Survivor and reaching red ranks as a Killer I decided to review this game.

[b]Survivor Gameplay:[/b]
The main idea is pretty simple, you as the survivor will work and complete 5 engines that are scattered throughout the map. After completing these engines you will have to find one of the 2 exit gates and pull the gate trigger until they open. It sounds simple but you do have to realize that a Killer will give you problems while trying to complete the engines. Now you may ask, what can the survivor do in order to “fight” against the killer? You do have multiple available game tactics while using perks and items. There is a build that does allow you to run a killer for a lot longer, other builds allow you to hide and make the Killer lose time searching for you, and lastly, you got builds that do allow you to help your teammates. Obviously, there are a lot more builds but these are the most common ones. Items have multiple uses honestly, Toolboxes and their Add-ons do assists you at either breaking hooks are working faster on engines. Medkits do allow you to heal up pretty fast and the Flashlight has multiple uses against killers or blinding killers, you can even save a survivor friend from the killer’s grasp! The map obviously offers interactive areas for the Survivors, you do have pallets that you can throw on the killer. If you do happen to succeed in hitting the killer with a pallet you will successfully stun him for a couple of seconds.

[b]Killer Gameplay:[/b]
Now the Killers goal is pretty straight forward. You will have to kill all of the Survivors, simple right? Well not really. As a Killer, you should know when to chase and when not to chase. There are certain areas in each Map that are basically built to make the killer lose time. One good example is the Killer Shack and is basically build for the strengths of the survivor. Usually, you should avoid this building. Just like the survivors, you do get the options to run a variety of builds. One difference is the fact that some Perks do work exclusively with Totems. These totems are usually lit which means that survivors usually tend to break them. Killers cannot use any items other than their unique abilities but they can use offerings and Add-ons just like the Survivors. In order to completely kill a survivor, you will have to hook him 3 times. Lastly, if you have killed 3 of the 4 survivors you can try to find the Hatch which works basically as a secondary exit for the survivors. If you find it first you can simply close it, after that the 2 exit gates will be powered.

[b]Other aspects:[/b]
[*]A Mori is a very powerful offering that allows the Killer to kill a survivor after his second hook.

[*]The game offers custom modes as well basically playing with friends.

[*]Dead by Daylight offers daily challenges as well as weekly ones. The weekly ones usually tend to give insight and a small story for each character, doesn’t matter if it’s a killer of a survivor.
[/list]

[h1]🎭Story:[/h1]
The survivors are pulled into the Entity's constructed world when they wander too close to the places the killers were taken from, disappearing from the real world without a trace. They end up at a lonely campfire, where they rest between trials until a killer pursues them again. This basically is an endless cycle. Each trial takes place in a series of realms constructed by the Entity of areas from where the killers were taken. The survivors' only hope of escape is to complete a series of generators scattered throughout each realm to power up large gates to escape. If the killer has killed all but one survivor, the Entity will offer the latter a final means of escape in the form of a hatch. Escaping from the grounds always takes the survivors back to the campfire, and offerings can be created to be burnt at it and appeal for the Entity's favor. Since the Entity feeds off the hope of the survivors to escape, it helps them just as much as the killers, acting as an impartial observer of the hunt, stepping in only to claim those hung on its hooks. The Entity is the essence of evil basically.

[h1]🌇Graphics / Audio:[/h1]
The game makes use of Unreal Engine 4 which gives this game a unique and creepy look. Obviously not the best looking game but it does look decent enough.

[*] [b]Audio / Soundtrack:[/b]
The audio is pretty basic yet extremely effective. Every time you’re being chased by the killer the “chase” music starts playing basically adding the sense of danger to the game. The more distance you build the more the chase music lessens in volume until there is no chase anymore. The survivors do make grunting sounds while being injured and so do the killers after being hit with a pallet. Some killers do have licensed music as well and it truly is a very good addition. The game is truly awesome when it comes to the audio part.

[h1]⚙️Performance:[/h1]                    
Sadly the performance is terrible when it comes to some older devices or even Mid-range devices which is crazy when you consider that this game doesn’t even look that amazing.

[b]In Game:[/b]
[*]AMD Ryzen 5 3700X 4,5Ghz, 32GB Ram 3200 Mhz, Nvidia RTX 2070 Super 8GB, 500GB nvme Western Digital:

I was running the game on Maxed out settings in 1080p with120fps.

Some people with GTX 1050ti’s and GTX 760s tend to go under 30fps in certain maps which is just crazy in my opinion.

[*] [b]Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:[/b]
In 370 hours of annoying poor killers, I had a plethora of game-breaking bugs and many many glitches. Luckily with the most recent updates, the game has become a lot more stable even with low-end devices,
[/list]

[h1]⚖️Conclusion:[/h1]
DBD currently is the best asymmetrical multiplayer game available. The depth of the mechanics and skill set is just amazing as well as the community. Sadly bad performance and bugs make this game a hit or miss for some people.

[h1]📉Overall rating:81/ 100 [/h1]

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Update: Now that Safer Seas has been out for a while I think it's fair to say that many people within the community are disappointed. For a lot of us Safer Seas was a lifeline for this game. Many of us were holding onto the hope that we could finally enjoy the game but I haven't wanted to play SoT since Safer Seas released. With no real reward for grinding, not being able to use your own ships, not being able to co-op with other friendly pirates and being extremely limited on what you can and cant do ruins any fun aspects that the game had left. 

I only started playing at the beginning of season 10, I obsessed over this game until Safer Seas released only because I was counting on the fact Safer Seas would be better and more enjoyable gameplay for someone like myself. I can't even bring myself to log into the game anymore as it as tremendously boring. While I enjoyed my time on the high seas, pvp its not something that I want do all the time and I think players should be able to enjoy Sea of Thieves in both peaceful and pvp settings. Almost all other games have some form of PVE or Non-Friendly fire servers. 

I hope that as Safer Seas ages, changes are made to include the ""peaceful"" community.



Original Review: My younger sister has been playing SoT on and off for years now. She finally convinced me to purchase the game a few weeks ago. Since I've played for over 100 hours, reached Pirate Legend and have really enjoyed my voyages on the seas. The game is filled with content and things to do, beautiful places and in depth stories but actually enjoying the story and PVE aspects of SoT is almost impossible.

Not knowing the tricks and tips that the well versed community have access too as a new player can make the game seem impossible to play, I was shocked that the servers were not skill or level based match making. Because of this it is somewhat annoying that you cant have private servers or even just PVE servers.

While I understand where some of the concerns come from within the 'pro pvp' community of SoT, I do not see how adding a PVE side to the game would hurt SoT. If anything, I think it would make the PVP aspect better by filtering out the players who are sailing to enjoy the lore and don't want to involve themselves in the PVP aspect (which is totally valid and okay).

As a new player I really don't think I'd recommend getting this game to others. It is hard to get into without help, especially if many of the players sharing your servers do not respect the ""Pirate Code"", the toxicity that some of these seasoned players show is disheartening and unwelcoming to newcomers. While I have met a handful of fun and nice players over the last few weeks the bad experiences overshadow the good ones.

I hope that with Safer Seas being implemented we will see more changes for PVE players and in general a more enjoyable experience for everyone.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",safer sea fair community disappointed safer sea lifeline holding onto hope finally enjoy wanted play sot safer sea released no_real reward repeatedly performing action gain resource not_being able ship not_being able mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal friendly pirate extremely limited cant ruin fun aspect left started beginning season 10 obsessed safer sea released counting safer sea be_emphasizedtter enjoyable someone bring log anymore tremendously boring enjoyed high sea versus not_something player able enjoy peaceful versus setting game form versus environment non friendly fire server hope safer sea age change include peaceful community original younger sister sot year finally convinced purchase week ago 100 hour reached pirate legend enjoyed voyage sea filled thing beautiful place depth story enjoying versus environment aspect sot impossible not_knowing trick tip versed community access impossible play shocked server not_skill based somewhat annoying cant private server versus environment server understand concern highly skilled experienced player_emphasized versus community sot not_see adding versus environment side hurt sot versus aspect filtering player sailing enjoy lore involve versus aspect totally valid okay t_emphasizedhink recommend others hard help especially player sharing server not_respect pirate code toxicity seasoned player disheartening unwelcoming newcomer met handful fun nice player last week bad experience overshadow good one hope safer sea implemented change versus environment player general enjoyable

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Star Wars Jedi Survivor is a very good action/adventure game, it is the sequel to Jedi Fallen Order and continues the story some time after the end of the first one. We still follow the story of Cal Kestis, 5 years after the first opus, the crew is separated in the galaxy and you will be again embarked in a new story with many twists. The game is also very interested in the High Republic era and makes many references to the extended universe. There are very good action sequences and the cinematics are also very well done, the character development is also very good.

The game is very similar to the previous one but with a huge improvement on all levels. The main problem of the previous game which was for me the level design is really better in this one, especially thanks to the fast travel that avoids you to get lost while trying to reach your next objective. 
For the combat, they have also been greatly improved with now 5 lightsaber stances that each have their own skill tree. The exploration is a real pleasure, the addition of the grappling hook adds a real plus to the game, the annex areas are much larger with this very numerous and varied item/skin to loot. The bestiary is also very complete with different creatures for each planet, new enemies for the empire and a new faction using old separatist droids.

The character customization has also been greatly improved, you can now modify the hairstyle, the beard as well as the top, the jacket and the pants with many color variations. The saber customization is the best we have had so far in a star wars game in my opinion and is even more advanced than in fallen order. 
There is also a ""hub"" with a shop where you can buy various things and a saloon where you can unlock some nice stuff while exploring the planets.

In conclusion, this game is a must play for all star wars fans. If you liked the previous one, you can only like this one, as mentioned above it's like the first one but with a clear improvement in all the gameplay. If you didn't play the first one, you won't understand much of the story, there is a little recap but the best is to do fallen order first.

1623730,Palworld,"Review update on 1/29/24 after another 20 hours of playtime:

I am now level 20, and while I have unlocked my third base, I still need to set it up.  I ended up moving the first base once I had my second base set up due to poor placement on my part.  I then moved that base to a very naturally protected area spot that has a ton of ore so I have nothing at that base really besides mining and refining.  My second base, while not in a good spot to defend, I plan on moving later, but it is my production base; all that goes on there is production stuff.  

I already know where I will place my next base as it has a lot of wood and ore.  I have yet to set it up, as I took a lot of time moving stuff from my original base to the new base and moving things between the second base and the base that replaced my first.    

I did spend some time on one of the sanctuaries getting some Pals that I wanted that I heard are good at mining, but mostly my time has been moving my first base after the second was established and setting that base back up.  

I am still learning a lot and have avoided as many spoilers as possible because half the fun of this game is learning the ropes.

Original Review from 1/21/24 after Initial couple hours of playtime.

I have yet to read many of the reviews, but the few I have were all good, and after buying the game, I see why.  I love survival, crafting games, and adding to the mix having a bunch of cute little critters helping you do tasks is too fun.  I have played ARK a fair bit, and this game already passes ARK in many areas. They are not strictly related but have the same general premise, build, and tame.   I highly recommend the game, and my first two hours flew by.  I had zero technical problems, and the game ran without frame drops, crashes, or clipping issues.  It is one of the best EA games I have played in a while that already appears to be as well done as many fully released games.   I will note that I played single-player only, so I can't speak of the game's multiplayer aspects.","Very Positive94% of the 220,720 user reviews for this game are positive.",1 29 24 20 hour playtime 20 unlocked third base set ended moving base base set due poor placement moved base naturally protected spot ton ore base besides mining refining base not_in good spot defend plan moving production base go production stuff already next base wood ore set took moving stuff original base base moving thing base base replaced spend on_emphasizede sanctuary pal wanted heard good mining mostly moving base established setting base learning avoided spoiler possible half fun learning rope original 1 21 24 initial couple hour playtime read review good buying love survival crafting game adding mix bunch cute critter helping task fun ark fair bit already pass ark area not_strictly related general premise build tame highly recommend hour flew zero technical problem ran frame drop crash clipping issue best ea game already appears released game note single speak mode multiple player interact compete real aspect

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"[h1]It's the same formula since Far Cry 3 and it somehow still works fine enough...[/h1]

...but not anymore after this. Playing a new old Far Cry game every three to four years worked well enough for the past decade, but if Ubisoft doesn't want to run this franchise into the ground, they really need to come up with something completely new and fresh next time around.

The Dunia engine has seen better days and while it still looks very good and has been optimized to the point where it basically runs almost flawlessy, the visual differences and improvements compared to Far Cry 4 and 5 are marginal at best. Far Cry's visual quality has been the same for a decade now and it sure as hell doesn't change with Far Cry 6. As always, the voice acting is decent, too, and the beefy weapon sounds make the gunplay very satisfying, but as someone who is not into latin music at all (to be honest i find it rather annoying), I was anything but happy with the soundtrack this time, even though it is fitting for the setting of course.

Speaking of the setting, It's another major point where Far Cry 6 really feels like it's standing still: This time the game draws some big inspiration from the 1950s Cuban Revolution (Che Guevara and Fidel Castro and sh*t...), so it takes place on another tropical jungle island. Almost every Far Cry game has it's own unique and interesting setting but to be set on a jungle island for the third time now after Far Cry 1 and 3 shows Ubisoft is really running out of good ideas for the franchise. Far Cry 6's map is the biggest in the series yet, but due to the well-known setting it also is the most stale and boring one.

Storywise it's not really the most interesting Far Cry game either: Our latin Soap MacTavish-Lookalike protagonist (if you chose the male character that is) wants to flee the fictional island Yara (say: Cuba) with his friends: The island is ruled by a massmurdering dictator, who opresses Yara's population and uses them as slave workers and test subjects for the cancer medication that is made of the tabacco plants only indigenous on Yara (cancer cure through tobacco, the irony is not lost on me here). Who would have thought, the attempted escape goes wrong, his (or her) friends end up dead and our protagonist becomes a key figure in the ongoing revolution.

The well-established concept of the charismatic, fascinating villain, which has become somewhat of a series trademark since Far Cry 3 still works, but less so than in previous games. ""El presidente"" Anton Castillo is still a proper grade-A a*sshole that you love to hate but he is far from the entertaining value of a Vaas Montenegro or the moral complexity and ambivalence of a Joseph Seed. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast in Far Cry 6 doesn't work well at all. Most of the characters are just bland and boring, and many of them are downright obnoxious and cringe (that awful HipHop duo, oh my god). Far Cry became somewhat dependent on interesting characters because without them the gameplay is mostly reduced to hollow and redundant open-world busy work with zero motivation, but luckily Castillo saves the sinking ship. Barely.
In addition, the game tries hard to acknowledge a lot of serious topics like brutal regimes, torture, slavery, genocide, oppression, civil war and even stuff like modern aspects of sexuality (Transgender, LGBQT,...), but it doesn't take those topics serious enough at all and is often unfittingly childish with downright inept humor and idiotic cringy oneliners. Far Cry 6 almost deliberatly paints the picture that civil war and revolution are more of a big party than a brutal deadly conflict, so it falls flat on it's ass in this regard. 

The gameplay is familiarly simplistic and casual, but still satisfying in a weird way. You still run, drive or fly over the huge map on foot or with various means of transportation (cars, motorcycles, airplanes, helicopters, quadbikes, parachutes, wingsuits, boats, fast-travel, you name it...), doing tiny, repetitive sidequest after sidequest (conquering outposts and checkpoints, driving timed races, hunting animals, destroying anti-aircraft guns, etc.) and inbetween tackle one of the main missions that push the story forward. It's the archetype of monotonous open-world busy work, that sooner or later will undoubtely p*ss off anybody but the hardest hardcore completionists. Furthermore, you can't even dip your tiny toe into the water without almost immediately and constantly being harrassed by Barracudas and sharks and as always they were very lazy with the NPC models (Yara is full of clones). Only the few DLC like ""The Vanishing"" or ""Lost between Worlds"" break up the monotony a bit, but they all are very short and don't last longer than a handful of hours each. But honestly, thanks to the still very satisfying gunplay and stealth mechanics and beautiful, vast environment there is some considerable amount of fun left in exploring the island and surviving gun fights with the impressive and varied arsenal of guns and explosives. Far Cry remains one of the ultimate ""mayhem simulators"" and apart from GTA (and maybe Just Cause), it is still unrivaled in entertaining- and production value when it comes to games that just let you lose on a huge open world to just cause all kinds of chaos and trouble.

Far Cry 6 once more proves the unwritten Far Cry law of quality: The odd numbers are the really great ones, while the even numbers just retain the qualitative status quo set by the previous game. As was already the case with Far Cry 2 and 4, Far Cry 6 is less fun and exciting, less polished and less innovative and creative as its predecessor. If you've played any Far Cry game since Far Cry 3, you already know exactly what to expect here, nothing more, nothing less. Far Cry fans will still love it, for everybody else it might have gotten stale and boring by now. But anyways Far Cry 6 is still a bona-fide triple A game, that you can hardly resist to enjoy at least for a few hours, even if you try to. The gameplay might feel stale and repetitive by now, but there is still something deeply meditative about traversing Far Cry 6's picturesque landscape and just stab some people from behind with a machete and blow sh*t up.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"After ~210 hours and almost three months, I've finally completed the game (I'm a completionist and a slow player who likes to absorb the world carefully and slowly, explore everything, read everything a couple of times, etc).

The sheer level of complexity of interconnected stories, dialogues, outcomes, various characters, and factions is simply unbelievable. Hats off to Larian for managing to create such a rich, complex and meaningful world with hundreds of characters, dozens of factions and interesting groups, vast maps with an abundance of interesting locations to explore and secrets to uncover... While being almost completely nonlinear and giving players the opportunity to do everything in the way they want to do it.

Pros:

- Character models and animations (especially facial animations) are some of the best I've ever seen. It adds so much to the immersion. No matter how important or unimportant an NPC is.

- Superb voice acting, done with so much love, passion and care. And most importantly, with an understanding of the characters they give voices to.

- Generally, the writing is great. It successfully balances Larian's signature humour and silliness with a more macabre and serious tone of the world and the game's story.

- A diverse cast of memorable companions with their own agendas, personalities, personal stories and major questlines. I will miss every single one of them.

- Combat is mostly fun and rewarding. It rewards a tactical approach, experimenting and thinking out of the box.

- Every encounter is a meaningful experience, every combat is hand-crafted, every questline a story on its own, and every location is a unique place. There are no fillers or padding.

- Dozens upon dozens of interesting side stories and quests of various scales and importance.

- Great level design with attention to detail. It’s a pure joy to explore various locations and just look around.
 
- Memorable and multilayered villains with distinctive personalities and agendas.

- Amazing music by Borislav Slavov. Kirill Pokrovsky would be proud.

- Excellent implementation of D&D rules into a video game.

Cons:

- The game's tempo varies. In the early game, it seems that some relationships with companions are developing extremely fast. On the other hand, in Act 3, there is a dichotomy between the urgency of the main quest and the amount of quests, side stories and general stuff you can do and explore in the city of Baludr's Gate.

- Bugs and some general unpolishness become much more obvious in Act 3. Luckily, Larian is actively working on ironing out everything and making the experience truly complete.

- There are some balance issues when it comes to combat, gear, and classes. But that’s also something that will be fixed over time.

- Inventory and companion managing is absolutely horrendous, by far the weakest spot of the game. It’s a nightmare when you try to juggle between characters, find and store items, etc. Recommend using modes for this.

- I personally don't like that almost every companion is player-sexual. It kinda kills their uniqueness and takes away from the immersion when they can all fall in love with you.

- The game should have some kind of a codex where it will store all books and notes that you find, info about characters you’ve met, info about the types of enemies you have encountered, etc.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 505,051 user reviews for this game are positive.",210 hour three month finally completed completionist slow like absorb world carefully slowly explore read couple time sheer complexity interconnected story dialogue outcome character faction simply unbelievable hat larian managing rich complex meaningful world hundred character dozen faction interesting group vast map abundance interesting location explore secret uncover completely nonlinear giving player opportunity pro model animation especially facial animation best add immersion no_matter important unimportant non controlled artificial superb voice acting love passion care importantly understanding character voice generally writing great successfully balance larian s_emphasizedignature humour silliness macabre serious tone world s_emphasizedtory diverse cast memorable companion agenda personality personal story major questlines miss single combat mostly fun rewarding reward tactical approach experimenting box encounter meaningful combat hand crafted questline location unique no_fillers padding dozen dozen interesting side story quest scale importance great design attention detail pure joy explore location memorable multilayered villain distinctive personality agenda amazing music borislav slavov kirill pokrovsky proud excellent implementation d_emphasized rule video con tempo varies early relationship companion developing extremely fast hand act dichotomy urgency task objective given non quest side story general stuff explore baludr bug general unpolishness obvious act luckily larian actively working ironing truly complete balance issue come combat gear class fixed inventory companion managing horrendous far weakest spot nightmare juggle character item recommend mode personally companion sexual kinda kill uniqueness take immersion fall love kind codex book note info character met info type enemy encountered

I can confirm I will not be buying this game. I won't support this title either. No steam achievements, no purchase. 

This review was made during the free weekend so as of tomorrow, the game will leave my account and never will return unless they change their mind and add steam achievements that consoles and uplay already have.

Ubisoft would rather have staff spend time moderating the steam forum to delete or move people's posts about wanting steam achievement, which will never end, instead of spending a fraction of that time just implementing the steam achievements. They could have saved all that time and spent it on something more productive instead.","Mostly Positive71% of the 17,395 user reviews for this game are positive.",confirm achievement not_supported title ubi milky developer dec 17th 2022 confirm not_be buying support title no_steam achievement no_purchase weekend tomorrow leave never_will unless mind add achievement console uplay already rather staff spend moderating forum delete move post wanting achievement never_end spending fraction implementing achievement saved spent productive

The game also comes with a newly built in feature known as The Great Filtering. It's the tutorial boss that bullies players who refuse to listen to the handler about using their assault boost and pulse blade to defeat the boss and as such the community is kept pure with only the highest caliber of player. 10/10 would recommend.","Very Positive90% of the 50,561 user reviews for this game are positive.",truly phenomenal core nearly 10 year finally mech building fantasy combat tight snappy boss intense memorable 3 ending pushing 100 hr mark onto working rank versus definitely plenty price come newly built known great filtering tutorial bos bully player refuse listen handler assault boost pulse blade defeat bos community pure highest caliber 10_emphasized recommend

2161700,Persona 3 Reload,"The game looks and feels great to play. However, ATLUS have made some bizarre choices with the graphics settings that cause problems. 

For reference, I have played on both my Steamdeck and my brand new RTX 4070 PC. 

The game has Ray Tracing which cannot be disabled, even if you turn off the badly named ""reflections"" setting which is the Ray Tracing setting, and even if you set Ray Tracing to 0 in the ini code. Turning off reflections will cause the game to perform better, but it'll still have areas with ray tracing that hasn't been turned off. For example the lights in Tartarus. 

There are areas like the mall which will absolutely tank your Steamdeck no matter what you do, and lower the framerate to the 60s even on the best devices. 

The most egregious thing for me was how the game spikes in memory requirements and crashes. It crashed multiple times for me, specifically in the entrance to Tartarus, because there was ""not enough memory"". On my pc with 16gb RAM and 12gb VRAM????? Was it experiencing SPIKES and then crashing because the memory was allocated elsewhere, because that's how PCs work???

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"[h1] Long Detailed Post Warning [/h1]
my hours are misleading, my real in-game hours in total is actually pretty close to 9000 at the time of writing this.
[b] Cons: [/b]
[u] Disclaimer: [/u] many of these are subjective and even pros to some people, there is also no specific order to this list.

the binding coils of bahamut raid at the end of a realm reborn is very story relevant and time sensitive but completely optional, and players can play through the entire game never knowing this

the story is around 70% of the games depth of content and takes some serious time to start feeling like something unique and can chase people away for taking so long.

most problems with the game are brushed off as being the fault of an archaic game code and limited resources on part of the allocated development team by both [strike] small indie company [/strike] square enix and the community and you'll be told off for complaining in the first place as if you're not grateful for everything good and shouldn't criticize anything regardless of the praises you sing, expect this in the comments im allowing lol

zones and instances can break immersion coming from more strictly open world experiences

there is a hard limit to the amount of player characters that can be on screen at once and this will cause phasing in and out in some areas every few steps, conflicting with npcs being clickable. This also effects certain pve events such as event fates and NMs like hunts.

animations during cutscenes can be a little jarring and the head bob and repeated mouth motion for even sad parts can break the tone until and unless you get used to it sometimes being unintentionally comedic when its clear there was effort put into it (see: [spoiler]the Milk cutscene in the weapons trials storyline.[/spoiler] you know the one.)

the glamour (transmog/weapon and armor appearance) system is restrictive and limited Mods can solve this but the visual will be client side only of course, this is the number 1 thing WoW absolutely slaps this game in the face over indisputably

classes have a correct rotation or a few correct variants that are not always intuitive enough to pick up on without outside guides, this correct rotation is intentional in design but there is no in-game tools for learning it by yourself, Suggestion that someone is not performing well enough even at endgame can result in a ban regardless of third party tool usage and called harassment regardless of politeness. Silent kicks are actively encouraged and if someone asks why and you tell them, that can also be punished.

the character creation options are very limited and some races are even restrictive in some cases.

the optional cash shop is almost insultingly overpriced on many items (40$ for a mount, 10$ emotes, 10$ pets - for reference a new expansion is 40$ in total.), and paying for additional retainers for extra ventures and sale slots could be considered pay to win although only in an in-game currency kind of way.

botting is rampant in gathering and crafting, as well as marketboard hawking for price adjustment competition, and housing plot camping its easy enough to spot but extremely hard to get anything done about, there is like, a good 60% chance that anyone you see with a pternodon mount botted.

there is an illusion of choice in the narrative which changes nothing no matter what is selected except for a few lines of dialogue usually amounting to ""funny you said that but here is what we are doing anyway"" with like, one or two exceptions in some side content.

the housing system is overcrowded on every server and biased towards players who already own plots, it is also abusable through the FC housing system and alts, especially with an auto-clicker bot.

PvP is very dead and generally looked down on by most players despite it not being so bad at all, however the win trading and healer meta can be a turn off in competitive so frontline tends to be the only queue that pops for a non-premade player.

third party tools such as damage meters are against ToS, while gms and the devs themselves have said they will look the other way as long as harassment isnt an issue for anyone using them, as they don't monitor client-side things.

endgame progression, after you've gotten geared up, is mostly what you make it. it has a definitive ending and it is quick and simple to get there once you understand the pattern, although i obsess and still play daily despite being completely done and even having every triple triad card, there is no denying an obvious drought of difficult content that optimal gear sets can be used for.

because of the lack of variance in class rotations, two players who perform equally as well will have 0 differences between them, there is nothing that seperates you from another of the same class other than gear, skill and race, theres no trees or passives or anything that change the way something is played to make you potentially different like in other games.

some classes are very ping reliant

[b]Pros:[/b] 

despite everything listed above the community is warm and welcoming and the players are usually genuinely kind and helpful as a majority.

the story is incredible, easily one of the best final fantasys and jrpgs, i'd put it as a top 3 or at least top 5 for its own series and top 10 for best jrpgs.

the OST is inspired, soken studied nobuo during heavensward and it shows, at least 90% of the music are complete bangers and really set the tone for whatever you're doing.

crafting and gathering systems are unique and even fun, they have rotations that function like battle classes and mini games and even somewhat of an endgame to them that could have you even main them if you'd like.

you can fish and its fun.

every battle class feels very unique in both playstyle and aesthetic/animation compared to each other even despite some sharing armor pieces.

the game is incredibly well balanced and every class is both viable and valued for its unique type of contribution for its group.

every piece of content in the game except ultimate fights (of which there are only 3) are capable of being done with only pugs through the party listing system, and any normal content in the MSQ is done through the matchmaking system duty finder. (proof: i pugged e1s-e12s)

you literally never have to do any kind of dailies for any reason beyond currency, leveling, mount collecting, or completionism and they will always be there to do forever in case you choose not to at the moment but may want to later.

you can play this entire game completely by yourself without verbally interacting with anyone, ever, and still have a very immersive mmo experience, and this is intended by the developers who are even now backtracking through older expansions to introduce systems like Trust designed to allow a solo player the chance to only use NPCs as a party in dungeons and trials if desired.

the developers respect their community and listen to feedback for the most part, and are swift to rectify most bugs and gripes.

every consecutive fight tends to introduce something new and you always feel like you're learning new things like mechanics, movement and mindset, all the way up to level cap.

the aesthetic of the game has something for everyone and is just eye candy during some segments, animations and visuals during encounter cinematics specifically.

most if not all of your personal grievances during your first few weeks with the game you will find to be fixed or removed in future expansions. (ex. english voice acting in ARR)

the grindiest parts of the game are still enjoyable to a fault, and always optional.

most systems in game are explained very well and that overwhelmed feeling a new player usually gets in a new mmo is handled gracefully through the games natural progression if given time.

you will never feel like you missed out on something important for your understanding of the game, story, characters, etc.","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",long detailed post warning hour misleading real hour total pretty close 9000 writing con disclaimer subjective pro no_specific order binding coil bahamut large group player tackling difficult challenge realm reborn relevant sensitive completely optional player play never_knowing 70 game depth take serious feeling unique chase taking long problem brushed fault archaic code limited resource allocated development strike small indie company strike square enix community told complaining not_grateful good criticize praise sing expect comment im allowing lol zone instance break immersion strictly open world experience hard limit character screen cause phasing area step conflicting npc clickable effect certain versus environment event event fate nm hunt animation cutscenes jarring bob repeated mouth motion sad part break tone unless unintentionally comedic clear effort spoiler milk cutscene weapon trial storyline spoiler glamour transmog weapon armor appearance restrictive limited mod solve visual client side course number 1 wow slap face indisputably class correct rotation correct variant not_always intuitive pick guide correct rotation intentional design no_in tool learning suggestion someone not_performing endgame result ban third party tool usage called harassment politeness silent kick actively encouraged someone asks punished creation option limited race restrictive case optional cash shop insultingly overpriced item 40 mount 10 emotes 10 pet reference major addition add feature mechanic 40 total paying additional retainer extra venture sale slot considered pay win currency kind botting rampant gathering crafting marketboard hawking price adjustment competition housing plot waiting strategic location ambush defeat player enemy easy spot extremely hard good 60 chance pternodon mount botted illusion choice narrative change no_matter selected except line dialogue usually amounting funny anyway exception side housing overcrowded computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player biased towards player already plot abusable fc housing alt especially auto clicker bot versus dead generally looked player despite not_being bad win trading healer effective popular strategy character build turn competitive frontline tends queue pop non premade third party tool damage meter tos gm long harassment isnt issue monitor client side thing endgame progression gotten geared mostly it_emphasized definitive ending quick simple understand pattern ob play daily despite completely triple triad card no_denying obvious drought difficult optimal gear set lack variance class rotation player perform equally 0 difference seperates class gear skill race there no_trees passive potentially different game class ping reliant pro despite listed community warm welcoming player usually genuinely kind helpful majority incredible easily best fantasy jrpgs top 3 top 5 series top 10 best jrpgs ost inspired soken studied nobuo heavensward show 90 music complete banger set tone whatever crafting gathering system unique fun rotation function battle class mini game somewhat endgame fish fun battle class feel unique playstyle aesthetic animation compared despite sharing armor piece incredibly balanced class viable valued unique type contribution group piece except ultimate fight 3 capable pug party listing normal msq matchmaking duty finder proof pugged e1s e12s literally never_have kind daily currency leveling mount collecting completionism forever choose not_to moment play completely verbally interacting immersive massively multiplayer intended developer backtracking older expansion introduce system trust designed allow solo chance npc party dungeon trial desired developer respect community listen feedback swift rectify bug gripe consecutive fight tends introduce learning thing mechanic movement mindset cap aesthetic eye candy segment animation visuals encounter cinematics not_all personal grievance week fixed removed future expansion ex english voice acting arr grindiest part enjoyable fault optional system explained overwhelmed feeling usually get massively multiplayer handled gracefully game natural progression given never_feel missed important understanding character

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"After spending considerable time immersed in ""Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"" I've found it to be an exemplary piece of interactive storytelling. The narrative is exceptional and is both engaging and profound. The attention to world-building is remarkable, providing a depth that captivates from the onset.

My primary critique centers around the game's combat mechanics, which feel somewhat disjointed and in need of further polishing. Specifically, the timing for parries is challenging to master, and there appears to be inconsistency with the activation of certain combo inputs, leading to moments of frustration. Additionally, I would have favored a gameplay design that focused on controlling a single protagonist, with the other character serving as an AI companion, reminiscent of the dynamic seen in ""God of War."" This, I believe, would have offered a more streamlined and focused gameplay experience.

Visually, the game ranges from satisfactory to stunning. The developers have clearly dedicated a great deal of effort into the presentation of cutscenes, which are both immersive and beautifully crafted, drawing the player deeper into the game's narrative. However, the sound design presents a mixed bag. While it can be exceptionally immersive, particularly in environmental storytelling and key narrative moments, it falls short in combat scenarios. This inconsistency occasionally detracts from the overall experience, leaving engagements feeling somewhat underwhelming. Additionally, the game's musical score shines brilliantly during certain scenes, such as the poignant moment the protagonist finds themselves awakening on a beach. Yet, outside these highlights, the soundtrack tends to fade into the background, marred further by a noticeable looping issue post-release, where at least one track abruptly stops and restarts at inappropriate times.

The Foley work, especially in terms of character movement and during cutscenes, stands out as a highlight for me, showcasing a meticulous attention to detail. Voice acting within the game is varied, with the majority delivering exceptional performances that enhance the narrative's impact.

It's evident that the development team drew inspiration from the ""Witcher"" series, as seen in the game's animations, user interface, and overall feel of the game. Despite these similarities, ""Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden"" secures its place among my favorite games, primarily due to its superb writing and atmospheric depth. I am eagerly looking forward to a sequel, hopeful that it will continue to build upon this strong foundation.",Very Positive88% of the 563 user reviews for this game are positive.,spending considerable immersed banishers found exemplary piece interactive storytelling narrative exceptional engaging profound attention world building remarkable providing depth captivates onset primary critique center combat mechanic somewhat disjointed polishing timing parry challenging master appears inconsistency activation certain combo input leading moment frustration favored design focused controlling single protagonist serving ai companion reminiscent dynamic god war believe offered streamlined focused visually range satisfactory stunning developer clearly dedicated great deal effort presentation cutscenes immersive beautifully crafted drawing deeper narrative sound design present mixed bag exceptionally immersive environmental storytelling key narrative moment fall short combat scenario inconsistency occasionally detracts leaving engagement feeling somewhat underwhelming musical score shine brilliantly certain scene poignant moment protagonist find awakening beach highlight soundtrack tends fade background marred noticeable looping issue post release track abruptly stop restarts inappropriate time foley especially term movement cutscenes stand highlight showcasing meticulous attention detail voice acting varied majority delivering exceptional performance enhance narrative impact evident development drew inspiration witcher series animation user interface despite similarity banishers secures favorite game primarily due superb writing atmospheric depth eagerly forward sequel hopeful continue build strong foundation
1158310,Crusader Kings III,"A good continuation of the excellent ck 2. Redesigned the system of the army (in my opinion, so for the better), religion and culture, improved graphics, etc.

I think the game is more suitable for a new audience, since it is much simpler than ck 2 and players familiar with the series will be bored. Personally, the game could not particularly tighten me, as well as my friends who played the previous part ( by the way, I played 1K hours in ck 2). In the future, most likely, the game will be updated and saturated with new mechanics. But at the moment, as I have already written, the game is more intended for beginners than for old players.

Result: people who may have found ck 2 difficult and were afraid to play it because of this-this part is perfect for exploring the series. For old players, I rather recommend waiting for updates and of course DLC (Yes, what did you expect from paradoxes?).

1599340,Lost Ark,"On 3-2-2022 I received a permanent ban on Lost Ark for Commerce Lock.

The reason I was told I received this ban was due to a refund of a steam purchase I had made of the Founders pack of Lost Ark before the game Launched for early head start. Purchase was originally made in August of 2021 and Refunded on Jan 30th 2022.  I have screen Shots of all mentioned transactions.

The reason I did this refund was because I was trying to decided on which founders pack was of the most value to me and could provide the most benefit.  I ended up deciding the next day Jan 31st to purchase all packs offered (Including the Founders Pack I was Banned For) and I continued to purchase all available packs that were released after. 

This ban should be reversed as customers like myself who not only did not realize we were doing a ban able offence, but as well a lot of players have invested money into your game with all packs, gems, etc. 

It is unfair and unjust practice to be banned from playing due to mistakes on refunds, especially when those refunds were issued before your game was released and players never received in-game items.

I have never had a ban on any of my 400+ steam games and I am highly disappointed that Amazon Game Studios was the first. Especially given the reasoning.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Final Fantasy XIV is in a tight spot. Following the poorly-received Final Fantasy XIII and carrying on the legacy of Final Fantasy XI, it has a lot to live up to.

And originally, it failed to live up to this. With 1.0, it had a lot of major issues including XP caps, lack of group activities and general bad design. This was a major problem that could've caused the death of the game.

However, Square Enix did something different. Instead of following the generic ""Make it Free-to-play"" model, they set out on rebuilding the game. Almost completely scrapping the original game and rebuilding it from the ground up, they made a game that can serve as the true XIV that people wanted. This is A Realm Reborn.

Following the failure of 1.0 and the implementation of ARR, Square Enix decided to keep the universe of 1.0 semi-canon, with ARR following on. Set 5 years after 1.0, there was a catastrophe that served to bridge the gap between the 1.0 world and the ARR world. With many features such as landmass, NPCs and areas staying almost identical to that in 1.0, the whole storyline is completely a new, almost sequel to XIV, with gameplay vastly improved and expanded to meet those of other modern MMOs.

The storyline, although generic, does follow the Final Fantasy formula of an evil Empire ruling over the world with an evil agenda, and you and your companions have to fight against them. With this, it is almost a retelling of Final Fantasy VI, with many story elements shared across the two universes, and this is strengthened in the expanded storyline with locations and characters having similar names.

The characters within the game are all pretty unique, although it does have it's own versions of ""Biggs"", ""Wedge"" and Cid"". Each character in the world feels fleshed out, with most having their own questlines and stories separate from the main storyline. This serves to flesh out the universe and make you feel like you're in an actual world rather than a half-baked MMO.

Although the storyline is a major aspect of the game, it does serve mainly to unlock additional content, although this is in no way a bad thing. The storyline quests give a good step on leveling up your first character, guiding you through the leveling process whilst not serving to hand-hold the player. Although it is easy to gain levels through quests, it would not be easy for a character to max out by simply completing quests.

Instead, the game has a number of different ways to level up, mostly these are through group events.

Firstly, one of the most commonly encountered events are FATEs. There can essentially appear anywhere in the field, outside of towns and other sanctuaries. FATEs have a simple objective, often something such as ""Kill all of x enemy"", ""Kill x boss"" or ""Collect all of x"". Usually they involve beating on enemies until the quota is met, which is pretty satisfying. These give the player additional XP and Gil. Mostly these FATEs are level-limited, so many higher-level players would not be inclined to do older FATEs or do them if they are max level, however this has been changed through late-game content that requires players to return to areas and perform in FATEs, meaning that they are available for everyone and serves to keep old content fresh.

Secondly, are Leves. Similar to FATEs but for single player, you are assigned them in each town by a special NPC with a unique tasks such as ""Kill x and collect their item"" or ""Plant an item at x"". These are pretty fun to pass the time and have a number of benefits, similar to FATEs.

Finally, the most common way of leveling up is through Duty Roulettes. Once a day, the player is given a boosted XP and Gil bonus by performing in the Duty Roulette. By choosing to do this, you are randomly assigned a party for a Duty, which can consist of a dungeon, a Trial (Boss fight) or Guildhest (Similar to FATE and Leves). These are unlocked as you progress through the story, and as it is random you can get assigned to any duty that you have previously unlocked. This means that a maxed player can get assigned to a level 20 dungeon. This ensures that the game is kept fresh and that new players can progress through lower level dungeons without the risk of there being no available players, which is also reinforced as an XP bonus is rewarded for all party members who participate with members who are new to that duty. As you progress, more and more duties are unlocked including high and extreme level, with their own rewards. In addition, once the player hits level 50, an additional reward becomes available as a substitute to the XP.

I currently have 150 hours registered to Steam for this game, and have just completed the main storyline. There are countless other things that I must complete, as well as the content unlocked in the latest update coming soon. This will add large amounts content which serves to increase the playability for both high and low level players.

Square Enix are very good at announcing and presenting new content to the games, with regular livestreams showing off new content to keep up the hype. This builds good relations between both the players and the company. In addition, the moderation team of the game (GMs) I have heard are very helpful, and can resolve most issues. In addition, in the two times I have contacted Square Enix support I have received an adequate response within a few hours.


In all honesty, the game is great. Although it is different from other MMOs I have played, it does have a great playerbase who will help newcomers with any issues.

899770,Last Epoch,"This game has pretty quickly evolved into one of the best ARPGs on the market. Tired of PoE or waiting for  the new league? Want something faster than Grim Dawn? Diablo 2 feels a little bit stale? - This is the game for you. Not to say that it is just the next best thing after those other ARPGs.

Combat - it could be better on some classes, Rogue being the smoothest class by far (it really does feel reeally good to play it), but we already know that they are working on overhauling other classes.

Skills and Passives - the passive tree is deep enough to have a plethra of choices for builds. The Skill leveling system is amazing, this is what D3 wishes it was - not too complicated, yet you could build each skill 3-5 completely different ways, combine that with multiple skills and sub-classes - you got a ton of variation for each class.

Items - more or less the usual ARPG stuff, but the crafting system makes sure that you can get the item that you need, you can just craft the affixes that you need on the base that you want. It is not that simple, as you add instability to your gear that way and can lock up or damage the item in the process, but the system as a whole is great tbh. Uniques, well, they are uniques, they have some modifier that a rare item can't have, more or less specific build enablers and whatnot.

Visuals - the game looks great, gives me enough old-school vibes, yet looks fresh and pretty.

Sound - leaves a little bit to be desired, could have more impact and weight behind skill sounds, but that also might be fixed in the future.

Overall, would say that the game is a good 7.5/10 that also has the potential to become a 9/10 in the nearest future. And I am quite sure that it will.

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Revision explanation: 
I decided to rate the game positively as I watch the end credits.
Despite all the technical shortcomings, constant crashes, framerate issues, etc. I have to give the writing staff and game designers huge kudos. The story is so rich, charged and at moments really funny, that I was absolutely immersed in the universe. I am at a loss for words explaining how beautiful this game looks too, leveraging all the power of Unreal Engine. The spirit of the Star Wars Saga really shines here. After the disaster that has been the Skywalker Saga, this is just so refreshing to experience. Not a single moment has been felt by me like it has been wasted. Grinding has been kept at a minimum, if you just want to enjoy a rich and beautiful story in a galaxy far, far away. (If you want to 100% it like I did, there is some grind, but still worth it...) A must for any Star Wars fan. That is why I implore the devs to make it technically more polished for the next installment, if one will ever surface. Thank you for a massive game, content-wise totally worth the asking price (especially on sale)

I have to say, great game, feels nice has so much more content than the last installment. It obviously runs great UNTIL the VRAM gets filled. I am almost 100% positive it is an oversight in ""garbage collection"" of the VRAM. I have ~130 fps on epic settings, until I see the VRAM being full on mangohud (Linux gamer here, hi), that is when the stutters happen, assets are obviously not being unloaded regularly and it is a major oversight. I know memory management and optimization is a hassle, but you will have to handle it eventually, or this is the last game I am purchasing from EA. It is not logical to me that there has to be 15 GB of VRAM used in an area where none of the previous assets, where the 15 GB got filled is visible to the player. Fix ya s**t !!!! Why I know it is an oversight on your part? Changing the visual settings to the lowest possible one does not change the VRAM utilized.","Mixed66% of the 43,165 user reviews for this game are positive.",revision explanation decided rate positively watch credit despite technical shortcoming constant crash framerate issue writing staff designer huge kudos rich charged moment funny immersed universe loss word explaining beautiful look leveraging power unreal engine spirit saga shine disaster skywalker saga refreshing not_a single moment wasted repeatedly performing action gain resource minimum enjoy rich beautiful galaxy far_emphasized 100 grind worth fan i_emphasizedmplore technically polished next installment surface massive wise totally worth asking price especially sale great feel nice last installment obviously run great vram get filled 100 positive oversight garbage collection vram 130 shooter epic setting vram mangohud linux gamer hi stutter happen asset obviously not_being unloaded regularly major oversight memory management optimization hassle handle eventually last purchasing ea not_logical 15 gb vram asset 15 gb filled visible fix ya oversight changing visual setting lowest possible not_change vram utilized

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"This is the best idle game on the market without anything else even coming close. The amount of unique content is unmatched, even when you start comparing it to other genres. There is, however, one fatal flaw:

[h1]The lead developer is equal parts game design genius, greedy, community-observant, and neurotic.[/h1]

I've been playing since release on mobile, and most of the updates have been great. It's been exciting to see the game grow piece-by-piece, but one piece that's been concerning me since day 1: [b]a growing reliance on P2W methods[/b]. Now, I'm not a whale, but I'm also happy to throw $10-20 his way every month or two because I appreciate the game he has created. I'm not afraid of a bit of monetization, but over the past couple years he's been quietly ramping up its aggressiveness and as of today it's just too much.

Now, he'll probably make claims about how he ""added in so much stuff he could have monetized for free"" recently, which is true, but it doesn't excuse how predatory his newest system is. Whether this was mind-games or coincidental is anybody's guess, but it's not a good look. He already has a rough history with deep-level community engagement that I won't go into here, and I feel like the newest monetization strategy will be the beginning of the end depending on how he handles the backlash.

[hr][/hr]

I want the game to succeed, I truly do. I want lava to be able to make a profit vs just treading water. I also want to be able to play this game without spending 5x more than I do just to feel like I'm participating in the content he's releasing. Even packs used to be less than half of what they cost now, which truly feels like it comes from a place of greed before anything else.

There are plenty of other games out there, and while they may not be IdleOn, they will cost me multitudes less to enjoy to a similar level. So if you're reading this lava, understand that we complain from a good place and only want to not lose this wonderful thing that you've created -- do the right thing and keep monetization levels at a fairly justified place.

[hr][/hr]

Edit: Also, the new pet bonuses (even if made easier/cheaper to achieve) [i]need[/i] to be tuned down heavily. 2 of the bonuses outright remove the need for strategic choice (the sheep and doot), while 100% exp/droprate would ruin a lot of the experience for newer players. Pretty much every pet produces a ridiculous amount of powercreep, especially for a strictly P2W feature.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",best market else close unique unmatched comparing genre fatal flaw lead developer equal part design genius greedy community observant neurotic release mobile update great exciting piece piece piece concerning 1 growing reliance p2w method not_a spends large microtransactions happy throw 10 20 appreciate created not_afraid bit monetization past couple year quietly ramping aggressiveness today probably claim stuff monetized recently excuse predatory newest mind game coincidental anybody guess not_a good already rough history deep community engagement newest monetization strategy beginning depending handle backlash hr_emphasized succeed truly lava able profit v treading water able play spending 5x participating releasing pack half cost truly feel come greed else plenty game not_be cost multitude enjoy similar re_emphasizedading lava understand complain good not_lose wonderful created monetization level fairly justified hr_emphasized pet bonus easier cheaper achieve tuned heavily 2 bonus outright remove strategic choice sheep doot 100 exp droprate ruin newer player pretty pet produce ridiculous powercreep especially strictly p2w

899770,Last Epoch,"I've been playing this game since late Alpha before it was on steam, and I really think this is the next big Diablo-like ARPG.

This game has tremendous depth even in beta (and don't listen to reviews that complain about it not being at the level of a beta, they're using an antiquated idea of what a beta is), with each class having an absolute ton of directions that can be taken through the various and ingenious skill tree systems.  Infinite loot drops exist through the random loot system akin to PoE, but the crafting system is far more intuitive and fun without being easy, along with a growing list of unique drops to enhance your build with.  And the content is growing every patch with already 8-10 hours of story as well as two endgame systems.

But the best part has to be the devs.  They're on discord constantly answering questions, and their ability to keep us players in the loop is beyond anything I've ever seen.  They're also great at delivering new content on a consistent and relatively quick basis, and I'm continuously impressed at how much stuff makes it into each patch.  

This game is going to launch into full release late 2020, but it's already a game that you could put hundreds of hours into.  If you love PoE or games like it, you really should give this one a a close look.  Even better, if you love PoE's depth but wish there was a game that was a little more intuitive and less overwhelming, this might be the game you've been waiting for.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.

What I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.

First, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*
- What does this mean?
If you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.

Second, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different
- What does this mean?
There are two types of subscriptions. 
The first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.
The second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. 
There are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. 

Third, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character
- What does this mean?
Every character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.

Overall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out.","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",it_emphasized good great trial play probably heard word mouth not_going good thing telling player maybe important version major addition add feature mechanic ffxiv square enix directly future expansion mean sale major addition add feature mechanic cannot_participate go future expansion not_square frustrating wrong waste double check bought mogstation seeing version type subscription entry standard subscription different type subscription entry subscription 12 99 usd 30 day long get per sever total 8 character subscribing move standard subscription standard subscription starting 14 99 usd 8 charcters per sever total 40 standard subscription purchase multiple month save long especially addition extra retainer fee completely optional form inventory management third wow play class on_emphasizede swap class changing weapon meaning play class come class requires big draw swapping character real pain yes s_emphasizedtill repeatedly performing action gain resource involved class square play wow reading name change race change cheaper remember wow name 10 usd fantasia completely makeover changing race gender nearly else save name 10 usd bought pack 3 5 save good thing top help re_emphasizedading hope fun trying

This game for me was a 100% upgrade over Jedi Fallen Order, the fighting mechanics felt more smooth and polished out with more dynamic ways of fighting.
The customization in this game is a huge upgrade to the first game and there is so much more to collect and change.
The planets are way bigger with much more to explore and fight.
All of the main characters feel like they have so much more emotion and purpose in their journey and feel like their own people who are trying to make it in the galaxy.
Cal’s personal journey throughout the story is really fascinating and the game is left off at a really interesting point for him.
The story itself is really good and ties in a lot of different pieces of lore that are really cool.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:

1. Loading screens take forever.

2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.

3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.

4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.

5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking retarded is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.

6. The f*cking loading screens X___X

7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.

8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.

9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.

10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make. 

11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.

12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.

13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.

14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be).

15. And shark cards can gobble my balls.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"You know those reviews saying ""oh it's just Divinity Original Sin 2 with the D&D rules""? Well, they are antiquated. Larian put out the game in a very early, experimental stage, and since they built the engine starting from the DOS2 one, there were of course going to be a lot of similarities that didn't mesh. And lo and behold, Larian did and still does listen to their fanbase. People were rightly saying that jumping was obnoxious, it got fixed. People were rightly having problems with dicerolls, they got fixed. People were rightly saying that backstab shouldn't give advantage, and it got fixed. I have never seen this level of prompt response and engagement with the community.

And that's not touching how high the production value is even now. It's without a doubt the most gorgeous game in my library, it sounds fantastic both in music  and voice acting, and the whole experience is just fantastically immersive, not to mention the characters! Oh, I have a crush for about half the NPCs around.

Yes it needs fixes, Yes some parts need expanding or reworking, and yes it hurts that we can't yet go beyond Act One, but holy guacamole is this a good start and a better continuation.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Everyone is focusing on the code bugs and graphical glitches, and there are so many of those for every platform.  But even if we strip away all those technical issues, this game is just plain incomplete.  

So many issues plague the gameplay and design in CP2077.  I focused all of my perks on stealth abilities but still found running-and-gunning to be the most effective tactic in nearly every situation.  The knife-throw sounds cool, but actually loses you your knife after a single throw, which totally destroys any point to having such a perk/strategy.  In the end, it makes every battle feel pretty much the same, despite intense attempt to build a character that goes counter to it.

Using a perk to auto-scrap junk is nice in that it gets rid of a big chore, but is that what perks should be doing in a game?  Fix the chore itself, instead of making it a reward to not have to do it.  Interestingly, there are paradoxes to getting rid of this tedium, since scrapping certain junk actually removes economic opportunities for the player too (some junk is worth way more than the scrap it creates).

There are no minigames.  I remember being excited to hear one of the characters telling me to go to the pachinko casino.  I thought I'd get to play the games.  Nope, they're just pretty environment geometry.  Most of the game is like this, despite such a beautiful city, there really isn't much to do in the city besides travel through it and shoot things.  No sports, no bar games, nothing.  

The AI is horrendous.  Committing any crime immediately spawns cops right next to you, which is both unrealistic and cheap.  But even then, on Very Hard, you can easily escape any wanted level by sprinting down the road in a straight line.  The cops can't keep up and they won't put any backup in front of you.  Also, jumping in any body of water will confuse the police enough to lose all levels.  For a game that came out seven years after GTA V and thirteen years after GTA SA, this is comically unacceptable.  I hate when people blame QA for game issues, but the AI honestly makes me wonder if CDPR even tried playing this game naturally, or perhaps if their warnings about the gameplay were ignored altogether.

The city is beautiful and definitely feels hand-crafted instead of snapped together with tile sets, but that's about the only compliment I can give this game and it just further exposes the fact that the city is pretty void of things to do.  And when looking at all the tall buildings seemingly connected by a network of high rise tunnels and bridges, it only serves as a tease since the game has no real vertical element.  No flying, no climbing, no parachuting or repelling.    

So even if the game suddenly started working properly, it's just not good.  It has a lot of sizzle, but no steak.  I love the setting of this game, and I love The Witcher, and I loved the way this company operated in general.  I had expected this game to revolutionize the open world RPG, but instead we got a mess so bad, I can't even understand how it got released with a straight face (even putting code bugs aside).   It doesn't justify the $60 purchase price for me, and it doesn't hold a candle to many open world games that came out ten to fifteen years ago.  This may not be the worst game in history, but it's easily the most disappointing game I've ever played.  I hope CDPR gets its act together, because this game is not good.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"**EDIT - Apparently I'm one of the [strike]hundreds[/strike] thousand or so people falsely banned. People were getting banned in the tutorial. Seriously?**

This could be a good game if Rockstar wasn't the most incompetent twats I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.

You read a ton of these negative reviews thinking that these people are just unlucky, that it can't happen to you. I've been playing the game nonstop for a past week, making money for a bunker and new cars and in the middle of a game, I just got falsely banned for a month for no reason at all and my character and progress INSTANTLY reset.

It's a shame because this is a blast to play with friends, but Rockstar just can't seem to manage shit with their own game. They don't try to improve the experience, pushing out a bunch of events that no one seems to care about, releasing new content that require days of grinding and instead forcing everyone to buy their absurd shark cards, which people still apparently get banned for.

Another thing which I found cute is that now their support page reminds you over and over no bans, no matter what, may be appealed and are AUTOMATICALLY closed. So even when they ban people fo no reason: tough luck. 

Not to mention, do you know what I'll find when I log on a month later, all of my hard work reset back to nothing? Modders and cheaters, the same that have been on the game ever since it first came to PC.

This game will forever be garbage because of Rockstar. This review will stay if mine and countless others bans are not overturned.

**EDIT 03/29/18 -  A majority of the falsely banned players, myself included, have been unbanned with all of our accounts intact.. to promptly being banned once again with the same response Rockstar had in the beginning of this mess.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"I'm very passionate fan of Helldivers 1 despite not having [i]that[/i] much playtime in it across PS and PC, so my review will be just a bit biased, but I'll try to give my honest opinion from what I've personally experienced so far.
Game seems to run quite well at around medium to high settings on my GTX 1080 FE + Ryzen 7 2700x. It seems like performance degrades after playing for an extended period of time or on specific planets with certain conditions. It doesn't look like there is a memory leak when I checked so I assume it's a much trickier problem to fix.
Crashes [i]do[/i] occur during non critical gameplay (menus/hub), your mileage will probably vary.
Edit: after sleeping and playing more, I'm not getting crashes anymore. Still keep in mind that the game [i]may[/i] crash for you but it's less likely now.
Controls feel fine, nothing amazing or notable.
Graphics settings have stupid stuff enabled so make sure you turn it off (such as motion blur)

Actual optimization doesn't seem to be the issue. Ss far as I can tell, it's mainly compatibility. The game is failing to launch at all with certain setups.
So unfortunately my biggest advice is; [u]you will want to test if the game agrees with your computer first[/u] because there is a chance it may not.

Supposedly there is a kernel level anti cheat (same tier as Vanguard level anti cheat). Something to consider, though it doesnt seem to have any impact on the game. Unless you're using Kali Linux or something with Tor browser and a VPN... You probably don't need to care about it.
In any case, the existence of the anti cheat is kinda stupid and they should remove it or move to something more reputable. Should that be a make or break point? Not really. Please voice to the devs that it was probably not a great choice though.

[strike]At the moment of the review (day 1), the game's matchmaking is broken, so keep in mind that you will have to play the game alone, or specifically play with people on your friends list.
Edit: Currently matchmaking is working fine, sounds like it was fixed VERY fast. Crossplay isn't working however so keep in mind that you should disable it until it is fixed and you won't be able to play with anyone on a different platform.
You can probably expect this issue to be fixed after about a week [i]at most.[/i][/strike]
Wow, they actually fixed it very fast. Surprising.

The game has monetization. I got a better look at it recently, so I just rewrote this section entirely to explain what it really is.
From what I could tell, there are 3 pages. A page for buying premium currency, a page for buying items with only premium currency, and banners which act similar to a battle pass. The second page I mentioned has exactly 4 items on sale which seem to change after a day or two. These have almost [i]zero[/i] impact on whether you play better or not. [u]The gear obtained with microtransactions have the exact same stats and passives as gear you can obtain through playing the game, and it's not particularly amazing either.[/u] You'll pretty much just be buying it for cosmetic value. The third page I've mentioned is the main progression for the game. It currently has two banners. The banner for the main game which has 10 pages of progression in it, completely free. Each page will generally give you a set of armor, a weapon, a banner, a little premium currency, and a couple of other random things. You do not have to unlock all of them to proceed to the next page, you only need to have spent a certain amount of in game currency which increases for each banner.
The premium banner has only three pages and the gear seems to be on par with the main banner. You also still need to spend in game currency to progress it I believe. (needs verification) In essence, it's DLC. Something Arrowhead and every other studio has been doing for YEARS. It's not timed, it's not going away, there is zero FOMO. It's DLC but in a slightly different format which has been causing people to panic. It's just DLC, which the last game also had.

At the time of the review, the game is rated mixed, which I expect will balance out to around 70-90% positive once more people test out the game and day 1 issues get fixed.

Can't be that bad of a bad purchase at $40 dollars when other studios are dropping steamy piles for a game at $70. (Lookin' at you Suicide Squad.)
Overall I'd give the game about a 7/10. I think the game will be a major hit or major miss for most people, largely depending on if your hardware agrees with the game or not. The gameplay itself is [i]extremely[/i] fun and challenging depending on your difficulty, with quite a lot of replayability with friends. (You got friends, right?) And hopefully the hiccups here and there that the game has get ironed out pretty quickly with early patches.

I [i]do[/i] care about the game, and want it to be the best it can possibly be. Therefore;
[u]If the game starts to decline in quality after this review, it will certainly be updated to reflect that.[/u]

1623730,Palworld,"-Small review-
(I switched from xbox gamepass to Steam version after 30hours or so) to support the creators.

what i like +

+ catch pals, enslave them, and make them work for you
+ the huge world, which partly reminds me of ark survival evolved
+ complex building system
+ beautifully designed monsters, some even better than the ones from pokemon ;) 
+ the unlocking system and finding chests is really addictive
+ the trainer towers are challenging, which I really like (its the endgame content right now)

= grafics is ok nothing special but its not ugly (looks better as pokemon ;) )

what still needs to be improved - 

- some pals are still stuck in walls from time to time when you fight them, just like human opponents
- the area that you have for building after you put up a pal station is a bit too small for me - it should be possible to expand it

what my wishes are for the future!

(more pals, more end content, a story or story quests, map use the areas that are not currently available such as the giant tree should still be added, and later dlc or something)

(it actually still has a lot of potential that can be expandet)

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"What a wonderful game!

I must admit I had skipped all the ""AC"" hype in the past; brushed it off as a younger-player's game ( I am 54) but alas...I was wrong.


I am a HUGE fan of of the FarCry series and the gameplay of AC4 is alot like that; open a map slowly-revealing points of interest, quests etc etc.

But what REALLY shines in AC4 ( IMO) is the sea combat. Most ( not all) of the sea combat is optional.

And game optimization.....WOW! Even on my 3.5 year old rig the game played smooth and is beautiful ( literally...beautiful; sailing at sea under a full moon listening to my men sing a sea chanty is a gaming Moment =)

So...on to the Bad Stuff ( there has to be bad right? No game is perfect?)--

1. Sword combat- maybe its my age but I never "" got"" the whole sword-fighting thing. Apparently you can"" break "" defenses and such by hitting a certain key but I cannot get it to work. Smoke Bombs are your friend. Trust me =)

2. There are SOME ( not many so far) timed events that are a major PITA. It's the You-Must-Do-X-Then-Y-then -move -HERE-X again ARGH!!!!!

  WHY for the love of GOD fuck up a great game with this crap!??  I assume it's aimed for the younger-nimble-I-will-keep-playing-till-the-nachos-run-out crowd. Its not fun. Doing the same damned thing 20 times is not fun..its WORK.


But! that is rare, and in a gem like this can be over-looked.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.

1. Graphics
BG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.

2. Sound
The sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.

3. Story
Not a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. 

4. Characters
I'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.

5. Combat
The combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!

6. Exploration
Expanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.

7. Races/Classes
The current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.

8. Character Creation (Visual)
Kind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).

9. Progression
Similar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.

10. Optimization
I run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.

Just a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out.

230410,Warframe,"Warframe is one of the best examples of the free-to-play economy done right. Due to the recent Plains of Eidolon expansion, warframe got a lot of renewed attention in the latter stages of 2017. the story is fairly pedestrian at first, and once you're past the first mission or two, the game pretty much lets you go your own way, some people really like the fact that it's not so ""Hand-Holdy"" others are left bemused as to what to do next, which is where the community comes in. The  majority of players in Warframe are helpful, friendly and more often than not, willing to help a newer player. I know I am. the co-op focus of Warframe means that we, as players, *want* you to do well, to succeed, because that also helps us. a few peices of advice for starting players.

1) Spend your starting platinum on warframe/weapon slots or an orokin reactor for your chosen starter frame. cosmetics can come further down the line. (and they will, trust me!)

2) The Warframe Wiki is your friend, and spoilers are appropriately marked. (and they are pretty big spoilers)

3) Do not level damaged mods. They will quickly be replaced by better versions. 

4) Mk1 weapons can be bought from the in-game marketplace for credits ONLY (others require crafting) and they are fairly weak compared to a lot of the later weapons. get them anyway, and use them until they are maxed out, you'll thank yourself later on for getting these done early.

5) Don't try and make a weapon something it's not. Weapons all have unique stats, and strengths. you can make a weapon that is strong in one way, (say, crit chance, for example) even stronger, but trying to boost a lacklustre stat is usually counter-productive and wasteful. Save yourself some heartache.

so yeah, TL;DR warframe is hella good, there is literally no reason to not try it.","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"I know most of you are just here to see how the game perform so here's my thought

I have an RTX 3070 and i7-10700KF CPU. All my settings are on high with ray tracing turned off. I am playing with Patch 7 right now, and I have about 70 to 90 FPS in smaller areas. But once I go to an open area, my frame drops to 50. It also drops when there are smoke effects from the enemy smashing the ground. My game also crashed 2 times in the 5 hours I've played today. I don't really recommend it unless your PC is super good. Come back after you've finished Baldur's Gate 3.

Now for the actual game I actually kinda like it.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is really satisfying. It's an improvement over the last game. Parrying feels more responsive and more satisfying. Each lightsaber style actually has a purpose. Double-bladed has a wider attack area, dual dual-blade has faster attacks. I am having a blast fighting bosses.

Character:
For Cal, I think he is a much better character than he was in the last game. He acts more natural and is more lovable. In this game, he truly feels like a Jedi survivor. As a surviving Jedi, he sounds and acts more like a normal civilian since he has been living among the people for a few years. But he is also a good guy because of his Jedi background, which isn't how normal people would act. Normal people in the Galaxy would be more selfish and greedy, and this took them by surprise when they see Cal being such as good person. This makes Cal more believable as a Jedi who has been living among normal people.

Exploration:
The exploration is whatever. The world is a little empty in some areas, and you don't feel intrigued when you explore. You do it because the map tells you, you haven't explored this area yet, and you expect to find good loot. Personally, I like it when I am motivated by the environment itself instead of the game telling me to explore. I wish the game used interesting buildings, landscapes, or NPC dialogues to motivate me to explore the world.

Story:
So far, the story is interesting. I am looking forward to finding out what happens next. And the game asks Cal some interesting and realistic questions instead of just defeating the empire, go kill the villain type of corny story. Cal's friends are telling him that it is meaningless for him to fight until he dies, and maybe it's time for him to be more selfish and think about how he wants to live. This is such a good question to ask and have our main character think about. For that, I am surprised and happy this is the direction the story is heading.
 
Graphics:
It's pretty good

Overall, I would 100% recommend this game if you can actually play it. What a shame.....

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I was very skeptic to play Final Fantasy XIV at first. Coming from Phantasy Star Online 2 back in 2015, FFXIV looked slow, stiff, and overall not challenging to play. The subscription model made it even harder to justify playing it, as I had always seen monthly subscriptions as a way to milk players' money as much as possible. When I was gifted the game by a friend (there was no free trial back then), I decided to give it a try just to confirm my thoughts. I could not have been more wrong.

Disclaimer: as of writing this, I have around 500 hours of playtime on the standalone version. I've played through two of the first expansions and I'm halfway through Shadowbringers.

As someone who usually ignores stories in video games as they tend to not conform to my standards, I was blown away by how captivating this game's narrative is. It's incredibly refreshing to come across an MMO that not only has a good story, but *knows* it has a good story. FFXIV has no problem throwing you 10 quests in a row where you don't fight a single enemy, because it knows the story alone is enough to keep you interested, and it is absolutely right. Every sentence was crafted to enhance your immersion in the world through character development that goes way beyond what I've come to expect from JRPGs, and story beats that hit you like a truck when you least expect them. If you care in any way about story-driven video games, you cannot miss this game.

The combat, at first, is slow. You'll be pressing the same three buttons over and over for a good couple of hours when you first start this game. While I considered it a problem as an MMO veteran when first starting out, it makes sense as an introduction to non-MMO players, or even people not used to games in general. That said, the game quickly develops on your class' toolkit giving you action after action until you have two hotbars of skills that are all universally useful in the right situations. Some of the more fast-paced classes (Ninja, Astrologian) feel like playing Dance Dance Revolution as a kid, all while dodging whatever the gigantic f*****g monster you're fighting throws at you. I've not yet done end-game raid content, but from what I've seen of my guild mates they expand on this even further.

If you don't play this game, it's completely understandable to be flustered by the payment model. Paying for a game, expansions and a monthly subscription on top of that rings a siren in the ears of any sane consumer, but this is different. Final Fantasy XIV does NOT pull any tricks to keep you subscribed. You get a good game with a huge amount of content and that's *it*. If you play for the story, you can subscribe while there's story content and simply stop paying until the next patch. If you play for raids and end-game content, you can pause your sub once you're tired or feel like playing other games.

Three years ago, a japanese player asked YoshiP (the game's director, Naoki Yoshida) how to stay motivated to keep playing in between patches, when content naturally dries out for a little while. His response was the following:

""It's alright not to play it everyday. Since it's just a game, you can stop forcing yourself if it's hard on you to keep that up. Rather, it'll just pile up unnecessary stress if you limit yourself into playing just that one game since there are so many other games out there. So, do come back and play it to your heart's content when the major patch kicks in, then stop it to play other games before you got burnt out, and then come back for another major patch. This will actually make me happier, and in the end, I think this is the best solution I can answer for keeping your motivation up for the game."" (source: /u/elevenmile on /r/ffxiv)

Reading this response is what made me realize what kind of experience I was paying for. In PSO2, to play end game content you *have* to log in at certain times of the day where such content is available, otherwise you miss out completely. After playing for years I grew resentful of the game because it felt more like a job than an enjoyment for me, yet I couldn't quit because I'd be behind if I did. In Final Fantasy XIV, you're experiencing the world on your own terms. No pressure, no time gated content, no manipulative tricks to keep you subscribed. If you don't feel like playing, just don't. The developers very clearly respect the player's time and it shows in game.

I can't force you to play this game, but I hope my thoughts helped you decide for yourself. Even if you ultimately decide to not play it, I recommend you watch Noclip's FINAL FANTASY XIV Documentary on YouTube. The development cycle of FFXIV and how it went from a financial disaster to SquareEnix's biggest hit is a great story.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"[h1][b]This game is a big red flag coated in sugar.[/b][/h1]

I was pretty bored when I found this game on Steam, and I thought it looked pretty interesting, because I'm a fan of MMO but never found an idle MMO, so I decided to give it a try.

It was fun for the first 30 minutes, you are learning the character skills and the three basic classes you can choose from, which you soon realize the ""hundreds of classes"" that was advertized, is not really true, because in reality you only have three main classes, all those other classes are actually sub-classes which you can progress through and pick which sub-class you want to go for. 
Oh and of course, there are secret classes that the game doesn't tell you about. I only found out about it because I was looking through the Steam community guides.

You are not allowed to change the names of your character once you created it. Now I know this doesn't sound much, but it's very annoying once you find out that you can't have capital letters in your name when you play on Steam, but you can have capital letters in your name when you play on mobile or any emulators like BlueStacks. Has this been brought up by the community? Yes. Has the developer ever fixed it? No. Will the developer come back to fix it in the near future? Well the game has been out for years, so I doubt this will be fixed at all.

The Spring Event that was released some time ago forces you to have the game open in order to get the drops that you need, which is a pretty obvious way to force players to have the game running, in order to increase the played time and make the game look like it's more active than it is.

I recently found out about how the daily reset works in this game, because it felt like things don't reset when it reaches certain time zones. The daily reset occurs at the time when you created your character. From a programmer's perspective, not only is this extremely inefficient, it's also just storing useless data on the server. 

Alright so, enough about the game itself, what about the community? Here I will reference [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198063960020/recommended/1476970/]another post[/url] I found regarding this since I never joined and will never join their Discord.

Here are a few examples of what was written on the referenced review: 

""Players and mods are banned on the discord for petty reasons.""

""The dev reprimanded staff he personally hired for fixing situations he caused and in his lack of transparency with his own team decides to punish his long time staff with an immediate ban without hesitation.""

""Any form of negative criticism is deemed toxic by the dev and makes you worthy of banning.""

""Dev has a history of censoring people whenever he can. He will take down YouTube vids because he feels they take away from his own channel, he will make you change your name if you are an Idleon content creator the name is related to his game, and he will ban you if you mention certain people that he doesn't like.""

""I was banned without warning after being a member with over 10,000 posts over a year without a reason listed. I assume I was deemed as ""toxic.""""

""The dev banned several active and long time users over an April fool's joke spoil. Only one has been unbanned.""

""The dev criticized my feedback in Discord by saying, ""so do the last 1.5 years of your enjoyment mean nothing to you?"" As if the game can't degrade or my feelings change over that time frame.""

""The dev adds things to the game because he wants to, not because the game needs it. He will spend an entire day streaming him drawing frogs for the first dungeon, when the dungeons have bugs and the party system is broken. His stream on 5/8/2022 had him explicitly say he does things because he wants to.""

""You must join the discord to be competitive. You will not be able to ""exploit"" his oversights without the help of the community that does the code digging. Many of his oversights are bugs that go on for months and give massive advantage to those that are adamant about staying ahead. You must be part of the discord to even know what is an exploit and what is deemed ok by the dev.""

""The developer's communication is poor. He has no community manager and doesn't address the communities concern. His version of addressing concern is by adding things no one asked for and saying people wanted it.
He has put out two game polls since the latest world release based on what the community wants, and nothing in those polls have been addressed in 2 months.
The only thing that was addressed were an issue with players auto clicking a new feature. His solution was to just hard cap clicks and screw those that didn't exploit early.""

""Cheaters are free to roam the game and can even unban themselves.""

The Steam reviews will probably be the one and only place where you can post criticisms about this game without worrying about getting it removed or banned, because developers cannot alter the reviews, and the only thing they can do about it is just respond to it.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",big red flag coated sugar pretty bored found thought looked pretty interesting fan massively multiplayer online never_found massively multiplayer online decided fun 30 minute learning skill three basic class choose soon realize hundred class advertized not_really reality three class class sub class progress pick sub class oh course secret class t_emphasizedell found community guide not_allowed name created sound annoying capital letter name play capital letter name play mobile emulator bluestacks brought community yes developer fixed no_will developer fix near future year doubt fixed spring event released ago force open order drop pretty obvious force player running order increase active recently found daily reset work thing reset reach certain zone daily reset occurs created programmer perspective not_only extremely inefficient storing useless data computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player alright community reference url http steamcommunity com profile 76561198063960020 recommended 1476970 post url found regarding never_joined never_join discord example written referenced player mod banned discord petty reason reprimanded staff personally hired fixing situation caused lack transparency decides punish long staff immediate ban hesitation form negative criticism deemed behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner make worthy banning history censoring whenever youtube vids feel channel name creator name related ban mention certain banned warning member 10 000 post listed assume deemed behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner banned active long user april fool joke spoil unbanned criticized feedback discord saying last 1 5 year enjoyment degrade feeling frame add thing want not_because need spend streaming drawing frog dungeon dungeon bug party broken stream 5 8 2022 explicitly thing want join discord competitive not_be able software loophole allows player gain unfair advantage oversight help community code digging oversight bug month massive advantage adamant staying ahead discord software loophole allows player gain unfair advantage deemed ok developer communication poor no_community manager address community concern version addressing concern adding thing no_one asked saying wanted poll latest world release based community want poll addressed 2 month addressed issue player auto clicking solution hard cap click screw software loophole allows player gain unfair advantage early cheater roam unban review probably post criticism worrying removed banned developer cannot_alter review respond

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

This game is great! Round up any group of friends that you have and pray for each other's lives. Environmentally the creatures in this game are always a (not-so) pleasant surprise, and each moon you go to has different weather conditions that can make or break your quota that you need to reach. This game also has amazing proximity chat, which is the reason why so many people love it. Echoing voices, screams that suddenly get cut off.

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"Two months ago I would have written a glowing review. I have been flight simming for about forty years, and this version was transcendant -- the best flight experience by far in all those years. By July 25 I had logged more than 300 hours in flight, and had loved every minute of it. The sim was running beautifully on moderately high settings with a framerate around 60. Then, on July 25, a required update (SU5) simply destroyed the sim. After the update (which cannot be rolled back) it crashes to desktop every single time I attempt to fly. I have reduced the graphics settings; I have removed all mods; I have emptied the Community folder; I have turned off AI traffic; I am not overclocked; I have no conflicting third party apps installed -- and this is all on top of two consecutive clean re-installs. Set up a flight, click ""Fly,"" CTD. Every time. Do not buy this thing until (if) you get word it has been fixed. After six weeks of CTDs I am losing hope it will be.
UPDATE: As someone pointed out, I have clocked more hours in the sim since I posted this review. That's because the issue did get fixed. The problem was introduced with the #5 update (SU5), and to my knowledge that problem has not been fixed yet, but I did get around it. I had purchased a separate SSD dedicated to MS Flight Simulator, and while on this drive I happily flew for more than 300 hours. After six weeks of the problem described above, the tech support suggested installing the sim on another drive. When I did this, it worked. My SSD was in exFAT format, and it seems after the SU5 update, the sim likes NTFS format ONLY. So I reinstalled on an NTFS drive and problem gone. A non-intuitive solution, and one that baffled tech support for a long time, but it works. MSFS is back, for me, to being a beautiful experience. I hope you are all as lucky. 
P.S., to address another comment, MSFS install time depends on your internet speed. With a fast connection it can be installed in less than an hour.","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",month ago written glowing simming forty year version transcendant best far year july 25 logged 300 hour loved minute sim running beautifully moderately high setting framerate 60 july 25 required su5 simply destroyed sim cannot_be rolled crash desktop single attempt fly reduced graphic setting removed mod emptied community folder turned ai traffic not_overclocked no_conflicting third party apps installed top consecutive clean installs set click fly ctd not_buy word fixed six week ctds losing hope someone pointed clocked hour sim posted issue fixed problem introduced 5 su5 knowledge problem not_been fixed purchased separate ssd dedicated m drive happily flew 300 hour six week problem described tech support suggested installing sim drive worked ssd exfat format su5 sim like ntfs format reinstalled ntfs drive problem non intuitive solution baffled tech support long work msfs beautiful hope lucky p address comment msfs install depends internet speed fast connection installed

Then they turned around and offered to sell us high tier premiums to let us skip the grind.

I'm 44, and usually only have the time or energy to play on weekends.  I played for about 4 hours or so most Saturday mornings.  As a casual gamer I can definitely say the game is open to all playing styles and skill levels.  The story line was as good as a really good book.  The ending did a great job closing out all the story lines too.  The attention to detail by the developers was incredible.  You never know what you're going to deal with as you turn each corner, and every time what comes up is interesting and fun.  Often times I would just go off and explore the game's open world outside of any story lines.  I have an EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC ULTRA video card.

MSFS2020 is simply put: a next gen flight simulator. Everything is indeed a step forwarded compared to older simulators. Cities with 3D models look amazing, cities with AI buildings also look cool, but of course they aren't entirely modeled.

To the Simulator itself: I have been flying mostly small aircraft exploring the world and doing simple IFR flight here and there. I have yet to find a bug or something weird that ruined my experience. I know a lot of people are complaining about the Flight Management computers in airliners being fucked, as well as the autopilot. These are extremely complex systems and quite honestly, I would be extremely surprised if they got some study-material aircraft perfectly at launch. Physics wise this is also very interesting. It's still not perfect, but it's getting better. Topographic turbulence and weather changes are becoming somewhat realistic.

916440,Anno 1800,"Unfortunately I refunded the game without playing a minute. The launcher with account force+ copy protection was too much hustle. Did not start at all. The comeback to steam seems like its only account grabbing for the ubi store (which has discounts on dlcs - not here on steam?!). In my opinion steam has to change policies here too...

Additionally im worried that a game advertised as Complete Edition does not include all DLC. The marketing is not transperent about this.

Also the pricing of 60€ effectively for a game that released years ago is surreal for me (yeah the dlcs added content. But its not transparent if its worth the money)","Very Positive82% of the 13,562 user reviews for this game are positive.",unfortunately refunded minute launcher force copy protection hustle not_start comeback grabbing ubi discount dlcs not_here policy im worried advertised complete edition not_include downloadable additional released initial launch marketing not_transperent pricing 60 effectively released year ago surreal yeah dlcs not_transparent worth

This game is IN-SANE.
The attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars. 
The single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games. 
The beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in. 
In fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time. 
Taking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours. 
Riding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times. 
I got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Got this game for 20 bucks because it was on a sale and I haven't played a Madden game seriously since EA decided to STUPIDLY switch over to Frostbite(A First Person Shooter Engine) which completely broke the game mechanics that still hasn't been fixed for some reason. And boy was I not surprised to see how BAD the game is even on a top of the line rig I still have choppy frames and the UI both in the main menu and in game is a JUMBLED Mess compared to older titles.

The gameplay feels rough, unnatural and a serious stray from the games that made this franchise so great. Instead of making the game better by adding core features the fanbase have been asking since the day's pre xbox one port EA has every single year ignored them.

I honestly was just going to refund the game and move on but I left this review to show my absolute disappointment in the state of Madden and what the game has become. You're better off playing the Madden 25 Rebuilt mod on your Old 360's and just import the 2024 roster, the game play is MUCH smoother, enjoyable and a good call back to the good days of the franchise.

Don't waste 70 dollars hell not even 20 dollars on this lousy roster update with pretty graphics I'll re buy the games in this franchise when they actually listen to the fans until then i'm going to go play my older Maddens.","Mixed43% of the 5,008 user reviews for this game are positive.",20 buck sale seriously ea decided stupidly switch frostbite shooter engine completely broke mechanic fixed boy not_surprised bad top line rig choppy frame ui menu jumbled mess compared older title feel rough unnatural serious stray game franchise great adding core feature fanbase asking pre xbox port ea single ignored honestly refund move left absolute disappointment state 25 rebuilt modification alteration player fan old 360 import 2024 roster play smoother enjoyable good call good day franchise waste 70 dollar hell not_even 20 dollar lousy roster pretty graphic game franchise listen fan play older maddens

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Played WoW for 16 years or so. Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop. Dont regret a single minute of it. Cant wait to start the actual expansions though. Already recommended to all of my friends that play WoW.


!!Update!! 

100 Hours more played later. Im completely addicted. Still have yet to hit the first expansion. Just content everywhere I look. I cant remember the last time I genuinely woke up or got home from work and was excited about actually sitting down continuing an adventure on a game or just to have pure fun and enjoyment. One of best communities I have had the pleasure of starting to be a part of as well. Experience is still amazing for me so far. And I know its just going to get better and better. Cant wait!

!!Update!!
Well i am currently sitting at 340 hours or so played now. Nothing has change I am loving this. I actually just hit the first expansion Heavensward and good lord they were not kidding. Dont get me wrong i didnt mind a realm reborn... but wow just wow did they step it up in the first expansion. the cut scenes the first new Main city i am obssessed and in love with and the music that comes along with it. Most of the cast from ARR has new voice actors and damn they are good. I just scratched the surface of Heavensward and with it already shocking me how good this is getting I cant even imagine Stormblood or Shadowbringers. I can honestly say even heavensward has put WoW shadowlands to shame in all terms of story especially and cut scenes even landscape and music its just overall beautiful and being the big game of thrones fan I am the dragons and all that feel to it is just great. Its definitely not a suprise why they add heavensward into the free trial because they know after you touch that expansion you wont want to stop! :) 

Overall Take it from Me a WoW 16 year vet even with a WoW tattoo irl on my arm i lived breathed and slept WoW. I have yet to even miss a single patch or anything. Even with 9.1 that just came out yesterday while sitting here playing this now. I dont even question myself for a single second about going back anytime soon or resubbing. I am having an overall amazing experience so far and it has been keeping me completely busy and satisfied. I can honestly say this is the very first game in my life that has kept me away from World of Warcraft and for me thats a huge statement and win.

415 hours in or so. I should of easily been at Stormblood by now but i just keep getting side tracked into doing everything else in the game. Been leveling the Dark Knight up to 60 now and Finishing heavensward on him. Amazing class. Super fun story for the class as well. Machinest was my main until I recently started going Dark Knight crazy. The instant dungeon ques for tank are also a plus! And damn the Dark Knight gear just looks so good especially swinging around the big two hander feels so good as well. I should be hitting Stormblood soon though for sure as long as I dont get side tracked anymore. But honestly Im still genuinely happy and just having a blast playing this game honestly the longer it takes me to get to the other expansions the better. It is nothing like WoW where its just a strict grind fest as fast as you can to end game. Nah. Its just completely enjoy the game and have fun and do whatever you want and take your time!. Good stuff.

!!Update!!
Finally Finished Heavensward and Ill put this as simply and quick as I can. Amazing Story. Amazing Music. Just hooks you in and makes you connect with every character in the story it felt like I was just watching and getting to know every character like a full season of a show that just hooks you in. Some cutscenes were just an overall thrill and joy and by the end was hitting me in my feels haha. Simply just landed a spot in my top 10 stories of video games that I have experienced in my life.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"This game is exactly what is wrong with open worlds these days. A big vast world of emptiness and boredom! Instead of adding actual content and meaning to the game to make it longer, they force you to spend hours traveling in the world, challengelessly and with no fun, to start a mission.
Then you start a mission, it's a long cut-scene of ugly animations that reminds you of 2001. Then the cut-scene is over, you have to follow one dude for another 5 minutes just to listen to a stupid pointless conversation! Don't get me wrong, I love stories in games, by checking my games library you can see how much I love games with a good story. But this game is nothing but a time thief!
Then there is the skill tree ...! It's soooo f*cking big with so many useless crap inside it! WHAT IS THE POINT?! They want you to feel like there is such a big sea of options in front of you, but it's nothing but an illusion! Nothing but another waste of time to just see what skills are there to unlock! One of the most fun activities in games for me is checking the skills, comparing them and deciding which path matches my playstyle and go for them. But that means nothing in this game! Tens of skill nodes that you would never bother reading through, let alone comparing and deciding about!
After 6 hours of playing, I barely had any fun, I've just been running around and talking with people and watching ugly animations in cut-scenes. By the end, all these useless elements of time wasting made me uninstall the game and decide against ever playing it.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"I hate this game. 

This game is one with an extremely entitled, toxic fan base who does not give a single [care] for the other players in the game. The gameplay loop will get repetitive, and solo-queue is one of the most frustrating experiences you will ever have. Unless you're going to be surviving with friends, prepare yourself to be railed time and time again by either your teammates or the opposition. 

With that being said, I have a handful of hours on PC, and I have over 1K on console. This game has its claws rooted deep in me, and I can not take more than a month-long break before I'm right back to it. If you are down for a potential beat down on your psyche until the moment you have enough experience to have a good time, or you want to get up in a game with the homies, this is an addicting game that, although it is a slog, will keep you coming back for more.","Very Positive80% of the 512,225 user reviews for this game are positive.",hate extremely entitled behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner fan base not_give single care player loop repetitive solo queue frustrating experience unless surviving friend prepare railed teammate opposition handful hour pc 1k console claw rooted deep not_take long break potential beat psyche moment good homies addicting slog
1203620,Enshrouded,"Enshrouded is a survival action role-playing game set in the realm of Embervale where due to your ancestor’s lust for great magical power they unleashed a pestilence that consumed the world. It is in this world you awake and start your journey to ignite the ancient power of the flame and piece together the fragments of a story that unfolds beneath the surface.

Like most survival games Enshrouded starts off with a tutorial teaching you the basic mechanics of fighting and base building by setting you tasks to collect various resources to create workbenches which will enable you to create tools and weapons that will help make your heroic journey of cleansing Embervale of the deadly shroud that envelops it. Enshrouded has a unique hook though, in order to expand your collection of crafting recipes you will need to head out far from home and travel the map so you can rescue and recruit various NPCs such as the hunter and alchemist who will then reward you with the ability to make new crafting stations and more powerful weapons, tools and potions. You will also need to build them dwellings to live in and areas for the various tools they require such as kilns, drying racks and furnaces. If you decide to move and build in a different part of the map, then you can simply summon them to your new location with your handy summoning staff. It’s a unique touch that really helps to make you feel like you are building a village rather than just a place for yourself to live. Speaking of crafting, you can also craft a grappling hook and a glider to help you explore the map, it is even more fun than it sounds, jumping off a massive cliff and gliding across the landscape to your destination really opens your eyes to just how massive the world of Enshrouded is. Food and drink also play a massive part in Enshrouded but not in the usual way you would expect in a survival game, instead of having a hunger and thirst meter that you must constantly replenish you instead use food and drinks for buffs to strength, stamina and dexterity amongst other things which makes it vital to ensure you have the correct buffs applied before you set out on an adventure to the more dangerous parts of the map. 
There are enemies littered all over Embervale and you will have all manner of tools at your disposal to dispose of them, from swords and maces all the way through to bows, wands and staffs, both ranged and melee combat are simple in essence but also feel great to take part in, you also have a rather large skill tree that you can use to customise your character to the type of playstyle you prefer, you can be anything from a pure archer through to a sword wielding magic user depending on which skills you choose. Enemies aren’t the only thing actively trying to kill you in Enshrouded though, parts of the map are covered in ‘the shroud’ a toxic fog-like substance that harms anybody that wanders into it, when you enter the shroud a timer will start counting down at the top of the screen that warns you how much time you have left before you must get out of the shroud, once that counts down to zero then you cease to exist, you can extend your time in the shroud by reaching certain landmarks which will reset your timer or by using potions. The whole shroud mechanic is a work of genius that adds tension to exploring the map, I had several instances where I chose to stay and explore longer than I should and breathed a massive sigh of relief as I sprinted out of the deadly shroud into the sunshine with only seconds to spare, it’s these type of moments that keep you engaged in the world of Embervale and the game as a whole.

Embervale is a master class in world design, standing on the edge of a cliff and surveying the landscape through the holes in the shroud then seeing a point of interest miles into the distance and saying to yourself “I can actually go there” as you start off on another journey of exploration is an incredible feeling, as is exploring all the abandoned ruins and towers that litter the landscape. The map is absolutely massive and not only encourages exploration, but it also rewards you for it, if you put in the time to investigate every nook and cranny then you will find chests that can contain anything from much needed resources through to epic weapons that will help you go stronger. The game is quite beautiful for the most part, with gigantic towers, old ruins, sweeping plains and valleys full of the fog-like shroud making up most of the world, Embervale is mysterious, beautiful and dangerous all at the same time. Unlike most games with survival aspects, Enshrouded does have a story, it is told mostly through text at the beginning and conclusion of quests and through various notes and books you will come across in your travels that help you get a better understanding of the lore behind the game and also mark key locations on the map for you to visit, if you are expecting flashy cut scenes then you will most likely end up disappointed, in my opinion though, the low key and unobtrusive story telling works perfectly for this type of game.

It is not all sunshine and rainbows where Enshrouded is concerned though, there are some nasty bugs and optimisation issues that pop up during gameplay, there are lots of frame rate issues during gameplay with some of the worst being during the transition from day to night time which brings the frame rate down into single digits, thankfully the transition only last for a minute or two so it is more annoying than game breaking. I also had a nasty bug that only seemed to affect me and not the friends I was playing with where it was impossible for me to exit out of the game even after trying to kill the process via task manager, this happened every time I try to exit the game and the only solution was to reboot my system on each occasion, I did report this bug to the devs but didn’t get a reply. People I were playing with also experienced a lot of random crashes during gameplay whereas I didn’t experience a single one so there is obviously an issue where certain types of hardware don’t play nice with the game, the game is Early Access though so some of these things can be forgiven and the devs were being really proactive with patching the game heading up to the launch, there wasn’t a day that went by during the week I have been playing that went by without a patch which is a really encouraging sign for the future stability and optimisation of the game.

Enshrouded is a game for people who like to immerse themselves into the world of a game and explore, not only will you be rewarded for your exploration with new items, new crafting recipes and weapons you will also be rewarded with snippets of lore that help you further understand the history of Embervale. I have been absolutely fiending to play this game ever since the playtest during Next Fest and I am happy to say that even though it can be a little rough around the edges Enshrouded is an absolute joy to play whether you are going at it solo or with a bunch of friends. The size of the map, the vast array of crafting recipes and the games building system, that even allows you to dig and build underground, are all top notch, the only thing  that really needs work apart from optimisation is the combat system, while it is far from terrible it does feel quite floaty and lacks feedback and oomph on successful hits, I found the ranged combat to be far more satisfying than melee, hopefully the combat can be improved over time. I highly recommend Enshrouded to anybody that likes survival or RPG games, the map is massive, there is so much to explore and so much to build that I can ensure that you will spend a great number of hours playing this game. I am really looking forward to seeing how the game develops during the early access period, Enshrouded is an example of early access done right and I hope it receives the support it deserves.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Despite being a big fan of the Witcher series and loving The Witcher 3 in particular, I did not pick up Cyberpunk 2077 at release, as the game seemed to be getting a mixed reception, and back then I did not really have the time and energy to play these massive games anyway. With the hefty 2.0 update, it came back onto my radar, and I decided to give it a chance. Therefore, keep in mind that everything I'm about to say applies strictly to the post-2.0 state of the game, 2.1 specifically.

First, to address the elephant in the room, I did experience a number of bugs, but most of them were harmless visual glitches, e.g. a procgen NPC getting stuck in the stairs. Just once did I have a major game-breaking bug, when I was simply no longer able to save for unclear reasons, no matter what I tried, which led to me losing a chunk of progress. My game also crashed a handful of times. Ideally, that number should be zero, but since these crashes and show-stoppers occurred only sporadically across 88 hours of game time I wouldn't say that CP2077 is currently a particularly buggy game.

It is fun to move around in this game, and it has satisfying gunplay for an RPG. The shotgun in particular feels really meaty and allows you to blast enemies into a different dimension, as all good video game shotguns should. The fact that there are various combinations of perks and cyberware possible means you have a lot of tools at your disposal when it comes to dealing with enemies. I started out always going in guns blazing, because I'm the impatient type and I thought it was funny to immediately fail the stealth conditions on purpose (and sometimes get berated for it), but later on I started experimenting with stealth, and I have to say that it makes for engaging gameplay as well. Said stealth is not particularly complex, as in, there is a limited number of basic options you can play around with, but I don't necessarily consider that to be a bad thing.

CP2077's writing, themes, and sense of aesthetics are where it truly shines for me, but they might turn you off if you're not as inherently receptive to them as I am. Without going into detail, most quests and characters are not black-and-white, you often have to make difficult morally grey choices, and the sense of hopelessness and cynicism that pervades the world will not appeal to everyone, especially since it is already so pervasive in modern entertainment. I myself do not mind this so much, because it lends more weight to those moments where you actually [i]can[/i] influence the world in some way, and/or build meaningful connections with other characters.
Nearly all quests after a certain point are named after song titles, which I personally loved. They seemed to lean especially towards punk and new wave, both of which I am a fan of (and I assume the year 2077 itself is a reference to punk). I recognized songs by The Ramones, Dead Kennedys, Blondie, and the Smiths, among many others. One of the quests is named after I Don't Wanna Hear It by Minor Threat, which is just amazing to see in an AAA game released in 2020. Once again, your mileage may vary.

The main criticism of Cyberpunk 2077 for me is that it sometimes fails to stick the landing. There are many well-written and engaging quests or quest chains that just fizzle out or end anticlimactically, both narratively and mechanically. Typically, if you've gone above and beyond, you end up getting a garbage-tier weapon that is not worth making a detour for, or another car you'll never use, and regardless you basically never hear from that character again, except for maybe a text, no matter how long and closely you've worked with them.

This final point is specific to the minority of losers such as myself who use azerty keyboards, so you can skip this if that doesn't apply to you, but CP2077 does NOT play nice with azerty (and presumably anything else that deviates from the standard qwerty lay-out). Not only did I have to rebind the WASD controls to ZQSD, which fair enough, but certain keybinds (such as q to drop a body you are carrying, which obviously conflicts with movement for azerty users) are impossible to change in-game, and I had to manually go into the config files to modify them. You can ask why people in Flanders would use azerty to begin with, and that's a good question, but it does actually come in useful sometimes for work, on those occasions where I have to communicate in French. So I have to dock points for the devs' decision to ignore us, but obviously this is not enough to tip the scales, and it will not affect most people reading this review.

All in all, despite the bugs that do persist to some extent even post-2.0, and the fact that it often has difficulty wrapping things up in a satisfying manner, CP2077 does many things right, and the average gamer will find it to be an enjoyable, cinematic experience. If you suspect that the game's themes and aesthetics might resonate with you, as they did in my case, it becomes an absolute must-buy.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

This game has one of the best stories ever made, Oscar-worthy voice acting, a soundtrack you could listen to over and over, an open world that feels alive but wants you dead, characters you wish you could confide in and cuddle, graphics that have truly set the bar for open-world games(only if you have some GAMING MONSTER) and an experience you will never forget like never.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"This is a write up on what happens if you already own Sims 4 on Origin and buy it on Steam.

= Installing =
The Origin and Steam install are in separate locations so everything will have to be redownloaded.  Any DLC you've bought in Origin will appear in game (but not in Steam).  Oddly there's no download progress for DLC bought in Origin and downloaded with Steam.  It just states ""a background download is in progress"".  Also, Origin now shows me two copies of The Sims 4 - one version is normal while the other is marked as ""Steam"".

If you want to go back to the Origin version just uninstall the Steam version.  Steam will delete it's installed copy of the game.  When you launch Origin it will think Sims 4 needs to be reinstalled.  Since the original Origin install folder is still there it will quickly verify everything and you'll be back to normal.

= Running the Game =
When you launch the game from Steam it fires up Origin.  When you launch the game from Origin it fires up Steam.  Even if you launch the Origin installed version of the game the Steam version supersedes it.  So if you install both an Origin and Steam version of the game it will always launch the Steam version.

= Sales =
The Sims 4 now has different in-game store fronts.  Right now there are no sales going on in Origin so that version of the game just shows all my unowned DLC at regular price.  But Steam IS having a sale so running that version of the game shows all the DLC at a discount.  I didn't buy any DLC from Steam so I'm not sure what happens with that.

= Saved Games and CC =
Both versions of the game use the same ""My Documents"" location for saved games and CC.  There should be no issues with that once all your DLC is installed.

= Bottom Line =
If you have any real investment in the Origin version then I'd say stick with that.  If you're new to Sims 4 then Steam is probably better.  The dual client thing is annoying since you need to wait for Origin and Steam to launch but Steam is the more robust client.  If the Steam version wasn't tied to Origin then I'd absolutely recommend dropping Origin but since you need both it's not worth the hassle to transfer to Steam.  Hopefully EA will get a clue and fully merge Origin and Steam accounts and just get rid of Origin.  The fact that Titanfall 2 bombed on Origin and is a huge success on Steam should be all the proof EA needs.","Very Positive87% of the 127,522 user reviews for this game are positive.",write happens already sims origin installing origin install separate location redownloaded downloadable additional released initial launch bought origin appear not_in oddly no_download progress downloadable additional released initial launch bought origin downloaded state background download progress origin show copy sims version normal marked origin version uninstall version delete installed copy launch origin sims need reinstalled original origin install folder quickly verify normal running launch fire origin launch origin fire launch origin installed version version supersedes install origin version launch version sale sims different front no_sales origin version show unowned downloadable additional released initial launch regular price sale running version show downloadable additional released initial launch discount downloadable additional released initial launch not_sure happens saved game cc version document location saved game cc no_issues downloadable additional released initial launch installed bottom line real investment origin version stick sims probably dual client annoying wait origin launch robust client version t_emphasizedied origin recommend dropping origin not_worth hassle transfer hopefully ea clue merge origin account rid origin titanfall 2 bombed origin huge success proof ea need

1085660,Destiny 2,"Destiny 2 has flipped the script on my personality, and quite frankly, my beliefs as a whole. Before this game, I was a positive, and just man. Giving credit to opposing players in other competitive games was the M.O. It's natural to lose every once in a while, some people are just better than you at some things and understanding that is only half the battle... or so I thought.

With every single death by the Igneous Hammer, Shatterdive, or the god-fucking-forsaken Bastion; my general outlook on life as a whole dwindles. I stopped going to the gym just to practice PvP in Destiny 2. I broke up with my girlfriend because she got in the way of my Glory Rank. Who needs college when you can go flawless in Trials? My attitude is ferociously aggressive due to the constant ass-raping I receive from 1350+ power smooth-brained, cock munching, bottom tree Striker Titans running Dunemarchers and Chaperone. Dawnblade Warlocks find a way to sniff out and obliterate my fucking taint with flying, flaming swords OR, manage to get their cross-mapping melee ability off on me as I spawn. Hunters are massively undermined by having Super armor equivalent to wet fucking cardboard that couldn't even begin to protect them. Go ahead and pop bottom tree Golden Gun and watch how fast you don't get kills because some mentally ill degenerate with an Adept Eye of Sol enables his aimbot on your sorry ass. Thanks for the Anti-Cheat Bungie! I give a fuck. 

The general state of the game as this review is being typed isn't far from pitiful. You want to go flawless in Trials? Go to hell. Level up your Glory rank past Fabled? Level up your expectations. Use out of meta guns? How about suck my dick. Destiny 2 has entirely drained all happiness and joy I used to get from playing it. Existence is pain, love is dead, we're all going to die. Play a better game.

TL;DR: Really great game with an extremely active community. Good story and even better characters. Highly recommend Destiny 2's story to any Sci-Fi enthusiast.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Been here since day 1, and I am someone who came from the PS4 version of the game. This has been quite the journey from its horrendous launch to where we are today. Ever since launch I have enjoyed the game, though I do acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable how this game launched, and no video game should launch how Cyberpunk 2077 did. I'd say that this game has been ""playable"" since its 1.3 updates, but it wasn't in a state where I could fully recommended this game to others due to it still being in a worst state than early day Skyrim or the likes. Now here we are, the 1.5 relaunch update has brought us the ""next gen"" update to the game. Whatever you want to actually call this update, it brings the soft overhaul to the game in terms of stability and actual feature and mechanics rebalance to make the game far better in its design, and thus making it feel better to play, along with its far improved stability. The game is now at a state where I could fully recommend it.

The game is still far from being perfect, as certain play styles far outclass other play styles in terms of combat, especially melee combat, as its still pretty stiff and a bit of a button masher at times. Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really. 

There is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.

I really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1203620,Enshrouded,"This game is so good, i wanna play 24/7 XD everything from visuals, music, mining, farming, crafting to combat is great - controls/UI very intuitive - the building system is PHENOMENAL !!!! you can get lost easily for hours ( or days !! ) creating your base or a whole village,  block by block XD trying different styles and layouts, there's so many materials to work with - builder heaven \o/ 
i just finished rebuilding a half destroyed town up north, with a friend - we stumbled upon it during a quest and fell in love with the layout of the town and buildings .. now we're spending our time fixing walls, bridges, roofs, decorating rooms instead of being out there beating up baddies XD
I never played a game where the player could change already existing buildings to that extent, that's a first for me !
Having the 5 NPCs like the blacksmith, hunter, farmer etc live on your base is also a nice touch, makes it feel even more like a home :) 

The wide variety of weapons, armor, spells & potions and impressive skill trees also allows for a plethora of different builds !
Of course, the game is still in early access, the world is not infinite but also absolutely not small and filled with quests, secrets and treasure \o/ there's a lot to explore already, a good variety of different biomes, animals, enemies, plants, ores etc. .. the shroud itself is also a very refreshing concept .. the thrill of entering a foggy, hostile, nightmarish home to strong enemies that could easily end you or to get the life sucked out of you by the shroud itself if you don't get out in time !

899770,Last Epoch,"As somebody who has played RPG's for over a decade I feel that Last Epoch is one of the best-all-around games i've ever played. This game does so many things right. 

To start with, the gameplay is very fast paced. The fact that I regen out of combat helps with making each time i ENTER combat a full-on battle. I don't find myself hunkering down between battles. Or timing my attacks to line up with  rest-periods. 

Graphics are extremely well done. In a manner that represents the genre without going over the top.

As I level the identity of my character slowly starts to form. This might sound odd but as somebody who has played plenty of RPG's; Sometimes it feels as though im just spamming red/blue/green spells without much feel to them. In LE the way skills are customized took me by surprise. 

Unique's are so  well done. Every time I see one I can't wait to read their stats. The fun thing about uniques in LE is that they are immediately obvious  how useful they will be.  Without some weird gimmick.


The story line is very engaging. It's  straight forward coupled with the built-in quest tracker it has been one of the best leveling experiences i've had in an RPG. Side quest? A lot of the zones funnel you to the end. It's the opposite of some games where it feels like every map is hide and seek. 

Crafting is very rewarding. They don't try to  convolute the system in any way. Without explaining much the best part about the system is that you can't ruin your item. You can only improve them - to an extent.  


Crafting can be done at any point in the game and doesn't require any special tools or quests to start. Say you're Mid-zone and want to try to upgrade a rare you just found? Open up the menu and do it.

The waypoint system was done in a way that doesn't  punish you for being  in the wrong zone. You simply open map and teleport anywhere you can. No need to TP back to town, then open quest menu just to  teleport.  Or if you've finished a quest and want to fast-track to the next one. Instantly teleport in to that zone. 

There is an in-game guide that explains every mechanic. I am yet to HAVE to google any question i've had. All the information is right there  in a very simple format. It's like they want you to know exactly how the game works. 

Looting is simple and quick .  Gold is automatically picked up. If you pickup 1 shard every shard around you is picked up.  


 With how fast crafting / Loot / Straight forward things are.  That's what makes this game is a true ACTION rpg. It focuses on getting you back in the combat.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"This is quite possibly the worst Far Cry game in the entire franchise.

First I need to point out the good.

Good graphics.
Good soundtrack and voice overs?
and....................that's all I got.........

This critique will be from a PC perspective with a mouse and keyboard for controls.
So let's start with the basic controls. They somehow, someway, managed to completely break the controls in this game. Why they couldn't just do a ""copy and paste"" of the controls from Far Cry 5 is beyond me. They broke the controls/physics of the helicopters in Far Cry 6 making them virtually useless. It is a shame because using helicopters in Far Cry 5 was fun! They could have also been fun to use in this game, but oh well. Just assigning weapons in this game is broken. You have to left click a series of times to select the weapon and then at the end (which should complete with a final left click of the mouse, you instead have to hit a bound key?)......who the heck thought of this???? It may not sound like a big deal but it's very easy to not realize that you don't have a weapon assigned until you start your mission and try to bring up that weapon. 

And remember how in the other Far Cry games, you could throw a rock (T) to distract enemies? Well the geniuses took that away. I'm guessing the reason the did this was to add value/meaning to THE SUPREMOS!

THE SUPREMOS are large cumbersome pieces of bulky garbage that are strapped on to your character. Using these pieces of junk are the only way you can utilize grenades, throwing knives and Molotov incendiaries. Oh and you can equip baseballs that will distract enemies when thrown. So that is why they got rid of the rocks I guess..

There is a point in the game, at one of the camps that the game forces you into a third person view (for no obvious reason) and you get to see how bad THE SUPREMO looks on your character. It literally makes your character look like some dysfunctional biped tortoise. 

Overall the game just isn't fun like the previous games were. Everything feels like a grind. Fishing, hunting, doing missions, completing map objectives.....it all just feels like a grind and isn't fun.

I was able to get the quickest ending/completion of the game on easy mode and I honestly think that is where I am going to have to leave it due to the lack of fun.

If/when the next Far Cry game of the franchise is release I am going to have to do serious research before I buy it. If they continue down the same road they took for Far Cry 6, I will definitely pass on it.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"In 1998, after seeing Saving Private Ryan at the tender supple age of 16, I wrote a letter to god knows what game developer that essentially outlined what this game actually is:  gritty, slow-paced foot races to take objectives, forced team work and communication, and the iron-sight dominated battlefield.  

I won't lie:  I had the exact same frustrations as everyone else: ""I can't see anyone!"".  Take it from me:  MOVE SLOWLY.  APPROACH CORNERS METHODICALLY.  STICK YOUR HEAD OUT SLOWLY.  WAIT.  LOOK FOR MOVEMENT.  IF NONE, TRY MOVING.  REPEAT.

The only way to have a ""truly"" enjoyable time is to use a headset, participate in chat and strategy, call in requests for supplies, put down garrisons and outposts.  If you are a squad leader, make sure someone is an engineer and set up nodes.  This may require having supply drops on the HQ or having someone else run support and drop them in your squad.  Resources and a competent commander make the game SO much more enjoyable.

1778820,TEKKEN 8,"[b]Pretty good package all around. But I am deeply hurt to say, no Tekken Ball online. Only Local.[/b]

[b] Main story shows love to fun side characters.[/b]  Story itself isn't really that interesting, but there's a lot of effort put in it to make it a fun display.

[b] There's another game mode called Character Episodes. Short CGI endings are back and they look great, however it still feels like a ""fun little side thing"".[/b]  It could have used more matches than five, could get a little harder at the end as it doesn't feel like a real game mode but something to do for casuals. I don't like that idea, I think even casuals would like to overcome some challenge, which would make them more likely to play online. Nevermind that, they could actually advance characters' storylines instead of repeating the same old feuds. So there's not much really new, would absolutely be more fun if you had no idea what Tekken is, I guess. But it's way better than Tekken 7 at the very least. 

[b] Arcade mode is a tiny bit better in the matter of gameplay[/b], eight battles that are a lot more challenging, but I don't really see why you would play it again after you've seen it once, especially when there's Super Ghost Battle.

[b] Super Ghost Battle is truly fun, you can download someone elses ghost you face online, you can basically download a bunch of good players and make an Endless Mode of your own.[/b] Of course they are still not the carbon copy of the player and act slower, but they use similar tactics and make similar mistakes, so it is a very useful tool to break down the opponent's patterns.

[b] I think the biggest achievement of Tekken 8 is that they've done everything they could to teach the game.[/b]  Streamlined a lot of characters' game plan, added Heat as a last resort for choking newcomers and turned it into an actual fun mechanic so it isn't a burden on experienced players, the practice mode is great, being able to watch replays is great, you can even take control during a replay to try a different approach, it's really amazing how much thought they put into it. [b]Arcade Quest, while it condescendingly babies the player with Mii characters, sets up well thought tutorial matches to show you the ropes.[/b] It still doesn't break down everything, but at least it is character specific and gives you a good idea of what to expect. It's nice if you're someone who never played a fighting game and want to avoid studying a video game. It gives you the basics however it still won't teach you everything about your character, or about actual bastard plays people make in Ranked.


[b]I'm very positive about the gameplay itself[/b], while I think the visuals are cluttered and Rage Art cutscenes are annoying because it forces you to watch a customized anime character do a bunch of generic bullshit whose shameful creator is surely jerking off during that whole minute, [b]I think this game allows a larger variety of gamestyles than Tekken 7.[/b] Turtling is not unbeatable anymore. You can sidestep, power crush, throw, and most importantly use explosive moves like King's or Paul's punches to stagger the enemy and put pressure on a blocking player or fish for openings. There's still a lot of times when it feels unfair, like when a character pulls up with something in a confusing mix-up, a trap for you to lower your guard to punish you for a simple jab, and spams that because it's the easy thing to do, but I do not think a fighting game can ever be truly balanced without being boring.

[b]Network connection is fine in general, but it doesn't deal with high ping extremely well.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"I absolutely love this game, BUT there are some issues. This is not an attack on the devs or the game, I just feel that it's very important to bring legitimate criticisms to light, despite my love for the game. I want you to be informed on your purchase instead of being disappointed.

1. Anti-Cheat: This can significantly impact performance during gameplay, especially on older CPUs (including those within the minimum and recommended specs). Many have reported problems on a variety of newer cores as well. 

2. General Performance: The game seems to not properly utilize the GPU and as such, pulls a lot from the CPU. Performance is quite spotty. One night, you'll be running at a solid 70-80 fps with very few drops, the next night you'll struggle to get over 45. Sometimes, the game allows for very little room to run extra apps like Discord in the background and it can impact performance of your whole PC significantly. Again, this has been reported by many people on older AND newer cores. Crashes can also be very frequent. For me, reinstalling the game a couple of times fixed many of these issues.

3. Super Credits and Monetization: Now to the microtransaction issue. I have very mixed feelings about how the premium currency is handled in this game. On the one hand, there is NEVER a good reason to include MTX in a PAID game. But on the other hand, it's going to happen regardless and this is one of the least intrusive MTX systems I've seen in recent history. The reason why I'm not fully against it is because you can find Super Credits in most missions in packs of 10, just be sure to check Minor Points of Interest! I have found as much as 50 SC in a single mission (And they're shared with your teammates!), though you can go quite a few missions without seeing any at all. Not only is it present in the missions, it is also available in the FREE and premium Warbonds in packs of 100 or 50. I was initially impressed with the low pricing of the Super Credits store, but recently they added items in the store that can cost as much as 400 SC. That's ~$4 worth of Super Credits for only one item. Further, what pisses me off the most about this is that there are PREMIUM Warbonds that cost 1000 SC. Which brings me to my next point.

4. The Warbond Progression System: The main progression system is through what the game calls ""Warbonds"". Warbonds are a 1-1 replica of Fortnite's current Battle Pass system. You have pages of items that you unlock with Medals that you earn from completing missions. However, you must spend a certain amount of Medals before moving onto the next page of each Warbond. Each page has 8 items each, consisting of one pack of Super Credits (quantity changes depending on the page), one weapon, one suit of armor, one cape, one helmet, one emote, one player card, and one different piece of equipment per page. The problem is, many of the items are not worth spending medals on, yet are required in order to progress to the next page due to the Medal threshold. Good news is that Medals are pretty easy to unlock in mid-high difficilties.

The next problem regarding the Warbond system are the [i]Premium[/i] Warbonds. These are Warbonds that cost Super Credits to access, then Medals to progress through. The current one costs a whopping 1000 SC. It consists of modified versions of basegame weapons, as well as the usual armor set, emote, etc. The weapons are mostly just slightly buffed versions of some of the basegame weapons, but none of them are the best weapons in the game. In fact, most of the Primary and Secondary weapons are very viable throughout the game, they really just feel different in terms of playstyle. You won't have much of an edge over your teammates in terms of weapons if you have the Premium Warbond. The issue I have is mainly the price. While, you can earn SC in the game, you'd have to save every single one in order to make enough to purchase the Premium Warbond. You won't be able to afford any other SC items if you want to earn the current Premium Warbond through playing the game (unless you want to grind for even longer than it already is). Premium Warbonds [b]HAVE TO GO[/b]. Make all of the Warbonds FREE TO ACCESS FROM THE START. Or, make it a progressive system where you unlock the next Warbond after completing one. Having it use Premium Currency significantly hurts the progression system and makes grinding for it a slog. 

Last thing before I move on: There are only 2 Warbonds at the time of writing, so most of what I just said is SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Also, Warbonds are PERMANENT and will not go away when new ones come out (At least, according to the developers).

5. Non-Warbond Progression System: This is something I really enjoy in this game, but still has some problems. There are 2 other forms of progression in the game: Stratagems and Ship Upgrades. Stratagems are support utilities that can be called upon in-mission. You unlock these through Requisition Credits that you earn by completing objectives in missions. Ship Upgrades are general upgrades that improve various stats for your character (these do NOT apply to your entire team afaik). Stratagems are also level-locked, meaning you'll have to reach certain levels to unlock more to purchase. Ship Upgrades are unlocked with Common, Rare, and Super Rare Samples you pick up in missions. Higher rarities become available in higher difficulties. These are a bit harder to earn as you drop them when you die (they can be reclaimed, but it can be very difficult sometimes). Both, Req Credits and Samples are shared with your team. The problem with both Ship Upgrades and Stratagems is that, while there are insanely good ones, there are also a lot of useless ones. I have found that it's better to just save up for the stratagems that are clearly better. Most Ship Upgrades are minor buffs with some outliers that are very useful. Which, these things are going to happen with any game, but it's still a little disappointing.

6. Matchmaking and Server Issues: Many of the matchmaking issues have been resolved over the last few days. They are still present, just not as much. I, personally, have not had many issues with matchmaking. Also, if you get a matchmaking error, spamming the button usually works. Though, playing with friends is a lot more reliable than random matchmaking. Rewards are now being properly distributed at mission completion. The devs are hard-at-work, trying to resolve the remaining issues. But, if you don't have friends to reliably play with or are simply on the fence about getting this game, join the Discord server to keep up-to-date and team up with others. Hell, I'd still recommend the game right now because it's still fun as hell XD.

7. The Problem of Live Service Games: Lastly, the problem with all Live Service games. You really depend on the servers to be running properly. This prevents you from being able to host completely private matches that connect directly to the host's PC. This also basically gives the game a limited lifespan as once the game loses most of it's playerbase, the servers may shut down and anyone who still plays and enjoys it won't be able to (though, this definitely will not happen ANYTIME soon). Hopefully, Arrowhead adds a way to connect directly to each other so even when the dev-hosted servers go down, we'll still be able to enjoy it with our friends.

Overall, I [b]HIGHLY[/b] recommend this game. It is incredibly enjoyable and for every negative I listed, there's at least 5 positives. To name a few: the wit is hilarious, the ever-changing Galactic War system is very interesting and works great, the potential for new alien races is limitless, the enemy variety provides very interesting enemy desgins, the gunplay is FANTASTIC, I could go on and on about the good things in this game. Definitely pick this game up because it's an absolute BLAST!

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"Backstory :  I started with MS Flightsim on an amber screened IBM clone in 1987. It took several 'disks' to load, and I would go make coffee and  drink most of it before it would be loaded and ready to play. Looking back, it was simply atrocious. It had no graphics to speak of, ran at less than 5 fps, and used a keyboard as input. In short, it was the equivalent of flying a very stubborn turkey. 

But I was hooked. ""One day, I mused - this will be real. One day places will look like it does in the real world. One day planes will feel like planes, not just an illusion of something clearly being tortured on a screen. 

Finally,  37 years later, 'one day' is here. 

I can nitpick little flaws in this game, like the fact that the frame rate is inconsistent, and it slows down substantially around massive built up areas, or that the drone camera system is somewhat cumbersome and flight planning could be a lot more user friendly when adding or re-ordering waypoints. But these are minor. And  though I am sure they will be ironed out, I could also live with the game as is, because all the rest is just so far ahead of anything else I've ever seen. It not just great, its phenomenal. 


I've been a hopeless pilot, trying my best for years and years, and I'm still rubbish at it. However, this simulator is a quantum leap from the ones before. I can actually land every time without crashing when realism is maxed out.  The actual simulation of flight systems and avionics has been vastly improved, making it so much easier to hand fly aircraft  than in previous iterations.  It actually feels like you are flying a plane, not a simulation.  It actually feels like you are in your hometown when flying over it. (And no - that house you are flying into looks nothing like your actual house. In fact it could be mine.  )

Sometimes a product comes along that changes everything about its genre. This will change flight simulation forever. This is groundbreaking.

So seeing this being delivered before I get to go to that big refrigerator in the sky,  makes me so unbelievably happy. It gives me untold pleasure to admit: ""Its finally here and its better than I ever imagined possible""

I'm not going to complain about a single thing, when, for $60, I can go fly anywhere in a faithfully recreated virtual copy the world. Fly over a place and exclaim: ""This actually does look like it does in real life."" How ungrateful would I be If I lamented the hours and hours it took to download, when, by the end of it, the whole world exists on a little setup in the corner of my lounge.  Honestly, some people.

I am one very happy gamer today. Always knew this day would come. It did, and its simply mind blowing.","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",backstory started m flightsim amber screened ibm clone 1987 took disk load coffee drink loaded ready play simply atrocious no_graphics speak ran 5 shooter keyboard input short equivalent flying stubborn turkey hooked mused real place real world plane plane not_just illusion clearly tortured screen finally 37 year nitpick flaw frame rate inconsistent slows substantially massive built area drone camera somewhat cumbersome planning user friendly adding ordering waypoints minor ironed live rest far ahead else not_just great phenomenal hopeless pilot trying best year year rubbish quantum leap one land crashing realism maxed actual system avionics vastly improved easier hand fly aircraft iteration feel flying plane not_a feel hometown flying no_that house flying look actual house mine product come along change genre forever groundbreaking seeing delivered big refrigerator sky make unbelievably happy give untold pleasure admit finally imagined possible not_going complain single 60 fly anywhere faithfully recreated virtual copy world fly exclaim real life ungrateful lamented hour hour took download world exists setup corner lounge honestly happy gamer today knew simply mind blowing

They haven't fixed years old bugs, haven't done some nice decompression for matchmaking and all the premiums are ridiculous. Especially the Ka-50. Fuck that thing. Grind for ships past like 2.3 is awful, grind for helicopters is hell, and tanks, while better, are still bad. Top-tier tanks are a clusterfuck, top-tier jets as of this writing are basically F-4 Phantoms, premium Hunters and the occasional MiG-21, 19 or F-100. Bombers are bad. Don't play them. I feel if they weren't so terrible with premiums and fixed the bugs and compression, the game would be a lot better. Planes are tons of fun, especially jets. Booming in to hit someone at the speed of sound is always fun. Especially with their changes to the sound engine recently.

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"[h1] Rubicon is where dreams go to die. [/h1]

Armored Core 6 is a gloomy action game with intense mecha combat. Everything about this game sets a tone; the visual juxtaposition of the powerful and often sleek giant robots against the destroyed landscape of the planet Rubicon, the subtle but gorgeous industrial soundtrack, and all the dreams that get crushed along the way. What an excellent sense of scale this game has.
Deeply engaging in both story and gameplay, while I went in with an appropriately mercenary attitude this quickly gave way, and I was taken in fully by the game's world. Story is given mostly in the form of audio messages before during and after missions but don't let that description make you think it isn't full of character with lots of lore tidbits to collect and dialogue to reflect on. I'd also like to praise the excellent voice performances on both the English dub and original Japanese, as a stanch user of the anime pfp I actually opted for the English voices this time, and they are great. 
Combat is very fun in AC6, more than once while playing it made me pine for a Gun dam game in this format. You pilot the titular Armoured Core equipped with 2 hand weapons (guns, lasers, swords, missiles, shields, rocket launchers) and 2 support weapons on your back. You can then glide around the arena with your little boosters, towering over the remnants of cities and demolishing enemy mech pilots. The afore mentioned weapons are all completely customizable and so is basically everything else about your AC from colours to lights to the arms and legs of the thing, I spent a lot of time on this feature.
I don't really consider myself a person that seeks out difficult or super challenging games but the punishing this game offers didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game at all, in fact I went out of my way to 100% this one.

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

899770,Last Epoch,"The good points up front are the skill trees and the setting of the game. 

The bad parts are the incomplete campaign, story boss bugs that have not been fixed (Lagon), lackluster endgame, and missing QOL features (imagine hand picking up crafting mats one by one in 2023). Having to grind out your skill points again after respeccing just adds more tedium. The uniques are somewhat interesting, but nothing to write home about.

Being early access, usually a game is here for testing and to get polished before release. After doing some reading, I believe this game will be released in an unfinished state if at all.

The developers do not engage their paying customers on Steam, but instead hang out on reddit and their forums of all places. The community there at large is an echo chamber for the developers who actually do not accept any form of criticism of the game or the decisions of said developers.  

Any roadmaps and announcements will be quoted from their forums, their kickstarter page, discord, or a post-it on someones monitor whichever is convenient. So far as I have seen they have recieved funding from kickstarter, supporter packs, early access sales and Tencent. Now they decided to sell cash shop cosmetics while in early access. Clearly this is a company that is unable to manage their budget. 

So far we are on version 0.9, which is pretty close to release and we are missing classes, a finished campaign, critical bugfixes and a plan for an endgame. People need to test this content, which is what early access is also there for.

Instead they worked on revamping Act 1 which was a non issue, adding their cash shop which sent wrong signals everywhere, and forcing mmolike towns to of course display said cosmetics. They refuse to add the most basic QOL that every ARPG has had for a decade and come off as bad PoE copypasta.

It is a shame, because this game could have been great. Asking for 30 bucks and adding MTX is a douche move for an indie. PoE is free at least, and well Diablo is carried by it's own brand. LE however is a no name new contender, which ultimately will get knocked out of the market as long as the devs steer it in the current direction.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don't play these types of games - they're just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are [i]really[/i] into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I've formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.

[h1]Do I think Apex Legends is good?[/h1]
Honestly...yes. I do. I didn't expect it but I've been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that's enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
There are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let's break them down point by point.

- [b]Gun play[/b]
The guns in Apex are [i]satisfying[/i] to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I'd choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say ""hey I died but I had fun"".
Not everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can't just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying.
On top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don't think they work very well and they aren't anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there's memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it's because they just really don't fit in with the way this game wants you to play it.
To clarify - I'm not saying they're useless, I'm just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.

- [b]Abilities[/b]
This game's abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren't integrated into gameplay properly. It's the one thing that I dislike about this game being that  you have no idea what you're getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once.
But perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they're conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not.
Overall though, I appreciate that this game doesn't make it so you [i]need[/i] to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you [i]can[/i] use if you need it.

- [b]Movement[/b]
I love this game's movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it's no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels [i]really good[/i] and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter.
The only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it's super satisfying but [i]man[/i] does it feel awkward initially.

[h1]Monetization:[/h1]
This is a free-to-play game, it's natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they've created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how's the monetization in this game? Honestly I'm incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.

- [b]DLC[/b]
The DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I'm hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it's just a shame altogether - I'd personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.

- [b]Lootboxes[/b]
I think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I'm not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I've gathered they don't do limited-time lootbox drops so they're avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they're there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.

- [b]Battle Pass[/b]
This is one thing I actively dislike about this game's monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like ""Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin"", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you ""buy premium to get this skin!"", at which point I just wanna tell the game to fuck off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.

[h1]Graphics, Sound & Optimization:[/h1]
How are the other aspects of the game?

- [b]Graphics[/b]
For being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching.
Some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It's not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.

- [b]Sound[/b]
The sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying.
The music isn't anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don't really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about.
The voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.

- [b]Optimization[/b]
I think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn't seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it's just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
There are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it's satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.","Mostly Positive78% of the 794,366 user reviews for this game are positive.",legend battle royale 1 normally play type game not_something personally enjoy legend different friend i_emphasizednto able semi consistently someone play amazing putting 20 hour confident formed legend good honestly yes expect far enjoying legend bit gripe someone asked shot not_my answer solid yes convince good hope enjoy rest hear read aspect legend enjoy talking break gun play gun satisfying controllable recoil sound incredibly satisfying compare oddly choose compare tf2 gun play rock solid seeing solid 60 damage example dopamine kick let hey died fun not_everything perfect favorite mechanic shooter bullet drop understand sake balance someone smg snipe across mid range feel clunky annoying top gun kind pointless prime example energy weapon shotgun fire rate usually abysmal and_emphasized precision good tactical shooter counter strike fast paced battle royale t_emphasizedhink anywhere near appealing sniper rifle lmg understand meme shotgun bad fit want play clarify not_saying useless saying option result faster efficiently ability ability newcomer daunting integrated properly dislike no_idea able legend play perhaps good ability meant situational escape sticky situation edge opponent left feeling legend useful others bloodhound lifeline conceptually super simple easy grasp whereas character wraith difficult understand ability applicable not_overall appreciate ability win treat movement love movement mechanic based source engine thing no_wonder satisfying movement mechanic moving flying tower sliding slope feel good fight movement break encounter complaint regard movement concern specific legend pathfinder standard grapple depth perception worst enemy constantly fighting considered appropriate distance initiate grapple hang it_emphasized s_emphasizeduper satisfying man awkward initially monetization play natural monetization developer earn product created pretty skeptical publisher ea worst possible given monetization honestly incredibly mixed lem detail downloadable additional released initial launch downloadable additional released initial launch stupidly overpriced offer review reflect 30 unlock single hero honestly stupid price downloadable additional released initial launch definitely barely offer worthwhile consumer honestly hardly surprised given publisher shame personally avoid downloadable additional released initial launch unless go 50 sale lootboxes lootbox pretty okay not_condoning inclusion inoffensive best legend lootboxes offer 100 cosmetic item varying rarity item ranging crafting material shop weapon skin gathered limited lootbox drop avoiding consumer fomo welcome addition word skip not_with engage appreciate b_emphasizedattle pas actively dislike monetization purely clickbaits constantly stuff reach 25 unlock skin reach 25 tell premium skin wan na fuck battle pas challenge fine reward underwhelming keep trying drag buying premium battle pas actively dislike graphic sound optimization aspect graphic developed source engine surprise able accomplish look great not_outstanding stunning visually appealing eye catching gripe tends struggle loading graphic found staring insanely low re texture slowly fade higher quality one not_that big deal usually happened loading screen selection screen noticed sound sound music good gun sound great hitsounds perfectly satisfying music outstanding stick mind comment great background non crucial situation definitely freely mute forget voice acting okay actor good portraying optimization department frequently notice random frame drop mentioned texture loading struggle maintaining playable framerate like dip annoying conclusion thing wan na talk cut due limit legend surprised s_emphasizedatisfyingly fun look great monetization optimization fence trying

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Black flag is probably the best assassin's creed game in the franchise from a fun perspective. I played it back on the 360 in 2013 and it still holds up in 2020
Its got a wide arsenal of weapons to use being 2 swords, 4 pistols, 2 hidden blades, a blowpipe with 2 different ammo types, and a rope dart. Plus a entire ship to customize and attack and board other ships. Its also super fun to explore the Caribbean while your crew sing shanties and whales surface giving a cool vibe. 
The combat itself is a little basic and you can pretty much kill anything from the very beginning but i still think its a pretty fun combat loop and Edward fights brutally. The parkour is pretty easy so you can turn your brain off (kinda good kinda bad depending on how you see that)
The story i think is pretty interesting and the characters are probably the best in any ac game. Blackbeard, Kidd, and Edward being the standouts with their performances.
The only ""bad"" parts i can say is really the modern day sections but they're so short it doesnt really get in the way of doing pirate stuff and outside of certain story moments you wont be in the first person modern day parts often if ever.

Enjoyable game. Building is amazing. The detail you can put into your builds is top notch.

Weapon and armor crafting are sub-par. Most stuff is found in the world. I often found myself wishing there was a way to craft gear. 

Leveling doesnt seem to keep up to speed with progression. I've hit level 11 and all my progression quests and exploration requires me to go into level 15+ zones. Doable, but highly annoying.

236390,War Thunder,"[h1]This is an extensive review of what to expect going into another Free-To-Play game and its business practices. This review is aimed for new players looking to get into the tank part of the game.[/h1]

[i]Note : If you are interested in aircraft or ships, skip this one.[/i]


The game is developed by a Russian company, Gaijin - they work with another company to make the vehicle models and other individuals and contributors to get real data/information on how they performed in real life and how to best represent that in-game.

[b]The Positives Side : [/b]
[list]
[*] The graphics are stunning. Very accurate models, world detail and the new Dagor 5.0 engine did wonders for the game and they've promised even more optimizations in the recent Russian stream. The overall feeling is quite good, although the warlike atmosphere (such as smoke clouding the skies) could be a bit better. 
[*] UK, USA, Russia, Germany, France, Japan and soon Italy will be participating in ground battles. Each nation with their own playstyle, shells, armor layouts making for a refreshing experience.
[*] Accurate ballistics and armor composition make for a tactical tank combat that requires knowledge before player skill. In-game stat cards give an overall idea of what the tank is capable of, how much punching power it has and what type of it can deal with. It's quite a steep learning curve for the first hundred hours and even by then you'll still have questions about how to deal with certain targets and what to look for. [i]Hint : Look for answers on youtube and reddit, not in-game.[/i] Rome wasn't built in a day and you will certainly not understand War Thunder's mechanics early on. 
[*] The tank models are really well made. I mentioned this before and I would like to emphasize on the ""weight"" of the tank compared to Wargaming's World of Tanks. You can really feel like you're driving a tank and not Mario Kart. The pacing is slow in two game modes, and a bit quicker in the other one (more below).
[*] The sounds are excellent. From 12.7mm Anti-Air guns, to big 150mm Sturmpanzer cannon - deeper, realistic and satisfying shell sounds are what help with immersion when playing this game. 
[*] Three game modes to please every tank player - Arcade, Realistic, Simulator. All have their differences ranging from engine power (with Simulator being the closest to real values and arcade having extra power) to aiming assistance. 
[/list]

[b] The Negative :[/b]
[list]
[*] Gaijin has to be one of the worst offenders in gaming history. If you have an extensive gaming experience you are already thinking of Nexon, Trion, EA, and half of the developers in the MMORPG market. The one thing they do not have compared to Gaijin is the [b]grip on a niche audience[/b]. You see, there's no competitor to War Thunder in the entire gaming industry. World of Tanks and Armored Warfare target a different audience - one that likes arcade style hitpoints, peak-a-boo style of tank play. The audience of War Thunder is completely different. You have community members who spend an absurd amount of time finding documents, conducting research unlike in any other community you'll ever see. Because there's no competitor on the market for a realistic war game with tanks and aircraft/ships, [b]they own this entire audience and they know it[/b]. This company has pulled of unprecedented levels of unprofessionalism and lack of communication with the playerbase that would've grounded [b]ANY[/b] company including the owner of this store you're reading this review on. Constant lies, fabricated ""sources"" and documents, selective feedback. I could go on forever here, but EA has that stigma because it was Star Wars and that hurts Americans, not because they're worse than Gaijin.
[*] Infurating matchmaker - The matchmaker is set to +- 1 battle rating. What this means is that having your best tank a 3.7 Sherman you will at worst be matched with players that have either a 4.7 vehicle as their best, or at best with players who have a 2.7 tank as top. In lower tiers this is not really an issue, you will learn and adapt to a different playstyle. However as you move up into late World War 2 vehicles where armor really matters and further into Cold War T-54s the matchmaker becomes such a problem to the point of frustration. Depending on the game, your best tank will not be able to penetrate frontally any of the enemy teams excluding cupolas and machine gun ports (if they have one). The community has been asking for a +- 0.7 battle rating matchmaker for [b]YEARS[/b], but they haven't listened and never will. Good luck fighting an American T29 heavy tank hull down on your Panther D, you will never win.
[*] When you get a new tank, you get a stock performance which can be further improved by researching modules such as ""Engine"", which gives a better acceleration, ""Brakes"" that help you break quicker and allow for quick retreating if you're caught off-guard and many others. Among these modules you have two culprits where one of the shittiest player frustration mechanic in the game is - ""Parts"" and ""Fire Prevention Equipment"". Without the first one, you cannot repair your tank, unless you're sitting on your objective. If you take a shot and your gun breech is damaged, you're out of combat for the rest of the game, since shooting with a broken gun breech will detonate the shell inside your own tank. If you take a shot to your transmission you'll be stationary the rest of the game. If a similar situation happens 20 seconds into the game...you can see how fun that might be. The best is FPE - if you get shot in your engine or fuel tanks, you'll be set on fire. You guessed it, without this module you'll continue burning until you're dead. The removal of these two modules has been asked since closed beta - Gaijin refused.
[*] Community management - No developer reads the international forum in English. Instead there are moderators who ""forward"" suggestions to them for review. This is fine, they're not required to know English, it's an absurd request. The moderators on the other hand are absolute morons and worthless human beings on a power trip. If they do not like your suggestion your post will never appear. Your communication with the developer is entirely gone because no one heard it - not your fellow players who could upvote that or give feedback to you on how to improve it, or why your idea is totally wrong and you should come back with a better one. Radio silence, it's gone. They shut down opinions they do not like or that highlight the Russian favoritism that is present in game (there's plenty of evidence of this, ask me below if you want) and ban everyone that talks back. Truly one of the worst forums out there.
[/list] 

Something to note about the community in-game : I was a bit surprised coming from World of Tanks and it's cesspool. Most games go without anyone talking other than radio commands ""Attack X"", ""Defend X"", ""Follow Me"" etc. Very rarely do you get dirtbags and flame wars, it's surprising in a PvP game. Usually it's someone venting in [ALL] about bias, rarely personal. They're far more talkative in Simulator Tank Battles, really nice as well. Overall a decent community I would say, on reddit too if you ignore some of the usual internet types. 

[b] Final thought :[/b]

The game itself is excellent, there's nothing like it which is why I've played it for so long. It's interesting, you also tend to learn things you never knew just by playing and talking to other community members - tanks, the war, other projects, prototypes and so on. 

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone however. The further you go, the sadder you'll feel about what a company like Grinding Gear, Digital Extremes or Obsidian could've done with this. This is the best war game on the Steam store, made by the worst company.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1085660,Destiny 2,"The end of an era. I've wrote two reviews for this game, because of how much I enjoyed it.
One during Witch Queen's release, one during Lightfall's release.

Whilst I never recommended the game, it was purely due to the monetisation of the game, and how challenging it was for a new player to get into the game.
I have always praised the gameplay within these reviews, because to me, Destiny 2 is a very enjoyable experience, mechanically speaking.

But now I cannot recommend this game at all, due to the upper management of Bungie killing the dev team and their passion for this game.

Upper management will refuse to listen to what the devs want to implement, whilst forcing more monetisation in. They will refuse to let the devs tone back microtransactions, or focus on what the community wants, because they want to chase a bottom line.

Recently, 100 Bungie employees, 8% of the total company, were laid off because Lightfall didn't meet inflated revenue projections.

Upper management is killing this game, slowly but surely. And until that changes, I cannot recommend this game.
Because until that changes, this game will only get worse, not better.","Very Positive80% of the 583,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",era wrote review enjoyed witch queen release lightfall release whilst never_recommended purely due monetisation challenging praised review enjoyable mechanically speaking cannot_recommend due upper management bungie killing passion upper management refuse listen implement whilst forcing monetisation refuse tone microtransactions focus community want chase bottom line recently 100 bungie employee 8 total company laid lightfall meet inflated revenue projection upper management killing slowly surely change cannot_recommend change worse not_better
1144200,Ready or Not,"Love the idea of the game but I have to agree with the people being rubbed the wrong way from updates being released weeks earlier only for ""supporters"" of the game who were suckered out of 80$. The game is in Early Access, just buying the game at all is already being a ""supporter"". Not to mention the devs are pretty terrible at communication recently, like changing the recent update from being available for all players, to being pushed back, only to then be made for supporters first all without a word. Bad business practice.

Edit: Thanks for the support on this review guys. Let's hope the developers see our complaints  and make some sort of positive change. Whether that be more communication and transparency, or a change to the awful ""supporter"" edition (although I bet they're going to follow the dollar signs on that idea).

Edit 2: The 1.0 version of the game came out and it is a massive disappointment. The AI is absolutely atrocious and one shots you instantly before you can even tell they are a threat just like early access, and the performance is laughable.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Edit 2 - I think the randoms in this game are worse than destiny 2 :(

I'm going to give you an honest review, as someone who's not basing my entire one over launch day server issues which happens, might I add, on basically every game/mmorpg. 

The questing can get bland, but it's easy to progress through the main story and once you finish they let you skip it and reward you with a free character boost for your first time clearing the vern story. 
Combat is incredible, and pvp is fantastic. What the US version has to offer isn't the full aspect of the game either, as several classes are held back for revamping, reworking, and re-release. 
The end game content can be grindy, but with how easy it is to gear characters you can focus on tiering one character up at a time, using multiple characters to farm the dungeons for materials and working through them, then using the next tier character to tier up the rest. Easy progression. 
This game has had huge success in multiple countries, these reviews are bombed over a server release issue on a game that hit the second highest peak players in STEAM HISTORY. Of course without being able to simulate such a heavy load, it's going to some trial and error to get things fully right.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",2 randoms worse destiny 2 honest someone not_basing launch computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player issue happens add basically massively multiplayer online role questing bland easy progress finish skip reward boost clearing vern combat incredible versus fantastic version offer t_emphasizedhe aspect class held revamping reworking re_emphasizedlease grindy easy gear character focus tiering multiple character farm dungeon material working next tier tier rest easy progression huge success multiple country review bombed a_emphasized computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player release issue highest peak player history course able simulate heavy load trial error thing

1623730,Palworld,"Grab this game! Let me put it this way, if Nintendo knew what they were doing and listened to people other than themselves, they'd be releasing the 5th version of this game by now, and they still wouldn't come close to something so full featured.

This is a survival craft, automation, monster hunting, creature taming, 3rd person shooter, RPG. It can be played single player, which is a very relaxing to fairly challenging and tense experience depending on how you set up your world. It can also be played in teams of up to 4 on a server of up to 32, though these numbers will be bumper in the future.
With the amount of content this game has right now, January 21st, in an early access release, I can comfortably say most triple a studios should be at the top of your ""ignore and only purchase on sale"" list.

Plus some day this game will allow the steam workshop. You cannot imagine how amazing that will be until you've sunk a dozen or so hours into even it's current state.

Just go buy it. You absolutely won't regret it.


A few cons: at this moment you can't rebind controls. Pal AI has some problems, though I'm certain it'll get better, and building designs are pretty limited, though they're not likely to be that way for long.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"Has more bugs than a high school programming classroom.
There *was* a 90 page list of bugs people submitted in the forum, but the dev never fixes bugs. His solution was to delete the list.
He wants to be popular, and he thinks that the only way to get attention is by adding new stuff. The problem is that he never tests anything new for more than a couple minutes. Seriously, he posts his timeline on discord. So the bugs grow and grow and grow.
There's entire skills that you can put points into that do nothing. They have spreadsheets over on discord to keep track of what doesn't work. The bug reporting channel *never* stops growing. It's annoying because you can spend weeks putting points into something, thinking you were improving some stat or another, only to discover that it did nothing at all. Just doesn't work. Doesn't do what the thing says. Just off the top of my head, I can think of four entirely different systems that did this to me. Someone on Discord mentions, ""Oh, that doesn't do anything"" and you realize how much time you've wasted because he just never fixes bugs.
On android, he has a bug where large numbers aren't supported. So if a large amount of money drops, it just vanishes. Items in large stacks? Vanish. And he has no idea how to deal with it other than tell people to stop playing on the platform. I never did play much on Steam, but I have thousands of hours on Android. His defenders will go on and on about how it's just not possible to fix on Android because it's a platform limitation. That's nonsense. Computers have been dealing with higher numbers than 2 billion for a long, long time. There's tons of workarounds and tricks that computer scientists have developed over the years. You know what hasn't developed over the years? The dev's sense of professionalism or honesty.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"This is [h1]Early Access Review[/h1] so keep in mind that by the time you read this a lot might have changed.

Hell Let Loose tries mix realistic mil sim shooter with more arcady FPS games like Battlefield. And in my honest opinion it has succeed in carving it's own little place in very oversaturated market of FPS games.

And that is a brave thing to attempt. Purists who will come from titles like Arma will point out it's more ... 'noob' friendly aspects while people who are used to playing Call of Duty or other more mainstream titles will feel overwhelmed by sheer amount of systems at work and completely different set of requirements to succeed in Hell Let Loose.

Now i guess i should point my finger and explain what aspects of the game are more Arma like and which feels more oriented towards mainstream audiences. Firstly and mainly combat does feel more arcadish than in something like Arma or Project Reality and i feel that it is a right choice. While general strategy and squad dynamics does play huge role in any firefight in HLL ( I will use HLL instead of Hell Let Loose from now on ) there's still a factor of personal skills involved , more so than in my previously mentioned titles .  FIrefights are short and deadly since time to kill is literally 1 bullet and you are gone and in certain situations personal skills can carry you quite far .. but not all the way to the victory and that's there Military Simulation part comes .

Despites it's a bit more mainstreamish shooting and movement mechanics HLL is still a highly strategic game and well coordinated and led team with always win against random people running around and shooting ( as individually good as they are ) . Strategy and teamwork wins games in HLL and a good and decisive Commander ( Person who leads and directs whole team ) can win even with objectively less skilled players, as long as they are listening to the commander and whole team follows one plan.

Now , as someone who have played countless hours of Project Reality back in a day ( Project Reality for those who are not familiar was/is very realistic mode for Battlefield 2 ) i really do appreciate mix of things HLL puts on the table. Time for games is limited at my current age sadly but HLL manages to scratch that itch of Arma/Project Reality/other mil sims while at the same time not requiring as much time as those games did. I could afford to sit in a ditch with an MG back then for 30 minutes and not fire a single shot as a defensive squad members , nowadays i still want to experience some gameplay and 30 minutes is all time i have in a day to play sometimes and that's there more mainstream aspects of HLL comes in . I still can experience some action and have fun even if i dont find perfectly coordinated squad.

There's of course whole Early Access thing. For me personally this game is worth it's asking price as it stands now  BUT i cant deny that there's a lot , and i mean A LOT of work to still be done here.  There are plenty of bugs, obvious missing features. Game is really poorly optimized and struggles to run even on most beastly systems. Amount of content is on a light side and there's a lot of other minor issues.

That said Devs are working on this game hard . It's a small indie team and it obviously takes them a lot of time to do anything but from what i've seen so far i have my confidence in them. It might... well it most definitely WILL take them long time to polish this game but i feel that it's only going to  get better by the time. 

If this game feels like your cup of tea i strongly urge you to give it a go. Yes , at the moment it's rough around the edges but it's a solid experience nevertheless and it's only bound to get better.","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",player purchase play official release mind read changed try mix realistic mil sim shooter arcady shooter game battlefield honest succeed carving oversaturated market shooter game brave attempt purist title arma inexperienced unskilled friendly aspect call duty mainstream title overwhelmed sheer system completely different set requirement succeed guess finger explain aspect arma feel oriented towards mainstream audience firstly mainly combat arcadish arma project reality choice general strategy squad dynamic play huge role firefight hll hll s_emphasizedtill factor personal skill involved previously mentioned title firefights short deadly kill literally 1 bullet certain situation personal skill carry far not_all victory military come despite bit mainstreamish shooting movement mechanic hll highly strategic coordinated led win random running shooting individually good strategy teamwork win game hll good decisive commander lead directs win objectively skilled player long listening commander follows plan someone countless hour project reality project reality not_familiar realistic mode battlefield 2 appreciate mix thing hll put table game limited age sadly hll manages scratch itch arma project reality mil sims not_requiring game afford sit ditch mg 30 minute not_fire single shot defensive squad member nowadays 30 minute play mainstream aspect hll come action fun dont perfectly coordinated squad course player purchase play official release personally worth asking price stand cant deny plenty bug obvious missing feature poorly optimized struggle beastly system light side minor issue working hard small indie obviously take far confidence definitely long polish feel cup tea strongly urge yes moment rough edge solid bound

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Disclaimer: This is a review aimed at players who think they can find some casual fun in this game.

No, I cannot recommend this game if you, like me are a casual player. I get that it is called Sea of Thieves and is a game that heavily pushes PvP. That in itself is not an issue and is a feature of the game - The problem arises, now that most of the casual and friendly player base that used to be in the game has left for greener pastures.

I originally played this game when it came out, when it was new and fresh, and everyone was still learning. There were of course people yearning for PvP, it is nothing new, they have always been there. Now, however, they are the only ones left truly playing this game. In practice, this means that now, every time you log in and attempt to get a bit of progress in, running into another ship is an instant death sentence, unless you are incredibly good at the game already.

This game does not and will not respect your time. The only way you can enjoy this game, is if you are okay with hours of hard work disappearing in the blink of an eye, because that will happen to you, especially if you are new to the game and still learning.

I came back because I heard they had finally caved and made a safer seas mode, only to learn that this mode was completely and utterly useless for me. I don't mind that you only get 30% rewards in safer seas, it makes sense that you get much less reward when there is little to no risk - However, gating reputation levels past level 40 and making you unable to use the ships you have purchased in this game mode is what kills it completely for me.

I would have been fine just spending a few hours of my time here and there, slowly chipping away at the reputations with the reduced rewards while sailing on my own ship - But no, I am not allowed to do that, because in order to enjoy this game casually, you are forced to deal with the worst this game has to offer as well.

TL:DR: This game is not for people like me, who likes to play the game for a casual adventure with friends. This is a game for hardcore players, ready and willing to dedicate hours of their lives to become true pirate legends and reap the rewards of dunking on much less experienced players.

Edit: Hey folks. I've read through your comments and I have a few notes. Yes, I did go back and play a little more after this, pretty much only to do some tall-tales with my friends to at least get a little out of my purchase.

I get it, some of you really like this game for what it is, and that's fine. This game is not for me and it's my right not to play it. I wrote this merely to warn other people that this game might not be for them.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",disclaimer aimed player casual fun no_i cannot_recommend casual called heavily push versus not_an issue problem arises casual friendly base left greener pasture originally fresh learning course yearning versus one left truly practice mean log attempt bit progress running ship instant death sentence unless incredibly good already not_and not_respect enjoy okay hour hard disappearing blink eye happen especially learning heard finally caved safer sea mode learn mode completely utterly useless mind 30 reward safer sea make sense reward no_risk gating reputation level past 40 unable ship purchased mode kill completely fine spending hour slowly chipping reputation reduced reward sailing ship no_i not_allowed order enjoy casually forced deal worst offer tl dr not_for like play casual adventure friend hardcore player ready willing dedicate hour life pirate legend reap reward dunking experienced player hey folk read comment note yes play pretty tall tale friend purchase fine not_for not_to play wrote merely warn not_be

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"[h1][Description][/h1]
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.
 
[h1][Pros][/h1]
+ Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets.
+ No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release.
+ Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far
+ Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior.
+ Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher.
+ A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency.
+ You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players.
+ Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits.
+ Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together.
+ Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones.
+ Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.

[h1][Cons][/h1]
- Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future)
- Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity.
- Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode.
- Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.
 
[h1][Conclusion][/h1]
While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.

899770,Last Epoch,"Good gameplay tropes, but very doubtful that this game will be going much further than its current state, that's a shame.

I think the devs bit off more than they could chew with Last Epoch. The latest decision to add overpriced MTXs (in the current heavily unfinished state of the game), coupled with an extremely long EA period and half baked features, starts to feel like they want to grab what they can before dropping the baby.

Happy to be proven wrong, but as an additional remark, going for FOMO + internal currency as a business strategy is really of poor taste.

Get Last Epoch if you want a fun experience for about 50-100 hours, but this will not be the ARPG you sink hundreds of hours in, you'll get bored before. I might change my review at the 1.0, but right now the EA ends up in disappointment.

Next day edit: 

Just a day after announcing the controversial business model, they allegedly revised the model to be more in line with player expectations. Problem: you don't take this kind of decision in a day, and they already had displays ready with updated prices (while also teasing the upcoming update), meaning they knew in advance what they were doing. That's called anchoring, and they just lost a couple more respect points from me.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn't recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level.
I hope this review is helpful.

STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor is the continuation of the Cal Kestis's epic journey that began in Jedi: Fallen Order. It features new and returning characters, new planets, new mechanics and a gripping adventure that will have you at the edge of your seat until the very end! However, this game does have its issues, with this game being riddled with performance issues, freezing and crashes.
The story of Star War Jedi: Survivor is one of its strongest points. You continue to play as Cal Kestis, who survived Order 66 and is now on the run from the Empire. You will travel to different planets, meet new allies and enemies, and uncover secrets about the Force and the distant past. The story is very well-written, engaging, and full of twists and turns. You will feel like you are part of the Star War universe and experience the struggle of the Jedi against the Empire and the dark side.
The gameplay mechanics are also much improved from Jedi: Fallen Order. You have more freedom to explore the environments, use different Force powers, and fully customize your lightsaber. The combat system is challenging and rewarding, requiring you to use strategy and timing to defeat your foes. You can also choose your difficulty level, from story to grand master, depending on your preference and skill.
The movement are fluid and responsive. You can run, jump, climb, slide, and swing across the terrain with ease. You can also use your Force abilities to interact with objects and enemies in creative ways. The game makes you feel like a powerful Jedi who can overcome any obstacle.
However, it is not without flaws. The game has a lot of technical issues that can affect its performance. You may encounter bugs, glitches, freezing, crashes, or long loading times during your playthrough. These issues can be frustrating and immersion-breaking, especially when they happen during crucial moments or boss fights. The game also requires a lot of disk space and a high-end PC to run smoothly.
Overall, Star War Jedi: Survivor is a great game for fans of Star War and action-adventure games. It has an epic story, improved gameplay mechanics, and fluid movement controls that make you feel like a real Jedi. However, it also has some performance issues that can hamper your enjoyment of the game. If you can overlook these flaws, you will have a blast playing this game.
STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor gets an 8/10.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"This game run like Dog shit and crashes out the fucking ass... I have contacted Steam support a few times just to be slapped with automated messages rather then a real fucking human who I know is working at a fucking desk getting paid for the position of ""Customer Service Representative"" yet put Zero effort into talk person to person to fucking help me fix my issue or give me a fucking refund of the damn game that run like shit and crashes.

All I am asking for is a steam wallet refund so I can get rid of Dog shit Madden and spend the same amount of money on good functioning games.

Update: After 3 failed refund request went to paypal to get my money as the game didn't work for me so why do I need to own a broken game? After paypal processed my refund request.

Steam promptly restricted my account from buying anything else claiming I have had ""Excessive chargebacks"" when Madden NFL 24 is the only game I have refunded in months the last game I refunded was back in January of 2023 so I have zero clue as to how I could have excessive chargebacks when so far this year I have two refunded games both which where asked to be refund via steam wallet with zero success.","Mixed43% of the 5,008 user reviews for this game are positive.",dog shit crash fucking as contacted support time slapped automated message rather real fucking human working fucking desk paid position customer service representative zero effort talk fucking help fix issue fucking refund damn shit crash asking wallet refund rid dog shit spend good functioning game 3 failed refund request paypal broken paypal processed refund request promptly restricted buying else claiming excessive chargebacks refunded month last refunded january 2023 zero clue excessive chargebacks far refunded game asked refund via wallet zero success
1144200,Ready or Not,"Review 2.0

The game is fun and frustrating.

Now that the game is released, they messed up the AI and now they are all John Wick and will kill you through walls with a Makarov. It's crazy to have some Joe Schmoe in street clothes be a tactical genius who can track you through walls. AI has such insane reaction time and accuracy making peeking nigh impossible and sometimes they will shake off stuns (Flashbangs, etc) instantly or not be effected at all. 

The maps are beautiful and polished, but they are so cluttered and often times AI will see and shoot you through obstacles you won't be able to, which exacerbates the AI issues. Furthermore, the piss poor grenade physics makes these obstacles a pain in the ass to make sure your grenade goes where you want it. 

Don't touch the mods if you plan on playing with other people, even touching the screen will prevent you from connecting to other people unless you get the exact same mods. If you do, make sure to delete all the mods/mod folder. 

The game is so close to being a YES to recommend.","Very Positive88% of the 127,116 user reviews for this game are positive.",2 0 fun frustrating released messed ai john wick kill wall makarov crazy joe schmoe street clothes tactical genius track wall ai insane reaction accuracy peeking nigh impossible shake stuns flashbangs instantly not_be effected map beautiful polished cluttered time ai shoot obstacle able exacerbates ai issue piss poor grenade physic make obstacle pain as grenade go t_emphasizedouch mod plan touching screen prevent connecting unless exact mod delete mod modification alteration player fan folder close yes recommend

230410,Warframe,"So like... Long overdue re-review?

3008 hours ingame, 1637 hours spent in missions, and reached MR30 (which is this thing which might prevent you from getting those cool guns you've seen other people use but also is pretty much just for showing off that you've played a lot of the game and used just about every weapon or item in the game).

Let's overgeneralize a bit-

Game has big guns that go pew pew or brrap brrap or psssssssssssshhhh that kill enemies to varying degrees. Also has tons of playable characters (Warframes) that have special magic powers like going invisible or... throwing stars which you can already equip normally. (I like Zephyr. Zephyr birb.) Tons of collectible guns and such with not-so-much space to store them, but it's a pretty nice shooty shooty bang bang game for people who enjoy things like Destiny 2, Borderlands uniques, or the mindless grind of Minecraft. But there's similar things in other reviews and you can prob just Google the game itself to learn more about the amazing timesink that is Warframe.

So, 3000 hours of having Warfarm launched, and I still haven't spent a penny (it's about the statement now). Money in this game can be a tradeoff for time played- there's this currency called Platinum that can be used in everything but also costs real money.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Team17's inherent ineptitude and complete lack of a stakeholder engagement strategy is on full display following U14. As a community owner and server provider, I am extremely disappointed with the level of communication we've had through official channels both prior to game updates/patches, and afterwards when we've encountered issues. 

Communities such as mine form the backbone of the broader Hell Let Loose community. We host 6 servers across three regions ($780 AUD/month), attract and retain new players, promote the game to our broader audience, and contribute to the game's social fabric. To say I am disappointed that I cannot elicit answers from Team17 on the most basic hosting questions is an understatement. 

The lack of a PTE (or anything outside of developer QA) prior to the latest updates is nonsensical, and it really shows in U14. Other reviews have articulated the myriad of bugs better than I can, but needless to say, the amount and severity of the bugs is unacceptable for an established $70 game made by a large studio. The QA processes need an overhaul, and desperately needs broader community involvement. 

Invest in your key stakeholders as we have invested in your game.

899770,Last Epoch,"As a veteran of Diablo 1 & 2 and being rather disappointed with Diablo 3 (RoS, so so). I looked for some good alternatives. yes, Grim Dawn caught my attention for about 80 hrs and Path of Exile i found too complex.
Anyhow I thought I gave Last Epoch a try. Here are my quick thoughts:

PROS

- Unique Crafting system! Love the affixes!
- Great loot, not too complex.
- Same for skills and passives!
- Quite a good end-game system with the Echoes and Dungeons.
- Love the boss fights!

CONS:

- For me, game has no soul. Not an engaging lore and story. Very basic, yes I know it is hack and slash, but I do not know a single NPC nor boss name. No cinematics, etc.
- glitches and bugs, but this is still early access.

OTHER:

- I played the acolyte class so far. Great fun. Willing to try out others.
- Very subjective: as addictive as the game is, speaking as a 40 year old male, after a few days, my eyes hurt from all of the flickering. Might want to take notice of that.
- Overall the game is not to complex from the start, but gets a bit complicated later yet holds your hand in just the right amount.

THIS is the direction I am looking for in hack&slash. Will keep playing and WILL come back to it once a full release has happened.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

Honestly feels like they were scared of writing a good story or it might butthurt their mobile players.

It's an amazingly fun game to play that suffers in the story side because it's following in a mobile games footsteps without trying to be as good as its predecessor.

So in early December 2016 I was grinding hard in GTAOnline during a slow week. I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-specific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month.

At first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final. 

I have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up. 

At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed. 

Let me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it.
 
[b]Overall:[/b]
So: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[b] I have always loved games from Bethesda, but not all is sunshine and sparkles . [/b]

There is a lot to say about [i] The Elder Scrolls Online [/i], but I will try to keep it short: When I was a new player, the gameplay felt pretty straightforward and both quests and main quests was (and still is) both exciting and somewhat accessible, or so I thought until I started using addons with Minion which made it even better. After a while, maybe creating a home for your characters sounds cool as you have collected random lamps and plants which may drop from fiends and harvesting mushrooms, which is a whole other part of the game to be explored (and we all grind for crafting plans because of it, hehe].

There's a jungle of guilds out there and I had to do some hit and miss before I found the one right for me ([b] PS: those who claim to have a non-toxic community in the zone chat are the worst ones [/b]). I've made a lot of new friends and joined the discord community as well where we can ask for gear tips, plan dungeon runs and discuss irl politics. If you're one of those social types, you'll quickly find people like you who shares the same interest, whatever that might be. If you're not, some of the content in this game will be challenging, but do not fret: you can ask for people to group up temporary in the zone chat and join a queue for dungeon run (the queue system has been broken for quite some time as I write this review which kind of mirrors how players are [spoiler] disregarded by the developers, [/spoiler] but enough about that).

As all platforms with an online communication function, you'll also meet a lot of [u]weirdoes[/u], [u]trolls[/u] and people who have an [b]unhealthy[/b] interest in Argonian biology, but occationally you'll see players giving great stuff away for free to anyone who replies in the zone chat and we all love generous people, [b]a small shoutout to those who tries to make a community great for new and veteran players alike.[/b]

While that's being all well and good, there can be plenty of bumps in the road, some of which Bethesda is well known for: Bugs (computer generated non-insects), silent players being randomply kicked out for ""spamming"" (also a bug), a weak effort to make the game accessible for people with low vision (bot unable to handle languages and reads the chat out loud in anarchy mode + weird playstation-like interface), constant server crashes, lazy daily rewards (you get stuff a calendar for logging in), high effort gives lame awards (spoiler [spoiler] for example a memento which is money raining on your head when you have finished collecting a list of stolen items for Thieves Guild [/spoiler]) and an unforgiving drop rate for a long list of items (I hope I one day get my hands on [i]Shivering Cheese[/i]).

All in all, as expected, this game is far from perfect, but both in solitary and with friends you can have hours of fun and to this day I'm not even finished with the main quest 'cause I do random stuff with my guildies or get distracted by the chats.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Until the last update, I would have highly recommended this game, but sadly I would advise everyone to steer away from this game and any other future Take-Two/Rockstar game. I think theifs is the best way to describe these companies. I can confirm to those of you reading these reviews saying ""surely they wouldn't be removing in game funds that people pay $80/£60+ for?"" that it is really happening. I will split this review into two parts; Single Player and Multiplayer.

[u] Singleplayer	[/u]
The story and how it plays out for single player is possibly the best out there. The story is fantasic, and there are very few missions that aren't fun to play. Also, the implementation of an in-game stock market (although not the best thing ever) is really cool to me. Pairing this with missions that allow you to manipulate this stock market, you can earn millions, even billions. But this leads to the issue of there being nothing to spend it on. Singleplayer mode for some reason does not get content from Rockstar's updates. The only way you can access them is by grinding multiplayer for days to afford the likes of one car, however we will get to that. 
Overall, Singleplayer is absolutely fantastic, except from the fact that after the story there is little to do unless you are interested in mods, in which case you will probably love this game for that.

[u] Multiplayer	[/u]

Oh yay, this train wreck. Okay, so I have 1,151 hours on Steam for GTA V, with around 1,000 being for multiplayer. I converted my stats from PS3 so likely have around double that. I know what I am talking about with this game. The multiplayer in this game is absolutely trash now. I was always able to look past the grind in this game, but it has gotten to the point now where money is so hard to make, and things are so expensive that it is no longer fun. At all. Rockstar and Take-Two have become money whores, so much so that they are taking purchased in-funds away for NO REASON and will accuse you of hacking the game. If you refuse to purchase the in-game currency (like me), then you will have to grind. Now, at least in my ways, around 1 hour of in game grinding will bring in, at most, around $300,000, and that's if youre grinding really hard, non stop, and have the most lucrative in game businesses in the game. When starting out, you will be lucky to bring in $100,000 per hour, so as you can see, it's a pretty tough grind anyway. The last update called ""Smuggler's Run"" brought some of the most expensive content in GTA Online to date, with things costing $1,500,000 upwards. I had 2.6 million removed from an in-game challenge called Criminal Mastermind that took me months to complete, getting $10,000,000 from. This was removed because it was ""modded or cheated money"". So, 6 tickets to Rockstar later, I have quite rudely been told by a robot to go fuck myself and that I'm not getting it back, and that's why I've finally decided that enough is enough with this game.
Something that I have always found interesting in GTA Online is that you can buy a yacht - a real calling card, with the most expensive one sitting at $10,000,000. The highest in-game currency you can purchase is $8,000,000, sitting at $100 real money. That to me has always seemed ridiculous for what is already a fairly expensive game.
Also, if you want to mod singleplayer, thats fine in their eyes (not really since they shut down OpenIV, a company they supported but hey let's let bygones be bygones), but if you DARE go near their money making method and try to make things fun, you will be banned and stripped of everything you have online.

[u] Overall	[/u]
This review could go on forever, about a game/company that steals from their fans and shuts down companies who they once directed their fans to, but I think it's time to sum it up. For what was for a very long time my favourite game ever, I would highly recommend that you never go near this game, even if you recieve it for free. I will never touch another Rockstar or Take-Two game, and hope that their next game flops and they learn no treat their fans better, however, if you're not giving them money, they hope you fuck yourself.

Update: Went on today to see if I had been refunded yet, and guess what!! I haven't.

Update 2: Left another ticket  to Rockstar asking HOW my money was illegitamate, stating several times that I know that it, according to them, is illegitimate but after my ticket making it to support stage 3 (presumably the highest? Has been in all support companies I know.), guess what happened? I got the same copied and pasted god damn response AGAIN.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"The game offers an enjoyable experience, with each character boasting a distinct play style. While I appreciate the brevity, the prolonged development time by the developers raises expectations for additional characters and unique boss battles (avoiding repetitive and recolored bosses).

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Although I was skeptical to begin with about playing this and how different it would be to Odyssey, I admit after a reasonable amount of play time I've come to appreciate certain things about the game. These for me personally are:

The Stunning Visuals - They are very intone with the viking theme and feel of the game and are just generally amazing. In some ways they even sort of Out do Odyssey, partly because they look a bit more polished, and partly because they have a more 'natural' feel to them.

Viking Culture - this aspect in my opinion is done more or less flawlessly,  from the look of the characters down to the very small, but entertaining dialogue moments while sailing to raid locations. It very much feels like you're playing an episode of Vikings, and I think that definitely says something. I also love how you can use the some of the resources you raid to build up your own settlement, which adds to the authentic viking experience.

The Combat - Although not as varied and stylized as Odyssey, it still manages to be fun and engaging thanks to it's gritty realism (I swear every time I see a head go flying I have moment of sheer adulterated bliss).

The Length - I can tell this as i have already finished this game before when it came out in 2020 that this game is a much larger game compaired to odyssey, and for someone who juggles demanding full-time work with a two year old, that is indeed a Godsend. 170+ hours is waaay to long to spend on one game that doesn't hold up the balance with story and characters (Odyssey)

All in all,  if you've been curious about giving this a try, I say go for it!

P.S. If you do decide to go for the extra stuff (which you will, trust me), go for the mysteries, as there is a great variety of things to do and most of them are reasonably short and sweet

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"FOR ALL THE DEVS THAT HAVE MICRO-TRANSACTIONS ETC;

You know your doing something right when other developers like EA/Ubisoft/Blizzard, etc, come out saying, ""Baldur's Gate 3 should not be the new standard"". 
To put it simply, they are just mad because Larian Studios will not have a battle-pass, micro-transactions and expensive DLC's.
Which after all, is all us gamer's want. Just a polished game with unlimited hours of fun. Well done Larian Studios! You can tell you actually care about games, and have bought back what it felt like 15 years ago for me.

EDIT:
reading through the comments and you can see the majority rules. when i speak of DLC's i'm referring to things that should already of been included in the base game for example, Total War Warhammer (great game btw) should, in my opinion, already include the chaos race in the base game. i shouldn't have to pay an extra $30 for this particular race, (once again just my opinion). now id happily pay for an ""expensive"" DLC/add-on whatever you want to call it for BG3, especially if its the same quality as Blood and Wine.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I tried this back when it first came out and left pretty underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, but it was fiddly to the point of irritating, the mechanics were unclear, and the combat seemed dull. I was also playing other games at the time and I wound up drifting away from it after hitting level 12 or so.

Now, I'm a huuuuuuge Morrowind dork. When the expansion came out, I decided to take the plunge on it if for no other reason than to revisit a game I spent easily a thousand hours on, just to see how it holds up.

First point to its credit: It does a truly a solid job of recreating the OG Morrowind experience. The map is nearly 1:1 as far as I can tell, though large portions of the middle mountain are inaccessible so the actual playable area is likely much smaller. It doesn't feel that way though; I'm easily 30+ hours in on my second attempt and I've yet to really do anything off the island of Vvardenfell except for some minor sight-seeing. I've not even touched the base game Main Quest, in true Elder Scrolls fashion, and the game totally allows for this. 

More impressively however is that the game fully modernizes Morrowind. Every voice line has full (and well acted!) VO, complete with the actors making admirable attempts to pronounce all of Morrowind's insane dungeon names and Ashlander terms. Everything is much more lush and animated without losing any of the inherent weirdness of Morrowind. Telvanni mushroom towers are now inhabited by active NPCs who adhere to a day/night cycle and will work their jobs. Pages and assistants to the Telvanni mages fritter about talking among themselves. There's a ton of little details that have far more activity going on than the original game was ever able to allow, and it all just works. While it's set 700 years prior to Morrowind 1, there's still plenty of returning NPCs from Morrowind like Vivec and a much younger Divayth Fyr (that Telvanni Mage with the godlike Tower that players would always kill him and inhabit, and which had a dungeon below it (which is now a full-on raid, amusingly enough)). 

Also impressively, the single player things you'd expect to be removed from an MMO, aren't. You can still pickpocket any NPC you like. Stealth works exactly the same as it does in Skyrim. Shoplifting items is a thing, as is selling stolen items to fences for cash. Bounties are enforced by guards, and just like Morrowind you can either pay them off on the spot or run (jail has been omitted but eh, whatever). 

But the thing that's kept me playing is that this game is almost the Anti-WoW. Everything is vastly more complicated, seemingly as an intentional design choice, but unlike the launch version of the game it's now much more *crunchy* instead of needlessly fiddly. You can simply hammer out a few swords in the Blacksmithing profession and call it a day, OR you can dig deep into the system and craft some seriously powerful custom kit if you feel like it. Doing so, however, requires you to drop skill points into the system that could be spent on combat skills instead. Just like the Elder Scrolls games have always done, there's a significant choice to be made about character progression and they'll get better at the things they do more often than not. The complexity is initially pretty staggering but after a while you begin to be able to See The Matrix and the system winds up making perfect sense. 

The approach to character level in general is a curious one as well in that there really isn't one. Everything in the game remains at the same base level, and gaining a level is reflected more in your skill points than any kind of base power creep. A wandering Alit becomes only marginally easier to kill at level 30 than it was at level 1, but the difference is that if you've acquired more skills, you simply have more kit at your disposal; you have to actually USE it, however. The numbers don't automatically get any higher.

This translates to gear being less effective as you outlevel it, making new gear necessary not so much to jack up your power level but to prevent it from falling off. It's...Counterintuitive, but it actually makes a lot of sense and serves the excellent purpose of never gating you off from content because you're not a sufficient level for it. You're ALWAYS a sufficient level for it, and it's always floating at a difficulty point that will provide a challenge. It takes some getting used to and was jarring at first, but now I find myself preferring it to the Dragonball-Style power creep in other RPGs. Smart stuff, if a bit unconventional.

Lastly, and impressively: This game is monstrously huge. There is an INSANE amount of stuff to do. It puts every other Elder Scrolls game, and honestly any other RPG I can even think of, to absolute shame in terms of sheer Crap To Do™. When you factor in that all of this is fully voiced and animated, the amount of content on display here is jaw-dropping. Wanna explore Elsweyr, the Khajit homeland? How about the Dragontail mountains, not seen since the original Daggerfall? The Gold Coast? Hammerfell? Daggerfall itself? It's all in here and it's super detailed and explorable. 

~~And it's free.~~ EDIT: I'm an idiot, no it isn't, leaving this up because it's the only way I'll learn

Seriously. You can opt to pay $15 a month for the ""Crown Plus"" subscription. This is worth it if you plan on delving into the crafting aspect because you get a bottomless crafting item bag (which, believe me, you're GOING to want if you do any crafting), but if you simply want to ignore that aspect in favor of playing through the plot and going on exploration adventures, you can absolutely just play the free base game and be none the worse for wear. If anything, the $15 sub should be considered a Crafting subscription as opposed to anything gating off the proper game. It's incredibly useful for that feature, but really ONLY that feature, and you don't need to do it in order to play the content at all. Scaled item drops will always keep you sufficiently geared and you'll easily have a couple hundred hours worth of content to explore freely without limitation even if you never drop a single cent into the game itself. 

So in short, yeah. This is absolutely worth checking out in 2018, and I strongly recommend anyone with a fondness for Morrowind to drop the cash on the Expansion that allows you to play through it and check it out. 100% worth it even if that's all you ever do in the game.

If you do opt to check it out, hit me up in-game. I'm on the EU Megaserver (I have no idea why, it's where it put me for some reason) and can be found @DJMalloc. Let's go explore the ash wastes and pick fights with Cliff Racers.

1144200,Ready or Not,"With this game's 1.0 release, I feel like it's time to voice my deep concerns regarding this game's development and future status. This will be a review that doesn't restate anything you can read in the game's Steam description, and will instead focus on my thoughts about the game after 220 hours of play according to Steam at time of writing.

[h2] Performance Issues and Bugs[/h2]

Consistently, ever since I first purchased this game, up to the present 1.0 release, I have experienced performance issues with the game, even at the lowest settings. This is not a feature of My Machine™ alone, but a common experience I've seen between my fellow players and I. 

 - Framerates will regularly tank when entering or viewing large areas with many assets.
 - Stuttering when turning the camera around the room.
 - A feature of this latest update are seconds-long freeze frames in the middle of combat, which predictably lead to the death of the player.

Ready or Not is victim to numerous bugs, many of which are centered around the game's poorly implemented physics engine. For instance, pieces of evidence dropped by suspects will often phase several feet into the floor, which is now well revealed by the accessibility feature to highlight dropped evidence(a good recent addition). No doubt some of the performance issues can be classified as game-breaking bugs, like the screen-freezes.

[h2] Suspect Design [/h2]

This being a police game, the suspects are *the* primary source of gameplay. Without suspects, there is no need for a SWAT team, no need to yell or shoot at anyone. Thus, it's fairly obvious that the suspects in this game need to be well balanced for an enjoyable experience. While VOID has put a lot of effort into the creation of the suspects in this game, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed.

 - Suspects are extremely accurate, and will often hit players with fatal gunfire within one or two seconds of entering their line of sight.
 - Suspects are extremely decisive, and will usually initiate a fight with the SWAT team, even if they have not been fired at first.
 - Suspects are extremely hardy, and will continue to fight even after receiving multiple gunshot wounds. Somehow, they appear to surrender more quickly after being struck with beanbags than with real bullets.

Notice the use of *'extremely'* in the previous three points, and I think it's a good summary to describe RoN's suspects as *extreme.* They do not represent what one could reasonably expect even from trained and committed foes. They will fight like soldiers. Ironically, I would petition VOID Interactive to take cues from the AI of a game focused entirely on enemy soldiers: F.E.A.R.

While the AI in F.E.A.R. are representing a different kind of foe than usually faced in RoN, somehow they appear to behave as better foes than RoN's suspects. When encountering the player, they will often take cover rather than immediately engage, they are *rarely* perfectly accurate, they will often be stunned for 5 or even 10 seconds when shot, they interact with their environments more, in an attempt to gain an advantage over the player.

I don't advise copying and pasting F.E.A.R.'s replica soldiers into RoN, but taking cues from their design would do a lot of good I feel. Replica soldiers on the extreme difficulty of the game can be said to almost be the player's equal in ability. The suspects in RoN do not feel like equals, but like robots who can occasionally be convinced to surrender. This is the core gameplay of a tactical police shooter, so a failure to design good suspects is a failure to design a good game.

[h2] Scenario Design [/h2]

Every scenario which the team enters has to be designed to fit the concept. For instance, a group of violent youths holding up a Gas Station for drug money is a scenario, so you shouldn't expect to face a professional army once you enter the premises. One would also hope that the scenarios depicted in a realistic police game are ones which maintain the player's immersion in the story, without introducing absurd elements like space elves. RoN fails on both of these grounds.

 - Scenarios will often have suspects whose abilities, behaviour and morale do not match what could be reasonably expected of the description. A gang of youths robbing a gas station for money should not behave like hardened terrorists willing to die for $200.
 - Scenarios will often feature an excessive number of suspects. The best example of this is the Streamer map, which features a veritable army of suspects for what should be warrant service against a *single* murderer. Apparently, it seems there's an entirely unrelated *gang* in this apartment building. Why couldn't VOID Interactive be satisfied with this being a level that has a single suspect, or maybe two?
- Because of these facts, and the game's habit of turning every scenario up to 11, and linking them together with shared features, the game damages the player's immersion. Maybe we're not literally fighting space elves, but sometimes it does feel like the Eldar have landed an army and disguised themselves as corporate security or disgrunted military veterans.

[h2] In the Shadow of SWAT 4[/h2]

For those who aren't in the know, SWAT 4 is a nearly 20 year old tactical shooter oriented around a SWAT team performing high risk warrant services and counter-terror operations in a fictional American city. Ready or Not has been lauded as a spiritual successor to SWAT 4. Having played and enjoyed SWAT 4, I have to notice that RoN has failed to inherit the best features of SWAT 4.

 - Consistent and Bug-Free Performance: While I don't have the benefit of knowing what SWAT 4 performed like at release, I can say for certain that it runs perfectly well on my machine today and I haven't encountered or noticed any game breaking bugs, stuttering or freezes. This should be considered a bare minimum for a video game which is no longer a ""beta"".
- Difficult but Fair Suspects: Suspects in SWAT 4 can often be deadly accurate like RoN's suspects, but rarely do they initiate a fight within the first few seconds of spotting the SWAT team. Often, they will retreat to cover, or hesitate, which is a realistic response to the arrival of a tactical team, even for some of the game's more deadly foes, like trained terrorists.
- Sane Scenario Design: SWAT 4's scenarios are often unusual, featuring warrant service against cults, gun smugglers, terrorists and even foreign intelligence agents. But they are fitting for a *special* team, as well as the game's realistic setting. As well, the actual depiction of these scenarios is fitting to their concept. There is a high risk warrant service against a serial killer, and very rarely does the game give him an accomplice, making for *two* suspects. Suspects' abilities and behaviour will fit the situation and their background. You can expect a frightened drug addict to be inaccurate and easier to subdue than a hardened terrorist.

[h2] What's Good? [/h2] 

For all I have said about the game's flaws, I want to note what the game has done right. RoN is a passion project with the efforts of a committed dev team, and it does show.
 - When the game is not losing frames and stuttering, it can look very good! Even if I would rather trade the picture for a consistent framerate, it is genuinely nice to look at.
 - Teammate AI. This has faced a massive overhaul in the recent update, and for the better. The SWAT teammates are incredibly helpful, approach situations with initiative, and rarely obstruct the player.
 - The game's shooting mechanics are on point, as long as you're not stuttering. The firearm mechanics are well simulated, impacts are well communicated and the different firing positions and optics have real use cases.","Very Positive88% of the 127,116 user reviews for this game are positive.",1 0 release voice deep concern regarding development future status restate read s_emphasizedteam description focus thought 220 hour play according writing h2 performance issue bug h2 consistently purchased present 1 0 release experienced performance issue lowest setting not_a machine alone common fellow player framerates regularly tank entering viewing large area asset stuttering turning camera room latest second long freeze frame middle combat predictably lead death not_is victim numerous bug centered poorly implemented physic engine instance piece evidence dropped suspect phase foot floor revealed accessibility highlight dropped evidence good recent addition no_doubt performance issue classified breaking bug screen freeze h2 suspect design h2 police suspect primary source suspect no_need swat no_need yell shoot fairly obvious suspect balanced enjoyable void effort creation suspect number issue addressed suspect extremely accurate player fatal gunfire second entering line sight suspect extremely decisive usually initiate fight swat not_been fired suspect extremely hardy continue fight receiving multiple gunshot wound somehow appear surrender quickly struck beanbag real bullet notice extremely three point good summary describe ron s_emphasizeduspects extreme not_represent reasonably expect trained committed foe fight soldier ironically petition void interactive cue ai focused entirely enemy soldier f e r ai f e r representing different kind foe usually faced ron somehow appear behave foe ron s_emphasizeduspects encountering cover rather immediately engage rarely perfectly accurate stunned 5 10 second shot interact environment attempt gain advantage advise copying pasting f e r replica soldier ron taking cue design good replica soldier extreme difficulty equal suspect ron not_feel equal robot occasionally convinced surrender core tactical police shooter failure design good suspect failure design good h2 scenario design h2 scenario enters designed fit concept instance group violent youth holding gas station drug scenario expect face professional army enter premise hope scenario depicted realistic police one maintain immersion introducing absurd element space elf ron fails ground scenario suspect ability behaviour morale not_match reasonably expected description gang youth robbing gas station not_behave hardened terrorist willing die 200 scenario excessive number suspect best example streamer feature veritable army suspect warrant service single murderer apparently entirely unrelated gang apartment building void interactive satisfied single suspect maybe fact habit turning scenario 11 linking shared feature damage immersion maybe not_literally fighting space elf eldar landed army disguised corporate security disgrunted military veteran h2 shadow swat 4 h2 swat 4 nearly 20 old tactical shooter oriented swat performing high risk warrant service counter terror operation fictional american not_has lauded spiritual successor swat 4 enjoyed swat 4 notice ron failed inherit best feature swat 4 consistent bug performance benefit knowing swat 4 performed release certain run perfectly machine today encountered noticed breaking bug stuttering freeze considered bare minimum video no_longer a_emphasized pre release version available testing difficult fair suspects_emphasized swat 4 deadly accurate ron s_emphasizeduspects rarely initiate fight second spotting swat retreat cover hesitate realistic response arrival tactical deadly foe trained terrorist sane scenario design swat 4 s_emphasizedcenarios unusual featuring warrant service cult gun smuggler terrorist foreign intelligence agent fitting special realistic setting actual depiction scenario fitting concept high risk warrant service serial killer rarely accomplice suspects_emphasized ability behaviour fit situation background expect frightened drug addict inaccurate easier subdue hardened terrorist h2 good h2 flaw note ron passion project effort committed not_losing frame stuttering good rather trade picture consistent framerate genuinely nice teammate ai faced massive overhaul recent swat teammate incredibly helpful approach situation initiative rarely obstruct s_emphasizedhooting mechanic long not_stuttering firearm mechanic simulated impact communicated different firing position optic real case

No, the game is not optimized, it is early access and optimization is never a priority at this stage. That being said, I average 70-80 FPS with a Ryzen 7 and 3060 Ti.

The building system is by far the best I've ever used. You have ""blueprints"" that you can place that just place voxels in a specific array but then you can customize the building to the extreme by manipulating each and every voxel. 

The combat is good. The moves are not only telegraphed well but there is a slight ""flash"" on the weapon that shows the perfect time to parry the enemy's attack.","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",fantastic 13 hour single crash no_the not_optimized player purchase play official release optimization never_a priority stage average 70 80 shooter ryzen 7 3060 ti building far best blueprint voxels specific array customize building extreme manipulating voxel combat good move not_only telegraphed slight flash weapon show perfect parry enemy attack

The combat is good, not great- it feels like it could use some animation updates but compared to other similar games- it's fine. !v1 can be pretty straight forward but when it comes to group combat, mobs can ruin your day.

The base building is voxel based and in my opinion is one of the stand out features. The art assets look great and contribute a cohesive fantasy world
It really lets you create some fantastic bases and homes for NPC's. 

That's right:  like Terraria you will get NPC's who offer services that expand the crafting system and offer you more options to fight and traverse,

The survival aspect is toned down, and it really keeps gameplay focused on buffs vs. babysitting your character.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"[h1]The Ultimate Pirate Sandbox[/h1]

I would recomend this one even to a non-AC fan. It is a great pirate game.

- This one tells a story about a pirate who only cares for himself. He steals, murders and does many other bad things. Then he meets a crossdressing woman who tells him that is not a way to live. She want's him to sacrifice his life for a ""a greater good"". He refuses at first but when all the people he cares for die he realizes that being selfish really isn't the way, so he stops being a priate and becomes an ninja terrorist, so that now he can steal and murder with an excuse. 

- Appart from the usual conspiracy cr*p, Black Flag is actually a good enough character driven game. Of course it has some weak moments but those are mostly caused by the illogical creeds and fanaticism of the conspiring factions and the antiestablishment nonsense (and really bad written death of a really good characters). No, Ubisoft, pirates did not fly black flag as a sign of freedom? There is however very little of it. For the most of the game you trully are a pirate. You meet templars and assassins but you don't care for them. You just rob them.

- The gameplay did not really change much from AC3 appart from the fact that sailing levels are now a major part of the game. A bit polished, improved with some new features and really fun. The parcour is the more stable and responsive and the world is filled with actually interesting things to do. Not just tons of collectibles. It is also the first AC since Brotherhood with actuall colour and pretty world. The story is nicely paced, not forcing any urgency on the player, so you can experience everything on the pace that most fits you.

Bonus:
- Why is it every time someone in the game says ""Jesus"" they spell it ""Jaysus"" in subtitles? For a ""multicultural team of various faiths and beliefs"" there should be no problem to use the name with clear conscience.","Very Positive88% of the 55,599 user reviews for this game are positive.",ultimate pirate sandbox recomend non ac fan great pirate tell pirate care steal murder bad thing meet crossdressing woman tell not_a live sacrifice life a_emphasized greater good refuse care die realizes selfish t_emphasizedhe stop priate ninja terrorist steal murder excuse appart usual conspiracy cr p flag good driven course weak moment mostly caused illogical creed fanaticism conspiring faction antiestablishment nonsense bad written death good character no_ubisoft pirate not_fly flag sign freedom trully pirate meet templar assassin care rob not_really ac3 appart sailing level major bit polished improved feature fun parcour stable responsive world filled interesting thing not_just ton collectible ac brotherhood actuall colour pretty world nicely paced not_forcing urgency pace fit bonus someone say jesus spell jaysus subtitle multicultural faith belief no_problem name clear conscience

730,Counter-Strike 2,"2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol

Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.

To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:

* It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on

* Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player

* Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google

* have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100

* No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it

* As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve

* If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves

* SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me

* Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable

Good luck!

Not too long ago I have started playing it again, noticing some flaws of the PS2 version.
But still, it was quite enjoyable and had a big nostalgic factor.

I have not expected P3R to be released, but when I saw it, I simply had to purchase it straight away.
This new iteration blows my mind. It works up the issues of the older PS2 version and really elevated the beauty of the main game.
I so love that they kept all these twisted nuances like the shot to the head to summon a temporary ally to fight for you.
And the models, the style, the UI, the music. Despite the big update of those elements, they all carry the actual soul and body of the original.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I know what you're thinking, ""Dude, you played the game for almost 2000 hours, how can you not recommend the game?!"" Well, that's the funny thing about this game. You don't really realize what you're getting into until you reach the true endgame. I'll try to be brief and precise about the important issues. 

First off, the game is fundamentally pretty damn fun. The combat is fun and the visuals range from pretty good to gorgeous. There are plenty of systems that are kind of annoying and there's certainly lots of rng and things to grind at in the game, sometimes frustratingly so. But where I really hit a wall and felt my will to continue completely fade away was the endgame upgrade system. This is where most people realize just how pay-to-win the game is.

I reached ilvl 1475 on my main with relative ease, all things considered. I was happy about that considering the extremely low success rates. But once you get into raiding and acquire some relic gear, this game becomes very punishing.. but not the good kind of punishing, the kind of punishing where you can almost hear the sound of laughter coming from somewhere. But, it isn't coming from your friends, or other players, no, it's coming from the devs. They're laughing at you. ""Look at this loser"" you hear them say, ""he failed his 60% chance to upgrade his relic quality, and when he got it the second time, it only went up by 2%. HAHAHAHA, what an idiot"".

Now I could clarify, but it would take forever. Just know that this is just one of many upgrade systems in the game, and it's very expensive and very depressing. Plus the game wants you to do this for several pieces of gear across all your characters. Having multiple alts is also encouraged to help aid your main with materials and gold. Unless you completely whale this game and spend thousands of real dollars each month, you will struggle without alts. This makes the game quite repetitive after a while too. 

The last thing I want to talk about is one of the many currencies in the game called Pheons. This straight up made me quit the game entirely. If they removed it, I might consider coming back. I remember saying to myself ""Instead of subjecting myself to this, how about I just don't, quit, and live a happier life?"" So I did.. at least for a while, i'll explain at the end. I don't think the devs realize how much this currency is destroying their player retention...

Basically, Pheons are a currency that you need to purchase most things and ALL important things on the player market/auction house. They are VERY expensive to purchase outright in the store, and the devs give out insultingly low amounts on rare occasions. You need a lot of them, You will always need them as the game gets updated. Dealing with this currency made me feel like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing just hard enough to keep me alive.

In conclusion, I didn't like how this game made me feel anymore. Pheons and just thinking about cutting an ability stone make me want to alt-f4. Overall, this game started to feel like I was dredging through an alleyway full of heroine addicts trying to sell me some smack and hang out with them. Fuck that. Admittedly, I still fire it up from time to time to enjoy some combat, but I could never take this game seriously the way it is.

Oh, and the game's bot problem is severe and will probably never be fixed.

*edit: Just wanted to add some more context to this. At review time, I hadn't played for 3-4 months. I played a little bit more recently to check in on things, try out the new classes, and check out new skins. The economy appears to be getting worse though. Gold and prices on the auction house have more than doubled, Pheon's are still in play, items are becoming more scarce, bots are still everywhere, and island instances are completely dead. I want to play this game, but It's not worth it. As new games and MMO's come out this year, I imagine more people will leave and move on.

1623730,Palworld,"[h1] Adorable, addicting & enjoyable game. Recommended from a Pokemon lover ! [/h1]

Palworld is a fantastic game. There is so much you can do in it and its really your choice in what you want to do in its vast open worlds between islands. You can take care of your pals and level them up to become better and live a peaceful life with them or you can go out and battle ""wild"" pals and take on criminals in ""boss battles"". In my aspect this is considered a next gen Pokemon game with a twist on including weapons such as guns, bats, bow & arrows etc. There's a ton of items currently in game that you can craft for yourself and your pal friends as well. You and your own pal friends that you befriend have to basically try to survive and I like that aspect. While it could be a little annoying at times because ill be out away from my base and workbench it does take sometime to gather materials and bring them back to base to craft things like weapons and things that are needed to store items. There is also a weight limit on your characters person, but you can level that up with experience points so I find to craft as much as possible if your going out far from your base.

As far as the pals themselves and their designs and such, I think they are great and adorable as well. I already have a few of my favorites and those that I am in search of trying to collect so I can do my first battle. They also do ""work"" for you as well on base, but I do take care of them. 

As an animal person myself, I do not view this game as animal abuse or other topics as a number of forums have been made over this. Its a video game, and this is just my own personal stance and opinion. I originally did not know about this game and it wasn't on my radar like most people until the day before its release and thought it was something like super animal royale and fortinute, but I was wrong after seeing and knowing what this game truly was going for. If you like Pokemon style games and a mixture of games like fortinute some Zelda, Minecraft and survival I would highly recommend Palworld.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.

Pros:
- Excellent Movement.
- Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good.
- Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion.
 - New legends and weapons added every season.
- Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh.
- Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass.
- Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season's battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted).
- Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc.
- You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.

Cons:
- Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !)
- Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! )
- Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18.
- In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming.
- Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is ""we are working on it"" etc.
- Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets.
- Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can't even get into a game.

- SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3  and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.

The main reason why I can't recommend this game to new players is because I don't see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don't have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.

At the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in.","Mostly Positive78% of the 794,366 user reviews for this game are positive.",easily best game ruined bad management greedy short sighted publisher pro excellent movement satisfying gun play huge variety gun type shotgun smgs pistol sniper ar good size excellent not_too big empty not_too small game quick no_down middle portion legend weapon season map changed updated season keeping thing fresh season 3 month long offering plenty complete battle pas completing battle pas give coin purchase following season battle pas wanted recently started offering reward mid season event lot pack levelling con easily worst server major mode multiple player interact compete real game 20 tick server pubg 60 valorant 128 tick server non existent anti cheat region unplayable cheater worse barely fix issue year literally manually reviewing clip banning cosmetic overpriced legendary skin gun legend cost 18 audio broken team land not_make sound audio queue sort busy fighting soon notice face not_hear communication terrible studio general hear working unnecessary drama involved community via twitter resulting argument nonsense not_needed including deliberately provoking antagonizing player amusement player via software fix bug balance add feature note tweet update cause issue hour unplayable sbmm skill based accurately eomm engagement optimised log play given easier lobby good plenty kill maybe win give good boost matched harder harder opponent constantly die matched mate lower skill higher skilled enemy top matched pre squad solo randoms early randoms not_be matched pre team eventually losing constantly destroyed player given easier lobby not_put completely designed no_sense fairness matchmaking not_matched skill based tweaked season 3 noticeable expect deny existence eomm including test check recommend player thing changing improving waiting patiently season realised good stringing along false promise slowly sneaking greedy tactic squeeze course optional spend invested not_going improving user cheater rampant server held spit chewing gum brings issue take week fix analogy legend amazing recipe lot fresh ingredient high quality meat lovely kitchen gutter water rusted broken pot prepare

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"Developer has zero respect for the community he has backing him.

(The majority of my playtime is on the mobile version of this game)

Let me start by saying this game is good. The pacing in the early game is fantastic and the sense of progression is paced very well with new weapons and armours to unlock as well as various upgrade systems to help your account progression. There is a lot to do and you will get to play all of the classes as you unlock more character slots (core to the game). Unlocking new worlds once again open up new doors for account progression and more interesting upgrade systems and crafting unlocks. As well as solo progression in the worlds, there are also party dungeons and mini bosses which have you cooperating with other players. Quests are pretty solid and character dialogue is interesting and self aware making for quest text you actually want to read instead if breezing through to get the task.

The main reason I cannot recommend this game though is that the main MMO aspect isn't really within the game and the bulk of the community is found within the discord. The developer posts regularly to keep players informed of what is on the cards in future updates and the current state of the game. A recent April Fools event which happened within the discord resulted in several long time members and players being banned simply for participating and branded as ""trolls"" for unbeknownst reasons. I myself was included in this ban wave and am still a little disoriented about the situation.

It sucks because I actually like this game and the developer and want them to succeed, yet banning long term members of your community and ousting them simply because they dared to even mention said event is awful. Now the community is on edge and threatened with bans if they even mention this incident but fan boys of this developer will defend him to their dying breath.

This game is good but is held back by questionable decisions from the developer in regards to his community and distain for constructive criticisms. Play this game if you will but stay away from the discord which sucks considering it's where you will actually be able to interact with this games community.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",developer zero respect community backing majority playtime mobile version saying good pacing early fantastic sense progression paced weapon armour unlock upgrade system help progression play class unlock slot core unlocking world open door progression interesting upgrade system crafting unlocks solo progression world party dungeon mini boss cooperating player quest pretty solid dialogue interesting self aware task objective given non text read breezing task cannot_recommend massively multiplayer online aspect bulk community found discord developer post regularly player informed card future update state recent april fool event happened discord resulted long member player banned simply participating branded troll unbeknownst reason included ban wave disoriented situation suck developer succeed banning long term member community ousting simply dared mention event awful community edge threatened ban mention incident fan boy developer defend dying breath good held questionable decision developer regard community distain constructive criticism play stay discord suck considering able interact game community

1449850,Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"decent game but hard to recommend because:  

(1)its Difficult to get a lot of gems to open up packs (unless a event is going on where you can earn up to 2k gems). Plus they need to reduce the amount of Real money to buy Gems from them because the price they are asking now is to much

(2) some decks are just unbearable to play against due to the amount of Negates (literally faced a dude who went first and set up his entire board that negated any spell or trap card i would put down and negated any monster effect i could possibly use to the point it was useless to do ANYTHING. even had a monster effect).

(3) Konami needs to add more ways to earn UR points into the game because its hard to make any decks when you dont have any UR's to make some of them. 

(4) A Updated Ban list would be great Cause i can name over 2 dozen cards that either need to be banned or limited (mostly Limited)

(5) add a Casual mode to the game and not just having Ranked mode would be nice. Maybe tag team 2v2? would be cool.

(6) this may be a Hot take but maybe adding a Chat system would be good? that way you can talk to people online in the game about how to do certain decks or how to play them to get better.

(7) Reduce the time when its your turn. I hate playing with people who take like 7 minutes to do things. please reduce the timer.

 pretty much my POV of the games state right now. These are my Opinion on the matter but hopefully some of the problems i listed can be addressed and soon.

1085660,Destiny 2,"I've been there since the beginning of the Destiny, and I mean THE BEGINNING. I was there when the first Destiny poster was shown in Halo: ODST, I was there on the first gameplay trailer was revealed, I was there when the game was released. I took down the Black Heart, I slapped the living shit out of Crota on Dark Below, I whooped the street clean with Oryx's ass, I was the Young Wolf who eliminated SIVA, I shoot my way through the Red War, I helped brought back Rasputin Online, I brought back Osiris, I avanged Cayde. I was there nearly every season, doing the same stupid strikes again and again for mediocre loot. I was a lore scholar, who had ideas for bringing the most important stories in Destiny universe to animation for better presentation, worked on animations for destiny fan created stuff. 
 I'm all saying this just for you all to understand how much I liked Destiny back then. I may be didnt dedicate my entire life to Destiny, I may be didnt play every Raid or Dungeon, but I knew everything about them. And look what it brought me. Bungie became a selfish money hungry developer team, saying they didnt have enough resources to make a single new map, let alone several ones every season, which they ask money for every new season, while every season they bring new stupid well optimised(Im saying this because most of the destiny items are low-mid poly with well crafted textures and shaders, just right click to create that stupid shine vfx while inspecting any pants, you'll see the polygons) ornament items to the store page and make shit ton of money from just SILVER sales every season. Same fucking gun keep breaking the game over and over again. I stopped playing at the last season of Witch Queen, that 3 seasons were mediocre so I just wanted to wait while paying again a shit ton of money for mediocre dlc with 3 seasons. And as I expected, it was mediocre again so I didnt play them. And I still HAD positive expectations and ideas about the game. I still followed the lore through creators like Byf.
 And you wanna know what broke the camels back? 
 Bungie laid so many people of recently, including the brilliant composer and artist Michael Salvatori. And what excuses did they have? They straight up said ""Maybe if you bought more silver and pre ordered more we wouldnt have laid them off"". Yeah, they blamed the player base for this. They blamed the consumers for them making mediocre stuff and consumers not wanting to pay premium price for it. Maybe Bungie, if you made ACTUAL GOOD FUCKING CONTENT players would BUY IT MORE. Fuck you Bungie. Dont buy Final Shape, it's script is going to be leaked in few weeks earlier before the release anyways, including what's going to happen in all the seasons and upcoming changes etc. Happened in Beyond Light, happened in Witch Queen if im not wrong.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"I have no idea where to start this review 🙂

Did I like it oh yes, yes i did. Will I  continue to play it after 210 hrs , yes, yes I will.  After 210 hrs I have finally managed to playtrough a campaign twice.

All right with that said this is the only game from Paradox i have really played. Even if i have played a little bit of european universalis 4.

I really like all the options this game gives. In which nations to play as. In how you want to play it. Do you want to try to conquer alot of stuff. Or do you simply want to build your nations. Do you want to get more land by wars or do you want to try to get it more peacefully.  


Do you want to be a ruler who want to focus on the realm, or intigue or war , dioplomacy etc.  

I like that you can start as a queen/king or even just a count/countess and then become and empress/emperor

I really like that you have faith/religon involved and how you can create your own relgion with it own perks. I like that you have also a prestige system and a renown system.   That you can take over countries by marring of characters.  I really like all the different skills both for your character and for your country.  I really like that you can have different start dates even if i have yet to try 896.  I also like that each religon has their own cultures.

All the different perks and skills you can have is great.   Witcha lso leads to some different play styles and scenarios 

The game has given me some of my most epic moments in a game.  After 220 hrs I still feel I will keep learning and figuring out new tricks or new things. 

This is one of the few games I could arguably play when I am in a bad mood. This is one of the few games that have really helped me trough I a little of rough patch.  Great game.  I hope the expansion packs and dlc is great

It also helps that this game combines 2 out of my 3 favourite genres arguably. I like that each ruler and character feels invidual. That each country ruler might have their argendas. That you have to keep you nation population happy or at least vassals.  I like that the you can go in different type of wars or that you can join the crusades or that you sometimes have to defend. 

In my opinion this one my all time fav/best games. Fantastic game and while I don’t like to rate games I have to give this my highest regards.

Is the game perfect, no I guess not, then again that subjective, but the only problems I have with the game is so small that it doesn’t really detract from the experience. It doesn’t hinder my enjoyment anyway. Is as close to perfect as it gets for me.  The only thing is raising armies I feel is ok, but sometimes I witch there was and easier way to only raise them partially or something. Perhaps there is tough and I just have found out. Other then that very, very little. Perhaps and Indication when the Ai want to attack you , but then again , I think that too is part of the fun that you don’t really know and suddenly can get into a big war.  Or sometimes a small one. I like that you can give some characters different orders. 

The last time a played a sp game this much in a short amount of times has to be Civilization 5 I guess or perhaps some of the fire emblem games on the 3ds.  

Anyway highly recommended if you want a great strategy and rpg game. Where you will learn something new constantly. Relatively easy to learn, but damn is hard to master. The time goes by very fast  tough. Instead of civilization one more day, here it is one more ingame month or year.  

I really like that the game is make your own story type game, that the game has so many mechanics. That there is a lot that you can learn or play around with, all the options. 

Now I will hope the upcoming expansion pack and dlc are great and I might actually buy some dlc/ expansion for once. Highly recommended and a game that is almost like a dream game for me. There was a short time I taught I needed to take a break, but it really never happened.  

Also the hint system is great. 

Lastly the music is pretty solid. 

Thus  highly recommended if you want a deep game with tons of mechanics and stuff you can do.

1623730,Palworld,"I am a longtime lover and player of the Pokemon franchise. I have played every game since Pokemon Red. My very first game of my own was Pokemon Crystal for my birthday in 2001. With the release of Pokemon Violet, I decided I had had enough with the insane drop in quality of the finished product GameFreak allowed to be shipped to customers. Pokemon Scarlet/Violet are both the best and worst Pokemon games ever created. 

This game feels like it takes place in an alternate universe of Pokemon games that are derived from Pokemon Legends: Arceus. I have never played survival games like ARK that other people compare this game to, so this is my first time in this genre. I am amazed. I think about my Pals when I'm not with them. I think about leveling up and progressing when I'm not working. It's pretty hard for me to get this ""into"" a new game. They really have something special here.

236390,War Thunder,"Extremely impressive on a technical and visual level, truly a unique game, sometimes it feels fun to play.. 

Game is incredibly held back by its economy and developers, which are almost hostile towards the player's time. Even with a premium account the grind is painful and the toxicity of the economy permeates into normal gameplay as losing a match takes a hefty chunk out of your resource gains. Add to this extremely weird balancing at times, and its a recipe for an extremely frustrating experience, where you begrudgingly come back to every now and then because there is nothing else like it.

Can honestly not recommend it to any new players. Don't be fooled by the beautiful showcase of modern vehicles either, the store does not tell you that it easily takes a full year of playing to grind to that point unless you put down hefty sums to buy your way in.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

236390,War Thunder,"I have been an adamant supporter of Wargaming.net for several, several years. For the longest time I had this bias that War Thunder was a simple knock-off not worth my attention. In that time, I paid out to Wargaming in support of their efforts. Something changed recently that made me look into War Thunder, a change in Wargamings customer support policies that made me rethink my proposition of supporting that company. Not mentioning the issue here, I came over - very distraut mind you - to expect a horrible experience after many off-steam reviews that I read. Surprisingly, the steam reviews seemed to alter the opinion some.

Then, after downloading, I played the game. I was floored at how easy it was to get into, how much detail was spent on how an aircraft flies or a tank is destroyed. In World of Tanks, you have a typical health bar that dictates how much you can hit and what you can kill. Typically, people who fork out tons of money can get ""golden shells"" that help enhance that experience and one-shot players. In this game, however, I found that I - a regular, average joe - could one shot players. I found that I could actually get back into the game. I fell in love with it.

I admit that while players one shotted me - and often - that I felt somewhat iffed. Unlike World of Tanks, however, this game shows you *why* you were killed off. A detailed scene plays out showing how the shell penetrated your tank and the damaged it caused. Realistically you understand why you died, like I did. I'm not familiar with how real-life tank battles work - only theory - so based on that I understand the experience to be similar. To put it bluntly, I didn't feel *cheated* by the game when I died. The game told me *why* I died, *how* I died, and in some way even demonstrated *what I could do better* by the death scene as it played out. You watch it and literally go, ""Next time I should try this"", instead of in World of Tanks how I'd go, ""what happened?!"". 

In air combat mode, unlike World of Warplanes, you actually feel like you can shoot down planes two-times your better. There's even a reward for that in land combat mode! Everything feels fleshed out, and while they don't have a ""death scene"" for air combat mode (obvious reasons I'd say), you do get to see yourself shot down. There's a detailed, brief message on why you lost control of your plane. The reasons can reach from ""Pilot knocked out"", to watching a wing fall off and your crew whose still in full control as you press the fire button crash to their death. You *understand* why you died; to me, understanding why I died means a whole world of difference!

In conclusion, I feel that War Thunder has demonstrated itself to me in a way that feels familiar (World of Tanks) yet completely different. Instead of feeling in the dark when I'm shot down in air combat mode, I see explanations. Instead of feeling like I'm some piece of trash to be chewed and spit out in land combat mode, the game shows how I died and by contrast demonstrates what I could do better. I feel there's been a lot of attention to detaul placed into War Thunder that Wargaming seriously lacks in most of their games. I feel that, having played Warthunder in this short amount of time on Steam, I'm in love with it. No doubt that may change, but the feeling that the game isn't cheating me being gone plays a huge part in my new honeymoon phase.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"Crusader Kings III Review:

Wow. That is the words I have for the very tiny 50 hours or so I have played so far across both of my accounts. This game, although lacking in content to a small degree, is almost a masterpiece. I am just gonna get started.

The Cons: I am gonna start with the cons, cause there are not that many, and they are things that 100% will be improved. There are less options when it comes to start dates. In CK2, You could play from the mid 8th century, all the way to the mid 15th, now the start seems to be pushed up a century or so, although I do think they will add more over time. Next, the disease/plague system is a joke compared to the CK2 DLC (The Reaper's Due) which I honestly thought was amazing man.. The panic you would feel when a plague stretches into your domain into your capital city was absolutely horrifying and made the Disease map one of your most commonly used maps. Also, the cities and structures on the map are wack man, they just suck. I wish the holdings were more detailed, and had better appearance. Also, I think the character creator needs some works and the values you edit could be visible numerically. These are slight problems, and don't carry much weight. But on the other hand, I have only came across a few things I thought were just terrible, that would be the raised requirement for the creation of an empire, I really had to stretch my domain for it to reach requirement, and there were many real life empires which are much much smaller than that. And finally, just like CK2 I was able to become filthy rich in one lifetime, simply from ransoming prisoners 2 to 3 times every 10 15 minutes. I just think that is really... Exploitative? Also I hope the option for shatter and randomize worlds can return as it is very entertaining and can result in awesome campaigns. 

The Pros: Where should I even start? The graphics in this game are absolutely superb, the map looks just as good as I:R and the inclusion of 3D characters pissed me off originally and I thought it was a stupid idea, and then after I finished my first campaign I went back to CK2, and my god, it was so much less immersive. The character system and how they move, breathe, show emotion, show injury and disease is honestly so immersive and once you experience it, it is hard to go back to CK2. The map is much larger now, and there is much more incentive to play as Sub-Saharan Africans, Arabs, Berbers, Turks, Indians, Tibetans, and Mongols. My first full campaign actually was as a Ghanaian vassal and I ended up forming the Mali Empire until an imbecile heir taking the throne destroyed and fragmented it and the dynasties downward trajectory ended the family getting expelled from power in the early 1200's altogether, and honestly, that is fine, because although you want to do well, the stress level and the improvements to RP make it feel like you rather watch the events happen as if you are watching a movie or documentary on the events as they happen rather than you playing it. A lot of times I hated my ruler and despised the actions I was making due to the traits I was having to follow in order to keep the game going were completely disgusting and immoral at times, and when that game over finally hits, it feels like although your dynasty might have died out, it still was a great story, a magnificent playthrough, because the game itself feels more like an entertaining story/experience, than a game that you just attempt to win. Now, the players, and their actions/motives/life stories, although played by AI are nonetheless much more believable and immersive than before, and don't just seem like mindless bots, I felt actual emotions and care for my character, wife, children, and especially heir, and truly tried to act as if they were my real life royal family in the middle ages, and honestly it makes it easy. The events now are much funnier, immersive, and plentiful and I am so glad I am not seeing the same 100 events every single lifetime, it makes every character and their lives seem much more unique and believable as if you were really witnessing the life of a real lord in the middle ages. I love the fact your children look like a mix between you and your spouse, and their features aren't just completely random. It makes the entire dynasty feel much more connected, and makes you really remember the playthrough and the individual characters much more than before. The UI is so much better, much less clunk, and so much less clicking, and monotonous actions. All around I enjoy the soundtrack although it will take years for us to decide if these tracks surpass tracks such as ""In Taberna"" ""Saladin Besiege Jerusalem"" ""Vassal of Tripoli"" and ""Full Plate Metal"". Wars, raids, diplomacy, and everything under the sun has seen at least subtle improvements, and everything seems much less random/nonsensical, and a lot more fleshed out and practical, and the UI and AI improvements made that possible, much less clunk and monotony as I said and that is CK2's biggest problem. I also feel like campaigns are much much shorter, and trust me, that's a good thing. Also the skill tree system is so good and makes you truly want to work up all of your characters skills and make them great lords to help build up the realm, and having the different perks really help starting that every succession. All around I find myself finishing more campaigns than I did in CK2 because the Mid-Game boredom due to the same exact events and pop ups, along with monotonous gameplay loops made it a lot easier to put down and a lot harder to pick back up, and CK3 has much less of this problem. I found warfare much less like whack a mole or cat and mouse, and more like actual strategic battle tactics and warfare, as the CPU isn't as braindead as before, and doesn't just run in circles around your troops (AS MUCH) cause they still do things like that and there are points where it becomes questionable. Also I found myself investing in better military and troops because there are times where you can outnumber the enemy 4 to 1 and their superior troops and technology will cause you to lose the battle. So the idea that more troops = win mentality from CK2 seems to be gone.

Summary: In the end though, both games are pretty similar, and aren't starkly different, CK2 is still a masterpiece, and CK3 is lacking in content, but for what it is, and comparing CK2 at launch to CK3 at launch, this game blows it's predecessor out of the water. Honestly although it lacks in content, I recommend CK3 much more than CK2 at this point This game is AWESOME, highly recommend 9.1/10.","Very Positive92% of the 66,890 user reviews for this game are positive.",wow word tiny 50 hour far across account lacking small degree masterpiece gon na started con gon na con cause not_that thing 100 improved option come date ck2 play mid 8th century mid 15th pushed century add next disease plague joke compared ck2 downloadable additional released initial launch reaper due honestly thought amazing man panic plague stretch domain capital horrifying disease commonly map city structure wack man suck wish holding detailed appearance creator need work value visible numerically slight problem carry weight hand across thing thought terrible raised requirement creation empire stretch domain reach requirement real life empire much_emphasized smaller finally ck2 able filthy rich lifetime simply ransoming prisoner 2 3 time 10 15 minute exploitative hope shatter randomize world entertaining result awesome campaign pro graphic superb look good r inclusion 3d character pissed originally thought stupid idea finished series connected mission level form storyline ck2 god immersive move breathe emotion injury disease honestly immersive it_emphasized hard ck2 larger incentive play sub saharan african arab berber turk indian tibetan mongol series connected mission level form storyline ghanaian vassal ended forming mali empire imbecile heir taking throne destroyed fragmented dynasty downward trajectory ended family expelled power early 1200 honestly fine stress improvement rp rather watch event happen watching movie documentary event happen rather time hated ruler despised action due trait follow order completely disgusting immoral time finally hit feel dynasty died great magnificent playthrough feel entertaining attempt win player action motif life story ai believable immersive mindless bot actual emotion care wife child especially heir truly tried act real life royal family middle age honestly make easy event funnier immersive plentiful glad not_seeing 100 event single lifetime make life unique believable witnessing life real lord middle age love child mix spouse feature completely random make dynasty connected make remember playthrough individual character ui clunk clicking monotonous action enjoy soundtrack year decide track surpass track taberna saladin besiege jerusalem vassal tripoli plate metal war raid diplomacy sun subtle improvement random nonsensical fleshed practical ui ai improvement possible clunk monotony ck2 biggest problem campaign much_emphasized shorter trust good skill tree good make truly character skill great lord help build realm different perk help starting succession finishing campaign ck2 mid boredom due exact event pop ups along monotonous loop easier harder pick ck3 problem found warfare whack mole cat mouse actual strategic battle tactic warfare cpu braindead circle troop cause thing point questionable found investing military troop time outnumber enemy 4 1 superior troop technology cause lose battle idea troop win mentality ck2 summary game pretty similar starkly different ck2 masterpiece ck3 lacking comparing ck2 launch ck3 launch blow predecessor water honestly lack recommend ck3 ck2 awesome highly recommend 9 1_emphasized0

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Cyberpunk 2077 is not just a game, it’s a phenomenon. It’s a stunning masterpiece of storytelling, gameplay, and technology that will blow your mind and immerse you in a rich and vibrant world of the dark future. If you’re looking for a game that will challenge you, thrill you, and make you feel like a badass cyberpunk mercenary, look no further than Cyberpunk 2077.

Cyberpunk 2077 is based on the acclaimed tabletop RPG series by Mike Pondsmith, who was a consultant for the game’s development. The game is set in Night City, a sprawling megalopolis that is home to millions of people, corporations, gangs, and hackers. You play as V, a customizable character who can choose their background, appearance, skills, and cyberware. You can also choose your playstyle, whether you prefer stealth, hacking, combat, or dialogue. You can explore the city on foot, by car, or by bike, and interact with a variety of characters, factions, and quests. You can also romance some of them, if you’re feeling frisky.

The game’s main story revolves around a heist gone wrong that results in you having a bio-chip implanted in your head that contains the digital ghost of Johnny Silverhand, a legendary rocker and rebel played by none other than Keanu Reeves. Johnny is not just a sidekick, he’s a co-protagonist who has his own agenda and personality. He will comment on your actions, influence your decisions, and sometimes take over your body. He’s also hilarious, sarcastic, and charismatic, and you will either love him or hate him. The game’s story is full of twists and turns, and you will have to make choices that will affect the outcome and the fate of Night City.

Cyberpunk 2077 is not a linear game, it’s a branching game. The game has multiple endings, and each one is different depending on your choices, relationships, and actions. The game also has a lot of replay value, as you can try different builds, paths, and outcomes. You can also explore the game’s vast and diverse world, which is divided into six districts: City Center, Watson, Westbrook, Heywood, Santo Domingo, and Pacifica. Each district has its own culture, architecture, and atmosphere, and you will encounter different enemies, allies, and opportunities. The game’s world is also dynamic and reactive, as it changes according to the time of day, weather, and events. You can witness random encounters, crimes, and gigs, and you can choose to intervene or ignore them. You can also hack into the city’s network, access cameras, doors, and devices, and manipulate them to your advantage.

Cyberpunk 2077 is not only a beautiful game, it’s a technological marvel. The game uses the REDengine 4, a proprietary game engine developed by CD Projekt Red, the creators of The Witcher series. The game features stunning graphics, realistic physics, and lifelike animations. The game also uses ray tracing, a cutting-edge technology that simulates realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections. The game also uses DLSS, a technology that uses artificial intelligence to enhance the game’s performance and quality. The game also features an impressive soundtrack, composed by P. T. Adamczyk, Marcin Przybyłowicz, and Paul Leonard-Morgan, and featuring the contributions of several licensed artists. The game also features a stellar voice cast, led by Keanu Reeves, Gavin Drea, and Cherami Leigh, who bring the characters to life with their emotions and expressions.

Cyberpunk 2077 is not a perfect game, it’s a flawed game. The game was released with a lot of bugs, glitches, and crashes, especially on the console versions. The game was also criticized for its themes and representation of transgender characters, and for its depiction of violence and sexual content. The game’s developer, CD Projekt Red, faced a lot of backlash and lawsuits for their perceived attempts at downplaying the severity of the technical problems before release. The game was also removed from the PlayStation Store for six months, until it was restored in June 2021. The game’s developer has been working hard to fix the game’s issues, and has released several patches and updates, as well as free additional content. The game’s latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, was released on 26 September 2023, and it added a new storyline, characters, locations, and features. The game’s developer has also promised more expansions and updates in the future, as well as a multiplayer mode.

Cyberpunk 2077 is not a game for everyone, it’s a game for those who love cyberpunk. It’s a game that will make you laugh, cry, rage, and awe. It’s a game that will challenge you, inspire you, and surprise you. It’s a game that will stay with you long after you finish it. It’s a game that will make you think, feel, and dream. It’s a game that will change you, and maybe even the world. It’s a game that deserves your attention, your time, and your love. It’s a game that is worth playing, and playing again. It’s a game that is, simply put, a masterpiece. It’s Cyberpunk 2077","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Pros: Super fun game with friends/family, beautiful yet simple graphics, pleasing aesthetic overall. Lots to do, doesn't feel super ""grindy"" despite pretty much all the gameplay just being different ways to make money to buy cosmetics.

Cons: The community is suuuper toxic tho, can't recommend meeting other players unless you're really confident in your PvP skills in this game and you don't mind very rude and toxic folks on the mic, it'd be cool if there were servers with no combat or somethin idk. The forced PvP makes the game very hard to enjoy sometimes, because sometimes I just want to sail the seas and relax at the end of the day.

Would be a lot better if you could play in servers with only your ship size allowed (only sloops with sloops, etc). Also would be better if bosses had health bars, instead of just fighting them until who knows when, that gets pretty old.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"Devs should not have taken the ""Survivor"" part of ""Vampire Survivors"" so literally.

VS games are about a power fantasy, clearing screens of enemies while getting even more powerful, and getting permanent upgrades in-between the runs. Any run is a win and a progress.
DRG:S seems to be about slowly walking around, always overwhelmed by swarms bugs in a tight arena, then losing and getting a ""MISSION FAILED"" screen after you lose on Stage 3 or 4. Only to find out you collected barely enough resources to get a +4% increase on a stat - so it was truly a failure.

Even the regular enemies can tank my Scout's shots, and the the elites/bosses are incredibly tanky (and trigger too frequently). The hit boxes are unclear (especially for that long-forward-claws elite).

The UI/UX could also use improvements. It is unclear what resources are for the run / persistent progress, how they carry over. In the between-stages shop, it would be nice to examine current equipment stats.

The game is absolutely gorgeous, and I was happy to finally get into the Rock-and-Stone vibe with this new game. But at this pacing, no, thank you. Give me a power fantasy of VS genre, not survival game where I'm set up for failure and grind.","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_have taken vampire survivor literally v game power fantasy clearing screen enemy powerful permanent upgrade run win progress drg s_emphasizedeems slowly walking overwhelmed swarm bug tight arena losing failed screen lose stage 3 4 collected barely resource 4 increase stat truly failure regular enemy tank scout s_emphasizedhots the_emphasized elite boss incredibly tanky trigger frequently box unclear especially long forward claw elite ui ux improvement unclear resource persistent progress carry stage shop nice examine equipment stats gorgeous happy finally stone vibe pacing no_thank power fantasy v genre not_survival set failure grind
686810,Hell Let Loose,"This is my first review on steam for any game I have played. With almost 800 hrs played, it's no doubt I love Hell Let Loose! And with my lengthy playtime through many updates and changes with the game, I can confidently sport an informed opinion. Keeping in mind that this game is still in early access, I have very high hopes for the future of this game and have been impressed with the many improvements with each update and patch. First off, teamwork is key and Black Matter does an excellent job implementing teamplay mechanics into the gameplay. Every soldier has a purpose utilizing historically accurate loadouts and classes. It gives players a variety of playstyles to choose from that balance very well into the wider aspect of the team. There's a high reliance on communication and coordination between the squad leaders and commander. Having competent leaders usually always leads to fun and engaging gameplay, win or lose. The maps in HLL are absolutely stunning and historically accurate to their real-life counterparts. The randomized objectives in Warfare forces players to coordinate new strategies and maneuvers depending on the points that are selected. It also keeps the 9 maps fresh and not feel ""overplayed"".

[h1] 4/15/2022 Update 11 [/h1]
After playing another 2000 hours and through a few updates (U7-U11), I think it is time to update the review. Unfortunately Steam has a character limit for reviews, so I will not be able to include every opinion and recommendation that I may have. The current gameplay update for Hell Let Loose is U11 with U12 on the way. There are eleven maps, two gamemodes, and a variety of weapons/vehicles/gadgets from the American, Soviet, and Wermacht forces. New content will be releasing very soon introducing new maps, factions, and weapons. Check out the roadmap! There are some promising gameplay features and content coming to Hell Let Loose.

[b][u] Gameplay[/u][/b]: The core gameplay relies on the leadership roles. [b] GARRISONS! [/b] Garrisons are the main spawnpoints in Hell Let Loose. They are built by the Commander, Squad Leaders, and Spotters. Squad Leaders and Spotters can also deploy OPs, outposts, for their squad. There will be many games where teams will not have any spawn points. This is where Hell Let Loose falls short. The best components of this game are the gunplay and engagements with enemy players. When players cannot spawn close into the action or have to run 500 meters to an objective, the game loses all of its excitement and enjoyment. I cannot discredit the spawn system fully as it is more of a newer/learning player problem than a game or meta issue. The main objective of building spawn points is to encourage teamwork. The system has improved with the past few updates by adding more spawn points: Halftracks (driveable garrisons), Airheads (airdropped garrison with a set number of spawn waves), and the reintroduction of ""red zone garrisons"" (garrisons that can be deployed behind enemy lines). There are many intricacies to the gameplay that have a big impact on the outcome of a game. It is important that the developers do a better job at explainng these gamplay mechanics to newer players. People are suggesting in-game tutorials, test ranges, and developer produced video content. Please watch beginner and tutorial videos about this game, read other reviews, and check out the many steam guides to help get a better understanding of all the complexities.

[b][u] Gunplay[/u][/b]: The core of any first-person shooter is the gunplay. Hell Let Loose is a tactical shooter so expect hardcore gameplay and a low TTK. The engagements in HLL are still a huge plus. Kills are satisfying and expect to die in every way possible. The combination of armor, infantry, and commander air-strikes create an engaging battle simulator like no other. Hell Let Loose can definitely do a better job at improving it though. The game is still guilty of bad hitboxes and shoddy physics at times. Tank engagements are basically Rock/Paper/Scissors. Overall, the gunplay is great and highly recommended for those who like World War 2 warfare.

[b][u] Optimization and Graphics[/u][/b]: Optimization will always be a major deciding factor for players. The developers seem to be favoring better looking graphics than optimizing and improving performance. There are some fixes and tweaks you can implement to improve your framerate (Check Steam guides). The community is hoping for a renewed focus from the developers on optimization and performance. IT'S BEEN TOO DAMN LONG! Because of the subpar optimization, the graphics and atmosphere shines. No other World War 2 game captures the battles and maps quite like Hell Let Loose. While some models and textures can be improved, Black Matter does a great job at giving players that cinematic and ""Band of Brothers feel"".

[b][u] Community[/u][/b]: The best thing going for this game is the community and clans that support it. You will most likely play in community run servers with their own admins and moderators. I highly recommend that players join a community/clan, especially ones looking for more organized gameplay and teamwork. These groups do an excellent job teaching and helping out newer players become familiar with the game. Many teams will offer organized trainings, tournaments, and events against other communities. For the casual players, I still encourage you to definitely play with a squad of friends. It is safe to say that the majority of the playerbase are made up of Battlefield vets. The rest are players who are looking for a more hardcore and tactical WW2 shooter. With the disappointments of recent AAA shooters, we are seeing a big influx of players. With the increased playerbase, servers are easy to find and there are many communities supporting most regions around the world. Black Matter and Team17 need to focus on developing better relationships with the communities and players that have been supporting the game since its inception. Recently, there have been out of touch statements in the discord feedback channels and developer briefings. It has lowered the confidence of many veteran players towards the direction of the game. While not as bad as the giants at EA or ActivisionBlizzard, it is still concerning seeing similar behavior.

[b][u] Final Thoughts[/u][/b]: On a personal level, this game can get stagnant at times for me. I have been playing Hell Let Loose since 2019 and have over 2500 hours played. Of course with that amount of time, any game can become mundane or stale. There are no other current WW2 shooters that compare to Hell Let Loose with the exception of Post Scriptum. The AAA fps games do not provide the satisfying gameplay I am looking for, and are usually broken and incomplete messes. Comparing Post Scriptum and Hell Let Loose, HLL is definitely the more popular one. Post Scriptum does offer some better features though. They have nailed the physics engine, sound design, and the abundance of content (maps, armies, guns, etc). Now that Hell Let Loose is a fully released game, everyone is expecting major updates to bring the content on par with PS. 

[b][u] Recommendation[/u][/b]: I still highly reccomend this game, at least for the $40 price point it is currently at. Hell Let Loose provides enough content for fps gamers and WW2 junkies alike. If you are still on the fence about this game and price point, wait! This game gets discounted with every update.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....

Here is what I have experienced so far:

1. If you're good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big ""HOW?""

2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn't register so you have to relaunch the game.

3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).

4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).

5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don't play any different here.

Overall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue. You would've had more fun buying/playing Cyberpunk 2077 on launch day. If you're considering buying this game, don't do it now. I have fun maybe 30% of the time, but I can't let $70 go to waste.

EDIT: Steam told me I played an additional 11 hours and asked me to revise my review. Here's my revision, still sucks

Edit: allowing comments, but only if you're a COD MWII hater just like me

1144200,Ready or Not,"What I like in Ready or Not 1.0:
-Like the new maps and missions
-Like the customizations
-Like the idea of managing a SWAT unit and keep track of their status
-Like the briefings
-Like the fact SWAT AI are more independent if they're following you, arresting suspects and picking up evidence. I also like that there's a ""search area"" function to catch any stray pieces of evidence when you clear the area.

What I don't like:
-S ranks are pepperball and beanbags and CS gas only, for if anyone is killed or incapacitated, suspect, civilian, or SWAT, goodbye run. Granted, this was in games like SWAT 4  but man, I didn't like having to clear a hospital full of Nork spec ops in SWAT 4 with beanbags and pepperballs, and I do not like having to clear a hospital filled with Yemeni terrorists the same way in Ready or Not.
-I don't like the suspect AI being able to track you after cutting LOS perfectly and being able to wallbang you when you can't.
-While SWAT AI is improved, they still have massive problems with reacting to gunfire, which has led to deaths when they stand on a doorway and die without shooting back. They also have trouble following orders sometimes or getting stuck in place. And I've had instances where I told officers to restrain a suspect, they don't, and the suspect gets up and shoots them.
-Small rooms are a pain to get out since your members tend to not back up when you want out.
-I ultimately think the commander system currently is more an annoyance due to SWAT AI and their tendency to have their morale tank on any death, meaning you have to baby them a lot or constantly rotate new officers into the team like a gaggle of conscripts. And I feel like their traits when you do unlock it don't work at all. If they do, they don't have a noticeable effect.
-I don't like that the majority customization options are on the tail end of the campaign.
-Bunch of places make my frames tank for some reason.

However, I can't recommend the game because Ubisoft makes you launch it from ""Ubisoft Connect"", a useless program that is buggy and broken most of the time and makes you wait 5 minutes to play the game because it has to launch, then you have to log out of it because you attached this game to a new account you made when Ubisoft Connect forgot your old credentials and you forgot you had an account and made a new one, only for Ubisoft Connect to suddenly remember your old credentials as soon as you make the new account and attach your game to it, meaning you can only play it from that new account from now on.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Lost Ark is a great MMORPG, and it's one of my favorite game. It has great combat and it's a very raid focus game. The story  is not bad, the soundtracks are amazing, and the graphic quality is pretty good.

However, the game has some flaws. One notable drawback is the absence of solo progression. If you want to progress your character, you HAVE to do raids, otherwise you can't progress. That's also what leads to toxicity in raids, because the game is forcing newer player to play with veterans. I've seen a lot of comments about how toxic this game is. I came from League of Legends, and the toxicity in Lost Ark is comparatively mild. Most of my raids are pretty chill, I rarely see any toxic players in my lobbies, but sometimes I do see some toxicity and it's mostly during raids with less-experienced players. Personally, I don't mind guiding newer players through raid mechanics, but if they resist communication or refuse to learn, there's little I can do. Ironically, in my experience, the most toxic individuals tend to be the less-skilled players—those who've only cleared the raid a few times but still make occasional mistakes.

I recommend this game to those who enjoy raiding, likes to grind and don't mind the toxicity. 
I also have a few tips to make your experience more enjoyable:

[list]
    [*]Take your time to explore the game and learn your character. There is no rush.
    [*]The game is about grinding. If you want to progress you need to grind, but it's okay to miss dailies or weeklies. If you don't feel like playing, take a break—nobody is forcing you. 
    [*]It's going to be hard at the beginning, but if you keep learning and playing, everything will be alright.
    [*]Play the game with existing friends or make new ones with whom you can raid together by joining a guild or using Discord. It will make finding parties much easier.
    [*]Be willing to learn. It's better to watch a few videos before a raid, but you don't need to know everything. Focus on the major mechanics.
    [*]Don't be afraid to communicate. If you don't know some raid mechanics or if you're new to some patterns, speak up.
    [*]There are toxic players, and there are friendly players. Just like in real life. Learn to deal with it, and move on.
    [*]Remember to have fun! It's just a game after all :)

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?

[b] Mistakes / poor decisions: [/b]

- First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.

- Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.

- No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.

- Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).

- Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.

- STEREO sound... what year is this??

- Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.

[b] What would make this game better? [/b]

- Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.

- Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).

- Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.

- Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.

If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.

- Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!

- Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue. 

- Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.

If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.

[b] Why is it so popular then? [/b]

It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.

All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.

The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.

There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".

Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.

[b] Edited to add: [/b] To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.

PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game. 

Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Well EA, you've done it. You have made (by far) the worst Madden Franchise game I've seen as a player since Madden 2005. The amount of stupid things that happen throughout your gaming experience is enough to give a 23 year old a heart attack. I primarily play Franchise mode with friends in my time on this game and the amount of problems are truly insane that I must break them down by literal aspects of the game. 

For starters, if it wasn't obvious I play as the Miami Dolphins for my franchise primarily on All-Madden and the defense is literally broken naturally that you must alter damn near every aspect of it to play it properly, unless you want Bradley Chubb and Jaelen Phillips dropping into coverage... Now, lets continue with the defensive issues. You cannot tackle. It's literally impossible. The running backs break every fucking tackle - whether its aggressive, conservative or hit stick, they're bouncing off dudes like crazy and the receivers are only slightly easier to tackle. CPU pass blocking is unparalleled in strength, they get so much time in the pocket its crazy, 85 overall speed rusher Jaelen Philips has a whopping 3 sacks through 10 games and 80 overall power rusher Bradley Chubb has just 4 on the other side of the line. The pass coverage reaction is abysmal which is disappointing as I had seen many clips that showed it being improved for this years version of the game, however my DB's who are literally Jalen Ramsay, Jevon Holland and Xavien Howard, get smoked every fucking play and don't play the ball at all; then if you make the coaching adjustments to play the ball you can write off every possible tackle after catch you even had a chance of as they will soar right by them without hesitation. Now, lets by chance say you get an interception... the CPU doesn't worry because the ancient tight end Mercedes Lewis will run down Jalen Ramsay in a straight away going the other direction. No fucking way that ever happens. 

Now lets discuss the offense, going inversely to the issues on defense. My players never break a tackle, only time it happens is if I get the spam A break tackle prompt and i hit it, but even then it only shows up when I am smack in the center of 5 defenders so whats the use. My pass blocking is horrendous, like last year I notice moments where my tackle doesn't even touch the defender rushing. I'm running for my life and get unbelievable negative plays as a result and even with adjustments being made such as keeping a tight end in or a half back to pick up some stray blocks it just doesn't matter. Then this fucking momentum meter has some severely stupid enhancements - and let me be clear, I do like the momentum meter. However - in what situation does momentum make it so I don't even know my receivers??? That is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Another issue I run into is in my season with the Denver Broncos I can't throw a go route to save my life. Dude will be wide open with 5 yards separation from the receiver and that sucker gets under thrown every time - its amazing. I have been Tyreek Hill with the ball in my hands on a straight away and a man chased me down running at an angle up the field, again, never going to happen. 

Even special teams is broken. I had 3 games in the rain and windy, the wind is not accurate. Playing in clear conditions my kicker can hit from 62 going full power, playing with 13 mph winds going in favor of me the ball came up way short from 59 out. Playing in rain with the wind going 16 mph up and to the right, aimed the kick ever so slightly to the left to adjust for it and the ball went hard left like i was aiming in to section G on my left hand side. 

Fix the fucking game. Make the game fair. Make harder difficulties be harder because they play smarter not make them broken and literally impossible to tackle. Make it so they have fucking clock management for fuck sake, for yet another year the CPU will run out of time going into half time on the 25 yard line in clear field goal range when they started their drive with 3 full time-outs. Game has promise but has sever game breaking issues in key spots that make it no fun. I've played madden every year since 2005 on All Madden and I'm 1-9 with the most overpowered team in the game specifically because ""I can't play defense"" because my players can't make a tackle with  3 people to assist them.","Mixed43% of the 5,008 user reviews for this game are positive.",ea far worst franchise 2005 stupid thing happen throughout gaming 23 old heart attack primarily play franchise mode friend problem truly insane break literal aspect starter obvious play miami dolphin franchise primarily defense literally broken naturally alter damn near aspect play properly unless bradley chubb jaelen phillips dropping coverage let continue defensive issue cannot_tackle literally impossible running back break fucking tackle aggressive conservative stick bouncing dude crazy receiver slightly easier tackle cpu pas blocking unparalleled strength pocket crazy 85 speed rusher jaelen philip whopping 3 sack 10 game 80 power rusher bradley chubb 4 side line pas coverage reaction abysmal disappointing clip showed improved year version db literally jalen ramsay jevon holland xavien howard smoked fucking play play ball coaching adjustment play ball write possible tackle catch chance soar hesitation let chance interception cpu worry ancient tight mercedes lewis jalen ramsay straight direction no_fucking happens let discus offense inversely issue defense player never_break tackle happens spam break tackle prompt show smack center 5 defender whats pas blocking horrendous last notice moment tackle touch defender rushing running life unbelievable negative play result adjustment keeping tight half pick stray block matter fucking momentum meter severely stupid enhancement clear momentum meter situation momentum receiver dumbest issue season denver bronco t_emphasizedhrow route save life dude wide open 5 yard separation receiver sucker get thrown amazing tyreek hill ball hand straight man chased running an_emphasizedgle field never_going happen special team broken 3 game rain windy wind not_accurate clear condition kicker 62 power 13 mph wind favor ball short 59 rain wind 16 mph aimed kick slightly left adjust ball hard left aiming section g left hand side fix fucking fair harder difficulty harder play smarter not_make broken literally impossible tackle fucking clock management fuck sake cpu half 25 yard line clear field goal range started drive 3 out promise sever breaking issue key spot no_fun 2005 1 9 overpowered play defense player tackle 3 assist

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"TLTR: ESO is the best MMO I've played so far.


The Good.
It has retained many of the best elements from the Elder Scrolls series.
-Fantastic sound-score.
-Fine graphics.
-A world that feels alive.
-Great exploration gameplay.

The leveling and combat system is far better than any Elder Scrolls game, by miles. For PvE combat is great, tho I haven't played for long enough to get into PvP yet. You can choose to grind up to cap in a single session, if that strikes your fancy. Or you could care less about leveling and still participate fully in all non-endgame PvE.

ESO does not waste my time with long travel times, I can get to anywhere I've already been in between 30 sec to a minute. For me this is a very important point. I detest games that fakes longviety my wasting my time.

ESO is not in any way pay-to-win, and it doesen't unnaturally inconvenience the player to make me pay extra. The only inconvenience in the game comes with spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants while questing at the same time. This was an inconvenience in the Bethesdas Elder Scrolls games aswell because of inventory. You can pay to unnaturally compensate for this inconvenience through an ingredient-bag.

ESO has pay for vanity.

The world is immensly open. I can go anywhere I want and be successful straight from the start. There are many questlines with their own story tying into the main story. I can choose freely what storyline to follow, or I can ignore the story entirely if I just want to grind my way to the endgame content or just want to explore. This also means the game is extremely accessible for anyone.

Crafting is plesant and feels meaningful so far. There are crafting-quests in addition to crafting for trade, if I want to pursue it as a career. There are few games where I enjoy crafting, but in this one it seems ok.

Stealth gameplay is fun, although not innovative by any means.

Playing together ad hoc is fun even without groupinng up. Just running together with random people for an area or a difficult fight is quite fun. Probably because combat is fast-paced, players are considered allies for the purpose of abilities, and game mechanics generally supports doing so. It works very well for any open area I've been to, and is faster than grouping up.

Some of the dialouge is good.

Some of the quests are ok.


The Bad.
With the game being extremely accessible, people looking for a challenge will have to do a bit of searching or research where to go and who to hook up with.

Because the enemies and treasure scales with level, ESO doesen't have the mother-haul aspect of treasure-hunting that some older Elder Scrolls titles had. For instance, in the original Morrowind I could sneak into an ancient abandoned fortress, find a coven of vampires there so powerful they could one-hit kill me, sneak past them, discover an endgame weapon, steal it and leave. It was a very unique feeling when just stumbling into it while exploring.

The community tools for ESO are the porest of any MMO I've played. I haven't found an accessible way of reaching ppl even for PUGs. There is no tutorial on how to effectively get a group going, and frankly zero incentive to do so anyway in any area I've been so far. Further, getting a guild seems to be a matter of blindly accepting guild-invites from ppl spamming general chat. For instance I've found no credible channel on how to get info on guilds that may be suitable for me, seek them out and ask for an invite. As a noob I find getting involved in the community in ESO a frustrating chore.

There is a tool for queing to participate in dungeons (instances) with PUGs. The tool is never explained however, you just have to find it yourself. Also the queing I've done takes 30-90 minutes. Some times of the day I'm unable to find PUGs for dungeons at all through this tool.

The community also doesen't seem very inviting towards new players in my experience. I've not seen anyone being very helpful towards each other yet. It's not that it's hostile, just not very friendly either. It may of course be because the Morrowind expansion was just released and all the established players are over there, for all I know.

I cannot fly, levitate or do Khajiit-level jumps in ESO.

Some of the story isn't good. They all pivot around the main story in a very overt way. Like in the old arcade games, where there is a scheming badguy and everything except the end-fight is about thwarting his minions. ""His"" minions are everywhere in ESO: Tamriel, and it's just to much of the same. This is very different from the other Elder Scrolls titles, where the monsters of the land seemed to make up a whole ecosystem on their own, with their own lives and events. It makes the stories that follow the quests boring after 25 hours, and deteriorating rapidly at 50 hours.

Most of the quests are very boring. Fetch me those items or kill me those enemies. For me this may well become a reason for abandoning ESO, they were the reason I never played WoW for more than 20 minutes. In ESO they aren't as bad as the ones I experienced in the other title. It's normally 3-5 targets instead of 20-30. At first it seemed that this type of quests would be few, but it proved to be very frequent. A real pity.

Many of the quests are really stupid. And I mean really really bone 'ead stupid. Like the world-class schemer who's locked himself inside a tomb and left the 3 keys outside the door at different but easy-to-find locations. Makes sense.. It's back to the old arcades, only back then the format required some abstractions. In ESO it's not an abstraction anymore, but a literally really dumb story-element. While there are some straight-forward story elements of the type ""some soldiers have been captured, go rescue them"", nonsense solutions are more common. Fully expect an NPC to suggest solving a problem by shooting her magic rainbow-ray at the moon while farting some magic sunshine. But first you must go find her some rare shrooms at one location, kill 4 zombies at another location, get 3 seashells, then kill an evil monster turtle-boss. Then she can find the spy who's been taken prisoner by the enemy and learn what he knows. And on to the next one.

After a quest is done I get a pat on the back, where the NPC tells me this was all my doing. I'm a hero. It's not that it's wrong, it's just that after a while all quest-givers start to seem like a benevolent school-teacher praising a 7-year old.


The Ugly.
Customer Support are flat-out ignoring support-tickets. 

There are 3-year old bugs that prevent installing or starting up the game for enough players that the forums have several threads each day regarding them. New players enter the forum frustrated, not being able to play. Some are able to get it working through forum advice, and others can't and refund the game as a result. The ugly part is that the developers don't communicate with the players and doesen't even acknowledge the problem. It's been 3 years now, so it seems they just don't find the bugs worth the cost of resolving vs the number of resulting refunds and bad reviews.


Final Words.
I don't know how long ESO will keep me engaged. I'm currently doing the story and exploration, but unless the story starts diversifying in the next area I fear I'll seek other content. Maybe that content can keep my attention, maybe not. Regardless, this is the best MMO I've played despite its shortcomings. The combat is quite good, and the absence of time-sinks count for alot. That said, I've yet to find an MMO that could hold my attention for more than a couple of months.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",tltr eso best massively multiplayer far good retained best element scroll series fantastic sound score fine graphic world feel alive great exploration leveling combat far scroll mile versus environment combat great tho long versus choose grind cap single session strike fancy care leveling participate non endgame versus environment eso not_waste long travel time anywhere already 30 sec minute important detest game fake longviety wasting eso not_in pay win doesen unnaturally inconvenience pay extra inconvenience come spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants questing inconvenience bethesdas scroll game aswell inventory pay unnaturally compensate inconvenience ingredient bag eso pay vanity world immensly open anywhere successful straight questlines tying choose freely storyline follow ignore entirely grind endgame explore mean extremely accessible crafting plesant feel meaningful far crafting quest addition crafting trade pursue career game enjoy crafting ok stealth fun not_innovative mean ad hoc fun groupinng running random difficult fight fun probably combat fast paced player considered ally purpose ability mechanic generally support work open faster grouping dialouge good quest ok bad extremely accessible challenge bit searching research hook enemy treasure scale eso doesen mother haul aspect treasure hunting older scroll title instance original morrowind sneak an_emphasizedcient abandoned fortress coven vampire powerful kill sneak past discover endgame weapon steal leave unique feeling stumbling exploring community tool eso porest massively multiplayer found accessible reaching ppl pug no_tutorial effectively group frankly zero incentive anyway far guild matter blindly accepting guild invite ppl spamming general chat instance found no_credible channel info guild suitable seek ask invite a_emphasized inexperienced unskilled involved community eso frustrating chore tool queing participate dungeon instance pug tool never_explained queing take 30 90 minute time unable pug dungeon tool community doesen inviting towards player not_seen helpful towards not_that hostile not_very friendly course be_emphasizedcause morrowind major addition add feature mechanic released established player cannot_fly levitate khajiit jump eso good pivot overt old arcade game scheming badguy except fight thwarting minion minion everywhere eso tamriel different scroll title monster land ecosystem life event make story follow quest boring 25 hour deteriorating rapidly 50 hour quest boring fetch item kill enemy abandoning eso never_played wow 20 minute eso bad one experienced title normally 3 5 target 20 30 type quest proved frequent real pity quest stupid really_emphasized bone ead stupid world class schemer locked inside tomb left 3 key door different easy location make sense old arcade format required abstraction eso not_an abstraction anymore literally dumb element straight forward element type soldier captured rescue nonsense solution common expect non controlled artificial suggest solving problem shooting magic rainbow ray moon farting magic sunshine rare shrooms location kill 4 zombie location 3 seashell kill evil monster turtle bos spy taken prisoner enemy learn know next a_emphasized task objective given non pat non controlled artificial tell hero not_that wrong task objective given non giver benevolent school teacher praising 7 old ugly customer support flat ignoring support ticket 3 old bug prevent installing starting player forum thread regarding player enter forum frustrated not_being able play able working forum advice others refund result ugly developer communicate player doesen acknowledge problem 3 year bug worth cost resolving v number resulting refund bad review final word long eso engaged currently exploration unless start diversifying next fear seek maybe attention maybe not_regardless best massively multiplayer despite shortcoming combat good absence sink count alot massively multiplayer hold attention couple month

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"don't misunderstand me. i love this game, That being said it is not geared towards new players at all. free content sounds great in theory, but in practice it means every mission underpays severely, and everything you can buy costs a crazy amount of money. there is a tutorial for online, but it has not been updated since the original release in 2013. if a new player starts now, they get endless phone calls telling them to buy multi million dollar properties, with no explanation on how they should get the money, or where they should start. the players who do make enough to buy these properties become leaders of criminal enterprises, which sounds cool, but only means that you have more to spend money on, and now you have a target on your back. For example if you are sourcing crates for CEO warehouses, as soon as u pick up the first crate, the game sends out a session wide ping, and actively tells other players to come kill you and destroy your cargo for cash and rp. how much cash do u get for this, 2 grand and minimal rp, how much of the CEOs money did u just waste, 18 grand at the high end, plus 5000 for each death they suffered at your hand. this does not sound like it would be much of a problem because everyone is in cars on the road, right? WRONG!! let me introduce to you the oppressor mk2. the developers at Rockstar games decide to create the most powerful griefer tool ever created and unleash it for the low, low price of 30$ in real world currency, or 3 million dollars in game. what is the oppressor u ask? the 0ppressor is a flying hoverbike with perfect homing rockets that can not only lock onto cars, but also individual people. really rockstar? why is this a thing? oh and dont get me started on the hacking problem. modders can do whatever they want, whenever they want, to whoever they want, and they cant be stopped, even after you switch lobbies, anything they spawned or change stays with you. modders can force players out of any vehicle, force teleport players into cages, or just spawn explosions and kill everyone at once. how many people are in each lobby? 30 people per lobby is not bad when the game is server based, OH WAIT, when the game re released for next gen they made it p2p. for 30 people anywhere in the world to be allowed in one session, and rockstar thought it was a good idea to use a system designed for 10 at the hard max, and that is with good internet and good netcode, which this game does NOT have. lastly because of how competitive the game is due to the freeroam businesses, this games playerbase is among the most toxic player base i have EVER seen, players grief eachothers businesses just because they are bored. ROCKSTAR I BEG YOU, please make businesses available to work in private sessions so that solo players, and friend groups can play in peace. one last thing, shark cards are bullshit and dont give enough to be worth it, no matter what sales you have at the time. PS THE STORY MODE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Ok so most of the bad reviews on Steam can be summarized thusly:

1. The game was buggy for me (yes, it also crashed for me a few times, and loading times are quite long)
2. Ubisoft integration in Steam is awful (yep, no question)
3. Lack of achievements (I personally don't care about this stuff)
4. Map too big/game too long/too repetitive (I loved the size)
5. Too much bashing, not enough sneaking around (I loved both bashing & sneaking, but admittedly, in the early phases of the game there is more bashing than sneaking. By the end, it's the other way around)

Not since AC Black Flag have I been truly sucked into such an immersive and deep world in the AC franchise. I was a bit disappointed at AC Odyssey, but with Valhalla I really loved nearly everything about this game, and found myself playing just a biiiiit longer than I would have liked. The storylines, the characters, the side-quests, the environment, the challenges... pretty everything was well-done and compelling. As a bonus, the normally-tedious VR aspect of AC games is quite minimized, and not such a buzzkill as in other titles.

I don't deny that there are some *ahem* technical issues with this game, esp. on Steam, but as a true escape to another world, I'm willing to forgive all of that.","Mostly Positive71% of the 17,395 user reviews for this game are positive.",ok bad review summarized thusly 1 buggy yes crashed time loading time long 2 integration awful yep no_question 3 lack achievement personally care stuff 4 big long repetitive loved size 5 bashing not_enough sneaking loved bashing sneaking admittedly early phase bashing sneaking not_since ac black flag truly sucked immersive deep world ac franchise bit disappointed ac odyssey loved nearly found biiiiit longer liked storyline character side quest environment challenge pretty compelling bonus normally tedious vr aspect ac game minimized not_such buzzkill title deny ahem technical issue esp escape world willing forgive

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"I am mainly an offline player so take this review with a grain of salt. 

So far Navigating the menus has been painfully slow. In superstar mode something as simple as hitting ""advance week"" takes 10-15 seconds to register, than it does the sim of the other teams games, than another 10-15 second wait while it appears to just lag, than the week will finally start. Every menu you try and open, ie. settings, roster, upgrades, also have a massive delay after trying to enter them. This doesn't seem like much when you are used to games that navigate quickly or just don't feel like letting time just sitting there looking at a frozen screen add up it can be quite aggravating, especially with the price tag this game came with. 

The gameplay is more of the same from madden. When you hold A to skip through scenes you also end up sitting there waiting at a minimum of 20 seconds, which is almost not even worth it to hold A at that point. The screen freezes so you're basically watching a still frame of something for almost 30 seconds. If they could find a way to fix this lag I would say this is a decent step up from previous years but right now it just seems like more of the same from the madden franchise. 

Another thing I would like to bring up / complain about is that when your team accepts a penalty, the announcers will say really weird stuff like ""Why would they accept that and give the ball back to the offense"", when the penalty was like a pass interference on the defense and the context of their sentence makes absolutely no sense. I also had the announcers tell me that ""The Ravens are coming into this game after their loss to Baltimore last week"" which... I don't even understand how that happens. I also heard that ""The Cowboys defense did an excellent job against the run last week against Dallas"". On another side note in superstar mode it says that all of my stats are 1st in the league on the stat hotbar, however they are definitely not first in the league. ie I have 32 catches at this point and both Travis Kelce and Cooper Kupp have more than 32 catches but it still says I'm first in the league in receptions. I'm sure if I wanted to author a book I could sit here and give more reasons why I am yet again disappointed with madden and its single player experience but this was enough of a rant.

I will happily change my stance if some of these issues get addressed but I know madden has a history of not listening to the community or fixing problems that don't adhere to them making more money so not holding my breath.","Mixed43% of the 5,008 user reviews for this game are positive.",mainly grain salt far navigating menu painfully slow superstar mode simple hitting advance week take 10 15 second register sim team game 10 15 wait appears delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection week finally menu open ie setting roster upgrade massive delay trying enter game navigate quickly letting sitting frozen screen add aggravating especially price tag hold skip scene sitting waiting minimum 20 second not_even worth hold a_emphasizedt screen freeze basically watching frame 30 second fix delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection decent year franchise bring complain accepts penalty announcer weird stuff accept ball offense penalty pas interference defense context sentence make no_sense announcer raven loss baltimore last week understand happens heard cowboy defense excellent last week dallas side note superstar mode say stats 1st league stat hotbar definitely not_first league ie 32 catch travis kelce cooper kupp 32 catch say league reception wanted author book sit reason disappointed single rant happily stance issue addressed history not_listening community fixing problem adhere not_holding breath

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Decent Port : Keyboard & Mouse controls are good. I like that there's no mouse pointer.

Gameplays are fun and need lots of farming. which is fine in mine opinion.
it's like a mix of Monster Hunter style. where you gather materials to upgrade your gears and such. 
the Combat are very flashy and quite (anime-ish) spectacular. 

I don't care much on the Story side. The main campaign story is just very anime trope also Each character comes with a set of their own story called ""fate"" which was read aloud by voice actors plus some individual quests to progress the character.

i like the game. i recommend it.

1144200,Ready or Not,"Game:
The game puts you in the shoes of a SWAT officer leading a team of specialists to neutralize various dangerous situations such as hostage rescue, bomb defusal, and high-risk warrants.

The game features realistic and intense gameplay that requires players to think strategically and work as a team to successfully complete each mission.

One of the standout features of ""Ready or Not"" is its attention to detail, both in terms of gameplay mechanics and the game's overall presentation. The graphics and sound design are impressive, immersing players in the high-stakes world of SWAT operations.

Overall, ""Ready or Not"" is a solid first-person shooter that offers a thrilling and realistic take on the genre. The game's emphasis on teamwork, strategy, and attention to detail make it a must-play for fans of tactical shooters.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"I've been playing this game since it was on the 360 and have enjoyed the content for the most part, aside from the horribly toxic community killing anything that moves, modders ruining every aspect possible, trolls making missions and heists unbearable and so on. I would enjoy this game more if you could do Motor Cycle Club, CEO work, and the other money making portions in private or solo lobbies. Despite all my issues with this game, the long loading times, all of it, I did find it enjoyable with friends. 

And then it happened.

I got hit with a random perma ban for simply playing the game. I honestly don't know what else it could have been aside from a false flag from the ban bot or users not knowing that the MK II Heavy Sniper can have explosive rounds... Maybe players should just leave players alone unless they want a fight? If you wanna fight, don't cry when you get killed, especially since I never liked the PvP in this game, I honestly avoided players at all times cause I got tired of trying to figure out which one was a modder or not. 

So, until my ban gets lifted and Rockstar can figure out that we should be able to fight to get to play this game, I'm leaving this as a negative review and a warning for anyone who wants to play this to play this game, do so at your own risk. Cause that damn bot will not give a shit when it bans you and Rockstar will do nothing to change it.


Edit: Since this review has been gaining some traction, I feel I may want to clear some stuff up, especially now that I'm less frustrated at the joke that is Rockstar support. 

Honestly, I despise cheaters and modders in games where the progression is the grind cause you sell yourself short of the satisfaction of having worked up to your goal and getting the thing you wanted and worked for. Not saying that the stupid prices for stuff in this game is fair, but it does feel satisfying to finally get something... Only to turn around and ask why the hell I needed this thing in the first place. Though I get it. Some people want the instant gratification that comes with mods and modded money, but  for me, that would just help kill the game even more for cause then it begs the question, ""Why bother playing this game in the first place?"" You can get literally anything and everything you want at the push of a button and at no effort on your part other than a Google search. I don't like cheating and modding cause it feels dirty and wrong. Hell, I don't even really use mods in single player games till I've beaten the story to try and get the full experience of the game before going back and seeing what I missed, other options and choices if possible, or just seeing how badly I can break the game. But only in single player games where I'm not messing with other people's experiences, cause I'd honestly hate for someone to do the same to me in return.

That's just my stance on it, I know some people are gonna laugh and scoff at it, but I just thought I'd put this out there. Thanks for talking your time to read this, or at least skim over it.

TL;DR 
Singleplayer is fun and enjoyable as long as the next update doesn't keep resetting your progress.

Online is a battlefield and everyone and their mother will try to kill you. Play at your own risk. Money is gonna be a constant grind to get cause of how overpriced the fun stuff is, but in lobbies, you're probably gonna get blown up no matter what you do. There's ways to make solo lobbies. Keep it close and ready at all times and play with groups of friends whenever possible.","Very Positive86% of the 1,588,848 user reviews for this game are positive.",360 enjoyed aside horribly behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner community killing move modders ruining aspect possible troll mission heist unbearable enjoy motor cycle club ceo portion private solo lobby despite issue long loading time enjoyable friend happened random perma ban simply honestly else aside false flag ban bot user not_knowing mk ii heavy sniper explosive round maybe player leave player alone unless fight wan na fight cry killed especially never_liked versus honestly avoided player time cause tired trying figure modder not_so ban get lifted rockstar figure able fight play leaving negative warning want play play risk cause damn bot not_give shit ban rockstar gaining traction clear stuff especially frustrated joke rockstar support honestly despise cheater modders game progression grind cause short satisfaction worked goal wanted worked not_saying stupid price stuff fair satisfying finally turn ask hell needed instant gratification come mod modded help kill cause begs question bother literally push button no_effort google search cheating modding cause feel dirty wrong hell mod single game till beaten seeing missed option choice possible seeing badly break single game not_messing experience cause honestly hate someone stance gon na laugh scoff thought thanks talking read skim tl dr mode alone interaction player fun enjoyable long next resetting progress online battlefield mother kill play risk gon na constant grind cause overpriced fun stuff lobby probably gon na blown no_matter way solo lobby close ready time play group friend whenever possible

916440,Anno 1800,"I would like to give this game a thumbs up considering I'm a big fan of city builder games and the Anno franchise is excellent at that  but I really don't like the fact that they've decided to remove this game from Steam just because Ubisoft wanted some juicy Epic Games money.

This review, considering the game is unpurchasable right now, is just here so that people lurking my account or looking through my reviews are aware that getting Epic games freebies and purchasing games through their platforms is supporting exclusivity deals for PC and supporting a sub par game store platform which doesn't allow user-made reviews by default and allows devs to toggle off reviews at any time which is not consumer-friendly at all.

I know that Steam having a quasi monopoly on game distribution isn't ideal either but Epic games approach isn't really helping either. Convince your users with a superior platform and your publishers with better deals, not with exclusivity deals.

I might change this review to positive once they'll allow Steam purchases again.","Very Positive82% of the 13,562 user reviews for this game are positive.",thumb considering big fan builder game franchise excellent decided remove wanted juicy epic game considering unpurchasable lurking review aware epic game freebie purchasing game platform supporting exclusivity deal pc supporting sub par platform allow user review default allows to_emphasizedggle review not_consumer friendly quasi monopoly distribution ideal epic game approach helping convince user superior platform publisher deal not_with exclusivity deal positive allow purchase

There is nothing in the game that can't be done with a controller (housing glitches are more challenging). You just need to enable the cross-bar settings. 

Review:
Like any MMO, play with care. Other people are playing with you and it can be addictive. Pace yourself and make good decisions. This game is fun and beautiful with amazing music. If you played FFXI then there will be some callbacks, but this is a different game. Jobs function on rotations instead of TP building (in fact they removed TP as a resource a few years ago). Roles only consist of DPS (DDs), Healers, and Tanks. There are no pure support or pure enfeeble jobs. This game has a serious plot that has a very slow burn start (treat levels 1-50 as a long tutorial). Recently SE has begun converting the dungeons so that they can be played in multiplayer groups or as solo with NPC assistance. This system currently exists for the level 1-57 Solo 4player main scenario dungeons and all main scenario dungeons from level 71-90 as well as one trial. The rollout will continue until the whole catalog of main scenario 4player dungeons will be playable like this, lending new options for players who don't like MMOs or who have limited time/like to play solo. 

Other Interesting Features:
Surprisingly complex photography system built into the game (/gpose)
There are options to enter dungeons without being level synched or meeting pre-requisites to farm items or to take photos
Constantly expanding catalog of glamour choices (ways to make your armor look less awful).
A detailed character creation process (far more so than XI's but less so than PSO2 for reference framing)
A casino with card games, mahjong, chocobo racing, mini games, platforming puzzles, and more
Fun side stories and raid plots
Lots of things to collect (mounts, minions, cards, frames, dances, etc)
Relic weapon building
Alternative dungeons
Multiple challenge difficulties for a lot of endgame content for each expac
Treasure hunting
A detailed and complex housing system (houses, apartments, and instanced rooms)
Crafting and Gathering
NPC Squads you can train and run dungeons with (capped at 60)
Multiple formats for communication and community building
A decent GM call system for when things go wrong - the ToS is serious business here
PvP modes that are set apart from PvE areas
Multiple languages built into the game (choices for voice, text, and interface are all sepperate)
All jobs can be played on one character but you can also have alts (up to 8 per datacenter)
There are accessibility options for players with different forms of colorblindness or limited vision
Players can travel between servers and datacenters in their home server's region (JP, NA, EU, and Oceania) to check markets, play with others, or visit venues/events.
Island Sanctuary casual mode unlocked after the end of Endwalker - it's a farming sim (sort of?)
Unlimited free trial up to level 60, including the Heavensward expansion
30 days of free play with full purchase
Not PtW - the cash shop is only for aesthetic items like costumes, old event rewards, and special mounts
Cross-play with Playstation 4&5 - you have to buy a new copy but the account is the same so you keep all your progress.
It's game break friendly (except housing). The Devs encourage players to take breaks and not to burn out playing. (if you have a house of any size then you need to enter the house at least once every 30 days or it will be demolished via auto-timer)
You can invert your camera settings!
Two new jobs are released every time a new expac releases. Other jobs are adjusted throughout patches and during expac releases. 

Things to be aware of:
This game, while not focused on grinding levels and gear, can be a big time investment and there are grindy things to do if you go looking for them (Relics and achievement hunting)
It's got a serious plot. A lot of players report being very emotional while playing from Shadowbringers on.
There's going to be a big graphics update in 2024 so hardware might be an issue soon for older machines
SE has limited macros to the point where their use in combat is detrimental most of the time.
There are some jobs that are very difficult for disabled players to play and some content may prove to be an issue. For example: the Shadowbringers Alliance Raid Series based on NieR has an extremely bright contrast setting and a lot of explosions which cause a strobing effect.  If you have a photo sensitivity you will not want to unlock this side plot.
The housing market is often referred to as ""housing savage"" because it's very difficult to get a plot. Apartments are available on most servers still and FC Rooms are available to members. If you want a house it's going to be a game of chance with the lottery with bad odds. 
If you miss an in-game event, but want an item from that event, you have to wait a year for it to end up on the cash store.

Conclusion: 
It's fun and it's got a lot to do. Been playing for 10 years. It doesn't quite fill the gap from oldschool XI, but it does other things that make up for it. If you love FF games then this is going to be a great addition to your library. If you love villains, this is 100% the game for you. Research the servers before you make a character. Different servers have different specializations (player led: Crafting, Raiding, PvP, Casual, RP, etc).","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",note controller support not_pay attention partial support page controller housing glitch challenging enable cross bar setting massively multiplayer play care addictive pace good decision fun beautiful amazing music ffxi callback different job function rotation teleport teleportation building removed teleport teleportation resource year ago role consist damage per dd healer tank no_pure support pure enfeeble job serious plot slow burn treat level 1 50 long tutorial recently se begun converting dungeon mode multiple player interact compete real group solo non controlled artificial assistance currently exists 1 57 solo 4player scenario dungeon scenario dungeon 71 90 trial rollout continue catalog scenario 4player dungeon playable lending option player mmos limited play solo interesting feature complex photography built gpose option enter dungeon synched meeting pre requisite farm item photo constantly expanding catalog glamour choice way armor awful detailed creation process far xi pso2 reference framing casino card game mahjong chocobo racing mini game platforming puzzle fun side story large group player tackling difficult challenge plot lot thing collect mount minion card frame dance relic weapon building alternative dungeon multiple challenge difficulty endgame expac treasure hunting detailed complex housing house apartment instanced room crafting gathering non controlled artificial squad train dungeon capped 60 multiple format communication community building decent gm call thing wrong tos serious business versus mode set apart versus environment area multiple language built choice voice text interface sepperate job on_emphasizede alt 8 per datacenter accessibility option player different form colorblindness limited vision player travel server datacenters home computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player region jp na eu oceania check market play others visit venue event sanctuary casual mode unlocked endwalker repeatedly defeating enemy completing task gain resource sim sort unlimited trial 60 including heavensward major addition add feature mechanic 30 day play purchase not_ptw cash shop aesthetic item costume old event reward special mount cross play playstation 4 5 copy progress break friendly except housing encourage player break not_to burn house size enter house 30 day demolished via auto timer invert camera setting job released expac release job adjusted throughout patch expac release thing aware not_focused repeatedly performing action gain resource level gear big investment grindy thing relic achievement hunting serious plot player report emotional shadowbringers big graphic 2024 hardware issue soon older machine se limited macro combat detrimental job difficult disabled player play prove issue example shadowbringers alliance large group player tackling difficult challenge series based nier extremely bright contrast setting explosion cause strobing effect photo sensitivity not_want unlock side plot housing market referred housing savage difficult plot apartment available server fc room available member house chance lottery bad odds miss event event wait cash conclusion fun 10 year fill gap oldschool xi thing love ff game great addition library love villain 100 research server different server different specialization led crafting raiding versus casual rp

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"Having premised that I'm an airline pilot and that I see this product from a professional point of view I will say the following:
I was looking forward for this new title in the series, apart from the highly detailed graphics I was interested in the approach they took with live data weather, flight envelopes, accurate physics representation etc...
I will not rant about the 90Gb download counting towards the playtime since it is an issue already been adressed by steam and I didn't find any game-crashing bugs in my brief sessions.
What I'm more concerned about is the complete lack of functionalities and features, as I said I'm a pilot in real life and the thing that I was most excited about was the A320 which is the airplane that I fly in real life on a daily basis. Unfortunately there are so little functioning bits that I can't consider it a simulator, about 80% of the push-buttons and switches are just for show and you can't use them, the logic of the airplane is completely wrong, the autopilot acts in completely wrong ways, half of the mcdu doesn't even work which is weird since it was quite accurately represented in the previous title. The lack of VR support is odd since it sounds like an obvious piece of the game that is somehow missing, but what really disoriented me was the absence of multi monitor support, a feature that is considered mandatory for this genre.
Maybe it could be explained by the poor optimization, I was quite disappointed since I'm running an i9-9900k, an RTX 2080super on a high-end pc and the game is struggling to keep the fps count above 22FPS on medium without 4K.
For the ones interested in the graphics I ask you: how many times have you explored the world through google earth, I used to do it 10 years ago when I was young, now I don't anymore because frankly I find it quite boring, the quality of the world is not spectacular by any means, sure it's a step up from fsx but still uncanny and very rough.
All in all I can't figure out who the ideal user of this game could be, it's way too simplified for professional use or to run any sort of realistic simulation, too pointless for your typicall gamer, since there are no objectives, campaign, or goals to achieve, and too distant from reality for a student pilot or an amateour to get acquainted with flying.
As it stands right now I can't recommend it due to the aforementioned issues, I suggest the developers to focus a bit more on nailing the essential mechanics and less on polishing the droplets of water on the windshield.","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",premised airline pilot product professional view following forward title series apart highly detailed graphic interested approach took live data weather envelope accurate physic representation not_rant 90gb download counting towards playtime issue already adressed crashing bug brief session m_emphasizedore concerned complete lack functionality feature pilot real life excited a320 airplane fly real life daily basis unfortunately functioning bit consider 80 push button switch logic airplane completely wrong autopilot act completely wrong way half mcdu weird accurately represented title lack vr support odd sound obvious piece somehow missing disoriented absence multi monitor support considered mandatory genre maybe explained poor optimization disappointed running i9 9900k rtx 2080super high pc struggling shooter count 22fps medium 4k one interested graphic ask time explored world google earth 10 year ago young anymore frankly boring quality world not_spectacular mean fsx uncanny rough figure ideal user simplified professional sort realistic pointless typicall gamer no_objectives series connected mission level form storyline goal achieve distant reality student pilot amateour acquainted flying stand recommend due aforementioned issue suggest developer focus bit nailing essential mechanic polishing droplet water windshield

1599340,Lost Ark,"This game started off amazing.  Huge playerbase, everyone was learning the mechs, and the combat was absolutely seamless. No class felt super overpowered and all was right. However, the grind is incredibly tedious. Daily tasks are absolutely mind-numbingly boring and repetitive. I've played almost every day since launch and I wouldn't recommend to start playing now. Inflation is skyrocketing and it's impossible for new players to catch up. Progression  is limited by so many currencies and materials that you'll always encounter some sort of barrier, whether it be gold, silver, shards, or honing materials. Running low on currency? Sell your materials. But wait, if you sell your materials, how will you progress? You can't. 
Want to play a DPS? Good luck, the giga whale who's 40 levels above you will always be accepted first, and you'll be stuck in a waiting lobby praying for a support to join your room. 
Raids are fun, but if one person keeps messing up the mechanics, all fun is lost. Overall, the game was incredible at first, but absolutely piss-poor now.

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"Long story short I like this game, a lot, my favourite game of this year in fact.

I love the story, it's efficient, it gives you all you need to know in order to progress through the game, while you can find more details through scavenged logs from AC wrecks. It's simply brilliant. The story is structured in missions, that depending on your choices can lead to 1 of the endings, neither ending objectively good or bad, they are up to your interpretation.

Graphics wise AC 6 is beautiful, Rubicon is a scarred world, by both a cataclysmic event from its past, and the present war between corporations eager to seize resources and also the population of the planet, sick of being exploited.
The Armored Cores themselves look like industrialised murder machines, heavy, brutal, yet agile and graceful.

Speaking of agile, the gameplay itself is amazing, I haven't had this much freedom of movement in an environment in years, the Armored Cores are the most mobile mechs I've had the pleasure of piloting to this date. Armed to the teeth you can delete waves of enemies while the only others able to provide you with a challenge are level bosses and other AC pilots.
When it comes to this game your battles start in the garage, and end with your enemies defeated. AC6 much like its predecessors puts a great emphasis on being ready for what a mission might throw at you. 

Now, aside from the story AC6 also has a multiplayer component which I haven't touched at all, I am simply not interested in it right now. I might update this review in the future if this changes.

This is my first leap into the Armored Core series let's just say that AC 6 is my gateway drug to the rest of the series. I don't regret buying this game at full price, and if you are into mech or you just want to play a good game give Armored Core 6 a shot.","Very Positive90% of the 50,561 user reviews for this game are positive.",long short favourite love efficient give order progress detail scavenged log ac wreck s_emphasizedimply brilliant structured mission depending choice lead 1 ending neither_ending objectively good bad interpretation graphic wise ac 6 beautiful rubicon scarred world cataclysmic event past present war corporation eager seize resource population planet sick exploited core industrialised murder machine heavy brutal agile graceful speaking agile amazing freedom movement environment year core mobile mechs pleasure piloting armed teeth delete wave enemy others able provide challenge boss ac pilot come battle garage enemy defeated ac6 predecessor put great emphasis ready throw aside ac6 a_emphasized mode multiple player interact compete real component t_emphasizedouched simply not_interested future change leap core series ac 6 gateway drug rest series regret buying price mech play good core 6 shot

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"This game is an interesting one to review, given the conversation around it. As someone who played it two years after release, here are my thoughts on what the game is like in its current state, without any hype or rage attached to it. In short: I was pleasantly surprised. Like, a lot.

I picked this game up for cheap with low expectations. I expected something flawed but fun in a mindless way like Far Cry but I couldn't have been any more wrong. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game made with genuine love and care, with impressive attention to detail. The game was much more immersive and RPG-like than I thought it'd be, and the characters and story were top-notch. It reminded me a lot of Deus Ex and Fallout: New Vegas.

I think this game deserves special praise for being a AAA open world with zero padding. That is, you can ignore all of the side content and railroad through the main quest and finish the game in 10 hours if you really want to. The side quests are also extremely good though, and I was drawn to doing them solely because I found the characters and world fascinating. I think Night City deserves praise as an open world that feels hand-crafted and intrinsically interesting; nothing in it felt like mindless copied-and-pasted content to me.

Of course, your mileage may vary. This game is not GTA or The Elder Scrolls, and I think a lot of the disappointment that people have with this game even now comes from this fact. The driving isn't great, the pedestrian AI is basic, and you can't go into every single building. But I think that's fine. The game is a story-focused RPG and Night City is just there as the pretty backdrop in between missions. The real meat of this game is the narrative and characters.

For years I'd been hearing about how CDPR didn't ""deliver on their promises"" but after playing through the whole thing, I can't really say I feel that way. I had a blast and my only true gripe with the game is that it's unfortunately still riddled with bugs. You won't encounter anything game-breaking, but it is worth mentioning, so keep that in mind. Regardless of that though, I was still pleasantly surprised, and this is probably my favorite game I played this year. Long live Night City.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1085660,Destiny 2,"This is the most FOMO game I've ever played, nothing comes close to this. There is some odd individuals working at Bungie who think removing content is a good idea. Content that people have paid for like previous expansions and seasons. You buy 1 expansion and to get full value from that expansion you'd have to buy all 4 seasons over the year. This is how they siphon your wallet and time. It can total up to 100€. Your time and money is only worth it if you stick around and make this your main game. If you take breaks you might as well not return because you missed out on basically everything. 

Destiny could have twice the amount of content and a lot more variety in past seasonal content, strikes, dungeons, open world etc. Having to do bounties, which are already annoying because they force you to equip certain weapons/classes, is a lot less fun when you have to play the same strike 3 times in a row.

- No content - because the codebase got rewritten for MP which is coming out soon. This should pick back up after the bugs are worked out of MP.
- No trade - Alright, this is the big one. But in all honestly, I like the direction they've taken. If you want a trade-focused ARPG, PoE is literally 2 clicks away on steam. It really is that easy. ""But PoE is too grindy!"" yeah no shit chief, welcome to any economy focused ARPG. ""But I wanna be able to share with friends!"" And you'll be able to do that with the party-trade system.

1599340,Lost Ark,"The best way to describe Lost Ark is probably to say that it is a mix of a ARPG and a MMORPG. It plays like the a typical ARPG but has all the features and a huge open world like most MMORPG’S have. It’s a fantastic mix which works out better than I could have imagined.   
Since Lost Ark was already released in other regions quite a while ago, we directly got a further progressed version of the game, which means it is packed with content and features to the brim, which will keep you easily occupied for hundreds of hours.    
      
[u][b]Story[/b][/u]      
Evil bad = You big Savior.     
In all fairness, Lost Ark’s Story isn’t bad, they clearly care for it and put a lot of effort into it, it’s a good red line thought the world, garnished with many cutscene and details.   
   
[u][b]Gameplay & Game World[/b][/u]  
Lost Ark plays like your typical MMORPG. You run through zones, kill stuff, do minor work like walking 2 meters for an NPC to carry something, the classics. It definitely won’t win an award for innovative Quest and Level Up design.
But they could with one the Game World. Lost Ark is huge. The game is separated into different continents which serve as their own progression arc. The continents are separated by a vast ocean filled with countless Islands of varying sizes, all filled with things to do. You cross the oceans with either your own ship to explore them freely or ocean liners that connect the continents as a way of quick travel.
Lost Ark isn’t fully open world thou, each area is separated from the next with a loading screen. 
In contrast to most MMORGP’s on the market, Lost Ark’s movement and combat controls more like an Action RPG, like Titan Quest Diablo, Path of Exile and so on. 
It definitely needs a bit to get used to it, especially when you are doing your first dungeons, but afterwards, it works like a charm.  
      
[u][b]Classes[/b][/u]    
Lost Ark offers 15 different Classes to choose from which are sadly gender locked. The Classes cover everything from Tanks to Supporters, Mages, Classes which use guns, Assassins, Melees with giant weapons. There is something for everyone.
On top of that, Lost Ark has a fantastic character creator you can lose yourself in. 
    
[u][b] Graphic and Audio[/b][/u]
Lost Ark looks stunningly beautiful, in every corner of the world, every map, every dungeon is filled with details. The game is a couple of years old by now, but it can absolutely keep up. I haven’t played a game in a long while that made me fall in love with its world so much. 
The same can be said about the music, skill sounds and general audio design of the game. 
    
[u][b]Pros & Cons[/b][/u]   
+Vast World, tons of Dungeons and Raids, Islands
+Lot’s of Classes
+An incredible amount of content and game systems
+Great Char Creator
+Smooth, easy to learn gameplay
+Good Tutorials  
        
-Some p2w in the in game shop
-Endgame involves a lot of daily task (I don’t mind that, but I am sure some will)
-Rng based enchanting system, which can result in a ton of grind and slower progression     
     
[u][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/u]   
Lost Ark is a great MMORPG to get yourself lost in for countless hours. If you enjoy the genre and are up to try something a bit different or just on the look for a new game to play, Lost Ark definitely is a great choice. And thanks to it being free 2 play, you won’t lose anything besides some time if it turns out to not be for you.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",best describe probably mix a_emphasizedrpg massively multiplayer online role play typical arpg feature huge open world massively multiplayer online role fantastic mix work imagined already released region ago directly progressed version mean packed feature brim easily occupied hundred hour evil bad big savior fairness s_emphasizedtory bad clearly care effort it_emphasized good red line thought world garnished cutscene detail world play typical massively multiplayer online role zone kill stuff minor walking 2 meter non controlled artificial carry classic definitely win award innovative task objective given non design world huge separated different continent serve progression arc continent separated vast ocean filled countless island varying size filled thing cross ocean ship explore freely ocean liner connect continent quick travel open world thou separated next loading screen contrast mmorgp market movement combat control action role titan task objective given non diablo path exile definitely need bit especially dungeon afterwards work charm class offer 15 different class choose sadly gender locked class cover tank supporter mages class gun assassin melee giant weapon top fantastic creator lose graphic audio look stunningly beautiful corner world dungeon filled detail couple year old long fall love world music skill sound general audio design pro con vast world ton dungeon raid island class incredible system great char creator smooth easy learn good tutorial p2w shop endgame involves daily task mind rng based enchanting result ton grind slower progression final thought great massively multiplayer online role countless hour enjoy genre bit different play definitely great choice thanks 2 play lose besides turn not_be

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) is my nomination of 2020's “Game of the Year Award”, and now my nomination of 2022's ""Labor of Love Award"". It’s an instant classic, even for a title that is one of the longest-running PC video game series of all time! I have experienced real life flight training, so many years ago, and to some degree it was inspired by this flight simulator. One of my first “games” was the release in 1980, by subLOGIC, of a version of Flight Simulator for the TRS-80 Model I. Flight Simulator was licensed to Microsoft, in 1982 for the IBM PC, and marketed as Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.00. That was 40 years ago, and the 40th Anniversary Edition update continues to add amazing features to an already incredible game.

Sometimes a product comes along that changes everything about its genre. MSFS is groundbreaking as much as it breathtaking. In a year of shelter-in-place and lockdown, MSFS is an escape, a truly immersive environment to be explored, literally the entire world in your hands with amazing graphics! From pilot with or without autopilot (essentially a passenger), from inside the aircraft or viewed from a chase plane, to flying a remote camera drone. Day or night, with real time and real-life traffic and weather to enhance the realism, and beautiful realistic 3D modeled cities and landmarks to become the “prey” to be “hunted”. All while learning and experiencing what it is to be a pilot, from IFR to VFR and from single-engine light aircraft to the world's prominent passenger jets.

I don’t wish to sugar coat that everything is sunshine and rainbows with MSFS at this stage of development. Among its many flaws are that it is not easy to install, to configure, or to learn. That the better your flight controls are, the more likely you will enjoy it. Performance and crashes seem to crop up and affect people randomly. The AI created scenery is not perfect and can appear from blurred and flat to giant and blocky landscaping in areas. Those looking for challenges and goals rather than a pure sandbox might be disappointed. Still, with some rough edges, it is hard to image anything better. And, the future is promising, as witnessed by the various patches and two world updates thus far. 

So, go take Cessna 152 or ICON A5, for example, and explore our world. Find your home, the city you were born in, watch Giraffes wandering Blue Nile in Africa, land in the Forbidden City in China, fly under the Golden Gate Bridge, see the Pyramids of Giza, never thought you would visit Dubai or Hong Kong, never dreamed you could see Mount Everest or Mount Fuji, indulge your curiosity about Stonehenge or the Sydney Opera House, you can fly into a hurricane or up into space. Literally thousands of amazing places to explore. Ultimately, I absolutely recommend MSFS, as it is phenomenal!","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",msfs nomination 2020 award nomination 2022 labor love award instant classic title longest running pc video series experienced real life training year ago degree inspired game release 1980 sublogic version trs 80 model licensed 1982 ibm pc marketed 1 00 40 year ago continues add amazing feature already incredible product come along change genre msfs groundbreaking breathtaking shelter lockdown msfs escape truly immersive environment explored literally world hand amazing graphic pilot autopilot essentially passenger inside aircraft viewed chase plane flying remote camera drone night real real life traffic weather enhance realism beautiful realistic 3d modeled city landmark prey hunted learning experiencing pilot ifr vfr single engine light aircraft world prominent passenger jet wish sugar coat sunshine rainbow msfs stage development flaw not_easy install configure learn control enjoy performance crash crop affect randomly ai created scenery not_perfect appear blurred flat giant blocky landscaping area challenge goal rather pure sandbox disappointed rough edge hard image future promising witnessed patch world update far cessna 152 icon a5 example explore world home born watch giraffe wandering blue nile africa land forbidden china fly golden gate bridge pyramid giza never_thought visit dubai hong kong never_dreamed mount everest mount fuji indulge curiosity stonehenge sydney opera house fly hurricane space literally thousand amazing place explore recommend msfs phenomenal
578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"[h1]UPDATE 3: Remember ""FIX PUBG""? Yeah, me neither. [/h1]

Bluehole promised to FIX PUBG, and they had shown us a roadmap of all the fixes and changes they would make before the end of October. Surprise surpise... we are nearing the end of October and they haven't done much at all. The community is losing hope and the devs keep on apologizing for the terrible servers and in-game bugs.

Shame..

------

[h1]UPDATE 2: The ""FIX PUBG"" Update[/h1]

Bluehole have just released the 12.7GB ""FIX PUBG"" update, with quite a lot of performance improvements and gameplay changes. They are actually doing things! The review shall stay the same, atleast for now. If they continue with the improvements and make the game stable, maybe things will change.

""FIX PUBG"" is appearantly a campaing they're having, aimed at... fixing the game.
You can find the roadmap [url=https://fix.pubg.com/]here[/url]

------

[h1]UPDATE:[/h1]
There have been a few updated recently which patched things up a bit, but only a bit. Server performance is still the same and all that.

------

[h1]ORIGINAL REVIEW[/h1]

Optimizing the game? Nah.... Fixing networking issues? Nah.... Fixing bugs? Nah..... Better servers? Hell no...

Adding greedy microtransactions that provide no real value? Yes!

Wrongly suing the competition? Hell yes!

Porting the game to console in a hillariously broken state for more money? Fuck yeah!

----------

But that doesn't mean the game has zero good about. I'll just lay most of the stuff down here in a pro and con style:

+ Engaging battle royale mode
+ Incredibly fun with friends
+ 3 large scale maps
+ A variety of guns and customization
+ Semi-weekly updates, though most of them aren't really anything significant

- Wonky movement, especially jumping (vaulting is a great addition however)
- Optimization issues, even on some high-spec setups
- Server issues, desync and rubberbanding
- Lootboxes (most can only be opened by buying a key)
- Inferior Event Pass design to other games
- Ignorant Map Playlist design

- High amounts of cheater reports. I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me.
- The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing. (Suing the competition, ... adding new content instead of fixing the current game, porting the game to console in a broken state for that sweet microsoft money, ...)

---------

Conclusion: The game has massive red flags, but when it works, it works really well. Hell, even I still play it, but I wouldn't necesseraly ""recommend"" it to anyone new to the game, not right now.","Mixed58% of the 2,306,037 user reviews for this game are positive.",3 remember fix pubg yeah neither_h1 bluehole promised fix pubg shown roadmap fix change october surprise surpise nearing october community losing hope apologizing terrible server bug shame 2 fix pubg bluehole released 12 7gb fix pubg performance improvement change thing shall stay atleast continue improvement stable maybe thing fix pubg appearantly campaing aimed fixing roadmap url http fix pubg com url updated recently patched thing bit bit computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player performance original optimizing nah fixing networking issue nah fixing bug nah server hell no_adding greedy microtransactions provide no_real value yes wrongly suing competition hell yes porting console hillariously broken state fuck yeah zero good lay stuff a_emphasized highly skilled experienced con style engaging battle royale mode incredibly fun friend 3 large scale map variety gun customization semi weekly update significant wonky movement especially jumping vaulting great addition optimization issue high spec setup computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player issue desync rubberbanding lootboxes opened buying key inferior event pas design game ignorant playlist design high amount cheater report admit never_faced actual cheater others fortunate simply not_having clue suing competition adding fixing porting console broken state sweet microsoft conclusion massive red flag work work hell play necesseraly recommend not_right

1203620,Enshrouded,"In short: Valheim had a baby with Zelda BOTW with a little sprinkle of Elden Ring.

Game, for being a very young EA, is beautifully rich with plenty of content. The map is ""only"" half done, which will still keep you occupied for 50ish hours, which will be expanded and developed in the future.

It's a very diverse exploration action rpg game with a simple yet solid building and crafting system. 

Difficulty wise it's pretty easy as the difficulty ramps up so does your power scaling so don't expect a Dark Souls challenge, yet some combats still feel rewarding.

252490,Rust,"I start.
Spawn in.
Nude, cold, helpless.
I come to a castle looking structure (obviously player made)
I go up to it and say the oblivious ""Hello!? I'm friendly""
Meet some friendly guys out of the castle
They inject me with a green and white pen looking thing
Puts my health to 100
I get hit by a morningstar (or a mace if you want me to be correct)
100HP>20HP
""You are our slave now""
I accept my duty, as if I leave, I am sure of my death
They show me the contents of a box outside of the ""slave quaters""
I find 7 human skulls and 3000 bone fragments..
I think to myself ""Oh god, oh god, oh god.. Good one TeT look what you've walked yourself into this time""
I cannot call them by their steam profile names... I must call them masters or my death will be certain.
Masters say ""We will now mark you as one of our slaves""
One of them bring out a longsword
I fall.. Bleeding, screaming..
All of them laughing hysterically
""You're life is now ours, and we now own you""
I accept my fate..
They take me inside the ""slave quarters""
Wooden structure outside their stone castle
They show me to a 2 triangle foundation room.. Enough to fit a sleeping bag and thats it.
""This is your room""
They hand me a sleeping bag... I put it down in the small room.
They bring me out and tell me to wait
I wait for 15 minutes
They come back with a metal hatchet and a Metal Pickaxe.
""You get resources until we say""
I go out and come back each time they say.
*3 Hours of slaving for them*
They say ""Come inside the slave quarters now!""
I am scared.. I don't think ive done anything wrong.. I mean.. All they fed me was raw human.. I've had to cook it myself..
I ready for death
I clutch my fists as hard as I can...
""Settle, slave..""
""We wanted to thank you.""
""You have been the best slave yet, and yet you have got us enough materials to make our weapons and armors""
""And you keep coming back like a lost puppy""
....
I am utterly surprised..
""Come slave""
I follow what I think was the leader..
They open the door into the castle
I say ""I cannot go into masters den... That is for masters!""
They turn to me.. guns pointed..
I think to myself ""I am dead.. You are a complete fu....""
""Our den is now your den also.. We are inviting you into out lives.. No more slavery, you have proven yourself worthy""
I stay quiet, I'm not fully convinced..
They take me to the top of their castle
""Look at this view, Slave""
I look, it is free open land, the grass sways with the push of the wind, leaves rustle..
""You had many opportunities to leave and never come back, slave.""
""But yet you came back..""
""We will now call you by your real name""
All of them together in collaboration ""T-E-T""
""TET!""
""Will you join us into our endevours until death""
Woah, I think.. I can't belive this..
""I will follow you to the realms of hell, I will follow you to the end of the world, I will carry you over my shoulders for whatever how long miles, even if you have the slightest amount of luck to live.. You are my masters, I shall obey, I shall forever bow down to you""
""Come... TeT""
They take me to the loot room..
They hand me an AK.. Black hoodie, pants, boots, metal chestplate and mask..
""I can't take this""
""You are us now, embrace the look""
""Th..aaank you masters..""
""You don't have to call us masters anymo...""
Rocket hits the building..
Silence between us
I say ""To the death""
All of them ""To the death""
I freak out... I've never been in a real life battle before..
I spot 6
We are out matched..
Masters rush out will guns blazing..
They take out 2..
They are screaming their lungs out
I take deep breaths.. Heart is pounding..
I run out spraying for my life..
I hear the satisfying sounds on headshots of the enemies..
As I see their lifeless bodies limp to the ground 
70% Bleeding.. 
10HP..9..8
Masters still screaming
""I have you masters!""
I get them all up
""I will remember you all to the end..""
""My wounds need tending.. But this is too late""
I fall, screaming..
Masters scream
""YOU WILL BE FINE TET, PLEASE GET UP""
I see darkness settle in over my eyes
I just remembered the times I had with these guys
It's like life was flashing before me..
I hear the pounding of feet on the grass coming towards me
Darkness has now taken me
I am now free like the grass swaying in the wind..
I am now the leaves that rustled in the trees
""No..No...No... This can't happen!"" In a deep depressing tone
I dreamt of him taking my facemask off and him holding me against his chest, crying...
""Come back TeT, this is not your end! Please come back like the old days""
I say with the lastness of my breath
""These are the new days.. Master.. I am free...... Th..a..nk you.""
Masters are crying ""Nooooo! Please come back, please, please! PLEASE!""
""You can't go yet! We have places to explore! Enjoy food together! Carry each other to the end!""

""Till death""

Thank you masters.. Too bad I couldn't get your name
It was fun..

To the end?

Would absolutely buy this game for the memories.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"In short, the game is great but I definitely cannot recommend it in its current state.  

The game has a novel idea that is engaging and fun if you enjoy the ""idle"" aspect of games.  It does many things right and makes it easy to engage with it as much as you'd like.  It's an idea that could be truly amazing when fully realized.

Unfortunately, the developer seems to be entirely focused on adding new content than addressing existing issues. Normally I would say that's part of development but in this game's case, it is actively detrimental.  There is too much to list here, but the big three are:

- Bugs that have existed since the game's release (2 years, not on Steam) where entire features don't work at all.
- Inconsistencies within the game's mechanics that are not explained.  Meaning you can pursue certain bonuses (e.g., bonus xp gain for ""all skills"") that don't do what they say (in reality - ""...except for these 4 skills just because"" ).  This is usually due to updates outgrowing existing content.  The game does *not* explain that.
- In a similar vein, some mechanics have no effect at all but are presented as if they do (certain class talents don't do anything, various modifiers aren't factored in, etc.)...which are usually intended.

These ^ are mostly an issue because this leaves the majority of players in a spot where they find themselves having invested in xyz things but ultimately have no way to undo that process once they realize what's wrong; respec options in the game are very limited. The only way you would know is if you're actively engaged in the various communities (Reddit, Discord, etc.).  Some folks won't find this an issue, I'm sure, but to me this is too detrimental to a playerbase for a developer to actively ignore via development or discussion.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",short great definitely cannot_recommend state novel idea engaging fun enjoy aspect game thing make easy engage idea truly amazing realized unfortunately developer entirely focused adding addressing existing issue normally development actively detrimental big three bug existed release 2 year not_on feature inconsistency mechanic not_explained meaning pursue certain bonus e g bonus xp gain skill reality except 4 skill usually due update outgrowing existing not_explain similar vein mechanic no_effect presented certain class talent modifier factored usually intended mostly issue leaf majority player spot invested xyz thing no_way undo process realize wrong respec option limited actively engaged community reddit discord folk issue detrimental playerbase developer actively ignore via development discussion

381210,Dead by Daylight,"NOTE: This game was gifted to me by someone affiliated with the developers.

What's even more fun than chopping people up with your homemade machete while they're stuck in your bear traps? Well.. chasing down your friends with a chainsaw while you're on TeamSpeak with them and screaming ""COME HERE LITTLE PIGGY!"". 

This game is heavily based on the old slasher movies. There is one killer and four (stupid) teenage survivors. The survivors' goal is to fix all generators, open one of the two exits (or hidden trapdoor if you're last alive) and escape. The killer's goal is *surprise!* killing all of these stupid kids and hanging them on hooks to offer them to his Lord and Savior Satan AKA ""The Entity"". The kids can't defend themselves against the 7 foot tall maniac, but they can use the environment to their advantage. You can hide in lockers (Outlast!), throw piles of wood behind you to block the killer's path or stun him when he's right next to it when you throw it down and you can use the mist in combination with rocks, trees etc. to your advantage to hide behind aswell. The only thing that's missing is a black guy, because they are always supposed to die first in slasher flicks, but oh well.. Future DLC?

There is five different items that you can unlock as a survivor and these will help you win. They are: the med kit, toolbox, map, flashlight and Skeleton Key. The med kit lets you heal people faster, while the toolbox makes you fix generators quicker or can let you destroy hooks to ruin the killer's day. The flashlight can be used as a flashbang towards the killer. By shining into his eyes for 1 or 2 seconds he will be temporarily blinded and anyone who he might be carrying on his shoulder will be dropped. And then there's the map. In my opinion the most useless item in the game, because it shows you what generators have been previously used by highlighting them through the walls for a short amount of time. If you have add-ons for it (I'll get to those in a bit) then you could also see the killer's aura, aswell as the exit locations. And then finally there is the mysterious Skeleton Key. Not much is known about this yet. I've played for about 40 hours at the moment of writing but I haven't gotten one of these yet; I have got add-ons for it however. Apparently the Skeleton Key lets you unlock the hidden trapdoor on the map after only 2 generators have been fixed already (while normally it will only open when you're last alive) and then you and all your friends can just jump through it for an insta-win. Don't take my word for that though.

Besides items there is a lot more to leveling and progression. All four survivors and all three killers have their own ""progression tree"" which can further developed with Bloodpoint, which are gained from finishing public games. Every survivor and every killer has his/her own unique perks and progression tree. You can keep progressing until you're level 50 and then you can go ""Prestige"" which will reset you back to level 1 and gives you a random bloodied cosmetic item for that character. All your perks and items get taken but you'll keep your 4 perk slots.

Besides the Leveling System there is also a Ranking System for public games. You start at rank 20 and you can work yourself up all the way to rank 1. Survivors and killers each have their own online rank, but unlike the levels which are tied to each different character, your rank is only tied to a category: either survivors or killers. If you get enough points you will receive a ""crystal"" or even two if you manage to get the max amount of points. As soon as you collect 3 of these ""crystals"" you will rank up. At some point you'll need more than 3 and this amount keeps increasing the higher you get. If you don't get enough points in a match you will lose a ""crystal"" and when you're back to 0 crystals you'll lose your rank again. Right now there's not really a purpose for these ranks, besides showing others how brave and pro you are. You don't get matched with the same ranks and there's no unlocks or whatsoever, besides a colored number showing above your head. Also, you cannot earn bloodpoints or rank up in private games. All of this requires you to play with random people.

We already talked about items, but there's a lot more to your loadout. So, let's talk some more about add-ons, perks and offerings, shall we? There is add-ons, which are additional smaller items which you can attach to your main item to make it better, such as adding more charges to your med kit or being able to use the flashlight for a longer duration of time. Then there's offerings. Offerings can only be used once at the start of the match to get a one-time advantage over the killer. Such as all four survivors starting together or receiving 50% more Bloodpoints for the duration of that game. And finally there's perks. Each character has its own unique perks that help them in the game, linked to their personality and profession. Dwight is the Leader and so if you stay close to him you will repair the generators quicker. Meg is the silent cat girl who is quicker and more silent than the others. Claudette is the botany trained healer, who is better at healing others and Jack is the traps expert who can easily take care of and destroy traps quickly.

Now that we've talked about the survivors, let's talk about the killers. There is three different killers, each with their own unique weapon and skill. The Trapper can place down bear traps around the map that you can get stuck in and make you an easy pray for him. The Wraith can go nearly invisible as he pleases and suddenly pop up behind you to scare you like crazy. And the Hillbilly has a chainsaw that he can rev up to go into a crazed murdering state and come chasing after you while he holds his chainsaw above his head. Oh yeah and that also instantly downs you if it hits you.. I wonder what killer is going to be added next. I can't wait to chase people with a big, crazed, evil clown with a sledgehammer. Also real slashers like Jason Voorhees or Michael Meyers might be cool to see, in their respective areas, but I'm not sure if they can get the rights for that.

It also seems as if there has been made an area for each different killer. There are 3 different areas, each with 4 different maps. There is the Car Junkyard (linked to the Trapper), the abandoned Coal Factory with a broken bell tower (linked to the Wraith) and the old farm, full of the fantastic cornfields and more (linked to the Hillbilly).

All with all it's a really fun game, both to play with strangers, aswell as to play with friends, which I recommend the most. There is currently still some missing features however, like being able to play with your friends in public games, or some kind of chat for public games, but it's a really unique game with a lot of potential! The developers are promising a new update atleast once every week, so can't wait to see what's in store for us. I love unique games and I love horror movies, so this game is just perfect for me. It's both fun to play as a survivor aswell as the killer.

Things that can be improved or should be added:
- You cannot play in a public game with your friends and there's no bloodpoints to be earned in private games.
- There is not a single kind of chat mechanic. No text chat, voice chat or even quick chat. So you can't tell your fellow survivors that they can take you off the hook cause the killer is not camping you.
- Talking about that.. hookcamping, really ruins the fun!
- Several bugs that break the game such as being stuck on the killer's shoulders until one of you leaves.
- More rewards for the ranking system, aswell as balancing it so that you can rank up more easily.
- Preventions for leaving the game early and you losing crystals for that.
- A larger variety of maps (abandoned carnival, huge manor, a village or snow mountains sound like cool ideas).
- Voice acting for the killers.","Very Positive80% of the 512,225 user reviews for this game are positive.",note gifted someone affiliated developer fun chopping homemade machete stuck bear trap chasing friend chainsaw teamspeak screaming piggy heavily based old slasher movie killer four stupid teenage survivor survivor goal fix generator open exit hidden trapdoor last alive escape killer goal surprise killing stupid kid hanging hook offer lord savior satan aka entity kid defend 7 foot tall maniac environment advantage hide locker outlast throw pile wood block killer path stun next throw mist combination rock tree advantage hide aswell missing black supposed die slasher flick oh future downloadable additional released initial launch five different item unlock survivor help win med kit toolbox flashlight skeleton key med kit let heal faster toolbox make fix generator quicker destroy hook ruin killer flashlight flashbang towards killer shining eye 1 2 second temporarily blinded carrying shoulder dropped useless show generator previously highlighting wall short add ons bit killer aura aswell exit location finally mysterious skeleton key not_much known 40 hour moment writing gotten add ons apparently skeleton key let unlock hidden trapdoor 2 generator fixed already normally open last alive friend insta win t_emphasizedake word besides item leveling progression four survivor three killer progression tree developed bloodpoint gained finishing public game survivor killer unique perk progression tree progressing 50 prestige reset 1 give random bloodied cosmetic perk item taken 4 perk slot besides leveling ranking public game rank 20 rank 1 survivor killer online rank unlike level tied different rank tied category survivor killer point receive crystal manage max point soon collect 3 crystal rank 3 keep increasing higher point lose crystal 0 crystal lose rank not_really purpose rank besides showing others brave highly skilled experienced matched rank no_unlocks whatsoever besides colored number showing cannot_earn bloodpoints rank private game requires play random already talked item loadout talk add ons perk offering shall add ons additional smaller item attach adding charge med kit able flashlight longer duration offerings_emphasized advantage killer four survivor starting receiving 50 bloodpoints duration finally perk unique perk help linked personality profession dwight leader stay close repair generator quicker meg silent cat quicker silent others claudette botany trained healer healing others jack trap expert easily care destroy trap quickly talked survivor talk killer three different killer unique weapon skill trapper bear trap stuck easy pray wraith nearly invisible plea suddenly pop scare crazy hillbilly chainsaw rev crazed murdering state chasing hold chainsaw oh yeah instantly down hit wonder killer next wait chase big crazed evil clown sledgehammer real slasher jason voorhees michael meyers cool respective area not_sure right different killer 3 different area 4 different map car junkyard linked trapper abandoned coal factory broken bell tower linked wraith old farm fantastic cornfield linked hillbilly fun play stranger aswell play friend recommend currently missing feature able play friend public game kind chat public game unique potential developer promising atleast week wait love unique game love horror movie perfect fun play survivor aswell killer thing improved cannot_play public friend no_bloodpoints earned private game not_a single kind chat mechanic no_text chat voice chat quick chat t_emphasizedell fellow survivor hook cause killer not_waiting strategic location ambush defeat player enemy talking hookcamping ruin fun bug break stuck killer s_emphasizedhoulders leaf reward ranking aswell balancing rank easily prevention leaving early losing crystal larger variety map abandoned carnival huge manor village snow mountain sound cool idea voice acting killer

381210,Dead by Daylight,"*EDIT: I fear my review may have been too long to keep some people's attention all the way through as a popular misconception seems to be rising. I'll try and simplify it.

1) A report was filed against me for Griefing. 
2) I contacted Customer Care to see what had happened.
3) I got no answers, no real assistance, and, ultimately, was flat out ignored.
4) I removed the game from my account.

This sequence must be observed. I did not receive a report against me and refuse to acknowledge Behaviour again on that premise. It was the way the CS department handled me that left me with no other choice.


*UPDATE (06/19/2019): For informative purposes, the Ticket I submitted is still OPEN with 8 days of no contact from them. 
*UPDATE (06/28/2019): The Ticket is still OPEN after 17 days with no attempt to give assistance.
*UPDATE (07/04/2019): The Ticket is still OPEN after 23 days with no attempt to give assistance.
*UPDATE (07/04/2019): I have sent another Ticket as a follow up to the last two in hopes of discussing this matter again. The Ticket was picked (by Ian) within FOUR minutes, who moved it into the abandoned one. 
*UPDATE (07/05/2019): It is now 24 hours with no response from BHVR. It seems my Ticket has met the fate of the first two and is being ignored.
*UPDATE (07/08/2019): The first Ticket is OPEN after 27 days, and the second Ticket is OPEN after 4 days, with no attempt to reply on either.
*UPDATE (07/11/2019): Customer Service has responded back to my Follow Up Ticket sent on the 4th. This new agent (Thomas) restated exactly what Ryuti had said a month prior. I responded explaining that I still needed clarification. 
*UPDATE (07/12/2019): Customer Service (Thomas) has responded again! While he did not expand upon the previous statements, he has stated that they cannot ""disclose specific details of any incidents leading to [my] ban to protect the identity of any players involved."" 
This is, I take it to be, the end of the road. In summary, it took 30 days to inform me ""you're banned for reasons we won't explain"". Given that BHVR has not displayed any meaningful remorse (aside from Thomas' sudden attentiveness, which I still appreciate) for their mishandling of my issue, I cannot change my recommendation at this time and continue to urge all people considering purchasing their game to exercise caution and seek other games instead.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


As heartbreaking as this is to do people have to be aware of what could happen to them. The other day I was issued a 24 hour ban for Griefing. I was absolutely stunned when I tried to log in and saw that message. This had to be a mistake. I contacted the Customer Support right away.

It turns out that in one match that I had, though I'm not sure which one exactly, a fellow survivor filed a report against me. The only match that came to mind was one where a Meg player tried to provoke me in post game chat and, failing that, tried to add me as a friend on Steam. I obviously did not accept. Regrettably, whoever handles these reports failed to perform due diligence and investigate properly and, for the first time in all my years of playing any video game, I was actually issued a penalty.

Not that this means much more than words, but I like to think of myself as one of the least toxic, mean-spirited people around. I have never in all my life, in any game, been banned for any reason. I am always very careful to follow the rules of a game most meticulously. I don't even participate in less desirable customs like taunting Killers by doing the weird Butt Dance at the end of matches because I don't want to hurt someone's feelings.

The person who handled my support ticket, Ryuti, barely answered any question I had; instead regurgitating some cookie cutter reply that didn't even seem to specifically apply to the situation I was in. The whole conversation between him and I gave strong feelings of an immense language barrier, like I was trying to communicate with Google Translate. After I tried to clarify his answer, he just stopped responding and the ticket has remained Open with no activity for over 24 hours. 

I eventually filed another ticket, this time as a formal complaint about how I was treated and how my old ticket was abandoned. Exactly THREE minutes later, a second agent (Ian) picked up my ticket (yay!)

...and dumped it right into the old ticket. No reply. No acknowledgement. Nothing.

And that's it. That's the state it is left off in. 

Under no circumstances can I recommend this company be given actual money. I don't even mean that from a ""I'm mad and trying to get back at them!"" kind of way. This whole situation has completely depressed me, as I have never before actually seen a company disregard a genuine customer before.

I am 28

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Before I get into this review I'd like to adress a situation with AC3.

AC3 followed the story of Revelations where it ended off, Desmond woke up from his coma and was off to another new adventure.
In AC3 you overall got also introduced to a new Assassin Connor which most people call him uninteresting or lacking in terms of what Ezio had in store for you, but you shouldn't really put much blame on AC3 because of the Assassin design and what his atitude was in general.
Connor in my honest opinion was a brutal as hell Assassin, a loving and caring person when it came to his natural enviormeant the Village and the Homestead, but a literall devil on the battlefield, characther design and atitude in general were pretty good and didn't lack in anything if you understood the point of his characther overall.
AC3 overall was a pretty great game can't be top tier like AC2 or BF but it was a pretty great game in general.

Now for BF.

BF is either Great, Terific, Amazing, Glorious or God tier. It's pretty much an undescribable game for me really I enjoyed the hell out of it as a fan of the franchise for a long time, the overall core gameplay of it was smooth and fast paced and it was just an adrenaline rush in its own ways.

The game offered us a better and more extende Naval Combat system which we have been asking for from AC3 and its probably the most fun you could also have in the game, the game in general is mainly covered 60% sea and 40% land making the Naval Combat one of the more important aspects of the game.
The Naval Combat in BF is far superiour than what other Pirate/Ship battle games have and its quite alot of fun to just destroy the hell out of some giant fleets.

Now overall the story and characther of the game.
In BF the story picks off some time latter from AC3.

Overall your characther is unknown as he is some kind of employe working for Abstergo as a double agent of some sorts since you technicaly share intel with the Assassins troughout the game in the modern day missions of the game ( Shaun and Rebeca ) overall the modern day segments are covered in a first person perspective and are just a bit odd, fun but odd, the fun thing you could really have in the modern day segments is just randomly collecting some QR codes and hacking PC's, yes hacking is a thing in this game, the hacking is pretty fun altough it repeats the same short minigame of either switching frequencies, turning a line from point A to point B in order to unlock the file or just a simple cracking the firewall type of game, pretty short but they are also pretty fun in general.

The story of BF takes before the actions of AC3 so that means your way behind playing as the grandfather of Connor Kenway.
Captain Edward James Kenway or as people called him that started off as a privateer at the begining of the game, overtaken for the lust of having a better life, greed is his main priority he takes as he pleases and doesn't give a rotten damn about anything, but hey thats the usual which you expect from a pirate, but troughout the game thinking that he may be some bad characther he overall isn't, he did get a bad reputation with both secret organizations but overtime learnt the morals of which had taken him quite some time to understand, over that course he sought to fight along side the Creed and follow its morals. He also was technicaly the founder and Grand Master of the English Assassin's Brotherhood. He grew to be quite a likeable characther in my opinion atleast.

The core gameplay of it is as same as it was in AC3 with a few difrent changes to fit the playstyle of a pirate, duel wielding cutlasses and owning 4 flintlock pistols is the deal with AC4, the naval combat also has been improved from AC3 and also making it the main thing in the game.
The game adds another important characther to it the Jackdaw which is your ship that you sail trough the Caribeans plundering and taking as you want, it's important that you take of your ship as it becomes quite the game changer if you upgrade it to max and all.

Overall the game is good it'll take you aroudn 20-23h to complete that is if you spend next to no time on the naval contratcs, templar hunts, assassin contracts and such oh yeah and upgrading your ship which will take you quite a while to find the parts as there also a new mechanic added to game called Treasure hunting, you can find treasure maps from dead or unconcious corpses stranded on the shores of the locations you discover, each treasure map will containt either gold or an upgraded plan for the jackdaw and some aditional gold, sure gota love that pirate feel afterwards.

Anyways got a bit offtrack there.
The game at its base is great and all has a very small amount of glitches ( exclude the sinken rising ship thing which ocasionaly happens with the Jackdaw ) and so fort.
The gameplay is great and is just amazing in some sense as you feel like a genuine pirate with the tools at your disposal.

A much recommended game and also a favourite in my category as it just captures everything you could need in an AC game.","Very Positive88% of the 55,599 user reviews for this game are positive.",adress situation ac3_emphasized followed revelation ended desmond woke coma adventure ac3 introduced assassin connor call uninteresting lacking term ezio blame ac3 assassin design atitude general connor honest brutal hell assassin loving caring natural enviormeant village homestead literall devil battlefield characther design atitude general pretty good lack understood characther ac3 pretty great top tier ac2 bf pretty great general bf_emphasized great terific amazing glorious god tier pretty undescribable enjoyed hell fan franchise long core smooth fast paced adrenaline rush way offered extende naval combat asking ac3 probably fun general mainly covered 60 sea 40 land naval combat important aspect naval combat bf far superiour pirate ship battle game alot fun destroy hell giant fleet characther bf pick latter ac3 characther unknown kind employe working abstergo double agent sort technicaly share intel assassin troughout modern mission shaun rebeca modern segment covered perspective bit odd fun odd fun modern segment randomly collecting qr code hacking pc yes hacking hacking pretty fun altough repeat short minigame switching frequency turning line order unlock file simple cracking firewall type pretty short pretty fun general bf take action ac3 mean grandfather connor kenway captain edward james kenway called started privateer begining overtaken lust life greed priority take plea rotten damn hey thats usual expect pirate troughout bad characther bad reputation secret organization overtime learnt moral taken understand course sought fight along side creed follow moral technicaly founder grand master english assassin brotherhood grew likeable characther atleast core ac3 difrent change fit playstyle pirate duel wielding cutlass owning 4 flintlock pistol deal ac4 naval combat improved ac3 add important characther jackdaw ship sail trough caribeans plundering taking important ship changer upgrade max good aroudn 20 23h complete spend next no_time naval contratcs templar hunt assassin contract oh yeah upgrading ship part mechanic called treasure hunting treasure map dead unconcious corps stranded shore location discover treasure containt gold upgraded plan jackdaw aditional gold gota love pirate afterwards anyways bit offtrack base great small glitch exclude sinken rising ship ocasionaly happens jackdaw fort great amazing sense genuine pirate tool disposal recommended favourite category capture ac

1085660,Destiny 2,"Likes:
- Lots of high quality content to do, especially for a free to play game
- Big immersive planets to explore and get lost in
- Both pve and pvp modes are fun
- The game is very pretty
- Sound design, voice acting, soundtrack are very good
- Core gameplay mechanics are polished and satisfying, such as gunplay and jumping and riding the sparrow 

Dislikes:
-Unfriendly to new players because of the sheer amount of content they immediately have access to, with no clear indication of what the symbols on the map mean, combined with a disorganized quest menu, among other grievances. This is definitely a game where you should look up a quick beginner's guide as a newbie to point you in the right directions.
- No ingame guildfinder, you have to do that on bungie's website for some reason
- Hard to keep track of quests; you should be able to pin more than 4 quests at a time, the menu is disorganized and quests can get lost, and a lot of quests will leave you scratching your head until you just have to google how to complete it
- A few instances of missions bugging out forcing you to restart 
- Waypoints could be better and less finicky 
- Menus are not good in general

Recommendation:
If you like the idea of exploring, particularly in a space and science fiction setting, you might really enjoy this game. If you like shooting a bunch of things and chasing after loot, you will like this game. It can/does become a massive time sink however, which might be a good or bad thing depending on the player. 
If you are even considering playing this game, you should just give it a try because its free to play and you have nothing to lose.

1966720,Lethal Company,"Amazing game, even in solo. I've not played with other players but it's still a good time.

This is a survival horror game where you go to moons to collect scrap to sell to a company to meet a profit quota, if you don't it's game over. The game advises you to play co-op with other players and to use voice chat, although, you still have choice for if you want to play with others or not. It can be a little obvious that it's good to have other players with you because you can only carry 4 items at a time and big items will cause you to not pick up anything until you drop them. Since i have only played solo, I cannot say what the community for this game is like.

Each time you visit a moon, a seed is generated, so the map looks different every time. This game does not have an ending since it's just a ""see how long you can survive"" game so if you want a game that has an end, look elsewhere.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 274,684 user reviews for this game are positive.",amazing solo not_played player s_emphasizedtill good survival horror moon collect scrap meet profit quota advises play mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal player voice chat choice play others not_it obvious good player carry 4 item big item cause not_pick drop solo cannot_say community visit moon seed generated look different not_have ending long survive elsewhere
1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I've played this game for close to 2 years at this point & have accumulated 14,113 hours of played time as I'm writing this review. I've sacrificed the better part of my free time loving this game, the friends I've made & finding someone Pol Pot would say ""Sheesh, that's harsh man"" about.

[b] Firstly, the good things: [/b]

The community sits in number 1 spot for this, [b]previously[/b] providing huge resources tips/tricks & gameplay advice for all users. Everyone that I know who played/have played the game all stuck around for the community, others competing within certain skills or pushing their account to the limits.

This game offers the scratch that is the itch of idle games, it has a vast array of complicated mechanics & true micro-managing nerds can work their magic to make the most of it. You'll find a large variety of classes with varying roles that come together in a meaningful way & if you enjoy pixel art, the game floods you with it.

If you're someone that this game appeals to, you'll be hooked within the first few hours, it's probably the better version of an Idle RPG you're currently playing.

[b]HOWEVER - And a big however.[/b]

The Cons.

1 - A large amount of content across the game will only ever be able to be effectively levelled if you play ""Actively"" (leaving your game running on pc non stop)

2 - Increasingly larger power gains from spending $$$ (This has grown insanely in the recent patch). News has it that the Venezuelan board of economics are betting on this being the new Runescape due to ""trading""

3

Number 3 deserves a huge spot since it's the one thing that is absolutely killing this game, the community & the future of Idleon.

[b]The developer.[/b]

[b]""The developer, but wha... why.. why would he be killing the game?""[/b]

[b]LavaFlame.[/b]

The man himself is single handedly destroying the reputation & future of Idleon

I say that with utter sincerity & not out of malice. 

Take a moment with me now to picture yourself, picture yourself & hundreds of people around you on the set of Oprah, however it is not Oprah, it's Lava.

He shouts [i]""Are you all ready for my Lava approved update of the month?!""

[i] ""WOOOOOOOO!"" [/i] you and the crowd go wild

He rises from his seat, confidence fills his lungs.. [i] ""I want you all to... look under your SEAAATS!"" [/i]


[i] everyone in the audience is screaming... excitement fills you, your hands are shaking, you reach beneath your set... fingers furiously feeling around you feel it[/i]


[i] you pull the object from beneath the seat, smile widening.. it's been so long, what could it be[/i]

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.

So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","Mixed58% of the 2,306,037 user reviews for this game are positive.",work fantastic best compelling game day round play affected sort issue computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player desync physic bug randomly impassable terrain shooter spike regular occurrence egregious hacker shoot five time face 500m hacker sit blue zone taking damage hacker instantly healing item hacker shoot terrain pseudo hacker recoil macro built mouse fire auto 4x sight 150m field never_feels constantly battling not_only fair enemy raft player third party software win pubg corp care improving routinely ban hacker 30 us unauthorized illegal method gain advantage buy copy no_incentive rage no_other spend 25 minute gathering best gear setting best position shot wall someone never_even concerned blood pressure be_emphasizedst miss

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Patch 1.5 adds missing features, Will update review when I get it installed

Why is ""valhalla cyberpunk bartender action"" a way better world building experience then 2077, so heres what's missing and/or things that need to be changed that would go a long way hopefully thru many patches

Quality of Life

- [strike]Walk toggle for keyboard.[/strike]

- Key re-mapping for certain elements.

- Accessibility features missing (ie: text scaling for menus).

- [strike]In-game benchmark feature.[/strike]

- Dash should be a separate key and not a double press of walking key.

- Crouch and skip dialogue should not share the same key.

- [strike]The minimap is too zoomed in to be helpful in many cases.[/strike]

- Missing a toggle aim feature.

- [strike]Ability to respec attributes. (Note: Existing item respecs perks only)[/strike]

- Ability to disable objective marker.

- Ability to lower ADS sensitivity.

- Add proper ultrawide (21:9, 32:9) support.

- Add loot by area or/and autoloot feature.

- Add ""stash all"" feature.

- Add transparency option for hud elements.

- Add way to remove mods from unequipped weapons.

- Add toggle mouse acceleration.

- [strike]Driving markers and onscreen trajectory (alternative GPS).[/strike]

Gameplay and immersion

- Body slider customization (height, weight, muscle mass).

- [strike]Very few options for some of the character creation features (hair color, tattoos, skin complexion, scars, etc).[/strike]

- Animations for eating and drinking (excluding scripted ones).

- Unable to remove underwear outside of inventory.

- Vehicle customization.

- [strike]Apartment customization.[/strike]

- Cosmetic slots or transmog feature.

- Very few actual merchant stores in quantity and variety.

- No garages or parking lots.

- [strike]Crowds have low level of reactivity and awareness to the game world.[/strike]

- Very few interactive NPCs outside of missions with meaningful dialogue.

- Very few options to meaningfully construct a personality to V. You get to choose missions endings, but not an actual persona.

- Lack of non-action oriented stories and quests about meaningful themes of cyberpunk distopia.

- [strike]Player cannot smoke.[/strike]

- Weapon mods and skill trees largely irrelevant outside of marginal and mostly numerical improvements to combat.

- Lack of emergent gameplay events in the game world (ie: dynamic and random triggers).

- [strike]Unable to alter character's appearance (barbershop, tattoo parlors, plastic surgeon).[/strike]

- Lack of character reflection outside of the few mirrors available. This furthers the disconnection between the player and the character.

- No ownership of items (you can rob NPCs under their nose).

- No prison or lasting crime system.

- Wanted system is largely underdeveloped, with cops spawning out of nowhere and disappearing shortly after.

- Cybernetics lack variety in meaningful choices that alter gameplay (except for limbs weapons). Deus Ex has far more impactful mods that actually change the way you approach combat.

- The lifepaths are frustratingly brief and have little impact other than dialogue choices. V is essentially the same character regardless of past.

- [strike]The traffic AI is lackluster and there are too few cars driving around for a large metropolis.[/strike]

- Trains were obviously cut, even though the whole infrastructure is visible.

- The world interaction is quite minimal. Among items that should be interactive: chairs, benches, toilets, stools, sinks, gym equipment, light fixtures, restaurant menus, smartphones, taxi, trash bins and dumpsters, most merchant stalls, microwaves, dancing floors, gaming tables, arcades.

- You cannot preview wardrobe and weapon purchases.

- There is no reliable cover system.

- [strike]Loot system overdone, invasive and distracting. You are constantly showered with redundant and marginally better items and have no attachment whatsoever with your fashion and weapon choices. (Dear god, I hate this one).

- Enemies are too spongy and level design forces frontal assault way too often.

- Robotics and drone control largely absent (outside of scripted missions).","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1623730,Palworld,"So it's a couple of days after release. Sale numbers have just hit 4 million. I've played nearly 30 hours since its release, which is a [i]heavy[/i] burn, even for me. I've been enjoying it. Everybody's talking about it. My friends are playing it.

In spite of this, I genuinely don't recommend it. It's nothing to do with the various complaints about the developer having dealt with AI or having abandoned previous titles. It's also not about the derivative nature of the game's aesthetic - it knows what it is, and I see no reason to harshly judge a game for hitting its intended target. It's also not because of the natural early access jank - I have a reasonable amount of confidence that the AI and geometry bugs will be ironed out, and that certain somewhat temperamental systems like base building will get a solid overhaul.

If you're the kind of person who'd be really into this game, you've probably already bought it. This review is one part warning for the latecomers, one part critical analysis, and one part prediction of the future. Also, for the duration of this review, I will be referring to the creatures as Pokemon, because I have little to no tolerance for pretense.

I believe Palworld will be a flash in the pan. A blinding flash, to be sure. It's sold 4 million copies so far, and I won't be surprised if it hits 5. I genuinely believe it'll start a mass rush of open world monster taming games in the industry in the same way Minecraft put destructible terrain on the menu and Stardew Valley seemed to get everybody into farming. But I don't think it'll have any real staying power in and of itself.

Palworld is, fundamentally, an open world survival crafting game similar to Ark or Rust. You're in a world, you punch some trees to get wood for a workbench, you build a little outpost and start picking away at a tech tree. It's also got a bit of that Breath of the Wild style climbing and gliding going on. The main gimmick is that there are Pokemon. And, honestly, that much is a really fun and cool. There's a very definitive moment just after you first craft a bow where you first nail a Pokemon to the floor before belting it in the face with a Pokeball. That, right there, is the immediately satisfying interaction that you never knew you wanted. It's quick, it's snappy, it feels good. That's basically the ""hook"" - Pokemon dropped into a wilderness survival game, and it plays out exactly as you'd expect.

In game, your Pokemon serve three main purposes. The first is what you'd expect from a game like this - they're combat pets. They operate fairly autonomously with little room for direct control. They're more akin to an MMO pet than an actual Pokemon. The second is as a sort of crafting automation tool - You have various crafting stations, and you can release Pokemon into your base to have them craft items or harvest resources and whatnot. They require some minor babysitting, but they generally just do work where available. Their third and final purpose is as mobility tools - ground mounts, flying mounts, aquatic mounts, and also an automatic glider replacement.

The problem with these kinds of games, and Palworld in particular, is the inevitable loss of momentum. There's a moment at which the game stops surprising you, and Palworld hits that point remarkably quickly. The Pokemon themselves perfectly capture the essence of the real thing, which is to say they haven't been interesting since I was a teenager. The world itself does not feel especially alive. An idle glance over the tech tree just after the early game will eliminate most of your curiosity. The combat is remarkably shallow. Guns are cool, but shooting Bootleg Xerneas in the face while dodge-rolling fireballs is only so compelling after the first couple of instances. The level grind will also start getting pretty tedious past a certain point. If you're playing with friends, these issues won't be felt quite as harshly, but I'm afraid Pocket Pair don't get to take credit for my friend's insightful philosophical musings regarding the nature of goats.

I don't think it'll be long before other people start noticing these issues, and I don't think these are problems that will be fixed in any meaningful way. When it comes to early access, there are two kinds of issues that can be resolved: Lack of content, and lack of stability. But the fundamental underlying structure being poor? That's not something you can really fix after sales begin.

I don't regret buying the game, I don't regret playing it, and I'll probably get a bit more fun out of it yet. I'll probably even pick it back up again later after some updates hit. But if it's a couple of months after release, things have gotten quiet, and you're reading this because the initial hype wave didn't ensnare you and you're wondering if it's worth the purchase? Honestly, you could probably give it a pass and not miss out on anything remarkable.

I look forward to seeing if time will make a fool out of me.","Very Positive94% of the 220,720 user reviews for this game are positive.",couple day release sale number 4 million nearly 30 hour release heavy burn enjoying everybody talking friend spite genuinely recommend it_emphasized complaint developer dealt ai abandoned title not_about derivative nature aesthetic know no_reason harshly judge hitting intended target not_because natural player purchase play official release jank reasonable confidence ai geometry bug ironed certain somewhat temperamental system base building solid overhaul kind probably already bought warning latecomer critical analysis prediction future duration referring creature pokemon no_tolerance pretense believe flash pan blinding flash s_emphasizedold 4 million copy far surprised hit 5 genuinely believe mass rush open world monster taming game industry minecraft destructible terrain menu stardew valley everybody repeatedly defeating enemy completing task gain resource t_emphasizedhink real staying power fundamentally open world survival crafting similar ark rust world punch tree wood workbench build outpost picking tech tree bit breath wild style climbing gliding gimmick pokemon honestly fun cool definitive moment craft bow nail pokemon floor belting face pokeball immediately satisfying interaction never_knew wanted quick s_emphasizednappy feel good basically hook pokemon dropped wilderness survival play exactly expect pokemon serve three purpose expect combat pet operate fairly autonomously room direct control akin massively multiplayer online pet actual pokemon sort crafting automation tool crafting station release pokemon base craft item harvest resource whatnot require minor babysitting generally available third final purpose mobility tool ground mount flying mount aquatic mount automatic glider replacement problem kind game particular inevitable loss momentum moment stop surprising hit remarkably quickly pokemon perfectly capture essence real interesting teenager world not_feel especially alive idle glance tech tree early eliminate curiosity combat remarkably shallow gun cool shooting bootleg xerneas face dodge rolling fireball compelling couple instance grind pretty tedious past certain friend issue harshly afraid pocket pair credit friend insightful philosophical musing regarding nature goat t_emphasizedhink long noticing issue t_emphasizedhink problem fixed meaningful come player purchase play official release kind issue resolved lack lack stability fundamental underlying structure poor not_something fix sale regret buying regret probably bit fun probably pick update couple month release thing gotten quiet re_emphasizedading initial hype wave ensnare wondering worth purchase honestly probably pas not_miss remarkable forward seeing fool

TL;DR, Team Fortress 2 is probably the best online game I've ever played. Can't think of any worthy competition for it. One of the biggest reasons for that is because it's just fun. I've played League, Overwatch, VALORANT, Smash Bros., Splatoon; a lot of the popular competitive games. There isn't a single other game out there where I stop to join a conga line with the enemy team while I'm capturing their intel. At it's core, TF2 is a game you pick up and just play without giving a single shit about victory or loss. Maybe the real intelligence was the friends we made along the way.

1599340,Lost Ark,"[h1] Lost Ark [/h1]

Unfortunately i can't recommend this game. Despite interesting classes, amazing skills and a enjoyable early-mid game ( leveling up your character ) the late game is just not fun...  You just farm doing same 2-3 stuff everyday then change to your alt character and do exactly the same to propably feed your main character. And then you pray for RNG god to make that 5% honing chance to upgrade your gear level. And you still propably failed it dozens of times. And then you got back to do tidious,boring stuff or joined the pit of hell and payed dozens of $$$ to buy that honing gear only to throw that sweet money of your to oblivion. Again.
Despite this and army of bots that is invading the game... u can still have some fun as F2P player like me, there's some really cool scenes/story missions but overall most quest expierence is that you will be most likely just hitting that skip button ""G"". Then kill 2 gyus standing next to the npc or bring some sweet flowers cus he can't pick them from 4 meters from his spot... and your're done for. Do some similiar quest 100 times, then u got that one interesting story mission and of course u guess it.. [b] REPEAT. [/b]

Update: Bruh because a lot people cry, ""have you never played any mmo!?"" I did, but grinding in Lost Ark fells just unrewarding, unejoyable and boring. If you enjoy doing exactly same thing dozens of time just to have that Number +1 to the equipment then good for you ^_^.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"when you look at this game for the first time you may just see this as some odd looking asymmetrical horror game and wonder how deluded you'd have to be to sink thousands of hours into this game like a surprising amount of people have

and even after you play your first few matches and get focused down (or ""tunneled"") by some weird man setting bear traps everywhere that you seem to get caught in, even though you triple-checked only 5 seconds ago and you swore to yourself that there wasn't one there, you just cant understand what it is about this game that draws such a community to its name

but then you notice all of those shiny red things you seem to be accumulating through your many fruitless deaths and so you decide to open up the bloodweb, and you start to turn those useless shiny red things into items and perks that you use to better yourself and your odds of survival until you make that first sweet escape

all of a sudden you start to really see the way the progression works in this game, you see it for what it is, a long and hard grind, but you think about how sweet that first escape was and how you could start levelling up many of your characters to make the ultimate build. a build so powerful that the trap setting fool will regret ever coming near you.

you finally reach the summit, you've spent millions upon millions of those oh-so craved bloodpoints, you've learnt the teachables and you've made your builds, and suddenly you realise just [i]why[/i] so many people have dedicated such seemingly insane amounts of hours into this little asymmetrical horror game

i'm currently on this journey myself, with 174 hours i've unlocked a decent amount of stuff for my killers and my survivors but i'm still a long way off thoroughly completing everything there is to do in this game, but as someone who is quickly finding new games and dropping old ones and not committing too much to anything, this is one of the rare games i can see myself breaking the thousand hour milestone in.

the gameplay itself is fun with both roles offering a very unique experience, with survivors relying on each other to complete their objectives (which can also be played with up to 3 friends!), whereas the killer role is for the lone player who only wants to rely on their own skills to achieve victory. killer is by far the more stressful role of the two (despite what you may think) and is typically more rewarding in terms of bloodpoints. however both sides have their pros and cons and its really up to you whether you'd prefer to play one role more than the other or whether you'd rather just play them both depending on your mood or availability of friends (or some other reason)

and if you're still not convinced that this game may be for you but you're still curious, there are a plethora of youtubers and twitch streamers making content about this game all the time, so you can always take a look for yourself and see if you think you'd like it

if you somehow managed to get to the end of this review (i never write reviews and now you can probably see why :p) then thanks and i hope i've managed to sway you one way or the other about buying this game, if you do decide to take the leap into dbd then i hope you enjoy it! :)","Very Positive80% of the 512,225 user reviews for this game are positive.",odd asymmetrical horror wonder deluded sink thousand hour surprising play match focused tunneled weird man setting bear trap everywhere caught triple checked 5 second ago swore cant understand draw community name notice shiny red thing accumulating fruitless death decide open bloodweb turn useless shiny red thing item perk odds survival sweet escape sudden progression work long hard grind sweet escape levelling character ultimate build build powerful trap setting fool regret near you_emphasized finally reach summit spent million million oh craved bloodpoints learnt teachables build suddenly realise dedicated seemingly insane amount hour asymmetrical horror currently journey 174 hour unlocked decent stuff killer survivor long thoroughly completing someone quickly finding game dropping old one not_committing rare game breaking thousand milestone fun role offering unique survivor relying complete objective 3 friend whereas killer role lone want rely skill achieve victory killer far stressful role despite typically rewarding term bloodpoints side pro con prefer play role rather play depending mood availability friend not_convinced curious plethora youtubers twitch streamer somehow managed never_write review probably p thanks hope managed sway buying decide leap dbd hope enjoy

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Hear me out: 
1. This game has so much solid foundations that are very hard to master all. 
2. Two game modes, Warfare and Offensive, were honed and changed multiple times throughout versions. It all works. Each map requires a slightly different approach to storming the strong point.
3. Recon, Armor, Infantry, Command Chain - it all works in tandem.

When a game goes on, back and forth. for full 1.5h (or 2.25h in Offensive) it is one of the most satisfying feelings in gaming.

This is all achievement of Black Matter studio. It is still there in the game.

BUT:
The game is dying by a death of thousand cuts ever since transition of IP has started. Now Team17 is at the helm.

In 14.4 we always have to accept some EULA.  For some people it resets part of your settings. Every time.
This also coincides with some wonderfully useless videos about things you do not care about.
Which drops you into a ""Press any button to trigger another loading screen"". No one needed it. No one.
Because to get into a game you'll have to wait through a server loading screen, as well as a queueing screen (sometimes minutes).

They cut communications and Public Testing Env and alienated people that provided feedback. Systems of communications and PTE's are back, but suddenly less people willing to test.

Game has a garrison limit. It was shown in the UI. Suddenly it is taken away. Zero consideration for established game play. Just a decision made.

Opening map cancels long ""keep pressing this button to do a thing"". It did not some time before.

They rolled out British maps and forces in a quality equivalent of a beta patch. Major update to a solid, ""stable"" game rolled in a very poor condition. Sights were not properly zeroed in - you basically could not shoot properly in an FPS game.
Most of the guns covered a large portion of the screen.

You can buy this game.
You will have fun.
But at some point, frustration will overflow.
And believe me, there is a lot of frustration in game already.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Let me preface this by saying this review's purpose isn’t so that I get unbanned, at this point I don’t plan to ever return and play any AGS games. This is the first time I’ve been banned on any online game and this is the point that really irks me. This is here to provide some awareness for anyone who may be interested in this game and hope that others who’ve been unfairly banned will speak out so at the very least others may be aware and AGS may actually start becoming better or competent. 

Background:
•	Over 800 hours on the account.
•	My characters and some relevant equipment are as follows (AFAIK, Gem levels may be all over the place, 1 or 2 level 7, most were 4 or 5, few 6), I don’t bus at all and I’ve only ridden on a couple busses mostly for new 1370s. Bought the Gold Pre-release founders pack on release:
•	1462.5 Paladin – 1x level 7 Gem, assorted other gems usually all under 5 as I just forged most of my gems for 2 x level 7 Gems before the ban; all legendary accessories 3/3/3/1/1
•	1430 Glaivier – level 4-6 Gems, relic accessories 4x3, 1x1
•	1415 Deathblade – level 4-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1
•	1415 Sorceress – level 4-5 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2
•	1415 Bard – level 3-4 Gems (new Powerpassed character), legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2
•	1402.5 Gunslinger – level 3-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1 or 2

Suspected Triggers for Ban:
•	I’ve been selling as much stuff as possible to try to get enough for Legendary Grudge Engraving. Recently, I merged all my Paladin Gems and got 2x level 7 Gems but both were damage Gems so I moved those to my DB to reforge and bought 1 level 7 CD gem for around 15k Gold I believe (NAE Market Price). The DB rerolled the 2x level 7 Gems and sold them for 16k list, 18k BO which both sold on the market. Also sold T3 Destruction Stones and Honing Stones.
•	Bought a Swimsuit skin with RC and sold some of the pieces on the Market for Market price (pretty heavy fluctuation during the final weeks of the sale)
•	Bought new skins for my Bard and Sorceress and replaced some of the older skins by selling on the market for market price.

Ban and Appeal Process:
I found out I was banned on Sunday at around 9 PM EST. Obviously, I could not tell what triggered my ban so I sent in an appeal request at Sunday at 9:16 PM.
I received a reply at 9:28 PM saying that my ban was permanent and the disciplinary action was merited but they did not state why I was banned apart from Cheating which still does not tell me anything. 

I sent a reply back stating I still do not know what I was accused of and I can’t provide evidence against something I do not know, noted that my characters were the ilevels above and their gems/accessories being not high value. I also noted that most of my characters had rested bonus so I probably wasn’t botting and asking for escalation and got this as automated reply saying I’ll hear back from them within 6 hours.

After that I did not hear anything back. I re-sent in an appeal on Monday and it was becoming clear that they do not read these at all and just send the same prepared responses without any review. This went on constantly so at this point I’m pretty confident that they don’t ever read these and just block you. I read on their forums that sometimes the German one may actually result in an actual person reviewing the case but same response in German. I have sent in other appeals but all had the exact same response.

Seeing as AGS refuses to even tell me why I got banned or even bother to read my appeals, the only thing that this really tells me is that the claim that Moderators read appeals is a bald-faced lie and any CM who says otherwise is perpetuating this lie.
Based on what I did on my account, I suspect someone who RMTs bought my gem or skins and I got flagged as a Gold Seller as based on what I could see, RMT is not necessarily a permanent ban. This was added in my later appeals but same response. My Steam account is an account with over 200 games and is my only used Steam account, to be a used as a Gold seller would be highly illogical. Also, I purchased a pre-release package so its an old account.

Now why am I making this review? After reading the forums and Reddit about these posts, there’s usually some people mentioning that their friends also got banned unfairly but just gave up. Seeing as some of these posts are starting to crop up more, I would implore them to make some noise about it so that AGS may finally have to act. At the very least, it can provide a warning to anyone on the fence that this may happen to them and they should be wary. 

tl;dr - highest ilvl 1462.5, couple lvl 7 gems, sold 2 lvl 7 gems and some skins on the market and got banned. Appeals get a response in 5-10 minutes upholding the ban without saying why I got banned.

Actual useful stuff for a review:

Addressing the currencies of in the game. There are 4 currencies in the game used to unlock various aspects or you character's progression. Each of these can be earned through normal play, Thus far only the super credits may be purchased, detailing what they are all used for below.

1. Samples
2. Credits
3. Medals
4. Super credits (Premium currency)

Samples: These are used to upgrade your ship, your personal quest hub / lobby for your party, Thus far (~4 hours in) it looks like these are picked up on missions as a sort of bonus collectible. The ship upgrades, upgrade your stratagems, your skills / heavy weaponry so to speak. These ""currently"" look to be a medium to heavy grind through normal play, the first upgrades costing 60 common samples (there are also rare samples) and after 4 hours I have only collected 15 common samples, but I have not been exploring for them too much, there are a lot of upgrades to work through.

Credits: These are used to unlock NEW stratagems, earned fairly easily just by playing, you earn more by completing bonus objectives and having more of your team extract from a given mission etc., used for progressing your character.

Medals: These are used to buy individual items in the ""war-bonds"" the game's form of a battle pass, you earn these by completing missions and doing orders (daily quest presumably) higher difficulty missions see you earning more medals, and likewise the higher you progress in a war-bond, the more medals each item costs.

Super Credits: This is your premium currency that you can purchase. Thus far these are used for 2 things only, Firstly it's used to buy items from the premium store, these items seem to be ""mostly"" cosmetic, the store rotates items every 2 or so days. The armor in the premium store do come with perks (ex. 50% longer throwing distance), IMPORTANT NOTE: These perks also appear on the normal armor as well, so thus far not P2W in the store..yet. Secondly these credits are used to unlock the premium war-bonds, costing ~$10 or 1000 credits, I have not seen these to affect progression in any meaningful way as of yet. You can find these in small amounts in random boxes on missions.

-----------------------------------------------------------
War-bonds (Battle-pass): Specifically addressing the war-bonds, the battle-pass. The war-bonds are your source for new weapon and armor unlocks, cosmetic capes, emotes, and super credits (100 credits in each tier), There appear to be ~10 tiers (possibly 7), each item in each tier costs medals (detailed above), higher tier items cost more medals. To advance to the next tier you need to spend only so many medals in the current tier you can choose what you want to buy (I suggest weapon & armor unlocks and the super credits in each tier).

The war-bonds comes in 2 flavors currently the free normal one, and the premium paid for ($10 / 1000 credits) one, The premium does have better weapons BUT it needs to be said the items in the premium war-bond cost many more medals, As I recall the 1st premium tier, items start at like 40+ medals, at least for the weapons. So advancing the premium one seems to be more of a mid to late game activity. If you purchase all the super credits from the free war-bond you ""should"" be able to buy the premium war-bond through normal play (confirmation needed) for a given ""season"".

More importantly the war-bonds supposedly won't ever disappear or be removed, so your can work on whatever ones you may have unlocked at any point in the future.","Mostly Positive75% of the 62,617 user reviews for this game are positive.",liberty democracy bug die actual useful stuff addressing currency 4 currency unlock aspect progression earned normal play far super credit purchased detailing 1 sample credit 3 medal 4 super credit premium currency sample upgrade ship personal task objective given non hub lobby party far 4 hour look picked mission sort bonus collectible ship upgrade upgrade stratagem skill heavy weaponry speak currently medium heavy grind normal play upgrade costing 60 common sample rare sample 4 hour collected 15 common sample not_been exploring upgrade credit unlock stratagem earned fairly easily earn completing bonus objective extract given progressing medal individual item war bond form battle pas earn completing mission order daily task objective given non presumably higher difficulty mission earning medal higher progress war bond medal cost super credit premium currency purchase far thing firstly item premium item mostly cosmetic rotates item day armor premium perk ex 50 longer throwing distance important note perk appear normal armor far not_p2w secondly credit unlock premium war bond costing 10 1000 credit not_seen affect progression meaningful small amount random box mission war bond battle pas addressing war bond battle pas war bond source weapon armor unlocks cosmetic cape emotes super credit 100 credit tier appear 10 tier possibly 7 tier cost medal detailed higher tier item cost medal advance next tier spend medal tier choose suggest weapon armor unlocks super credit tier war bond come flavor currently normal premium paid 10_emphasized00 credit premium weapon need item premium war bond cost medal recall 1st premium tier item 40 medal weapon advancing premium mid late activity purchase super credit war bond able premium war bond normal play confirmation needed given season importantly war bond supposedly disappear removed whatever one unlocked future

1203620,Enshrouded,"[b] TL:DR: Good open world game with unique building and terraforming possibilities with obvious gaps in the multiplayer and still quite limited content. [/b]

First of all, I have played numerous representatives of the genre intensively: including Valheim, Ark, Conan Exiles, Myth of Empire, V Rising & Rust, as well as many adventure RPGs that focus more on telling stories and exploration than on sandbox building and survival. That's why I can say with a clear conscience about Enshrouded: It's none of those. Not a better Valheim, not Zelda and not a classic RPG either - it has a bit of everything and a few things of its own.

[h2] Pros: [/h2]
- [b] Building & Terraforming: [/b]
What makes the game really unique for me is the ability to model the terrain completely free. I mean - you have the same freedom as in Minecraft: digging a tunnel through the mountain instead of running around or climbing over it? No issue. Would you rather build a hobbit cave instead of an above-ground castle? - Let's go. Hollow out an entire mountain and recreate the mines of Moria? You can do it. Super cool.

- [b] Movement Utilities: [/b]
Very nice tools that make moving around easier and change the way you explore the world. Grabbing hooks and gliders - nothing new but well implemented.

- [b] Skill Trees and Equipment: [/b]
In terms of skill builds and equipment, Enshrouded is more like a classic fantasy RPG than an open-world survival game. A map with 12 skill trees that give you a lot of options to play your character in various ways. In addition, the ability to reset your selected skills almost free of charge gives you a lot of variation options over the course of the game.

- [b] The shroud [/b]
The basic concept of the shroud and the atmosphere it creates feels very good or better to say: scary.


[h2] Cons: [/h2]
- [b] GUI/HUD Usability: [/b]
The Overall Information architecture and click-flows of the GUI are pain in the a**. The world map is totally Overloaded, The building menu is terrible (Select a Hammer, Pressing Tab, Scroll the Mouse Wheel, Double Press Alt and press a Number-key from 1 to 9 just to select a Single Structure? Are you kidding me?) , The character- and skill information are also far too nested and has click paths that are too long.

- [b] Multiplayer Issues: [/b]
We started the game right at the release with 5 people. Ofcourse, it's more fun to play with friends, but the quests and the world progression are obviously not yet ready for large multiplayer groups. Even after 30-40 hours of play, it still wasn't clear to us which quests required personal progress and which progress happened globally. A player who arrives late on a server is completely overwhelmed by quests, but has no idea what his actual goal is. Clear recommendation: Start together, play together, stop together. Playing asynchronously on the same server is no fun.

Additionally, it doesn't feel like the enemy strength scales with the number of players, which is why the game felt very easy for us.


- [b] World Generation and Content [/b]
I can attribute this to the early access, but it should still be mentioned: Large Areas of the world seems quite loveless, especially in the late game areas, individual cities or POIs are nicely prepared, but a lot of it is just empty space without any challenge or opportunity to explore. In addition, our groups of 4-5 people player threw all the content in about 20-40 hours and there is no more progress to be done for us.


Overall, I still recommend buying it, even if I personally would wait for more content and advise against playing asynchronously in larger groups.","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",tl dr good open world unique building terraforming possibility obvious gap mode multiple player interact compete real limited numerous representative genre intensively including valheim ark conan exile myth empire v rising rust adventure rpgs focus telling story exploration sandbox building survival clear conscience not_a valheim not_zelda not_a classic role bit thing h2 pro h2 b_emphasizeduilding terraforming make unique model terrain completely freedom minecraft digging tunnel mountain running climbing no_issue rather build hobbit cave ground castle hollow mountain recreate mine moria super cool movement utility nice tool moving easier explore world grabbing hook glider implemented skill tree equipment term skill build equipment classic fantasy role open world survival 12 skill tree option play way addition reset selected skill charge give variation option course shroud basic concept shroud atmosphere creates feel good scary h2 con h2 gui hud usability information architecture click flow gui pain world totally overloaded building menu terrible select hammer pressing tab scroll mouse wheel double press alt press number key 1 9 select single structure kidding skill information far nested click path long mode multiple player interact compete real issue started release 5 ofcourse fun play friend quest world progression obviously not_yet ready large mode multiple player interact compete real group 30 40 hour play clear quest required personal progress progress happened globally arrives late a_emphasized computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player completely overwhelmed quest no_idea actual goal clear recommendation play asynchronously computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player no_fun enemy strength scale number player easy world generation attribute player purchase play official release mentioned large area world loveless especially late area individual city poi nicely prepared empty space challenge opportunity explore addition group 4 5 threw 20 40 hour no_more progress recommend buying personally wait advise asynchronously larger group

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"I won't give a thumbs up because they are pushing a heavy feminist woke agenda. You get wind of it the first minute you play the game with the mayor confusing the men as being the one in charge. Anyone could have made the same mistake since Red was the one that came in barging in the Inn like a Boss. Red and Duarte reacted with such insecurity. Any worse and they would've called him a bigot. Another instance that was obvious to spot was when Red was trapped on the robe by the leg and the huntress was trying to shoot the robe to free him. But, he was moving too much because he was nervous. She screamed at him and he simply said what would you have done if a lassie was trying to shoot your leg or something of the sort. She left him there and Duarte made fun of him too. Also the fact that they never say they are married, and there was another farmer girl saying shes never going to get married and spewing anti marriage propaganda. Which is another agenda being pushed by the feminist for a while now and funny because that has never worked in their favor.

This game is the most passive/aggressive woke game I have ever played. It's there and if you don't see it it's because you don't want to see it.

This is it. Nothing tops the feeling of running into an encounter unprepared, just bearley surviving it and then die to an enviromental hazard because your party failed a perception check. 

The environments are ecxeptionally detailed and I felt strongly compelled to explore every nook and cranny.  Also using the terrain to your advantage, like moving boulders for cover or igniting oil barrels with a cantrip, is incredebly satisfying and makes every encounter feel unique.
The combat Is strategic and unvorgiving and because of the afforementioned environment one missplaced AoE can turn the battlefield into an extreme game of the floor is lava. 
Planning is key! Just like in a reallife D&D Session you will suffer the consequences of your actions. If you dont like those consequences F5( quicksave) will be your best friend. 
The interactions between Party members feel natural and everyone seems to have a compelling backstory.

If you, like me, liked Divinity 2 you should definitly give this a try.
I couldnt be happier even if my poor old GTX 970 is reaching its limits.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"I'm sorry but this is just not a good game in its current state. I want to like it, but it just doesn't hold a candle compared to the other bullet heavens/survivor-likes on the market. 

The game has nothing going for it other than branding and graphics.

None of the items do cool stuff together or synergise particularly well together, other than occasionally being upgraded by the same upgrade (such as 'increase rate of fire of all medium type weapons').

The upgrades are boring and uninventive, I've played almost 2 hours and haven't seen a single upgrade that wasn't one of:
- increasing damage
- increasing rate of fire
- increasing reload speed
- a combination of the above
- ""overclocks"", which are special upgrades at lv6/12/18 that something slightly different like change the damage type but still don't really change the gameplay substantially

Most egregiously, the meta-progression is basically non-existent which is a slap-in-the-face to the entire genre. You do a bunch of runs and collect a bunch of resources just to go into the upgrade page and increase your damage by 4%, or EXP gain by 2%, or pickup radius by 4%. The unlocks that come along the way in terms of new guns and characters and such are okay, but take way too long to unlock and you have to go out of your way in runs to unlock them (unlike other games where unlocking them feels exciting because you did it incidentally and they genuinely bring something new to the table).

The game has no feeling of progression or becoming broken as the run goes on - it plays more or less the same 2 minutes into a run as it does 20 minutes. The closest thing you can get to a chain reaction of killing enemies is if there happens to be an explodey enemy in the swarm and it kills the others, so you don't even get the satisfaction out of it as you would in other games.

Hoping they improve the synergy of the weapons and upgrades available, as well as the meta progression (upgrade page). Give us more projectiles, or chaining projectiles, or anything remotely interesting beyond just tweaking numbers.

Overall a bland, forgettable experience.","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_a good state hold candle compared bullet heaven like market branding graphic item cool stuff synergise occasionally upgraded upgrade increase rate fire medium type weapon upgrade boring uninventive 2 hour single upgrade increasing damage increasing rate fire increasing reload speed combination overclocks special upgrade lv6 12 18 slightly different damage type substantially egregiously the_emphasized effective popular strategy character build progression basically non existent slap face genre bunch run collect bunch resource upgrade page increase damage 4 exp gain 2 pickup radius 4 unlocks along term gun character okay long unlock run unlock unlike game unlocking feel exciting incidentally genuinely bring table no_feeling progression broken go play 2 minute 20 minute closest chain reaction killing enemy happens explodey enemy swarm kill others satisfaction game hoping improve synergy weapon upgrade available the_emphasized effective popular strategy character build progression upgrade page projectile chaining projectile remotely interesting tweaking number bland forgettable

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"Early review as I've just started but I wanted to get this out there because this is a fantastic game so far!

- Voice acting is great
- Both main protagonists are awesome.  Highly likeable characters so far and as already mentioned very well voiced.  It's been a while since I liked game characters and I wasn't expecting much here, but they delivered.
- Story is really cool so far
- Combat is fun, I had read some people thought it was too basic, but it fits the game well and is quite enjoyable

374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"Recently I was asked by a friend who is new to the souls series what i thought of this game, so I thought I'd put what i wrote him here.

This game is a masterpiece.
I'd recommend it, but I will say its hard, like it can be discouraging at times.
However, there are few feelings that come close to the sensation of defeating a boss or enemy you've been stuck on for hours.

TL:DR= Beautiful game, challenging but rewarding fighting system and a non intrusive but intriguing narrative to boot. 9/10


Ill keep the review brief so you can skim through it, because, honestly, you've got to experience the game for yourself to fully comprehend what this game is about.

Story= Vague (left to interpretation sorta' thing) but intriguing. You're character seems to be the only one out of the loop and it really helps cement the idea that youre not ready for the grand task you've been given. You'd expect alot of satisfaction from the end of the game, however the real story chunks are tucked away in item descriptions and in the connotations of NPC's.

Visuals= F***ing fantastic. Graphics are great even on low settings and this mystical middle age setting looks so fucking incredible. The world is detailed and reinforces the main story with hints of the impennding doom that a dark age will induce. Oh, and fashion souls is real, and trust me you're going to spend a lot of time making your character look badass.

Gameplay= Toughest part. Easy to learn, hard to master. The levelling system require stat placement which means various builds can be created with various intended functions: from melee builds to caster builds to healing builds. Some styles are more forgiving than others and others require late game items/bonuses/spells to properly flourish. There are, of course, Meta builds that perform pretty well but everyone will also be trying to perfect there own build.

Online= Fantastic. Community is still pretty big for PvE and PvP but, the game is getting getting old now. Co-op is great and can be used through most of game (minus something like 3 transitory areas that dont really have anything important in them). Invasions are what made dark souls work: getting invaded and winning a duel makes you feel powerful if its a 1v1. Invading can be unforgiving because of gank squads (2+ players who corner single invaders) but it can be so rewarding when you pull of a whole squad kill and you get to do the infamous 'point down' gesture. PvP has its own arena if invading gets tiresome, so thats a plus. But high wait times if your not around the meta level in arena (Soul level 120 is the recommended meta range). General PvP can be alot more frustrating than other games but alot more rewarding. Mistakes can be unforgiving and there is a big issue with the lag in fights. However, for a guy who I know likes to feel the flurry of a good fight, this s*** delivers. Highly tactical gameplay that rewards smart decisions and good spacing. Dont get me wrong, the arena is useful for easy matchmaking but theres a whole pvp system called fight clubs where players gather in a non dlc area to do 1v1s (fair warning: there are no real rule enforcement in fight clubs so you just gotta' act honorable and hope your fighting compatriots do too and not gank you).

Thanks for reading, this has been my first review on steam so I hope its clear and legible :)

I look forward to invading you, and may the flames guide thee!

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Ok take this review with a grain of salt....if you are an Elder Scrolls fan you will think this is the best thing since the invention of porn, if you are one of those kids that spent 600 hours placing buckets on the heads of npc`s in Skyrim NO this is not Skyrim Online you will be a bit...well sad. BUT (and it`s one big but) as a standalone game in the MMO scene unfortunately ESO feels more like a social experiment that is ran by some mad scientist from Zenimax Online.

The good!
For the first time since the second game in the ES universe we get to play in the entire world (mostly) with the abundance of lore specific to each region,race and faction. We get to see the past of Tamriel and the events that lead to the single player series. The world itself is great and being treated like a single-player quest driven game where your friends or randoms can join in on the fun is great. Each quest is truly unique, each region is amazingly detailed and oozes atmosphere, no matter where you go it feels like a real place.
The classes follow the standard ES rules: choose a template and expand using EVERYTHING! Two handed giant sword on a skinny robed wizard...sure why not. A giant orc spellcaster that channels his spells with a bow, yes please go on. The variety is off the hook and you can build and test as you please. And to aid this comes the fact that you may level as you please as well. You are scaled to a higher state so you can go play wherever you want on the map, be it quest, grind or just do dungeons. You are unrestricted in your approach to the available content. Crafting is as in depth as you`d expect from an ES title offering you the usual array of options: make weapons, cook, craft metal armors or robes, alchemy and enchanting and even making your furniture for player housing. Though sluggish and slow there is an interesting appeal in such a diverse and well crafted world to pick up such a profession and immerse yourself in the economy of this thriving world.

The mediocre.
As mentioned above you may level as you see please with the available classes and in whatever gear and skills you wish. Well.....there`s a catch. Once you reach the maximum level and start grinding your Champion Points (a post game progression system that allows you to augment your class further without changing it`s role) you hit the brick wall of this game`s progression. Not all classes and skill trees are created equal. Viability of builds is essential in an MMO and this is a case of too much even for the producers as the wide variety of options is limited once you reach the endgame. Your character that wields 2 swords in a robe using summons to defend himself might not be the best option or even viable at all for even the more difficult dungeons. This is slowly eating at the variety and dividing the community as most people that want to roll with they`re own unique approach are being left behind by both the increase in difficulty of most veteran dungeons and the players that want to progress and have a more min-max approach. 

The bad.
OH BOY!!! Let`s talk DLC. This is really questionable as we have 3 types of DLC content. 1. The expansion (Morrowind and Summerset, with Elsweyr right arround the corner) are great offering more of everything:class, world, quests, dungeons and gear. If you get in the game and want to expand your content it`s best you start with these. 2.Quest hubs (Orsinium, Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Murkmire) offer a new area to quest in 2 cases here guilds and skill trees that long term ES fans are quite fond of. Fancy stealing and murdering, well now we got you covered but these lack impact outside of the designated guild quests with only thieving being expanded to offer people a new way to earn some little more cash and XP on the side. 3. Dungeons....YES end game dungeons are being sold as separate 2 dungeons DLC packs. This is mind boggling as selling your endgame is just gating the community or forcing them to spend money they might not want or have at the time of release.

The redeeming qualities. 
Trials are ESO`s raid contents  and they offer a chance for people that don`t have any DLC`s to get gear adequate for the end game. These are not as in-depth mechanics based as in other MMO`s (WoW being the prime example of excellent raiding) but they offer a challenge and decent rewards for dedicated players. The PVP is amazing. From the arena-like Battlegrounds mode to the full on Alliance war that pits the 3 factions of the game in an all out war with forts and resource nods to capture is a blast. You even get siege weapons that can be constructed and use by the actual players to siege enemy forts. This is quite rewarding and it even offers it`s own 2 skill trees (that for some reason prove quite viable in even most PVE builds). 

Conclusion.
While I`ve not covered all aspects of the game the main elements of an MMO have been reviewed and I`m sure everyone can make an informed decision on the game. As a final note I recommend picking up a copy of the game base game and giving it a try, but overall it`s quite a mixed bag. So far the devs have walked a fine line as the game already fell in the pit that led most MMO`s to being closed but the constant additions and improvements keep the game running and the community is well and running strong even if the numbers are not as big as the millions it once had. Unfortunately history showed us that PVP oriented MMO`s have quite a tendency to lay down on they`re face and die suddenly, and ESO needs to step up it`s PVE content (that is not locked behind DLC paywalls) as well as balancing some classes and skill trees. I will not discuss player housing, cosmetics or events as these are what you`d expect from any other MMO just done in a higher quality and more appealing way.  The buy to pay approach is excellent for getting a feel for the game, and for the first time in MMO history a dev actually made leveling FUN, varied and most important of all NOT SODDING BORING. There is much to like about ESO but there is also the mark of impending doom as one small misstep from the devs could prove fatal (yes all the signs of previous failed MMO`s are here) but so far they proved to be on the level keeping things going smooth and safe. And with the new Elsweyr chapter arriving soon we can only hope things will get better.

Part 2! The fuckening.
So let`s discuss progression. OH BOY if it ain`t fucked from the very beginning. While going anywhere and level up cause scaling makes sure everything is fine, dandy and fair....where`s the challenge?! I ain`t gonna get hyped cause of the epic quest I did in let`s say Shadowfen (no one likes Shadowfen let`s be honest now) at level 45 when someone else right next to me just dinged level 5 doing the SAME QUEST!!! And this applies to the rest of the game even in itemization. Itemization is totally up the bum with random world drops being as viable as dungeon loot or even substitutes for some Trial loot. Basicly no matter what you do....you CAN AND WILL get end game gear. So having at least SOME progression zones would be nice, like some areas for levels 1-10, most for 10-40 and finally 40-50 and end game content. I don`t think that would be much of a sacrifice.
Speaking of progression let`s talk dungeons. Short version: pretty good! While they go from easy to hard faster than the Mclaren X reaches 100 per hour it suffers from a bad case of LACK OF MECHANICS. Most later added dungeons (DLC) have quite a large amount of do a certain something or get a one shot kill to the face. Same goes for Trials. As a concept it`s great. You don`t need to put away 3 hours of your life for them, biggest one being Halls of Fabrication in a worst case scenario could be an hour and a half. Variety is high both in design and mechanics, and some as Sanctum Ophidia, Asylum Sanctorium and Cloudrest are nice boss rush style runs. Veteran difficulty is where most people will find the challenge they seek.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",ok grain salt scroll fan best invention porn kid spent 600 hour placing bucket head non controlled artificial skyrim no_this not_skyrim bit sad big standalone massively multiplayer scene unfortunately eso feel social experiment ran mad scientist zenimax good e universe play world mostly abundance lore specific region race faction past tamriel event lead single series world great treated single task objective given non driven friend randoms join fun great task objective given non truly unique region amazingly detailed ooze atmosphere no_matter feel real class follow standard e rule choose template expand handed giant sword skinny robed wizard not_a giant orc spellcaster channel spell bow yes please variety hook build test please aid come please scaled higher state play wherever task objective given non grind dungeon unrestricted approach available crafting depth expect e title offering usual array option weapon cook craft metal armor robe alchemy enchanting furniture housing sluggish slow interesting appeal diverse crafted world pick profession immerse economy thriving world mediocre mentioned please available class whatever gear skill wish catch reach maximum repeatedly performing action gain resource champion point post progression allows augment class changing role brick wall progression not_all class skill tree created equal viability build essential massively multiplayer producer wide variety option limited reach endgame wields 2 sword robe summons defend not_be best viable difficult dungeon slowly eating variety dividing community roll unique approach left increase difficulty veteran dungeon player progress min max approach bad oh boy talk downloadable additional released initial launch questionable 3 type downloadable additional released initial launch 1 major addition add feature mechanic morrowind summerset elsweyr arround corner great offering class world quest dungeon gear expand best 2 task objective given non hub orsinium dark brotherhood thief guild murkmire offer task objective given non 2 case guild skill tree long term e fan fond fancy stealing murdering covered lack impact designated guild quest thieving expanded offer earn cash xp side 3 dungeon yes dungeon sold separate 2 dungeon downloadable additional released initial launch pack mind boggling selling endgame gating community forcing spend not_want release redeeming quality trial eso large group player tackling difficult challenge content offer chance downloadable additional released initial launch gear adequate not_as depth mechanic based massively multiplayer wow prime example excellent raiding offer challenge decent reward dedicated player versus amazing arena battleground mode alliance war pit 3 faction war fort resource nod capture blast siege weapon constructed actual player siege enemy fort rewarding offer 2 skill tree prove viable versus environment build conclusion not_covered aspect element massively multiplayer reviewed informed decision final note recommend picking copy base giving mixed bag far walked fine line already fell pit led massively multiplayer closed constant addition improvement running community running strong number not_as big million unfortunately history showed versus oriented massively multiplayer tendency lay face die suddenly eso need versus environment not_locked downloadable additional released initial launch paywalls balancing class skill tree not_discuss housing cosmetic event expect massively multiplayer higher quality appealing pay approach excellent massively multiplayer history leveling fun varied important not_sodding boring eso mark impending doom small misstep prove fatal yes sign failed massively multiplayer far proved keeping thing smooth safe elsweyr chapter arriving soon hope thing 2 fuckening discus progression oh boy fucked beginning anywhere cause scaling make fine dandy fair challenge gon na hyped cause epic task objective given non s_emphasizeday shadowfen no_one like shadowfen honest 45 someone else next dinged 5 task objective given non applies rest itemization_emphasized totally bum random world drop viable dungeon item reward dropped defeated enemy substitute trial item reward dropped defeated enemy basicly no_matter gear progression zone nice area level 1_emphasized0 10 40 finally 40 50 t_emphasizedhink sacrifice speaking progression talk dungeon short version pretty good easy hard faster mclaren x reach 100 per suffers bad lack mechanic dungeon downloadable additional released initial launch large certain shot kill face go trial concept great 3 hour life biggest hall fabrication worst scenario half variety high design mechanic sanctum ophidia asylum sanctorium cloudrest nice bos rush style run veteran difficulty challenge seek

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Edit: TL:DR 
Best MMORPG I've ever played, definitely worth checking out. One character, ALL content including classes, jobs etc. BASE GAME AND FIRST EXPANSION ARE NOW FREE TO PLAY, with some restrictions. 

BTW. I have made some updates to this review to reflect patches.

I gave up WoW (or World of Warcraft) For this game. Why? You only need one character to play every class. [strike]The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs.[/strike] (Edit: They changed this feature not too long ago to make all classes self contained. They still level up into Jobs but you are no longer required to have a sub class to unlock the Job.) 

You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 95% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF! You don't have to be in a guild or part of a clique. The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive (on some realms...like Molboro!). 

Dungeons are part of a finder in game. There is also a personal/free company housing system that allows you to have a space to show off and decorate in. As of Shadowbringers, dungeons in end game can now be done with a Trust system where you run with NPCs. There was also an update to squadrons that let you do up to heavensward with a handpicked NPC group.

The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing. The (original) opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words. Square has really outdone themselves with this title and I can't wait to see how they wow me with FFXV!

Edit: As per a commented question, The sub options come in 30/90/180 day increments and can be set up as recurring (thanks Pasty858). 180 days is roughly $78.
As a further Edit: The sub is required to access the game and comes in two types, one that allows only one character per realm (all that is really needed) and one that lets you have up to 8 (I think) characters per realm (for the altoholics). The 1 character per realm Sub is less expensive.

Also, anyone who would like to share in the recruit a friend benefits, message me.

SO! Its been a while since I've played. after logging over 200 hours that weren't counted on here, and doing everything short of Savage content, I have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again. But this game. The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming. It was amazing! 

Edit as of Dec 12, 2020
I'm now playing on the Ps4 as well as Pc, have logged another 1000 hours and am almost endgame again, I was not thrilled with Stormblood but Shadowbringers is amazing so far!


If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month ([strike]or 14day[/strike] trial now goes up to heavensward content, see below) trial period!

A note to anyone new, the free trial is now available all the way up through level 60 and the first expansion Heavensward! I'm not sure how long the trial lasts, but it free to anyone and now is the best time to jump in! Exp has been increased, Main Storyline Quests have been optimized and new Jobs have been added.

I would like to add a note, now that I have finished MSQ for Shadowbringers, please don't level skip. If you do, please at least go back and learn basics. If you're not interested in the story, fine but don't let that stop you from being the best you can be at your chosen role.

1721470,Poppy Playtime,"Although a very good game both Gameplay and Story wise, my main issues are with the Game's Marketing and Game studio.
1. They locked teasers behind a Digital Paywall using NFTs, as a way of ""Jumping onto the Trend"".
2. The Chapter 1 is basically just a 30 minute introducion with no real variety and can be considered just a Tech demo. Yet, is is 5 dollars? 5 Dollars for 30 minutes? Games like Five Nights at Freddy's cost similar and have multiple hours of content.
3. Look, we only got a 30 minute chapter and we already got NFTs, a Merch Shop and a Clickbait YT Series for Kids made by the OWN CREATORS OF THE GAME.
Extra: Their YT Series ""Fazbear and Friends"", which casts FNaF Character in their Minecraft versions has a Merch store.
Although Monetization of the videos is normal, they are literally making money off a FNaF Fan Project, something which Scott Cawthon has said not to.

440,Team Fortress 2,"Chilli con carne recipe

if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Chilli con carne recipe you've come to the right place,

Ingredients

1 large onion
1 red pepper
2 garlic cloves
1 tbsp oil
1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder (or 1 level tbsp if you only have mild)

1 tsp paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
500g lean minced beef
1 beef stock cube
400g can chopped tomatoes
½ tsp dried marjoram
1 tsp sugar (or add a thumbnail-sized piece of dark chocolate along with the beans instead, see tip)

2 tbsp tomato purée
410g can red kidney beans
plain boiled long grain rice, to serve
soured cream, to serve

Directions

STEP 1
Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.

STEP 2
Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.

STEP 3
Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).

STEP 4
Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.

STEP 5
Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.

STEP 6
Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

STEP 7
Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.

STEP 8
Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.

STEP 9
Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.

916440,Anno 1800,"After 170 hours my overall experience is that i've loved it so far. (please note i have only played up to season 2 DLC at this point) 

Also this is assuming you can look passed the whole Ubisoft connect thing ( i know, we all hate it, but if you can just kinda pretend it isn't there, you're in for a good time)

The good:
Lovely soundtrack.
Looks great.
Runs smoothly.
can be a really relaxing experience ( vs easier AI or no AI) 
Starts of slow, but the more islands and regions you build the more complex it becomes.
can play co-op with a friend and build up the same islands together which is nice. 
can be as challenging or as chilled as you like (based on difficulty and number of AI)
Stamps are now in the game which is nice (basically you can create templates which greatly increase the speed at which you can place down a design for infrastructure)

The Bad: 
Combat is really not amazing, and seems to be a bit of an after thought, the AI build so many defences that you would need a large fleet to take them out and that is going to take a loooong time before you can get there. Plus as soon as you or an AI declares war, your trade network just gets obliterated as they pass by enemy islands on their merry (and doomed) way. So for me at least that kind of forces the buy them out route, but good that this is at least an option i guess.

The balancing of resources using the in game statistics although not terrible is not the most informative, using some basic maths the closest you're going to get to figuring out how much you need to send/import to different islands is an educated guess. 

The campaign isn't the best as the story is kinda meh, but you don't play it for the story really.



Overall: if you like tropico/cities skylines type games, you will most likely love this.
Edit:
I would possibly recommend playing the base game first both to see how you like it without spending too much, and not to overwhelm yourself with content. if you like the base game start introducing season packs as suits you.","Very Positive82% of the 13,562 user reviews for this game are positive.",170 hour loved far please note season 2 downloadable additional released initial launch assuming passed connect hate kinda pretend t_emphasizedhere good good lovely soundtrack look great run smoothly relaxing v easier ai no_ai start slow island region build complex play mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal friend build island nice challenging chilled based difficulty number ai stamp nice basically template greatly increase speed design infrastructure bad combat not_amazing bit thought ai build defence large fleet loooong plus soon ai declares war trade network get obliterated pas enemy island merry doomed kind force route good guess balancing resource statistic not_terrible not_the informative basic math closest figuring send import different island educated guess series connected mission level form storyline t_emphasizedhe best kinda meh play tropico city skyline type game love possibly recommend base spending not_to overwhelm base introducing season pack suit

1966720,Lethal Company,"wage slave simulator, i got molested by spiders for $8.50/hour

The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.

Its extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.
Hearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.
It truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.

PERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:
A monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.
Imagine hearing your friend, rounding the corner, and realizing that your friend is already long dead...","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 274,684 user reviews for this game are positive.",wage slave simulator molested spider 8 50 trailer justice extremely player purchase play official release spectacular super dynamic proximity chat make hearing muffled scream someone choked bug followed shortly panicked wail crewmember running life funniest thing experienced video truly simple infinitely expandable mechanic exited build future personal idea read monster pick target stalk follow silently stalking monster record whatever target say stalked kill target turn hunter ambush predator staying stationary dark recorded sound dead target order lure friend imagine hearing friend rounding corner realizing friend already long dead

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"The developer has always made sure that any elements in the game can be reached through playing for a reasonable amount of time. However, in the last update, he decided to introduce a new currency. This currency is only available in exchange for your money amd can not be earned through playing the game. You can only spend this new currency on a gacha system. This system introduced a new mechanic that allows you to absolutely steamroll the competition that doesnt have it. Luckily you get 1 free rol per week and there is a pity system that allows you to receive said mechanic after 200 rols. Meaning the F2P playerbase can get it within 4 years of actively playing once a week. And if you throw money at the problem it will only cost you €400 or so.

The developer does not seem to listen to the feedback and suggestions from the community, even though there are multiple seperate channels in the discord reserved for it. If you speak the truth in the discord you will be silenced and banned.

Great game turned incredibly P2W with a shitty non communicative developer.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"Rock and stone!

Having played Vampire Survivors and Halls of Torment, I will say this game falls short of both but has a nice shiny DRG coat of paint on it that gives it some charm. Endpoint character progression in this feels less god-like than in the previous two mentioned games. There are also several frustrations I have with the core mechanics of the game that make me not recommend this game.

1) Each level is on a strict timer because of the drop pod. If you miss the drop pod at the end of the level, you automatically fail. Because of this timer, the foremost goal isn't actually to kill the enemies, it's to complete your objective and gather minerals. Enemies exist as a barricade between you and your next objective/mineral. I strongly feel this is antithetical to this genre.

2a) Aimed attacks with keyboard movement. Certain guns fire where the playing is looking, or in the case of the Gunner's first default minigun, fires only when looking at an enemy. Keyboard movement lacks the radial precision for this type of gameplay, being that WASD can only move in eight directions. This is exacerbated by the following problem.

2b) Aimed attacks with mining mechanic. Mining requires the player to be facing a mineral or a wall. As such, two core mechanics are in direct opposition with each other. Similar to point 1, rather than encouraging the player to kill enemies AND get stronger, you must choose between killing enemies OR getting stronger. I find this frustrating design.

3) Weapon overclocking is poorly structured. Unlocking new weapons should feel exciting but feel underwhelming to use because they are grossly underpowered until you fully level one up in a single run. Only on subsequent runs is a weapon fun to use. It feels like you are encouraged to sandbag a run just to level up a weapon to max before having fun with it. I think this is poor design, as this structure undercuts the exciting feeling of unlocking new weapons.

4) Meta-progression is not exciting. Surviving an entire run just to upgrade my meta-progression reload speed by +2% or my movement speed by +2% is not exciting. There is no variety in these progressions: no extra projectiles, no increased damage of a specific elemental type, no upgrades to Bosco, not even a revive that is common to this genre of games. I do not excitedly look forward to my next meta-progression upgrades; I upgrade because there's a red icon that says I can.

5) This is a minor gripe but within the context of Deep Rock Galactic, movement in this game is poor. In Deep Rock Galactic, each class has a unique way to traverse the tunnels: scout has a quick grappling hook, gunner has a slow but permanent zipline, engineer can create stairs or close gaps, driller can terraform many times faster than the others. I think not adapting each class's unique traversal to this game is a mistake.","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",stone vampire survivor hall torment fall short nice shiny drg coat paint give charm endpoint progression feel god mentioned game frustration core mechanic not_recommend 1 strict timer drop pod miss drop pod automatically fail timer foremost goal kill enemy complete objective gather mineral enemy exist barricade next objective mineral strongly antithetical genre 2a aimed attack keyboard movement certain gun fire gunner default minigun fire enemy keyboard movement lack radial precision type wasd move eight direction exacerbated following problem 2b aimed attack mining mechanic mining requires facing mineral wall core mechanic direct opposition similar 1 rather encouraging kill enemy stronger choose killing enemy stronger frustrating design 3 weapon overclocking poorly structured unlocking weapon exciting underwhelming grossly underpowered single subsequent run weapon fun feel encouraged sandbag weapon max fun poor design structure undercut exciting feeling unlocking weapon 4 effective popular strategy character build progression not_exciting surviving upgrade effective popular strategy character build progression reload speed 2 movement speed 2 not_exciting no_variety progression no_extra projectile no_increased damage specific elemental type no_upgrades bosco not_even revive common genre game not_excitedly forward next effective popular strategy character build progression upgrade upgrade red icon say 5 minor gripe context deep galactic movement poor deep galactic class unique traverse tunnel scout quick grappling hook gunner slow permanent zipline engineer stair close gap driller terraform time faster others not_adapting class unique traversal mistake

1938090,Call of Duty®,"[h1] You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards ""casuals"", nor ""the OGs"" of the COD community [/h1]

Before I get into the title and explain why you shouldn't bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it's kind, I'm going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don't.

[u] What I like [/u]
I) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn't on the AK, when converting it to 5.45.
II) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn't worth it since it didn't make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should've done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy's spawn, not punished for it.

[u] What I dislike [/u]
I) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later.
•Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing.
•Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the ""immersion"" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly.
•The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It's like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a ""brand new game"".
•Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect.
•The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter's shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of ""realism"" to normies who think they've become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive.
•Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll.
II) You might be thinking ""Woah, that's a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn't have messed up worse this time?"". If that's what's on your mind, you'd be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves.
•The UI is some of the worse I've ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn't work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it'd be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is?
•There is this new ""ledge hang"" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It's also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you.
•On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn't like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max [b] every weapon level for every gun to unlock all the attachments for a single gun. [/b] MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it's not even remotely the case.

[h1] So, going back to the title I chose, who is this game targeted towards? [/h1]

[u] Is it targeted towards the ""OGs""? [/u] 
Of course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The ""OGs"" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the ""red dots"" on the minimap and the perk ""dead silence"", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.

[u] So, is MWII2022 targeted towards ""casuals""? [/u] 
Again, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don't have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new ""receiver"" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.

[u] So what is it? Who are they catering to? [/u]
[b] This is just my take, but to me, it's quite obvious. They are catering to whales. A small minority of neglected children and adult toddlers with too much spare time and money on their hands, who's entire life revolves around watching pixels on a screen change colors. This is the purpose of all these recent AAA business practices (grindy battle passes and challenges, ""cosmetic microtransactions"", hidden matchmaking algorithms etc.), to turn you into a loser who wastes their time helping the publisher brag about ""player retention"" to their investors, and their money buying grossly overpriced digital outfits and camos just to feel something new, because the gameplay itself is not enough to give you any kind of fulfillment. DO NOT GIVE IN, and if you have kids, don't let them play modern online AAA games, because they are designed to get gullible people (which every child is) hooked and detached from reality. Don't waste your life on games that take your time for granted. Do you want to achieve something noteworthy in your life, or do you want to throw it all away for some greedy billionaire? It's your choice, but believe me, there isn't time for both. [/b]

 Thank you for reading my review. I don't do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.","Mixed57% of the 529,504 user reviews for this game are positive.",mislead not_targeted neither_towards casuals nor_the ogs cod community title explain bother wasting mwii2022 aaa game kind specific thing select variant weapon platform taking attachment slot mw19 ak74u became utterly obsolete galil ace introduced nearly identical fire rate 74u superior range extra attachment slot ak converting 5 45 ii nice qol choice select wan na killstreaks scorestreaks cod game gave choice perk convert killstreaks scorestreaks typically worth difference difficult streak depending mode player choose whichever system long ago imo player rewarded objective waiting strategic location ambush defeat player enemy choke near enemy player enemy enter world not_punished dislike pretty issue present mw19 including bug present mwii2022 3 year final killcams software programming error cause unexpected behavior stopping abruptly player screen disappearing object pop 5 metre front breaking immersion infinity ward keep bragging constantly riot shield invincibility bug somehow returned third 4 year copy paste 1 0 version hud bit brand flashbangs completely broken blinded 5 second battle hardened perk reduces reducing effect visual kick weapon greatly exaggerated compared real life gun bobbed forth shooter s_emphasizedhoulder dislocated shot guess wan na false sense realism normies gun expert watching gun video youtube worst offender m16 bob sway firing inaccurate m4 completely counter intuitive accurate attachment stats introduced black ops cold war present vanguard removed whatever make choosing dozen attachment category dice roll ii woah bug single digit iq design choice surely messed worse mind wrong oh boy outdo ui worse videogame ui element overlap frequent example challenge lobby screen overlapping navigating weapon progression menu buggy k infinity ward thought good idea shove message boot press escape disconnected search scroll mouse wheel huh ape design menu noone realize confusing ledge hang mechanic allows hang ledge climbing not_a bad idea paper cannot_be disabled causing frequently trigger accidentally taking primary weapon interrupting gunfight killed buggy mechanic climb ledge quickly operator kind seizure remains ledge press space hurting pace increasing likelihood killed screwing paper addition receiver separately 5 attachment slot good idea activision good idea issue implementation attachment shared weapon platform platform good paper player max weapon gun unlock attachment single gun mw19 cold war vanguard already incredibly grindy matter worse previously casual hand wanted gun exclusively order unlock best attachment single gun spend 100 hour leveling gun infinity ward catering casuals seeing complain not_even remotely title chose targeted towards targeted towards ogs course not_the hidden algorithm mw19 force lobby finish eliminating social aspect online gaming punish particular ogs despise algorithm reason cod pro veteran abandoned franchise alltogether removed legacy mechanic red dot minimap perk dead silence discouraged waiting strategic location ambush defeat player enemy playstyle cod community notoriously dislike mwii2022 targeted towards casuals casual player log hour returning turn brain grind upwards 1000 weapon level 100 hour complete receiver forced compete sweaty environment sbmm lobby catering obvious catering whale small minority neglected child adult toddler spare hand life revolves watching pixel screen color purpose recent aaa business practice grindy battle pass challenge cosmetic microtransactions hidden matchmaking algorithm turn loser waste helping publisher brag retention investor buying grossly overpriced digital outfit camo not_enough kind fulfillment not_give kid play modern online aaa game designed gullible child hooked detached reality waste life game granted achieve noteworthy life throw greedy billionaire choice believe t_emphasizedime reading review cod gaming franchise grew butchered name greed developer redeem cheap gimmick painful infuriating hope simpler videogames unknowingly pleasant memory indie developer count
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I'm incredibly happy to see the injection of new players after WoW shat the bed with Shadowlands and 9.1. I played WoW for nearly a decade of my life and through every expansion to endgame, and I have to say that Blizzard doesn't hold a candle to ANYTHING Square Enix has pushed out for FFXIV. Allow me to explain, starting with the cons of FFXIV:

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
[*] Buying the game can be frustrating. There are two methods: through Steam or through Square Enix's websites. If you buy it on one platform you cannot use it on the other. [strike]I [b] HIGHLY [/b] recommend looking something up to walk you through it.[/strike] Square Enix has updated their website and the Mogstation to make it easier to purchase the game and the expansions through their client. I recommend taking this route rather than through Steam.
[/list]

[h1] The Middling [/h1]
Now, this isn't necessarily a negative, but some might think so.
[list]
[*] This is a story-driven game. It can be difficult to play with friends to go through quests since many of the main story quests will have you go into an instance by yourself. There are hundreds of hours of main story quests (it's thicc af), and almost all of it is good; however, some expansions are better than others and each have their own theme and build off of each other. ARR (vanilla) is arguably the worst, but begins to pick up about halfway through, and the rest of the expansions are excellent with Shadowbringers being one of the best narratives I've seen in an MMORPG. The newest expansion, Endwalker, has surpassed Shadowbringers in terms of story quality in my opinion.
[*] You can skip entire portions of story quests by purchasing story skips from the Mogstation. If you have disposable income and don't really care for the story, then you can buy these. You can also purchase cosmetics, orchestration rolls, housing items, and emotes via the cash-shop in the Mogstation. I personally never look at these because there is an abundance of content in the game already.
[*] Add-ons are against the terms of service since PC players and console players are playing together and add-ons that affect the game's code create unfair gameplay between the two. However, the game functions just fine without them.
[*] Buying the current expansion also unlocks all of the expansions before it. However, the same rules apply as it does setting up your account. You have to buy the base game [b]and[/b] the expansion on the same platform otherwise it won't work.
[/list]

[h1] The Good/Excellent [/h1]
As previously stated, I've played WoW for years, and the following game mechanics and features completely outstrip WoW in terms of functionality and enjoyment.
[list]
[*] [b] Your character can be every single class and profession (in FFXIV terms, jobs) and you can switch between them with literally a click of your mouse. [/b] This game respects your time immensely. Tired of playing the Archer/Bard? No problem! Switch on over to your Gladiator/Paladin and nothing changes except your class. Not only that, but classes receive something called an Armory Bonus that increases experience gained up to your maximum leveled class.
[*] Classes are all unique and morph into specialized classes. Class categories share a small pool of general abilities, like basic defensives or casting modifiers.
[*] There are daily quests, mostly in the form of Beast Tribe dailies. You can do 12 of these a day, and they reward you with unique currency that you can spend at the factions along with reputation. It might sound like a small amount of dailies, but the reputation gain is proportional. And better yet, flying isn't gated behind getting reputation with these factions (thank god). The reason this is a pro is due to the fact that it holds no bearing on anything else in the game and nothing is locked behind it (other than faction-specific mounts and pets and whatnot).
[*] The subscription is cheaper than WoW, and they give you veteran rewards every few months that you're subscribed.
[*] Chocobo racing and Gold Saucer nonsense. Be sure the play the mini and jumbo Cactpot (I call the jumbo Cactpot the Cuckedpot though because you'll never win the jackpot).
[*] The UI is entirely customizable down to the colors of enemy and friendly health bars. No need for an add-on or anything to change stuff around.
[*] Random drops exist, but that's not really the focus of the gear game, especially at end game content. Many duties (FFXIV's equivalent to dungeons and raids) will reward you with both random drops and tokens or currency to trade in for [b] specific [/b] pieces of gear. This means you don't have to grind the same raid or trial for the specific drop for weeks, and instead just buy an equivalent piece instead.
[*] Gearing up a class at endgame is incredibly fast so that you can get into the meat and potatoes of the hardcore raiding content.
[*] The duties are all unique and bosses rarely repeat mechanics from other duties. Most of the duties don't have artificial difficulty scalers, like arbitrarily more health or damage. Instead, bosses rely on complex and interesting mechanics. Savage, Extreme, Unreal, and Ultimate boss fights will also scale with health and damage and will require a certain DPS check, but when you're doing these you know what you're in for and what is required.
[*] Duties have their own unique soundtrack, and many bosses also have unique soundtracks and battle music. Honestly, most of it is top tier music.
[*] Almost all previous content is brought forward into the new expansion or content patch. Dungeons from ARR still reward currency that is usable at max level. Some unique content from previous expansions are expanded on and given new activities to do. Gear/stat scaling is applied in a remarkably balanced way. Square Enix routinely patches current and past content, all the way back to 2.0 (ARR vanilla).
[*] The game is pretty. Gear sets are unique to each dungeon, trial, or raid, and many have dyeable versions that can be crafted (I'm looking at you, WoW, with your reskinned gear sets from every dungeon in an expansion). Most harder difficulty content of the same duty rewards equipment that looks completely different from the previous difficulty, or they follow a certain theme. Regardless, the equipment will look different and rarely is it recolored.
[*] Raids and trials aren't long endeavors that take hours upon hours to complete, or even days. Almost all of them can be completed in less than an hour, and if you're there for more than an hour then you're doing something very very wrong.
[*] The crafting in this game is just [i] chef kiss.[/i] The same materials are used more or less throughout the whole game and can be farmed very easily. Not only that, but the game incentivizes you to use the crafting abilities to make high-quality craftables. In fact, it gives you the option to craft it quickly or take your time to really get that good good. There are also a few different types of crafting activities that involve items that are classified as collectables and reward special currency for nifty mounts, minions (pets), and cosmetics.
[*] The list goes on, but go see for yourself. The free trial includes ARR and the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions to the amount of time played. There are, however, some restrictions regarding social functions and in-game marketboard stuff.
[/list]

[h1] The Verdict: 9/10 [/h1]
FFXIV is one of the best MMORPGs currently available with a storyline that hooks deep into your gills. The game has many quality of life features that surpass its competitors. It also respects your time. The free trial is also exceptionally generous.","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",incredibly happy injection player wow shat bed shadowlands 9 1 wow nearly decade life major addition add feature mechanic endgame blizzard hold candle square enix pushed ffxiv allow explain starting con ffxiv bad buying frustrating method square enix website on_emphasizede platform cannot_use strike highly recommend walk strike square enix updated website mogstation easier purchase expansion client recommend taking route rather middling necessarily negative driven difficult play friend quest quest instance hundred hour quest thicc af good expansion others theme build arr vanilla arguably worst begin pick halfway rest expansion excellent shadowbringers best narrative massively multiplayer role newest major addition add feature mechanic endwalker surpassed shadowbringers term quality skip portion quest purchasing skip mogstation disposable income care purchase cosmetic orchestration roll housing item emotes via cash shop mogstation personally never_look abundance already add ons term service pc player console player add ons affect code unfair function fine buying major addition add feature mechanic unlocks expansion rule apply setting base major addition add feature mechanic platform good excellent previously stated wow year following mechanic feature completely outstrip wow term functionality enjoyment single class profession ffxiv term job switch literally click mouse respect immensely tired archer bard no_problem switch gladiator paladin change except class not_only class receive called armory bonus increase gained maximum leveled class_emphasizedes unique morph specialized class class category share small pool general ability basic defensive casting modifier daily quest mostly form beast tribe daily 12 reward unique currency spend faction along reputation sound small daily reputation gain proportional flying gated reputation faction god a_emphasized highly skilled experienced due hold no_bearing else locked faction specific mount pet whatnot subscription cheaper wow veteran reward month subscribed chocobo racing gold saucer nonsense play mini jumbo cactpot call jumbo cactpot cuckedpot never_win jackpot ui entirely customizable color enemy friendly health bar no_need add stuff random drop exist not_really focus gear especially duty ffxiv equivalent dungeon raid reward random drop token currency trade specific piece gear mean grind large group player tackling difficult challenge trial specific drop week equivalent piece gearing class endgame incredibly fast meat potato hardcore raiding duty unique boss rarely repeat mechanic duty duty artificial difficulty scaler arbitrarily health damage boss rely complex interesting mechanic savage extreme unreal ultimate bos fight scale health damage require certain damage per check required duty unique soundtrack boss unique soundtrack battle music honestly top tier music brought forward major addition add feature mechanic software fix bug balance add feature dungeon arr reward currency usable max unique expansion expanded given activity gear stat scaling applied remarkably balanced square enix routinely patch past 2 0 arr vanilla pretty gear set unique dungeon trial large group player tackling difficult challenge dyeable version crafted wow reskinned gear set dungeon major addition add feature mechanic harder difficulty duty reward equipment look completely different difficulty follow certain theme equipment different rarely recolored raid trial long endeavor hour hour complete day completed very_emphasized wrong crafting chef kiss material throughout farmed easily not_only incentivizes crafting ability high quality craftables give craft quickly good_emphasized different type crafting activity involve item classified collectable reward special currency nifty mount minion pet cosmetic go trial includes arr award winning heavensward major addition add feature mechanic 60 no_restrictions restriction regarding social function marketboard stuff verdict 9 10 ffxiv best mmorpgs currently available storyline hook deep gill quality life feature surpass competitor respect trial exceptionally generous

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Jedi Survivor is a third person action game set in the Star Wars universe, where Cal Kestis returns for the sequel to Fallen Order, in search for a home safe from the Empire.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Combat is mostly enjoyable as you’ll use Cal’s lightsaber and force powers to defeat various enemies including stormtroopers, bounty hunters, large and small wildlife, and various types of droids (some recognisable from episode 1).

•	Lightsaber has five stances to choose from, including single or dual wield, double blade, Kylo Ren style 2 handed, and single blade combined with a blaster. Each stance can be upgraded with special moves. I mostly used the double blade as it features fast attacks and long reach, which helped me to evade enemy attacks.

•	Many enemies will try to shoot you from long range, but if you time blocks correctly, your lightsaber will deflect the blaster bolts back to damage or kill the enemy.

•	I regularly used force push to knock weaker enemies off ledges for instant kills. One time I even managed to do this to a miniboss who still had about 80% of their health bar remaining. You can also use the force to pull enemies, throw your lightsaber, and use mind trick to make enemies attack each other.

•	Most of the game takes place on the planets Koboh and Jedah, in addition to a couple of smaller planets and a brief visit to Coruscant.

•	Playing on Jedi Knight difficulty (the middle of five options), combat is challenging but mostly fair. I really struggled with the final boss [spoiler]who for some reason is significantly more powerful than Darth Vader[/spoiler], and because I wasn’t enjoying the game for reasons that I’m about to get to, eventually I just dropped down to story mode so I could be done with it.

•	Much of the action takes place miles above ground level, and you have to navigate terribly designed maps which are full of huge gaps where you can fall to an instant death. You’ll need to jump, double jump, air dash, wall run, grapple and rope swing. The further you progress in the game, and the more force powers you unlock, the longer and more annoying these sequences become, regularly requiring the player to chain together 15-20 moves, and if you slightly miss time anything, you’ll have to go all the way back to the start of the sequence and do it all again. And there were a number of occasions where I was confused about where I needed to go next, or how to actually get there, which frequently interrupted the pace of the combat.

•	Sure, Fallen Order had some sections like this, but while those were relatively short, Jedi Survivor’s maps are entirely built around it. Maybe some players like this kind of gameplay, but I don’t. It reminds me of the difference between Doom 2016 (which I loved) and Doom Eternal (which I hated, and yes I know I’m in the minority there too).

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	Story is nothing special, I think it suffers from the villains not being interesting characters, but its at least better than some of the recent Disney+ TV shows (Boba Fett, Obi-Wan, Ahsoka).

•	Cal’s struggle with the dark side, and his relationships with the companions who previously appeared in Jedi Order, especially Merrin, did at least provide some excitement.

•	Voice acting is good.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	It took me 25 hours to complete the main story and a few side quests.

•	While I didn’t notice any significant framerate drops, the performance doesn’t feel smooth, like there are frequent small stutters (i7-12700K, 32GB DDR4, RTX 3080, 1440p). The first few hours seemed mostly fine, but it got worse the further I progressed. Koboh has the worst problems, but as its also the biggest planet, this is where you’ll spend the most time.

•	I also regularly noticed white flashes at the edge of the screen while panning the camera sideways inside buildings. I can’t remember seeing this before in other games so I don’t know what is causing it, perhaps the game was loading textures slightly slowly, even though its installed on my SSD.

•	The game optimises some files (I’m assuming shaders) every time you start it up, it doesn’t take long, but considering the above issues, I’m not sure if this actually does anything.

•	The game crashed twice with no error message. By itself its not the end of the world (I can live with 2 crashes in 25 hours), but it still deserves to be added to this list of shame.

•	Level up menu doesn’t tell you what the abilities further up the tree actually do until you acquire the ability immediately below it. I’ve never seen a game do this, usually you can see the whole skill tree to plan your character build in advance, so this is a really dumb design decision.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

Jedi Survivor isn’t a terrible game, and if Steam’s review system allowed a neutral option I would have picked that, but overall my feelings are more negative than positive.

While my dislike for the aerial gymnastics is a personal preference which other players might not have a problem with, you’ll still have to deal with unacceptable technical performance which gets in the way of the otherwise enjoyable combat and story.

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"This game was amazing in 2020/Early 2021. Since then, [b][u]RavenSoftware[/u] has been ruining/changing it and taking things away[/b], and here we are with them being involved in Warzone 2.

[h1]1. [b]They ruined the Map[/b][/h1]
Took away [b]Verdansk[/b] & brought [b]Caldera[/b]. --- Which killed Battle-Royal & made Rebirth Island popular 2 years after release, where majority only played Resurgance. Resurgance had permanent full playlist [i](Solos, Duos, Trios, Quads)[/i], prior it was 2 per week.

[h1]2. [b]They ruined TTK[/b][/h1]
Where SMGs can kill you within 165-250ms (Human blink is 400ms), a [b][i]Throwing Knife[/i][/b] insta kill a FULLY ARMORED enemy from Chest up, BUT a SNIPER that's heavier than LMG, which ADS slow [b]needs 3 headshots.[/b]
[list]
[*]Certain SMGs did more damage per bullet, than Snipers NECKSHOTS!
[*]Certain Heavy .50Cal Snipers literally needed 7-9 Bodyshots.
[*]SMGs & ARs can shoot FURTHER than Snipers with higher Bullet Velocity! [i](yes even SMGs)[/i] ""RavenSoftware Gun Balance""[/list]

[h1]3. [b]They ruined basic game Movements[/b][/h1]
You ran FASTER holding VG AR, than you do with fists!! --- Yes, picking up an Assault Rifle sometimes meant that you now run faster than the guy without a heavy weapon, or any weapon at all.

[h1]4. [b]They ruined Attachments[/b][/h1]
They've Created bugs that were never fixed for 3 years on their [b][i]'Trello'[/i][/b][strike][i] (too many to list)[/i][/strike] 
All whilst giving us 0 Comments, 0 Explanation, 0 ETA for a fix, if any would ever come, as plenty stayed broken to this day.

[h1]5. [b]They ruined Camos[/b][/h1]
[b]FREE CAMOS USED TO LOOK WAY BETTER![/b]
They've historically PURPOSELY changed FREE CAMOS that we earned through grinding camo challenges to look worse as time goes! [u]The SAME Camos[/u] from 2020/2021 [u]got changed to be worse in animation & sometimes 80% less gun coverage[/u] in 2022. --- a 'cheap' way to promote Store Bundles even more.

[h1]6. [b]Overbuffed AimAssist[/b][/h1]
AA works like Aimbot, through smoke, stun, goes to the next opponent when you kill the first one, reaction time faster than humanely possible, can 100% accurately predict movements (so no point trying to go left & right, the player won't be thrown off unlike Mouse & keyboard). Plenty of M&K streamers switched to controller after this. --- See Point #10 for more.

[h1]7. [b][u]Extremely STUBBORN![/u][/b][/h1] 
There are tweets that have gotten 200k+ likes, ton of #1 Reddit Trending threads, E-Sports articles, polls, videos etc [b]DEMANDING SNIPERS HEADSHOTS to be back[/b], it gets ignored where some Snipers sit at 0.03% Pickrate. --- ""We see positive metrics & snipers are in a healthy usage.""

In 2021, there were celeberties tweeting ""NERF DMR"" (Which RavenSoftware broke), people held signs on the streets at intersection saying ""NERF DMR"". They were still defending it, saying they've seen ""positive metrics"", same words they're using for Snipers Headshots nerf.

It's okay to be innovative, try new things, change stuff around. But to be completely stubborn, in denial & completely neglect your community is why this game got ""MOSTLY NEGATIVE"" reviews!

[b]Steam Reviews in a way exposed the ""YESMEN"" pages & actually reflected the community overall feelings.[/b]

[h1]8. [b]Completely DISCONNECTED from the community/Game & only focus on 1%'s Streamers[/b][/h1]
A Small tweet from a random 'influencer' can get something changed, but an outrage on Reddit/Twitter, Esports Articles etc for 10 months+ is ignored.

[b]Gave Streamers Anti-Cheat bypass[/b] & easy Lobby priorities, although plenty of them were very suspicious with a known bad record of being [u]cheat-banned multiple times, in multiple games[/u] (Fortnite, Apex, etc). [i]Infact, many of them came to Warzone as they were banned on those games...[/i] [b] If they're not cheating, WHY do they need Anti-Cheat whitelist?[/b]

Often limit gamemodes to Quads ONLY; not everyone is a Streamer with 4x Squad Party!

[h1]9. [b]HORRIBLE GUN BALANCE! - In Warzone 1, we've had over 200 guns from 3 COD Games[/b][/h1]
Yet 1-2 guns at most were what's used of each category. RavenSoftware are the WORST when it comes to [b]Gun Balance.[/b]

Some Snipers literally had 0.03% unused pickrate, and they were nerfed further whilst ARs that are on top gets heavy buffs. (For some reason they're always Anti-Snipers)

[b]Break a gun => Sell Bundles for it => Nerf in 2 months => Repeat.[/b]

[h1]10. [b]BLATANT bias towards Console Market[/b][/h1]
They're fully focusing on Controllers/Console right now, [u]at the cost of Mouse & Keyboard players.[/u]
[list]
[*]Please see [b]Point #6[/b] above.
[*]MWII CODNEXT Release was [u]stricly controller only[/u], M&K Streamers had to use controller a month prior on their stream to get ready for the event. As everyone was forced to use one.
[*]MWII Camos [b]UI Menu originally could only be accessed through controller, or keyboard arrow keys.[/b] Yes, even the menu. The mouse cursor did nothing on a $70 game in 2023.
[*][b]Forced Crossplay.[/b]
[*][b]Increased visual recoil+noise, M&K users might need attachments to reduce them[/b], where controllers AimAssist works through them effortlessly without any attachments to the gun.
[*]WZ1, [u]SPECIFICALLY[b] limited Snipers Headshots at specific ranges[/b] where AimAssist doesn't work.[/u]
[*][b]The ONLY scenario PC M&K users don't have a disadvantage over AimAssist is sniping at long range[i](Where AimAssist isn't as OP)[/i], where in WZ1 that got Aim-Assist range limited, WZ2 Sniping Headshot completely gone.[/b][/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h1] [i][u]Results:[/u][/i] [/h1]

That's why MWII is more balanced than Warzone 2.

That's why with RavenSoftware's influence, Warzone 2 got the same changes & nerfs they've done in Warzone 1 is now here in Warzone 2 (ie Snipers can't Headshot, but SMGs can kill you faster than blink).

[b]Warzone 2 would've been better if they kept it to Infinity Ward, how it was in 2020.[/b] Look what happened to Warzone 1, look where the game was & how it became thanks to RavenSoftware & the more they are in charge (Warzone Pacific).

RavenSoftware own employees have boycotted & protested and went on strikes before as decisions are often made without QA, and few execs call the shot for millions of players. (Such as Caldera!)

[u]If they hadn't updated Warzone 1 for 3 years, the game would've been 100x times better, and Warzone 2 wouldn't even be needed.[/u]
[hr][/hr]

[h1]Facts[/h1]
Majority came to MWII & Warzone 2 as they loved the old Warzone 1, and hoped Warzone 2 would bring that back, as RavenSoftware killed the first one.

To go from the [b]""Best Selling Numbers in COD HISTORY"" is very telling after VANGUARD[/b]; And to [b]""THE LOWEST WARZONE NUMBERS""[/b] is also telling when [u]you've got all the hype, sales, support & numbers[/u], but your studios are disconnected from the community.

Warzone 2 needs to copy everything Warzone 1 had in late 2020 & Raven's influence to vanish. Men lie, Women lie, numbers & stats don't.

311210,Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"*LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*

     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. 
Please google ""Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022"". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. 

TL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.

Now for my review:
     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the ""popular"" maps. The ""less popular"" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.
     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.","Very Positive87% of the 118,545 user reviews for this game are positive.",safety security risk buying online risky hacker able ip address mess weapon health personal information install rat pc computer super common s_emphasizedtill legitimate spending happen random player streamer play mode whenever stream hacker mess whatever trying banned please google 3 pc security risk 2022 shame treyarch fix serious problem real activision letting tl dr cautious potential security issue highly recommend like duty zombies_emphasized general want duty zombie franchise best duty zombie definitely challenge mode multiple player interact compete real match nowadays zombie match hard long popular map popular map difficult s_emphasizedtill possible especially search go mode multiple player interact compete real search specific time match not_entirely time wont leave guess different zone school best happen zombie series term storyline progression endless task item surprise different truly wonderful fun offered play experienced especially custom zombie modification alteration player fan tool community map literally endless map level play modification alteration player fan tool not_only remake zombie chronicle visually stunning remake monster enemy dead dead town buried die rise 2023 2024 highly recommend like duty zombies_emphasized general want duty zombie franchise

It's the most I have been emotionally invested in a game in a long time.

 The gun mechanics of the game are also top notch. Every shot feels like it has an impact and all the guns feel like actual weapons. Rockstar truly made a world that truly feels alive. It feels like I'm riding through late 19th century America. 

I can't really talk about the online experience because I haven't played enough of it to give a fair review.
