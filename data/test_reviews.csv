The game still has no content, the custom games is still broken, the store is still pathetic, and the desync has gotten worse. Now with plummeting player counts, a new problem arises.... the SBMM algorithm. If you go to Halo Waypoint and look at your past 20 games, you will get a statistic detailing your ""expected"" kills and deaths for the match. It is scarily accurate 80% of the time.

First: Dont expect to be good at this game when you first start, it takes time to learn about the gods. every god has specific builds and mechanics.
Second: Watch professional smite players on twitch or YT they will teach you how to play every roll for smite conquest.
Third: play arena first and learn every god in smite and how to use all their abilities. 
Fourth: Dont worry if people call you trash, tell them you are new to the game and they will understand.
Fifth: go on https://smitesource.com this site will help you learn how to build gods
Sixth: Play gods that you feel COMFORTABLE with. 
Seventh: once you are ready play joust, its a smaller conquest against 3v3. but it has some mechanics as conquest.
Eighth: PLAY ASSAULT its fun and its a random god pickers to play a 1 lane 5v5 
Ninth: Once you are ready play conquest

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I have been paying this game for years, building my opinions of the game. The easiest way to describe it would be Pros v.s. Cons. 

Pros:
Easy to learn, hard to master.

The Questing only gets better with each expansion.

You don't NEED to interact with anyone. Treat it like a single player game if you want and call it hard mode.

Fun dungeons that don't get boring with just a couple of runs.

Tons of ""End Game"" content to keep one busy far after they reach max gear level.

Super Fun PvP system with Cyrodil Tri-Banner War

If you want to specialize in something like crafting, it is diverse and fun enough to keep you entertained, then become extremely profitable in the future.

Cons:
To be a crafter in the most efficient way, you NEED to subscribe to ESO Plus (but as a little sneaky pro, ESO Plus gives all the DLC bundled with it plus ""crowns"" equaling the price paid for subscription""

VETERAN MAELSTROM ARENA IS UNFAIRLY DIFFICULT favoring Magika DPS players with very good sustainability and constant shield action. A bit of tough love that pushes away newer or less experienced players.

PvP, though really fun, has a very steep learning curve that leaves many unsure where to start, luckily PvP isn't the main focus of the game.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So where does this leave us? Is the game worth putting in time and money? Simple answer is, yeah. Despite a rough launch in 2014, ESO has improved and worked out MOST of it's flaws and kinks, making it the great and enjoyable sandbox MMO it is today. 

-If you are playing and feel you need some direction you can send me a message via mail in game @Cactusking158 and I will do my best to answer any questions that come my way.

Happy adventuring, and may you meet many fine people along your journey.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Not a lot of play time when this was posted but I spent 12 hours in the playstation demo as well

8 Years in the making and some how BETTER than expectations? ✔
The best ARPG combat we've gotten with 20 something somehow unique characters? ✔
Incredible Music that is somehow enhanced from it's source material? ✔
A team of vets who made the greatest era of Final Fantasy Games (IV-IX)? ✔
A PC port of a heavily marketed playstation game that runs at a locked in 120fps at 1440p with literally no drops? ✔
Loading Screens that literally barely exist as soon as they appear the game tells me it's ready? ✔
MMO Boss Raid Mechanics without the inane spamming 1 2 3 combos? ✔
Incredibly gorgeous stylized environments and characters? ✔
One of the most streamlined Co-Op menus and experiences ever? ✔

TL:DR: You like ARPG's about killing big bosses or hordes of grunts and pushing yourself and your friends to get the highest scores/lowest times possible on these kills? Do you like MMO raid bosses but wish the combat was more engaging? Sick of FOMO, MTX, Live Service, Time Gating, DRM, bullshit in your co-op games? Buy this game.

This game has it all for ARPG fans. My only cons are no ultrawide support but hell maybe I'll get that in a patch and solo only main story but it seems fast paced so we don't really care. Me and my friends played 3 hours on release just trying to S++ the first three side quests together and it was the most satisfying action RPG gameplay I've ever experienced.

It's beautiful, it's satisfying, the music is gorgeous, and it's not a live service bull shit fuck fest of battle passes, weeklies, dailies, limited time quests, time gates, or artificial bloat. You get to play the game, A FULL GAME, with multiplayer side content on top at your own pace, and grind your rewards without a time gate or some arbitrary clock ticking down in the top left telling you those rewards will disappear forever by the next month. No DRM, solo works offline, no kernal level anticheat for a co-op game, no bloat launcher, no bull shit. Support more devs like this that just make full experiences without all the heaped on crap.

Also finally an ARPG port that doesn't run like complete garbage on PC. Could use some more settings for changing controller bindings but the default bindings are really solid and reWASD exists for a reason. The game has such a deep and well crafted stylization to it's assets I'm not sure how much more graphical settings could even be included. But the game doesn't rely on upscalers to get you this quality and no smudgy TAA it's nonexistant thanks to the stylization efforts. It's not photo real but it's art, the hand painted backgrounds, sky boxes, and foliage are drop dead gorgeous.

I feel like a kid playing FFIX for the first time again. This game is pure magic. If you like JRPG styles and themes and deep ARPG systems, it's heaven. If you told me this was made by the company that made one of Japan's most successful Gacha games ever I would've expected more scummy gacha practices but they're somehow one of the only studios making complete experiences these days it seems. Seriously the game is just killer.

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"Posting this here, since Activision is re-branding to shake off the bad PR.

SBMM is creating some severe issues, leading people to think there is Skill Based Damage, but it doesn't stop there. The game is completely inconsistent on a technical level. Depending on the time of the day, your shots will do a different amount of damage to AI and players, there's plenty of proof if you look around online OR simply play the game and experience the frustrations of these co-op employee ran servers.  Every patch to fix bugs that I never had, I then would get in the bug that the patch apparently ""fixed."" Meanwhile serious bugs and hacking exists, that the team closes their eyes to and they push you $20 skins.

If you want to yuck it up and shoot some people, play the free version and add it to your rotation of games. I strongly suggest that you do not pay for this game.  If you make even a reasonable wage at 20 dollars an hour, you're still pissing away 3 hours of your 40 hour paycheck, just to be disappointed and have another over-marketed failure replace this.  Not to mention, any skins or battle passes are not worth the money, due to the high level of issues, bugs, crashes, and lack of transparency with the company, etc. 

They promised their community that they were going to break the annual cycle and let this run for two years.  Some folks bought the game due to the promise - Turns out, that's a lie and the next game will be out shortly.  It was all just a ploy to get you to purchase a game that they will intentionally trash, just to hype up another dumpster fire to bring in more money next year.  

Activision does not listen to their community, nor do they care. We are ""retention numbers"", a paycheck and good for their stock listing, that's it.  I have played COD since before many of you were alive.  I have uninstalled MW2 and will not play any further COD releases in the future. I was optimistic with their new approach to a COD game, but once again, I was let down by a company that panders to whatever makes them money.

This company is in it only for your money, not to create a quality game.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'm a 70 yr old lady, and I've played for some time now and I love this game. I will never be hardcore or even a good player. But there are so many things to do in this game it is almost overwhelming. Quests are very good, the story-line is very good and last but not least, the graphics are fabulous. 
On the downside; it is expensive being a Plus member, especially on a retirement pay (shoe-string budget). I recommend a much cheaper monthly fee. There is ofc the DLC content you get with the Plus membership but the ideal is to have a cheaper option only for that magical bag space just for crafters. Well, it's just a thought.

Happy New Year 2020!
Just a review of 2019 gameplay (many hours as you can see).
And I'm still playing (since my birthday 7 Dec 2017). I have just scratched the surface...
If you are looking for an adventure out of this world (pun intended) Elder Scrolls Online is the very very best.
I do pay for Eso plus, I need that magic bag since I farm and horde like a squirrel and craft like a boss. I have soon maxed out my main crafter.
I am in a guild with absolutely fabulous and helpful people. I have started to have a bit of confidence doing trials and dungeons with this guild, they know I am old and slow and they are patient with me. Hopefully, I will be a better team player this year. I am working on it.
In the meantime, I quest, explore, collect whatever, do delves, public dungeons, world bosses, farm and craft. And I enjoy it all!
All the best to all gamers in 2020.

I have edited this review, the starting-date was wrong, I got the game on 6 Dec 2017, and started to play on my B-day, 7 Dec 2017. Otherwise, counting the hours of gameplay, I must have been glued to the screen, LOL. I do have a life outside Tamriel, I promise... 
To All gamers Stay Safe in these crazy times. / Onna_Bugeisha

UPDATE 2022; This coming 7 Dec I'll turn 73 yrs which means that I now played this game for 5 yrs and I still love it.

Thank You! To all wonderful people for your heart-warming comments and awards. I like the titel ""Gaming Grandma""  

I have a confession to make - I fell in love with Horizon Zero Dawn, and spent some time there, i.e. I did 6 re-runs of that game (lol), it's a fabulous game. 

Now I am back in ESO again with the new High Isle chapter and two new companions, there are just so many things to do in ESO you never run out of options. Things like crafting, just exploring and farming, decorating your homes and create gardens... even fishing is very relaxing when you need a rest from bandits and monsters. 

Have I mentioned I lured my husband from Guild Wars 2, to come and join me in ESO last year? Now we play together, so much fun. 
A very important advice to all couples out there... this game is captivating and time-consuming - so please, see to it that you both play together or you might end up wondering what in the world happened to your significant other, seriously. 

I hope to see you in game or mail me (I am @Wing-Zun - on PC, EU server), I am in three trading guilds (BTW an excellent way to get some gold). 
 Arenthian Trade Guild - Tamriel Marketeers - The Twelwe Knights. Very nice guilds.

252490,Rust,"Before buying Rust, ask yourself the following questions.
1. Do you have a full time job?
2. Do you want a game that is not toxic?
3. Do you want a game that gives you a fair chance, regardless of group size?
If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, do not buy this game.
You will spend 25 hours a day playing rust in order to stay relevant on the server you are playing on. Also if you're not on for these 25 hours a day you will be offline raided and lose everything.

I mean - come on people, give the developers a chance to address the problems.

--------------------------------------
[u][b]1/26/2024 Edits Below[/b][/u]
--------------------------------------

After 20+ hours of play I've included some observations below.  It's quite clear as originally indicated the game has a lot in common with Valheim.  While there are some differences, overall if you liked Valheim you'll probably enjoy playing Enshrouded.  In addition, if there were things you didn't like about Valheim, there are also things you won't like about Enshrouded.

[b][i]Some Noteable Similarities:[/i][/b]
[list]
[*]Some recipes get discovered by acquiring a material or crafting item for the first time.
[*]A significant portion of gear/technology progression is tied to the elimination and looting of bosses.
[*]In combat, generally speaking the player wants to avoid facetanking enemies.  Blocking/parrying/dodging are a good idea even in 1 vs 1 engagements due to the relatively high damage of some enemies.
[*]Consuming food is for buffs and health/stamina regeneration.  The player won't die standing still and not eating (i.e. no hunger/thirst mechanic).
[*]Getting the rested buff by being in the presence of fire and comfort items in a sheltered area.
[/list]

[b][i]Some Noteable Differences:[/i][/b]
[list]
[*]The player can build with very small blocks of all building type materials, allowing for a much more refined final creation.  Building has no structure integrity in Enshrouded.
[*]Enemy difficulty is based on levels and there aren't champion/elite variants in Enshrouded.
[*]Enemies don't respawn in the presence of the player in Enshrouded.
[*]Progression in Enshrouded is tied to both boss killing and NPC crafter acquisition and subsequent quests (to collect crafting related items so you can make additional workstations).
[*]Player growth in Valheim is largely influenced by skill-ups but in Enshrouded it's from leveling, ability points and upgrading the Flame Altar.
[*]Valheim is significantly more visually atmospheric when compared to the non-shrouded areas in Enshrouded.  The weather effects and biome specific lighting are top notch in Valheim.  Outside of the shroud in Enshrouded there aren't weather effects like rain and storms, it's either light during day or dark during night with a small sunrise/sunset transition in between as appropriate.
[*]There's a significant amount of lore notes and quests in Enshrouded as opposed to the handful of objectives you get in Valheim.
[*]Enshrouded's map isn't procedurally generated.  I've noticed the design of the POIs is a bit more involved and the traversal/exploration based puzzles associated with them are pretty satisfying to solve.
[*]There are no PvE raids in Enshrouded like there are in Valheim.
[*]Don't appear to be set-bonuses for armor in Enshrouded.
[*]Seems more convenient to get gear upgrades by finding high rarity drops in the world and upgrading them with runes rather than crafting in Enshrouded.  Perhaps this changes later in the game.
[*]Health potions aren't on timers in Enshrouded.
[*]There aren't elemental effects to worry about in Enshrouded that requires specific gear (such as extreme cold).

686810,Hell Let Loose,As an old guy who is new to online FPS this game is very tough. It is on the realistic side.  One shot will usually kill you or the enemy.   Artillery and tank fire is devastating.   I died  at least 20 times before I even saw my first enemy.   I finally fired my gun after about two hours of playing.   And it took me about 4 hours of playing before I actually killed an enemy.  I appreciate it is difficult.  It makes any success I have more rewarding.  The game looks fantastic and it plays very well.  I am sure if you have any FPS online experience it will go easier for you.  Newbies should take baby steps and have patience.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"Enjoyable but flawed. This game fell short of being something incredible.
I don't believe I'm one of many with this perception of Hogwarts Legacy but it may prove interesting to some nonetheless.
Long review below:

The Good:
+ It's a nice visual game, some parts of it look ""magical"" indeed.
+ The gameplay works and functions well from start to finish.
+ The story has a few interesting moments but nothing that will blow you away. There won't be anything you won't see coming.
+ The spells feel great, combat was one of my favourites aspects of the game. The devs did their job right on this front.
+ A magical adventure for Harry Potter fans, it IS the best of all Harry Potter games, really immersive in some parts, fun in others and an overall good game. All in all, your money won't be wasted here. There's plenty of content to go around for everyone.
+ Soundtrack and sound in general is authentic to what the Wizarding world should be.

The Bad:
It's a shame that many RPGs  that are open world learned nothing from Skyrim, Witcher and Red Dead Redemption.

- Everything is so scripted to the point of comedy. As a result of that, it won't take more than several hours to realise how bland and empty Hogwarts is.
The best way to describe this is by comparing it to the tv series: Westworld (for those who have seen it). You feel like you're really trying to role play in a fake world.
The same animations will play in the castle over and over, the same NPCs with the same lines.
You get to experience all yearly seasons but besides some changes in the castle and around it, the NPCs react to nothing. Their garbs won't change according to the weather.

- Immersion breaking.
When you go outside of the castle in summer, you'll spot two students playing a game. That's a very nice moment to see the NPCs have activities around the castle. However, you'll reach winter and the same students are playing the same game, in their same outfits outside in the courtyard even at night time at 0 degrees C temperature. The same orchestra music that you first hear when you go across the hall will be playing throughout all seasons, through all day/night cycles. It goes from a wondrous, special moment to a tedious, run faster so it'll bother you less.
For an RPG, one of its priorities should be to establish or at least try to make something remotely natural for the NPCs to do. There's many more such situations but I won't go further into that.

- Progression is tied to the main story.  You cannot interact with your dorm colleagues or anyone around the castle unless it's a quest or a silly side quest. The house you pick doesn't matter. You'll only get 1 quest per house and it'll vary the looks of your outfit. I chose Ravenclaw but was shown around by a Weasly. I was expecting to have someone from my own dorm to be my friend/guide to lead me through the castle. 

- Your choices in the game have no consequence. Cast avada kadavra wherever you want because nobody cares. It's hilarious at times.

- I understand that the developers are trying so hard to be ""progressive"" but in their pursuit of fulfilling an agenda they made the setting of 1800s Scotland feel like 2023 woke Hollywood. You'll hear the name of ""Sirona"" and how special she is more times than you'll enter her tavern.

- Enemies around the world: 
You'd expect the ""Forbidden forest"" and ""any other place in the world"" to be somewhat different from each other since it's an RPG.
The enemies around the castle would be of a lower level while the forbidden forest would have tougher or more dangerous enemies. That's not the case.
You'll fight: humans, spiders, frogs, wolves, trolls, goblins and That's it. There won't be a special enemy type anywhere in this world.

- No interesting side quests or random events. Hogwarts Legacy doesn't have a natural side quest in it. You're exploring and suddenly you come across something - well, kinda... Some merchant who needs his pet rescued or kill more poachers. That's all you'll get.
The motivation to do these menial side missions is even lower due to the interchangeably awful voice acting and writing. It feels like if it’s not the writing that’s off, it’s the acting and vice versa. I would say the acting isn’t as bad as it could’ve been, but the writing reaches lower echelon Bethesda more often than not.

- The HUD is cluttered and breaks immersion.
- No memorable characters besides Sebastian.
- No matter the graphical settings, the game has issues around Hogwarts and especially Hogsmead. Lots of stuttering, textures loading in late, so on and so forth. It's got technical issues still as of June 2023.

Conclusion:
Despite most of its flaws and shortcomings Hogwarts Legacy is a strong game that many people will grow fond of. 
It does the main part right: gameplay, decent story, graphics and depicts the world of Harry Potter better than other harry potter games.
I strongly believe it wouldn't have been as successful if it weren't for huge controversies or if it didn't have the Harry Potter theme around it.

582660,Black Desert,"After putting in 2500 hours into this game I think I have a say in whether or not the game is good or bad. 

Is the game good? 

Sure. It can be. There has been countless times where I've enjoyed doing something other than grinding or pvping, like hunting sea monsters with my friends, or going to world bosses together, and etc. But there are way too many OTHER problems that are never being addressed, and when they are, players have already quit the game or rerolled to another class, throwing all the time away that they've invested into it. I had two friends so far reroll to different classes just because they were meta and the classes they played prior to rerolling were in a terrible position/they didn't enjoy it like they used to.

 I originally purchased Black Desert back in 2016 when the game released in NA. I had no idea what to do, and eventually a couple years later, one of my friends was quite knowledgeable, and was able to help me understand the game even more. Once everything became apparent, it's as if you were a newborn child opening your eyes for the first time. It was incredible. I played the game day in and day out, spending hundreds of dollars on cosmetics, and other things such as pets, and the tent that they offer in the Pearl Shop (Cash Shop). After four months, Pearl Abyss released a patch note that completely destroyed the balance of the game. Every class was pretty much stripped of their Super Armors (a buff that allows you to not be crowd controlled and makes you take reduced damage during the duration of the ability), and their crowd controls, and made most of the crowd controls for PVE (Player vs. Environment) only. However there was one class that was not affected in the slightest, and because of the changes, instantly became a top tier class in a matter or hours after the patch; Ninja. This event was the BDO version of the Great Depression pretty much. After people saw that PA wasn't fixing their classes, they started to notice the damage Ninja could do, and they rerolled to Ninja. They couldn't take it anymore. Hell, there was a point in time where even I couldn't take it. I almost rerolled to Ninja myself. But I stood my ground. I waited desperately, hoping for a buff or a fix to my (and other classes) problems. Six and a half months later, still no fix.

 I think the Devs don't play the game/listen to the feedback of their community. If they did, the decline in players recently, would not have been as big (maybe). As far as enhancing goes... I have to say, in my opinion, it has to be THE WORST enhancement system ever in a MMORPG game. You have to fail, spend more money, fail more, then succeed? Then what? You're stuck with no money for god knows how long? Unless you live and breathe this game, and live in your mom's basement, you literally have no chance of getting anywhere far in this game. Actually let me rephrase that, you do have a chance, but you'd have to invest hours and hours of time in order for that to happen. But, by the time that's happened your girlfriends already left you, your boss called you to let you know that this week is your last week at the office, and you have an eviction notice posted on the front of the door to your one bed, one bath apartment. 

Now, I know I bashed on the game extremely hard. BUT, there are some positives. The game is aesthetically pleasing. I think that the game is seriously ahead of it's time in terms of graphics, and it's combat system is unique and kind of fun. I came from games like TERA, and Elder Scrolls Online, where the only thing you'd have to do in order to use an ability is to press a hotkey, whereas in this, you actually have to press a key combination in order to use the ability. I think that, that is honestly second to none.

All in all, do I recommend this game to for you to play?

If you have a life:

""Hell no, don't do it.""

If you seriously have nothing to do with your life, you have a greasy neckbeard, wear Harry Potter glasses, and don't mind dying in front of your computer screen due to a brain aneurysm cause you failed a TET enhance on your accessory:

""Sure bud, go ahead.""



Thanks for taking the time to read this. Please leave a like, and share to any of your friends that are planning on buying this game. Don't make the same mistake me, and countless other people have made.

(*UPDATE AS OF 11/17/2018*:  I never said that the game isn't unenjoyable. It is poorly maintained sure, and has numerous other problems that need to be fixed, but it can still be enjoyable.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"I'll start off by saying this is literally my first Madden purchase ever. I recently got into football (2021) and decided I may as well pick up a Madden game for fun and this one was half off despite only being a few months old. Thats a massive red flag, but honestly I'd say it was worth it.

I only play franchise and superstar modes, I'm not interested in h2h or MUT. So far the experience has been great. The game works well enough that I have an enjoyable time.

That said, this is not me recommending the game to you, the average Madden player. If you play these games a lot more than I do than I'm sure you'll run into infuriating issues nonstop. The other day I was unable to play superstar mode because I couldn't connect to the league (????) and so I had to either play a quick match or play nothing. I only loaded up madden to play this (what should be an offline) experience and I couldn't. Other things of note are that people constantly get stuck on each other and it just ruins the timings of routes and the expectations of where a receiver should be when the ball is thrown. This wouldn't be a problem if there was adequate feedback that they were stuck, but they continue whatever running animation they're in, but just stuck in place.

Overall I cannot recommend a yearly sports game. That's to be expected. If you keep letting EA and 2k defecate in your mouth and then start chewing after, they're going to continue making bad games. I just bought this game because I didn't have one already and I wanted a casual game I could play with my friend.",saying literally madden purchase ever recently got football 2021 decided pick madden game fun one half despite month old thats massive red flag honestly worth franchise superstar mode interested h2h mut far experience great game work enough enjoyable time said recommending game average madden player game sure infuriating issue nonstop unable superstar mode connect league quick match loaded madden offline experience thing note constantly get stuck ruin timing route expectation receiver ball thrown problem adequate feedback stuck continue whatever running animation stuck place overall recommend yearly sport game expected letting ea 2k defecate mouth chewing continue bad game bought game one already wanted casual game friend
386360,SMITE®,"Keep in mind that I have played Smite for 4 years now, these Steam hours are merely 1/5 of my whole playtime.
I've spent about 2000 euros on this game, and while I don't regret any of those purchases, I really can't recommend this game in this state. Smite is not the problem, it's a good game. Hi-Rez is the issue.

If you enjoy basically non-existent lore, cash-grabs and rigged systems, cancerous matchmaking, unbalanced and clearly developer-favored characters, bugs aplenty, one completely incapable and utterly useless CEO that holds back the whole department and one of the most toxic communities that even rivals Overwatch's community, Smite is your game.

Back when I started playing, Smite was still in open beta and probably my favorite game for years. It was diverse, set itself apart from all other MOBAS through its 3rd person perspective and tons of different maps. It also had that great concept where you could just buy a skin that you wanted. But then Hi-Rez published it's first chests. There were only 2 exclusive skins, but they quickly realized how much money they could make off that garbage system. In the following years, 95% of all new skins were exclusive or limited - put in cash-grab events or chests. There was a time where there wasn't a single directly purchasable skin for 6 or more months. To this day there are still gods with well over 5 skins, all of them exclusive.

Let's put this into perspective: There are literally [b]128 types of chests[/b] in this game. They range from 200gems to 400gems, so about 3,20€ to 6,40€ respectively, [b]per roll[/b]. As a new player, you have 0/55 items from the Curiosity Chest. Each roll costs 3,20€. The chests are also rigged, not joking here, which means you'll get the skin at ~53/55, which puts you at a staggering 170€ just to get that one skin you wanted. 
And every single season, the grande finale of cash grabs, the so called ""odyssey"". Smite teases one ""Tier5 skin"", a skin that changes basically everything a god has to offer in terms of design. It's comparable to LoL's ultimate skins, which cost about 20€. The only issue here is, that you can't directly buy the skin. You [b]have to[/b] get a ton of other exclusive skins you probably don't even want for that one T5 skin that's barely worth 20 bucks. You'll lose about 100€, if not more, in this great ""odyssey"", as Hi-Rez likes to title it. The odyssey is also often accompanied by several ""adventures"". Adventures are basically one sort of RPG where you choose one god and kill some monsters. The catch is, this map doesn't change, the map always remains the same, and all rewards are either locked behind a paywall (who would have guessed) or a tedious grind-fest that'll probably take millions of your brain cells and about 2 weeks of your life. I'm not even going to talk about the recent ""adventure"", because that's just a pure joke.

Now, bugs. Smite suffers from so many bugs, many of which are present since closed beta. Some of the more recent ones are so gamebreaking it's honestly a joke that they're not fixed yet. First off, In 99% of all matches, lobby chat just doesn't work. It won't even appear in your chat box. You can't communicate with your teammates while you pick your gods. 

Second, also in 99% of all matches, one or more gods won't load in your stats screen. Which basically means, that, if you press TAB, it won't list that particular god. You can't see their items (which in turn means you don't know how to build against them), you can't see their relics, not even their score. Their kills [b] aren't even listed for your team[/b]. You basically have a ghost. 
Also, sometimes your game just freezes on defeat or win screen and just crashes alltogether. Present since beta, they're just addressing it, after 4 years.

While we're at it, I just want to point out Hi-Rez' favoritism, regarding both gods and modes. As you would expect with gods, there are just certain gods which are blatantly overpowered or just unfun to play against. These can usually be identified by looking at their skins, because they usually have billions. Examples would be Loki, Neith, Hercules or Nox. These are not necessarily overpowered, but have heavily bloated kits which make them almost unkillable and totally unfun to play against. 
Now modes. Like I said before, Smite has a multitude of gamemodes, many more than Hots, LoL or DotA. Now, the issue is, the whole game is balanced around the ""main"" mode, Conquest; the typical 5v5 tower-and-minion-push mode, which every moba has. In my 4 years of Smite, I have played 18 matches of Conquest. To compare, I've played over 2000 matches of Arena (5v5 without towers), 600 in Joust (3v3), 500 in Siege (4v4) and 900 matches of Clash (5v5 mix between Conquest and Arena). I never really found the ambition to learn all 4851 rules of Conquest, so I stuck to the other gamemodes which barely required 2 of my 5 braincells. Hi-Rez just tries to force Conquest down your throat at every single possible moment. IIRC, one of the design-leaders even talked about removing other modes so people would flock to Conquest. This alone truly catches the sheer incompetence of Hi-Rez's executives. Most players even stated they would quit before they'd even touch Conquest.

At last, Smite's community. I'm more of a casual and average player, but every single match you're plagued by atleast one incredibly inept (most of the time they're low level because matchmaking sucks) or toxic player, sometimes even both. The problem is, that just like in many other games, most players think way too highly of themselves. But Smite players take the cake. They not only play gods, they [i]think they are gods.[/i] The ultimate pinacle of garbage this game has to offer can be found on reddit. You can't criticize one single god without some white knight showing up and defending their true love like there's no tomorrow, because ""muh waifu"". It's one of the most toxic communites you'll ever see in any videogame, so rev up these mute buttons. Just be aware that you can't mute incompetence. Also, the matchmaking is so fucking bad that I have a legit 85% winrate this season. Every game balances the winrate around 50%.

In conclusion, I'm fascinated that both Hi-Rez and Smite are still alive. Hi-Rez ran so many good games into the ground, gunned them down in the streets or left them to rot in their bug-infested basement, it's a miracle that the company isn't bankrupt. Play this game if you want, but you'll be disappointed in the long run, which is the worst kind of disappointment. Many years I've defended both Hi-Rez and Smite, but at this state, it doesn't make any sense to. I've had my fun, I don't regret a single penny or minute I've spent, but I'm about done.",mind smite 4 year hour merely 1 5 playtime spent 2000 euro game regret purchase recommend game state smite problem good game hi rez issue enjoy basically non existent lore cash grab rigged system cancerous matchmaking unbalanced clearly developer favored character bug aplenty one completely incapable utterly useless ceo hold department one toxic community rival overwatch community smite game started playing smite open beta probably favorite game year diverse set apart mobas 3rd person perspective ton different map great concept skin wanted hi rez published chest 2 exclusive skin quickly realized money make garbage following year 95 skin exclusive limited cash grab event chest time single directly purchasable skin 6 month god 5 skin exclusive perspective literally b 128 type chest b game range 200gems 400gems 3 20 6 40 respectively b per roll b player 0 55 item curiosity chest roll cost 3 20 chest rigged joking mean get skin 53 55 put staggering 170 get one skin wanted single season grande finale cash grab called odyssey smite tease one tier5 skin skin change basically everything god offer term design comparable lol ultimate skin cost 20 issue directly skin b b get ton exclusive skin probably one t5 skin barely worth 20 buck lose 100 great odyssey hi rez like title odyssey accompanied adventure adventure basically one sort choose one god kill monster catch map map remains reward locked paywall guessed tedious grind fest probably million brain cell 2 week life talk recent adventure pure joke bug smite suffers bug present closed beta recent one gamebreaking honestly joke fixed 99 match lobby chat work appear chat box communicate teammate pick god second 99 match one god load stats screen basically mean press tab list particular god item turn mean build relic score kill b listed team b basically ghost sometimes game freeze defeat win screen crash alltogether present beta addressing 4 year hi rez favoritism regarding god mode expect god certain god blatantly overpowered unfun usually identified looking skin usually billion example loki neith hercules nox necessarily overpowered heavily bloated kit make almost unkillable totally unfun mode said smite multitude gamemodes hots lol dota issue game balanced main mode conquest typical 5v5 tower minion push mode moba 4 year smite 18 match conquest compare 2000 match arena 5v5 tower 600 joust 3v3 500 siege 4v4 900 match clash 5v5 mix conquest arena found ambition learn 4851 rule conquest stuck gamemodes barely required 2 5 braincells hi rez try force conquest throat single possible moment iirc one design leader talked removing mode flock conquest alone truly catch sheer incompetence hi rez executive player stated quit touch conquest last smite community casual average player single match plagued atleast one incredibly inept time low matchmaking suck toxic player sometimes problem game player highly smite player cake god god ultimate pinacle garbage game offer found reddit criticize one single god white knight showing defending true love tomorrow muh waifu one toxic communites ever videogame rev mute button aware mute incompetence matchmaking fucking bad legit 85 winrate season game balance winrate 50 conclusion fascinated hi rez smite alive hi rez ran good game ground gunned street left rot bug infested basement miracle company bankrupt game disappointed long worst kind disappointment year defended hi rez smite state make sense fun regret single penny minute spent
1240440,Halo Infinite,"[h1]Under New Management[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
It's a story that every Halo fan is familiar with. 343 Industries, a studio spun up by Microsoft to be the stewards of the Halo IP going in the future, took over the franchise in 2011 after the departure of series creators Bungie. They then proceeded to drag the franchise and its fans through two sequels which, while not awful in totality, were proof that 343i had no clue what made Halo so special in an aesthetic nor a gameplay sense. 

[b]Halo Infinite[/b] was seemingly meant to be the course correction for the Halo series in the modern era. It had the Bungie era aesthetics, music evocative of Marty O'Donnell's amazing scores, and a gameplay loop that brought the focus back to the sandbox. Weapons, vehicles, power ups, and equipment placed on the maps, equal starting loadouts, and a set of base abilities that blended old and new felt refreshing in an age of gaming where this kind of arena design was dead in the mainstream. Despite a solid foundation however, 343i's attempt at creating a live service ecosystem around what they had built was doomed from the start because of just how bare bones the launch game was.

Critical features like campaign co-op, the custom game browser, and Forge mode did not ship at launch, split-screen co-op didn't launch at all, and the features that were initially included were half-baked or broken. The content updates were extremely slow to come out, utterly failing to keep the core community engaged as new maps trickled out at the slowest rate they had in the series history. The free 2 play cash shop and the battle pass system being the only meaningful ways to earn cosmetic items critically damaged the experience of the average player, a problem only made worse by a horrible armor coating system which disallowed players to change their armor colors as they saw fit. This combination of failures and downgrades made much of the community write off Infinite for good, seeing every update as too little, too late.

Despite the general attitudes around the game, a hiring freeze that prevented new developers from coming onto the game to help fix it up, and a huge management shakeup that led to the previous studio heads departing from the company, 343i kept on working diligently to fix the game's issues. Pierre Hintze, the man who led the Master Chief Collection's amazing overhaul, taking over as the head of 343i has led to an incredible shift in priorities from the developers: building up on top of the solid foundation they already had by giving the community what they want.

Halo Infinite is officially in comeback mode.

The new developer-made maps are a huge improvement over the stock maps, finally allowing the arena game design to shine. The playlist rotations keep things fresh every week. Free events happen all the time, finally letting free players collect some great looking gear on a regular basis. Custom games are lively and full of tons of creativity. Forge mode is astoundingly powerful, with some forged maps looking indistinguishable from developer made maps. They've even started to implement the best of the community's maps directly into the matchmaking system, in both competitive and casual playlists. Shoutouts to the Squad Battle playlist.

It's amazing to see how much better Halo Infinite actually is right now. Even in a gaming landscape where games launch broken and then somehow get even worse though post-launch updates, there are many reasons to be optimistic for the future of this game due to the dedication 343i has shown in the last several months. I hope that people will be able to give it a chance again, because if 343i stays the course, this could be one of the best Halo games of all time.",management hr hr story halo fan familiar 343 industry studio spun microsoft steward halo ip future took franchise 2011 departure series creator bungie proceeded drag franchise fan two sequel awful totality proof 343i clue halo special aesthetic sense b halo infinite b seemingly meant course correction halo series modern era bungie era aesthetic music evocative marty donnell amazing score loop brought focus sandbox weapon vehicle power ups equipment placed map equal starting loadouts set base ability blended old felt refreshing age gaming kind arena design dead mainstream despite solid foundation 343i attempt creating live service ecosystem built doomed bare bone launch game critical feature campaign co op custom game browser forge mode ship launch split screen co op launch feature initially included half baked broken content update extremely slow utterly failing core community engaged map trickled slowest rate series history 2 cash shop battle pas meaningful way earn cosmetic item critically damaged experience average player problem worse horrible armor coating disallowed player armor color saw fit combination failure downgrade community write infinite good seeing little late despite general attitude game hiring freeze prevented developer coming onto game help fix huge management shakeup led previous studio head departing company 343i working diligently fix game issue pierre hintze man led master chief collection amazing overhaul taking head 343i led incredible shift priority developer building top solid foundation already giving community halo infinite officially comeback mode developer map huge improvement stock map finally allowing arena game design shine playlist rotation thing fresh week event happen time finally letting player collect great looking gear regular basis custom game lively full ton creativity forge mode astoundingly powerful forged map looking indistinguishable developer map started implement best community map directly matchmaking competitive casual playlist shoutouts squad battle playlist amazing halo infinite right gaming landscape game launch broken somehow get worse post launch update reason optimistic future game due dedication 343i shown last month hope able chance 343i stay course one best halo game time

1599340,Lost Ark,"[b]If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you![/b]   Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead.  Excited yet?  You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job!  Wait, there's more!   If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content.  That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of!   Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside...  This is a pay to win game.  That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can.  They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that.   However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands.   I'm serious, it's beyond insanity. 

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you:  it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content.  You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will  express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up.   It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.  

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players.   All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression.   Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character.  Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too.   The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold.   What is gold good for?   The Auction House.  Upgrade items and gear.  Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals.   That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.   

What the heck are Pheons?   They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters.  The gear you wear is what determines your item level.  After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials.  Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in.   So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.

How do you get Pheons?   You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals.   How do you get blue crystals?   By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons.   Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.   

Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server.   These bots have one goal - farm gold.   Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue.   It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag.   Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.   

You see the problem yet?   Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value.  [i]Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK[/i], that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups.   Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies.  There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum.  Maybe as many as 60?  I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid.  Almost all of them are unnecessary. 

There are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous ""I'd rather watch paint dry"" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you'll try to participate in, and so much more.

This is a game I knew fairly decently what the premise was and how the gameplay would flow. I saw a metric fuck load of spoilers online but I was still very much looking forward to the story, even past all of the online hate. Mind you, I loved games like Arkham Knight and No Man's Sky which were bashed by the internet for years but are NOW getting love after nearly a decade. But this game is one of the very few times I'll agree with the internet. 

This game has minimal fun. I'm halfway  through the game and have encountered one boss fight, which was cool, lasted about ten minutes. The core gameplay, however, is unfun. Jump from rooftop to rooftop and shoot purple aliens. There are  a few copy and paste side missions from time to time but even the story missions are copy and paste. I'm just constantly being reminded that there are far better superhero video games out there, as well as better looter shooters.

I'm seeing it through because I'm a DC fan and I want to complete the story, but I'm happy CDKeys had the lay up for not paying full price for this shit.

 - The long written part! -

Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is the completely reworked and almost entirely remade version of Square Enix's latest MMO. Initially it came out, just as Final Fantasy XIV, on the 22nd of September 2010. Unfortunately, it was absolutely terrible, and is still regarded as one of the worst MMO's in recent years, if not ever. The UI was particularly bad, but the problems were pretty much onmipresent. Graphcis were gorgeous but ridiculously unoptimised, bad gameplay mechanics, etc. However! This is NOT that game! I can't stress this enough!

In December 2010, Naoki Yoshida was brought in as the new Director and producer, to try and make the game better. While some of these changes did start to make the game more playable, Square Enix, feeling (rightly so, some would say) very ashamed about this initial release (which I will call 1.0 from now on), and also worried about the damage it would do to the Final Fantasy brand, deciced to close down this game and completely rebuild it from the ground up. The servers for 1.0 closed on November the 11th 2012. 

The rerelease, called A Realm Reborn (the current game!), launched on August 27th 2013, with a PS3 version coming out on the same day. With the transition to the new game, Square implemented lots of cool in game lore explanations for the upcoming dramatic changes, and it is now a part of the game's story (which I think is really cool).

ARR is a fantastic MMO in nearly every aspect. It does, of course, have it's problems, but I have yet to find an MMO which doesn't (not even WoW). I have been playing MMO's since Everquest, and would say ARR is now my favourite of them all, from WoW to EQ to SWTOR to EVE, etc. I feel they have gotten the formula just right.

For the purchase on Steam you get the game itself, along with a month of playtime, so I would definitely recommend this if you think it might be for you (there is also a trial on the Square Enix website, but this would mean you don't have to reinstall if youstick with it!). 

In terms of gameplay, it follows what I think would be fairly described as a rough following of the Western style MMO formula, with some key differences:

 - Classes are not ""one-per-character"". On your character you can switch between and unlock every single combat, gathering and crafting class within the game, and even use some of the skills you have unlocked cross-class. It's actively encouraged to do this, and having more than one character is not really of any use, unless you just wish to have characters of different races, or something like that.

- Great matchmaking system for instanced content, all instanced content can be tackled using player made groups, or with the ingame matchmaking. It has (for me at least) always been efficient and works well to build groups for all content that needs it.

- Levelling feels reasonably varied. There are lots of different ways to level, from simple mob grinding (not recommended!), Main Story Quests, side quests, Levequests (repeatable minor tasks), dungeons, exploring, FATE's (random area specific objectives), etc. If you start to feel tired of levelling your ""main"" class, you can switch and level some of your crafting classes, or a different combat one, etc.

- Storyline makes the game feel like a true Final Fantasy game, the Main Story Quests (of which there are many) contain the games main story (although there are plenty of side stories within the games guilds, etc), which, without giving any spoilers, is very enjoyable and definitely held my interest far more than anything like this in any MMO's I have seen, with the exception of maybe SWTOR. Definitely feels like a more story oriented game, which I love. I feel your character has a much more grounded place in the game world!

- Combat, combat is somewhat similar to WoW in the most basic sense, abilities come on a bar, and are used in whichever way you want to fight enemies, heal allies, etc. The global tick rate (global cooldown) is longer than WoW, so if you are used to WoW, you might find it a bit slow to begin with. The abilites in game feel varied and are unlocked at a steady rate, letting you get slowly used to the class you play until you reach endgame. 

- UI, the UI is reasonably good. It provides all of the information you need, but is probably the one point I feel needs the most work. Once you get used to it, it's completely fine, but can be a bit confusing to begin with. It can sometimes feel like there are a lot of menus to click through, but the improvement from 1.0 is so huge, and it does do the job, that I feel it can be overlooked a bit. 

- Game World, the world is beautiful and full of diverse environment. The world is very large, and definitely worth exploring. One issue, is that (mainly at least) because the game is currently supported on PS3 (though this may change in the future), a lot of the world is accessed through loading screens. If you are expecting a WoW-esque free world with no loading screens, you may be dissapointed. To me, it's not a massive deal, but I know for some it could be a problem. The loading screens are not long and I don't feel it detracts much from the overall experience. It is also something that has been mentioned by the devs which could change in the future. For me, the quality of the world is enough to let me look past this problem, but for you it may be different.

- Crafting/Gathering, for me, ARR has one of the best crafting systems I have seen in an MMO. Crafting is done with individual classes representing the different professions, for example Armorsmithing, Cooking, Leatherworking, etc. Gathering is done in a similar fashion with regard to classes, Miner, Botanist and Fisher. The crafting system is very satisying, useful to the actual game experience (not just a money sink, or waste of time), and very complex at the higher levels, with apporpriate levels of reward! The crafting and gathering classes can all be acquired, just like the combat classes, making for a character which is very diverse and can (technically, if you have enough time!) do everything in the game without the need for alts.

- Updates, the game recieves frequent, and large updates. There have been big chunks of content added on a regular schedule, which I would say, puts other MMO's, especially WoW, to shame. The updates come frequently and add lots of content, making it worth the monthly fee, and meaning you never run out of things to do.

Overall I would give this game a 9/10. I think that with a few improvements to the UI and world loading, aswell as minor things like balancing, this could easily be the best MMO that currently exists, and I would heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.

11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on battle.net which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the battle.net servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download battle.net and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially  cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe.

1151340,Fallout 76,"I became a big fan of Fallout 4 after my grandson talked me into getting the game. I delayed on Fallout 76 for the price to drop and to insure PVP wasn't an issue (not a fan). And I have to say there are a lot of positive things with Fallout 76. I also waited for them to do major updates etc. I do enjoy the mission...lengthy though they be. I'm a slow player (almost 70 years old).  Having to move around servers for camp emplacement is a pain but I understand why....so..not too bad. Building isn't quite as much as in Fallout 4 though you can do a lot as you choose. I do wish combat was more along the Farcry 4,5 type....where you had the chance to truly sneak into a camp and remove the baddies. But overall if you are a Fallout  fan you should enjoy this game. Graphics are good, they corrected a crashing issue, continue to add content and changes and supports different styles of play. I don't pay extra for 'Fallout 1st' (monthly fee) which gives you some nice benefits,...and while I could afford it...well I haven't paid a monthly subscription since my wow days. Like most games some of the missions are tedious but there are lots of events, dailies etc to mix up game play. So I do recommend it being an overall Fallout fan.

899770,Last Epoch,"This game is just like Wolcen, in no way whatsoever. 

This review is specifically about my experience in the game and with the community throughout the Alpha and Beta. With over 500hrs I feel like I am in a unique spot to hightlight the good and the bad. 

First, the price... Even at the current price of $30 or so the game is an absolute steal. For those who choose to wait and not pay a premium for beta access, the game will be $15 at release. The developers have confirmed that the real money shop will be purely cosmetic. 

This game has two major things going for it, the extremely customizable gameplay and very active and transparent Dev team. The development team has been very prompt when it comes to new content. From what I have seen a new patch is out about once a month, and every other patch has major improvements/additions to the gameplay. Devs are not ashamed to push back an update or a feature in order to ensure quality. Don't get me wrong, there are still bugs in the game but they are addressed quickly and usually fixed by the next patch. Overall, probably the best dev team of any game that I have followed closely. 

Now to my second point, customization. As I mentioned, even at the current price you will have no problem getting your moneys worth. There are 5 classes(still missing one, Rouge) and each class has 3 very distinct passive trees. Each different passive tree of every class has 1, if not multiple different possible builds that can be explored(most can be competitive). Now to the truly ""juicy"" part, every single active skill have their own skill tree(excluding some skills  who's skill trees are not released yet) This means that not only do you have a ton of choices when it comes to passives, but you also have the ability to change how fundamentally some of your active skills work. At 500hrs, I still haven't explored all possible builds. Not to mention that there is a ton of content yet to come out which would only add to the game. 

The main question I have seen from people contemplating buying the game is, ""Is it worth the money?"". If you like RPGs you will like this game. You just need to understand that as of right now(Jun 2020) this game is still early access and may not be as polished as other major games of the genre such as PoE, D3, and Grim Dawn which have had years to improve. One thing I have never had to worry about with this game is the solid development and the steady improvements of gameplay and bugs. 

I hope this helps and If you choose to get the game, enjoy!

PS: The only bad thing I can think of is that the patches just can't come fast enough, but I think that just serves as an example of how much I have enjoyed the game, even unfinished.",game wolcen whatsoever review specifically experience game community throughout alpha beta 500hrs feel unique spot hightlight good bad price current price 30 game absolute steal choose wait pay premium beta access game 15 release developer confirmed real money shop purely cosmetic game two major thing extremely customizable active transparent dev team development team prompt come content seen patch month patch major improvement addition devs ashamed push feature order ensure quality get wrong bug game addressed quickly usually fixed next patch overall probably best dev team game followed closely second customization mentioned current price problem getting money worth 5 class missing one rouge class 3 distinct passive tree different passive tree class 1 multiple different possible build explored competitive truly juicy single active skill skill tree excluding skill skill tree released mean ton choice come passive fundamentally active skill work 500hrs explored possible build mention ton content add game main question seen contemplating buying game worth money rpgs game need understand right jun 2020 game early access polished major game genre poe d3 grim dawn year improve one thing worry game solid development steady improvement bug hope help choose get game enjoy p bad thing patch fast enough serf example enjoyed game unfinished
990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"Hogwarts Legacy is a great game, very polished by today's standards in my opinion. But it is lacking in some small areas. Below I have listed the pros and cons of the game. I also listed what I want to see in the future, as well as what I don't want to see in the future! Keep in mind I am not a massive Harry Potter fan and only have seen the movies a long time ago. This list was made over the course of my playthrough during the 72 hour early access for Deluxe Editon owners, hopefully there is a day 1 patch out by now! Enjoy!

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
• Good Performance (Could be better, but it is very good at least for me)
• Great Immersion
• Graphics and Art Style
• Changing Seasons
• Fancy Animation (With spells, puzzles, doors, and all that)
• Great Music & Sound Design (Broom class kinda popped off with that music)
• Engaging Story/Narrative
• Fun Late Game Combat (Ancient magic is sick! Just use your spells and mix it up! It's pretty fun)
• Exploration (Rewards you heavily for it)
• Detailed & Big World (You can go into any building, find many secrets, solve fun puzzles, pet cats, and much more)
• Interesting Characters (There are lots! The voice acting is sometimes bad)
• Great Transmog (Once you get the item you keep its appearance for use whenever you want)
• Great Quests (There are a ton)
• Fun Skins/Outfits (Great outfit pieces, mount skins, wand skins, and all that)
• Almost No Bugs (Visual bugs only, most are funny)
• No Crashes
• Accessibility & UI Options (There are LOTS!)
• Graphic Options (Also LOTS!) 
• NPC Quest Speed (WOW, NPCs that actually move your speed on quests?! More games should do this!)
• Room of Requirement (Fun to customize, can be daunting at times)

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
• No Quidditch
• Cramped Camera (Sometimes it can be at weird angles, maybe add customizable positions)
• Character Customization (I'm referring to the customization at the start of the game, it's a bit iffy)
• Voice Pitch (In the character customization menu at the start, every voice pitch besides the default one sounds robotic)
• Voice Acting (Sometimes)
• Repetitive Early Game Combat (Not a lot of spells to use but it's understandable)
• Limited Gear Slots (Can be increased by doing [spoiler]Merlin Trials[/spoiler])
• Confusing Menu (At first, it was hard for me to get used to it all at once, I couldn't find transmog or my Twitch drops)
• Useless Houses (From what I have played your house doesn't mean much)
• Useless Wands (When choosing your wand, the attributes don't do anything from what I have seen, from a game standpoint it makes sense)
• Small Enemy/Boss Variety ([spoiler]All 4 trials are the same, etc[/spoiler])
• Graphical Stuttering (In cutscenes mostly, sometimes happens when entering newly rendered areas)
• Lighting Transitions & Flickering (Sometimes the lighting can be blinding, or just straight up weird looking)
• Door Loading (When traversing the castle, sometimes the game will show a loading icon on doors)
• Robot Background NPCs (They pretty much don't do anything but walk and talk, with no reactions to spells or anything)
• NPC AI & Animations (Sometimes it's a bit janky)

[h1]What I Want to See:[/h1]
• Multiplayer (At least Quidditch multiplayer)
• Mod Support (Would be awesome, especially Steam Workshop)
• Quidditch (They have the Golden Snitch and the arena in-game already)
• Camera Control (Positioning, maybe increased FOV slider?)
• Photo Mode (Please!)
• Better Character Customization (More skin colors, hair, face shapes, and more)
• Improved Voice Pitch (Better pitch shifter)
• Improved Voice Acting (Most likely will not happen)
• Bug Fixes (Lighting transition fixes)
• Better Performance (Door loading improvements)
• More Accessibility Options (Arachnophobia switch?)
• Community Engagement (Free in-game events to win cosmetics, community updates and more! Ex. Dying Light 2 is a game that does this VERY well!)

[h1]What I Don’t Want to See:[/h1]
• Micro-transactions 
• Overpriced DLC
• Radio Silence (No more updates, no communication, and all that. Would be a bummer)

To conclude, most of the cons can be fixed easily, don't let the cons bring you down. I believe most of the cons will be fixed/addressed. Anyways, here are my PC specs and I ran the game at 1440p with consistent 120 FPS at almost all times! No RTX on!

1151340,Fallout 76,"2500+ Hour Launch Player Here. Just migrated my account to Steam.
Massive review, but all the cuts for character limit don't do justice. Bethesda is not interested in adding significant improvements to the game or protecting players. I have all the best gear, done it all and have exhausted everything. 

Fallout 1st / ""Pay for Storage""
Pay for it only once or just wait for a free trial. Load up like no tomorrow and you will almost never run out of resources.

Atom Shop
You can earn atoms for free. I currently have  ""$400 worth"" of stuff from the atom shop given for free.
Pro Tip: CS will refund your atoms and let you keep the items if you complain for any reason. You can even get refunded for entire bundles. Just don't do it more than once every other month.

Positives
+ Huge, unique, and amazing world full of detail. Lots of random moments too.
+ Some good base story moments. 
+ Free Story DLC. Some of it is good.
+ Huge variety of weapons and armor.
+ Some attempts to player diversify builds.
+ CAMP Building
+ Some really cool community events.
+ Clip through Door Exploit Still Exists
+ Improved loot system and Instanced technology.
+ Tons of cosmetics and CAMP items, most of them are free.
+ No subscription just to play

In Between
= Performance. No issues after upgrading, but I still hear stories.
= Being Reported will likely go nowhere, whether it is valid or not.
= Character Customization is just okay. 
= Visioned as Rust close, now PVE fest

Negatives
- Bethesda listens to the wrong people and does the wrong thing.
""I don't like it when it tooo dawk"" - Beta player who doesn't play anymore
* Makes nights too bright
""Wat if Atom Shawp was real place!"" - Reddit Galaxy brain who doesn't understand the amount of weekly work involved.
* Plasters Cardboard Vaultboy Cutout Shortcut Everywhere

- CAMP building could use less restrictions and more customization options.
- Lack of End Game Content
Only three events still exist that are intended for expert players, with the last one introduced two years ago.

- No more vault raids.
Expert event fumbled at launch. Instead of reworking it without the timer and adding a more appropriate boss, they dropped it entirely. Only remnant is a downsized version being used as an arena for Daily Ops.

- Content is constantly delayed or canceled entirely.
Major updates get delayed by a month or more. Four stars and improved pets silently dropped. Vaults dropped or downsized to empty smaller versions . NW was dropped with two unreleased maps. Completed presidential event dropped. Mole village and other areas dropped. Talks of PVP factions and survival competitions that never came to fruition. 

- New content is often short & unsatisfying.
Majority of new quest lines that come out every 8 months (if we're lucky) can be completed in under an hour. Choices don't matter and only affect some dialogue. The Pitt/Expeditions is just Daily Ops all over again. Better armor/power armor was introduced, but the best weapons of the game are still ones from launch.

- Legacy and Hacked Weapons
If you are new and have a friend who can hook you up, move this into the positive. If not, witness players seemingly tear through end game content without effort. Legacy weapons mostly consist of explosive energy weapons  that were removed from being dropped for being too powerful. However they were duped and thousands of them still exist in the game. 
There are also hacked weapons, weapons injected into the game that gave insane damage beyond intention. For a year, Bethesda refused to acknowledge these weapons even existed until the most common ones were disabled.

- Bethesda has no social responsibility. They ignore problems, until it publicly becomes a problem. 

If you have a legitimate issue even when the decision is ""final and not made lightly"", complain on reddit and hope it gains traction. Otherwise, it will never get resolved. People who lost their equipment due to a glitch (Vault Raid Event) or something malicious (Equipment stealer) were initially told nothing could be done about it.

Item Duplication via in game exploits ran wild for the first 3 months of launch with little to no disciplinary action... which of course just allowed the problem to spread with the assumption nothing would come of doing them. Instead of just wiping the characters and taking social responsibility, they banned a significant amount of people ""indefinitely"" and only unbanned them if they kept submitted support tickets about it months later. These duplicated items which include the best weapons still exist and continue to be given out freely or put on auction websites.

Nuclear Winter, their battle royale had tons of potential. It was then attacked by hackers using sophisticated third party software on a daily basis. During this time, it was proven their support stopped responding to tickets (with evidence!!) about the issue. Often just marking them as ""Resolved"" so that they could no longer be escalated. 

The NW bans didn't come until reddit and other outlets took to it publicly. Many of these hackers persisted for weeks, even months before being banned. Most of which only got a 3 day ban (sounds pretty light compared to the indefinite ban), just to go out and do it again before getting a permanent one two weeks later. 

- Code of Conduct really means, ""Whatever we feel like""

Recently a player known as ""TopHatFetus"" who used the name since launch had their name forcibly changed to OpalPenguin2. Instead of leaving it at just that, they also said this would be a permanent violation despite never having done anything else in the past. This was likely done in response to recent US politics. 

When researching the issue further, it appears other players were unfairly given these violations and even three day bans. These names which are subjectively offensive at best included TwistingHips78 (claims to have been mass reported by a troll group), AbhorsenRaist (named after a famous fantasy book), and bclinton8 (His real name actually happened to be William Clinton), Jack-The_Stripper (Parody Name). ManyFaces88 and MommySalami managed to get their violations reversed after resorting to reddit. It can be assumed many more people were affected, but have gone on unreported.

In a mature rated online game full of obscene material, a name like Bamboobzle (also banned) would be the least of my worries. I have also witnessed and reported legitimate harassment and racism with evidence, only for it to be ignored

- Sinseer 
An infamous troll among the Fallout 76 PC community who had seemingly been banned from every major discord, facebook group and reddit.  Footage still exists of this user engaging in extremely vulgar rants (on stream and in PUBLIC VOICE CHAT), using exploits, running two characters at once, using a voice disguiser, stalking and harassing other players. He also ran a website dedicated to name & shaming and even included players who had never even met him before. 

This individual for reasons unknown, managed to develop an open line with Bethesda in the form of phone calls and expedited support tickets for two years. Eventually the shenanigans got so far out of hand, they rightfully cut the relationship off and banned him. Of course, not before having amounted over 16,000 hours in the game.

- InnovSurvivalist
In contrast, this beloved and recognized youtuber who promotes the game in a positive light received a three day ban for ""griefing"". What happened you may ask? A group of trolls found a way to by pass pacifist and repeatedly destroy her camp. Getting annoyed, her husband got on the mic and let out a small vulgar line which the group mass reported.

What happened to the griefers who exploited to instigate the scenario? Nothing.

The game can be amazing for the first hundred hours or so, but there are likely better options if you want something that has a long term future and better support.

236390,War Thunder,"don't play this game if you care about your mental health


I still like it tho:)

P.S Thank you all :)",game care mental health tho p thank
2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"Having played FIFA titles competitively and consistently throughout the last 5-6 years, I can safely say without a doubt that this is the [b] most horrific title ever released. [/b] This may seem like an overreaction (after all, how bad can a reskinned football game be right?!), and I wish it was, but it isn't in the slightest. I will break this down into some broad sections:

[h3] Gameplay: [/h3]
Where do you start with this. It appears that, for what feels like the third time in a row in FIFA/FC franchises, that the AI is only capable of playing at a high level using high depth, direct passing tactics, that completely negate any form of tactical flexibility or stylistic influence you may wish to have (this may be my FM brain kicking in, but im sure most people dont ALWAYS want to play the same 90 minutes over and over again?). Having been in the elite divisions and consistently finishing FUT champs at around 16-4, I have not seen any variation, besides the starting formation to revert to the standard 4321 meta.

[h3] Player Flexibility: [/h3]
With the new Evolution system being introduced, I, like many fans, were excited to see what layer of tactical flexibility this could offer to teams in ultimate team. Unfortunately, this feature is SEVERELY disappointing. In classic monopolistic style micro-transaction paradise, more 'premium' upgrades are locked behind what seems to be a ridiculously steep paywall (I am of the opinion that paying upwards of £15 for a single player upgrade is quite frankly outrageous). Furthermore, the restrictions are so draconian that only a select crop of players can be eligible. Take the 'Centurions Midfielder' upgrade, with an increased price of 150k coins (don't try to calculate how many games you would need to play) or 2k fifa points. The ONLY usable player in this selection that would be considered meta is Marcos Llorente (shocker!), and any other would be a waste of hard earned currency/ies. Like most years, the availability of exclusive players is so unbelievably high that you would have to wait until AT LEAST post Xmas for any hope of obtaining top level cards (and that is generous, since i'm basing this off of my experience in previous titles, having playing EVERY weekend league with consistent rewards). Would you like to use your favourite footballer, Kylian Mbappe? That is a shame, since you would need a literal mortgage on fifa points to afford just his services (lets not even get into top tier icon prices!!). 

[h3] Player Movement: [/h3]
Remarkably, even due to the 'new' engine that was blessed to us two years ago on PC versions, the level of AI stupidity is quite frankly remarkable. Positional play is non-existent to be optimistic, and downright outrageous on the other end of the spectrum. Realistically, the only avenue of scoring is (you guessed it) Step 1: Buy fast wingers with playstyle+s that offer more 'pace' than their stats suggest (Chiesa is a good example), to then cut it back on a plate. There is no variation at the top level of the game, as this is the most achievable way of scoring a goal. The lacklustre player movement also extends to goalkeepers, who not only do NOT save shots with their actual hands (more so a forcefield aura around their gloves, magic!), but fail to make basic saving animations, and often find themselves locked into animations that they are unable to get out of. We've all seen Alisson Becker make a howler as he is diving sideways, despite the ball coming straight at him (I guess?).

[h3] Predatory Marketing: [/h3]
For what feels like an eternity, EA have been very fast to implement micro transactions into their games without actually considering improving the fundamental gameplay, which in turn would give a more enjoyable experience and thus make people consider spending their hard earned funds on the game. When one of your landmark features in your ultimate team breakdown is the 'Claim All' Button, shouldn't you be looking elsewhere? New packs have been introduced which can set you back a literal weeks shop (if you're not careful). Thankfully there is some pushback in Europe from countries such as Belgium, but more needs to be done to recognise this in built slot machine, which, is also key to note, is listed as a PEGI 3 (ie. EA are perfectly morally ok with the fact that literal children could be gambling money on their game, just to get a virtual card which will be irrelevant in 12 months!!).

730,Counter-Strike 2,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.

I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.

1203620,Enshrouded,"I really wanted to love this game. The single-player experience is pretty solid. the building and combat are great, and the world is compelling. It's a ton of fun to explore and discover new recipes. But at present, it's only really playable single-player. There are only 2 flame altars per server, which means that either a 4 or 16 player server must share 2 bases between them. There is no way to make your own base, or chests, they're available to all. There are no admin tools to deal with griefers either.

In addition progression is server wide, AND character dependent. This means if a character is not present when a quest is completed, they lose out on the rewards for the quest, but also can't receive the quests themselves, effectively gating their progression. Only one person gets boss and quest rewards, so on a 4-16 person server, good luck sharing loot.

Even in two player co-op, both players always present, quest progression is broken. you can only have one major quest at a time, and I had a quest to make a weapon, which I didn't complete, as I didn't realize it was gating my progression. In that time, I helped my co-op partner complete several quests, including a major boss kill, and I don't have the quest completion reflected in my journal, but the area is permanently altered and I can't receive or complete those quests, so my progression is bricked.

Given the way multiplayer is implemented, it's clear it started as a single-player game with a changing world that tacked on multiplayer to appeal to the survival craft genre.

If you want a single player survival game with a compelling world and decent combat, go for it. But if you want to play multiplayer in any capacity I would look elsewhere.",wanted love game single player experience pretty solid building combat great world compelling ton fun explore discover recipe present playable single player 2 flame altar per server mean 4 16 player server share 2 base make base chest available admin tool deal griefers addition progression server wide dependent mean present completed lose reward receive quest effectively gating progression one person get bos reward 4 16 person server good luck sharing loot two player co op player present progression broken one major time make weapon complete realize gating progression time helped co op partner complete quest including major bos kill completion reflected journal permanently altered receive complete quest progression bricked given multiplayer implemented clear started single player game changing world tacked multiplayer appeal survival craft genre single player survival game compelling world decent combat multiplayer capacity look elsewhere

Update: After a year we finally get XP for performance (win/lose, end-of-match placement, etc)

Personally, I would have thought it better if we also got XP for kills, for example 10XP for a normal kill and 10+5XP for a precision kill. Especially since the weekly challenges have become significantly fewer and we get less XP for them. 
Unfortunately, you have to wait a relatively long time for the game to find a match, the average waiting time can often be 2-5 minutes, this is a huge deterioration compared to the previous ~10 seconds, although this is understandable in terms of the number of simultaneous players. I think the winter update of the game brought some very good changes and additions, but I feel like it did it too late. If it were possible to give a neutral rating, I would change it.

899770,Last Epoch,"Like the lovechild of Diablo and Path of Exile that has the best features of both, Last Epoch is everything I'm looking for in an Arpg.  From the diverse classes, to the unique boss attacks and patterns, to the robust filter--Last Epoch gets all the small details right. However, I have to say it's the intuitive crafting systems for both skills and items that's the real winner. I never liked crafting in other games because it was always buried beneath a byzantine system of checks and balances. Here, they handle crafting as a more WYSIWYG affair. You know what you're getting and, with the items, you know the success probability of it being crafted without a hitch. No more mixing recipes or putting runes in a certain order--do you want to add damage, or speed, or cheaper mana cost. Then by the effing gods that's what you need to find and that's what you craft onto your item. Period.

Once multiplayer is added and the story to completion is added, I literally think this has the foundation to blow 95% of the other Arpg's out of the water--including Grim Dawn and PoE. The barrier for entry is low, but the path to mastery is still long and exciting. In my book that's the winning combination.",lovechild diablo path exile best feature last epoch everything looking arpg diverse class unique bos attack pattern robust filter last epoch get small detail right intuitive crafting system skill item real winner liked crafting game buried beneath byzantine check balance handle crafting wysiwyg affair getting item success probability crafted hitch mixing recipe putting rune certain order add damage speed cheaper mana cost effing god need craft onto item period multiplayer added story completion added literally foundation blow 95 arpg water including grim dawn poe barrier entry low path mastery long exciting book winning combination

686810,Hell Let Loose,"// Please scroll down to ""EDIT #3"" - I still like the game, but the devs have dropped the ball in a few ways

For an early access game, Hell Let Loose does everything right.

This is the best modern WW2 shooter on the market IMO. You have the pacing/action of Red Orchestra/Rising Storm with the tactical play of Squad and PS.

Unlike Squad and PS, you won't have 30 minute breaks between fighting and won't have to wait 15+ minutes after the match starts to fight. The maps are large enough, but their design encourages players to get into the action quickly, while still retaining a very important tactical meta. That meta doesn't just include field tactics such as flanking, defending, finding superior firing positions, etc., but also a Commander role which leads your team and has the power to call supply drops, strafing runs, and bombing runs.

Armor can dominate the battlefield if used appropriately, and player-controlled artillery guns can wreak havoc on enemy positions. The experience of being an infantryman while tactically pushing forward alongside armor and a platoon's worth of soldiers, while being hailed with artillery and enemy small arms fire, is really a sight to see.


There is both role and career progression that unlocks authentically-appropriate cosmetics, FOR FREE. No MTX, no lootboxes, you can only earn these items by playing the game.

The devs post updates almost weekly; some are small, and some are quite large.

There are 5 completed maps on live servers, 1 more is being released within the next few weeks, and they stated they have 3 additional maps in the current development pipeline (community believes at least one of these is Carentan). (edit: I think it's more like 10 or 11 maps at this point, with plenty more on the way)

Graphics are surely good enough. Audio design and animations could use some reworking, which is exactly what is happening. The current audio for weapons and animations for weapons/movement are being upgraded significantly at the moment, and this update will be pushed to player clients within the next few months.

The devs have stated they intend to include the Asian theatre (likely US-Japanese) and Eastern Front. 

If you were disappointed by BFV, this game might be for you. It doesn't exactly play like BF, it isn't quite a sandbox. And you really really need to work with your team. Having a mic is preferable, but most leaders in-game will be OK with your presence as long as you can understand/follow orders and occasionally type in the chat.

Very bright future ahead for HLL, and it's already shining quite a bit IMO.

I rate HLL in its current state an 8.5/10, and I believe the release product will be truly amazing.

EDIT #1: Changed 4 maps to 5 maps.

EDIT #2: Adding performance information I posted in another thread -

i7 3820
EVGA GTX 1080 FTW
16GB 2333mhz
850 EVO SSD
1440p

Almost all maxed settings, slightly higher than default FOV, and two settings on Medium - I think one is Shadows and I forget the other. FX/textures are definitely kept maxed. Also using FXAA. And setting corpse despawn to lowest possible.

Steady 60 - 90, drops to 40-45 with heavy action/lots of players. Pretty playable, it's not like a twitch reaction shooter like CoD that often, though I still would like a better processor. But due to Intel's annoying socket release I'm stuck with this until I get a fully new PC.

EDIT #3: Well, things have faltered slightly. Since I last updated this review, the devs have added MTX and a console version. Pacing of updates has slowed down as well, and the game suffers from long periods of imbalance in which everyone (including the devs) agree certain features aren't working well, but they refuse to diverge from their ""once every 5 to 6 months"" patch schedule.

Example: they are deactivating the Commander's Final Stand ability in the upcoming early December update (U11)  - this has literally been publicly known to be exploitable for YEARS.

It's still a great game, but there are rough edges that will likely never be sorted out.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"At the time of writing this I am roughly around 180 hours in the game.

When I first got into Elder Scrolls it was with Skyrim. Playing only that and none of the other previous games I was blown away with how detailed that game was. When I heard that a MMORPG was made with the same title I was very enthusastic. When I got Elder Scrolls Online, I was told it would not be ""Skyrim Online"", and to an extent, those whom mentioned it were correct. However my thoughts and feelings on that statement have changed quite a bit.

After playing for as long as I have, which in comparison to many others, I have found this to be right at home with my previous experience with Skyrim. I absolutley love this game. I feel that it is totally worth the $60 price tag and I invite other open minded players to give this game a shot. There are many differences from the Single Player version of Elder Scrolls but all of the reasons I loved Skyrim are placed in this game.

The ability to customize my character in any way I see fit, the endless caves, areas and places of interest to see. Fully voiced NPC's and endless hours of lore and other content for players to experience. Not to mention that NPC's reconize your heroic feats as you walk by them, often singing your praises and sometimes even questioning some of your actions that you have made in the game. In fact, there are many circumstances where I have had to make a tough decision and have spent much time dwelling after the fact if I made the right call. Should I have helped fight at the docks or was defending the fort the better call? The result might be the same but the fact that I even had to contemplate the lives of fictional NPC's that I would never meet again shows how enriching the plot can be.

The  PvP in my opinion is very hard, but very fun. I die often, but its not frustrating. Being able to team togeather with random strangers, plan an attack and take a fort seems like it would be difficult to do but everyone is on board and ready to play the game. They want to succeed as much as you and I found the community helpful and enriching, not to mention being able to use seige weapons is so much fun and adds a level of excitment I didn't realize was part of the game.

In the non PvP side, I found most players to be felpful, friendly and very outgoing. I found a guild almost right away and in that guild was open minded Veteren players who wanted to help grow and encourage newer players. Often investing a lot of time and energy explaining various parts of the game such as Armor, Weapons, Skill's, ect. Even non guild members and complete strangers are often pretty nice. I can recall looking for a Werewolf Bite and after a few bad players asking me for a ton of gold and crafting materials in order to give me a bite, one player simple messaged me and say ""don't pay them anything, I will give it to you for free."" Not only that but he also gave me tips on how to complete the Werewolf single player quest.

I plan on sticking with this MMORPG for a very long time. Its fun, its first person, its 3rd person and its live action. It has its faults, all games do, but if you can take things with an open mind and a grain of salt you will find much love for this awesome game. It wont ever be ""Skyrim Online"" but in many ways I really feel it is. A great story, great community of players, a big wide open world to explore with choices that are unique to your character. Seems pretty close in my opinion.

You are too busy milking all the 12-year old FUTwhales that spend mum and dad's money on your stupid packs, which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end. You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC. 

I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be. Speaking of lists, I am going to provide one with all of the bugs that I encountered in my first few hours of game-play.

 → Choppy animations, frames drop and becomes an eye-sore to watch.
 → Commentary does not work on launch. There is 0 commentary.
 → Player models, the hair, bugs out when it is rainy and foggy. Becomes pixelated.
 → Can not connect to the internet (whatever this means). 
 → Controllers not working properly.
 → Game keeps minimising on PC. 
 → The game is not opening and launching for so many players.
 → Can not sack coaches in Career Mode, it just freezes. 
 → Objectives not counting.
 → Not getting XP when completing objectives. 
 → The game freezes on the EA FC logo. 
 → Stuck in half-time animation.
 → Game-play stutter. 
 → Overall TERRIBLE performance even on high-end hardware. 
 → Anti-cheat error message. 
 → Media questions still make 0 sense.
 → Same animations for media interviews and transfers.
 → Same animations for injuries, etc. 0 innovation and creativity here.
 → Menu in FUT will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again.
 → If you navigate the menu too quickly, it messes up and goes all over your screen.

Again, like mentioned, this list could be as long as you want it to be. The point is, you are incompetent EA, and you are ESPECIALLY incompetent when it comes to creating a proper PC port. But of course, because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives, you can keep getting away with this. I am an idiot for playing this game and ""enabling it"" and I know I am, but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run. 

Also, why on Earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game? What went on in your heads over there at EA when you thought, hmm, let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go. What about Champions League nights, important finals, etc? There is no immersion anymore. You do not get to watch your team walk out, line up, with the anthem roaring in the background, your players lined up and ready to battle it out... it just sends you straight into action. This is SO stupid. As a Career Mode enjoyer (shock, I know right, cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode?) this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games, especially big ones. Mind-boggling decision. Begs the question, in typical EA fashion, which iteration of EA FC will you bring this back and market it as a ""brand new, immersive feature""?",year year ea despite one highest grossing video game company time fail deliver product release reflective price paying premium game year met lacklustre mundane boring feature year sure blame continuing game truth love football love football fifa ea sport fc game scratch itch viable competitor love beautiful game football buying ea refuse hard coding game add feature improve game busy milking 12 year old futwhales spend mum dad money stupid pack ultimately matter care career mode proper innovated dawn jesus christ pro club untapped potential matter fut whale splashing thousand thousand year player item obsolete following iteration fifa eafc despite paying disrespect continuously shown pc player unforgivable year year forgot absolute disaster release fifa 21 fifa 22 fifa 23 lucky enough launch game met terrible fps choppy animation bugged player model honestly list endless wanted speaking list provide one bug encountered hour game choppy animation frame drop eye sore watch commentary work launch 0 commentary player model hair bug rainy foggy pixelated connect internet whatever mean controller working properly game keep minimising pc game opening launching player sack coach career mode freeze objective counting getting xp completing objective game freeze ea fc logo stuck half time animation game stutter overall terrible performance high hardware anti cheat error message medium question make 0 sense animation medium interview transfer animation injury etc 0 innovation creativity menu fut freeze close game launch navigate menu quickly mess go screen mentioned list long incompetent ea especially incompetent come creating proper pc port course love football simply alternative getting idiot playing game enabling stop speaking disgrace company earth remove player walking onto pitch lining game head ea thought hmm replace key immersion building realism replace stupid cutscenes immediately throw game everyone already pitch ready champion league night important final etc immersion anymore get watch team walk line anthem roaring background player lined ready battle sends straight action stupid career mode enjoyer shock right cause willingly play neglected mode totally kill getting sort feeling towards game especially big one mind boggling decision begs question typical ea fashion iteration ea fc bring market brand immersive feature
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"[b]9/10 - Would Manderville again.[/b]
[i]This review was written based on version 3.0[/i]

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Consistent, large patches about every 3 months.
[*]Gorgeous graphics engine. 
[*]Deep crafting system.
[*]Probably the best storytelling in an MMO I've ever seen (but it does take 30+ hour to really get into the meat of it)
[*]One of the most friendly gaming communities around.
[*]Cross-platform play with the PS3 and PS4, excellent controller support for PC.
[*]Possible to play casually and still enjoy/experience the game with hardcore friends.
[*]Hildebrand - Game doesn't take itself too seriously and just has fun.
[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Game doesn't reinvent the MMO wheel. It is a pretty standard ""theme park"" MMO. That being said, it is extremely polished and everything in the game is executed very well.
[*]Subscription model, I was almost tempted to put this in the Pros column. One of the few games to do this model well in a sea of F2P MMOs.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Tens of hours of monotonous fetch quests sprinkled throughout the game. Usual MMO fare.
[*]Long PvP queues, slightly unbalanced. (Not enough people play PvP)
[*]Endgame content can be very grindy at times. (Ex: Relic Weapons, and ""Run the same 2 dungeons over and over to get currency to buy gear"".)
[*]Gil sellers - I realize this happens in pretty much every MMO. This didn't make the list because it happens, it is strictly on the list because of advertising chat spam. On an average day you will see a lot of messages (unless you're like me and are so fed up with it you go /away). Expect the spam to be cranked up to 11 whenever a large piece of content is released. I really feel SE could implement better countermeasures with respect to advertising. It does seem worse than in many of it's other AAA MMO competitors. On a side note, I'm told the JP servers are practically gil seller free. I've never tested this myself however. Overall, not a huge con, but an annoyance none the less.

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"It started off well, but by about half way through you have seen every single mission type they are going to do, the city looks empty, half the character's traversals are fiddly and un fun, and worse is that you get to a point that maybe 1 out of every 10 enemies you can actually kill with your gun.  The amount of constraints constantly put on you (can only be killed with a grenade, can only be killed by a melee attack first, can only be killed after building up a meter) on even the simplest grunt makes every encounter a chore.

The cut scenes are wonderful, funny, well acted, and amazing motion capture, but everything else, including the CONSTANT ""evil batman"" voice in your ear when you are out in the field just slowly sucks the joy out of the game.

I don't mind a live service grind, but this is more of a chore, than a way to relax.

Hopefully they can do a Diablo4 style patch and quickly respond to it, but this strikes me as going the way of Marvels Avengers instead.",started half seen single mission type city look empty half traversal fiddly un fun worse get maybe 1 10 enemy kill gun constraint constantly killed grenade killed melee attack killed building meter simplest grunt make encounter chore cut scene wonderful funny acted amazing motion capture everything else including constant evil batman voice ear field slowly suck joy game mind live service grind chore relax hopefully diablo4 style patch quickly respond strike marvel avenger

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Team17's inherent ineptitude and complete lack of a stakeholder engagement strategy is on full display following U14. As a community owner and server provider, I am extremely disappointed with the level of communication we've had through official channels both prior to game updates/patches, and afterwards when we've encountered issues. 

Communities such as mine form the backbone of the broader Hell Let Loose community. We host 6 servers across three regions ($780 AUD/month), attract and retain new players, promote the game to our broader audience, and contribute to the game's social fabric. To say I am disappointed that I cannot elicit answers from Team17 on the most basic hosting questions is an understatement. 

The lack of a PTE (or anything outside of developer QA) prior to the latest updates is nonsensical, and it really shows in U14. Other reviews have articulated the myriad of bugs better than I can, but needless to say, the amount and severity of the bugs is unacceptable for an established $70 game made by a large studio. The QA processes need an overhaul, and desperately needs broader community involvement. 

Invest in your key stakeholders as we have invested in your game.

1599340,Lost Ark,"As someone who has played the RU version for 1000hrs+ and have leveled two characters legit and boosted 8 of them (to 50) my two cents about the topic:

+ The game is a fun journey from start to the endgame. The leveling process gets a bit dull, but on your first character it's manageable.

+ The start of the endgame is quite fun. When you first hit 50 there's a lot 'island quest' storylines to complete, reputation quests to unlock, new guardian fights/new dungeons/new raids to experience, some 'sea events' and other 'timed events' to check out. Progression feels pretty good and smooth (until you gear gets around +9, the +10-+15 upgrades are significantly 'harder' to succeed => More fails => More costs => Way slower progress).

+ The equalized arena PvP is fun although very CC-heavy and takes a little learning curve to get into. However the rewards are quite poor beyond the 'weekly' ones, so unless you are really into PvP you probably won't spend a lot of time playing it. The ranked PvP is only TRUE SOLO QUEUE, so no premades (which is pretty fun for solo players!).

What does this actually have to do with potential P2W and 'forced alts'?

+ Kinda tricked you with the topic. The game is a fun journey even before you need to think about spending.

To the actual topic:

+ Once you hit your first progression wall (starting from +9 / +10 upgrading) you'll start to see yourself being handicapped by various resources. It might be materials (drops from limited daily dungeons/daily quests etc.), it might be shillings (daily dungeon/daily quests/'limited' cube dungeon), or it might be gold (weekly dungeons/weekly raids/weekly quests). To get through this wall you'll either need to just take it slow (log-in and do your daily/weekly things) or go faster (start making alts that allow you to farm more of the aforementioned) or go super fast (start top-upping with $/€'s and turn that into gold to get the resources needed for the upgrade gamble).

+ 'Taking it slow' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character

+ 'Going faster' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character + 1-2 hours or so per WEEK per alt character

+ 'Going super fast' is only limited by your bank account <- beware though getting to 'max gear' as soon as possible removes many gaming goals you might have when 'taking it slow' or 'going faster'

Now there are other monetizations that boost your progression in various ways but these are laid out in other posts and are not that significant. Basically with 50$ you'll get all the permanent things you'll ever 'need' and then you have the option of running the recurring 'crystalline aura (sub)' for extra benefits. The only thing I'd raise as a 'must-have' is the pet which is around 5-10$ and it's ACCOUNT WIDE, so you'll only need one of them. The reason for the pet is auto-looting, which is a major convinience for your daily dungeon running (the pet picks up the constant loot pinata from the daily dungeons instead of having to run around furiously smackin the loot button). Pets are also given out through events so you are likely to get one for free sooner or later.

TLDR; The game is a fun journey from 1-50 regardless of whether you spend a single dime or not. When you get to the mid-late game (of the current patch) you'll either take it slow (1 character), go faster (alts) or you go super fast (spending $/€'s).

2073850,THE FINALS,"I want to recommend. This game is so much fun. Until cheaters... Nearly every match now. But the devs don't want to region lock China because it ""is xenophobic"".

Region locking China has NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE. The Chinese culture does not see ""cheating"" as ""cheating"" like Western culture does. If you are smart enough to get a leg up on an opponent, then you deserve it. To them, it's intelligent, not cheating. Either stop giving BS excuses or stop being so damned sensitive. You could be black, white, brown, yellow, green, blue, purple, etc. - if you're born and raised in China you would have the same cultural stance. 

Let the cheaters play with cheaters; because to their culture there's nothing wrong with it. Stop MAKING US PLAY WITH THEM.

--Edit: Hot damn, I cannot stress this enough: cultural differences exist. They're not wrong, they just exist. The Chinese ""Art of War"" cultural viewpoint isn't wrong. It's different. It's OKAY to respect the difference in cultures around the world while realizing it doesn't mesh with other cultures. This has nothing to do with race. Stop watering the word ""racism"" down, it means absolutely nothing now because it's been so overused.

1888930,The Last of Us™ Part I,"Alright, these are gonna be some harsh words that I´m about to say but I´ll say them anyway.
TLOU is an incredible game and I dont think that its necessary to explain why.
At this point everyone and their mothers have heard about the game so let´s skip that part.
I myself experienced TLOU shortly after release on the PS3 and have never heard about the game in any way possible.
When i got to play it, I was hooked on it so bad that i bought the game 3 more times.
Yes i bought the PS4 Remastered twice (Cause i lost the first copy) and after almost 10 years of waiting I bought it for the PC for the Full Price.... AGAIN, but now I´m finally able to play it... or am I?

Well release wasnt that pleasant but heres a short Rundown on how its state for me was on release, and how it is now.

For my Specs I´m running a Ryzen 5 2600 with 16 Gb of Ram, for the Gpu I´m having a RX5700XT (and yes its being bottlenecked by the Cpu) and im playing on a Full HD Monitor with only 60 hz cause my 144hz Monitor broke recently.
I also have FSR 2.0 activated on the ""Quality"" Setting.

Okay lets get started:
Release: The game was literally unplayable for me. Besides the extremely Long Shader Cache installation the game itself was horrible and in an absolute unacceptable state.
I had LOADING WINDOWS MID GAME. Even the Ps3 didnt have this (and yes I know the game is specifically coded for the ps3 and other Console Plattforms) but why did they decide to let the Worst Porting studio in the History of PC-Porting handle the biggest Trademark of their company. Well i had the game on all settings, Strict and Mixed (sometimes it didnt even care what my settings were and loaded low poly models instead) and it was just unplayable in every way so i decided to wait.

Patch 1.0.1.5: I mean... it fixed some stuff?
I still resorted to the widelyspread Oodle fix wich did increase my performance a bit and made it ""playable"" but not enjoyable. Still I managed to play for couple of hours wihtout wanting to rethink my choices in life.

Patch 1.0.1.6: Meh nothing changed really.
Small improvements and a tiny bit less stutter but nothing major really.

Patch 1.0.1.7: This Patch focused mainly on crashes but I never had any Issues with them really.

Patch 1.0.2.0: Okay now we´re talking.
There are some major improvements for stability and performance in general.
Also they fixed the high Vram usage which was just a display error.
It wasnt displaying the right amount of vram usage when changing graphic settings.
Also it reduced the overall Cpu usage which is always nice.

Patch 1.0.2.1: Wonderful.
They fixed an Issue where you had massive camera jitter which was just unbearable.
Small Patch but definitely an Improvement.
At this point I´m also halfway through the Game.

Patch 1.0.3.0: What happened???
This patch focused on mostly audio based issues and various issues across the board but it somehow managed to kinda tank the performance a bit. At this point im almost done with the game but I noticed that my ram was filling to the brim and suddenly dumps everything leaving my cpu to be overloade and my storage doing nothing,
This causes my game to be left at about 30-40 fps for couple of minutes until my ram has been build up again.

Patch 1.0.4.0: WOW.
I finished the game before the Patch released but I´m playing my NG+ save on this patch and ist awesome.
Finally something with not only Major improvements, I´d say they´re Gigantic Improvements.
-More Graphic Settings
-Optimized CPU and GPU Usage
-Much better Performance
-More acceptable Loading Times (Still faster then GTA V)
-Better Texture Streaming across the Board
-And a much more fluent Experience
All the annoying issues at the beginning were gone or mostly fixed.
There are still some major issues, such as the definite memory leak that is happening and I´m pretty sure they can get it much more optimized, but overall the game is moving in a playable and enjoyable state...

which is exactly what it should because i think TLOU is an experience everyone should take the chance to have this experience. And without ad oubt, this remke of the game IS the definitive edition.
Still as a long time fan since the beginning, I´m more then dissapointed in what stae the long awaited PC-Port arrived and i hope for Naughty Dog that the can make this Port to state that its meant to be played, because as it is, it is disrespecting towards themselves, their whole Fanbase (which isnt a small one) and the story that is being told inside the Game.
And thats that.

Edit: Patch 1.0.5 has been released a couple of hours ago. Ill try to play it as soon as the 50gb update has finished.
Its focusing on every major issue so im excited to see for myself how it played out.
Also I know there are a lot of grammar issues in my review so far, but i aint gonna fix them, so go ahead, sue me.
Alright the Patch did fix a lot of stuff but theres something weird about it.
At this point im now able to play the game on Medium-High Settings without FSR Upscaling, and im reaching around 50-60 fps much more stable.
It aint perfect, but its more then playable, its almost enjoyable.
They also fixed the overloading ram issue that set my ram back for about 2-4 gb in space which is a lot.
There are more graphic settings, better resource utilization etc. but there is no real performance bump...
Yes the game runs much more stable and the frametimes are much tighter then before, but real preformance improvements in terms of raw fps, there is no significant difference, but I feel like this is the first version that should have gone to retail.

(Edit 23.05) Okay I´ve noticed something really weird.
I´ve updated to the latest drivers and reset my shader cache after reinstalling the game once.
Im now able to play on Ultra without FSR?
Im confused, but whats even more confusing then that... well the fact that the game doesnt have any performance impact when changing settings.
The only thing that is affected is the Vram usage, but my resource utilisation was maxed bringing me to around 45-60 fps.
I´m not sure whats going on, but at least, in my opinion, its playable so...

(Edit 30.05 Patch 1.0.5.1)
This patch does focus on stability improvements, even though I did not notice any real performance difference, I did notice a much faster boot and loading time then before. (This may vary tho)
Not much else then that but better then nothing :)
I´ll be keeping on updating until this game is in an almost perfect state.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Have not had a JRPG in a long time, was looking to play together with a friend from far away.
Action combat feels nice, art style is good. Sound mediocre at best.

- from the 2nd start of the game, i had 5 crashes to blacksreen
- i had to switch to window mode and since you can only set preset resolutions i play now in small full HD window on my ultra wide 2.5k
- you have to play a bit to get to coop mode, which is not story 
- no matter how we invite each other we can not play, session not there, network error whatever
- looking a bit, seems we suffer from region lock

I personally think it should not be possible to label a game coop such as this on steam this is basic multiplayer for side quests, and region locked should be a must to flag.

As a single player game (thats waht it is) this should be bought on a PS5, even though the graphics are PS4 at max.

Of course you now have more than 2 hours of gameplay after you looked up everything and played the ""intro"" so far, you can not refund it now.
Very clever.

I am absolutely pi$$ed, this is like 120€ down the drain. Of course i can play this solo but sure not in this shitty window.

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"UPDATE:

I made 2 new tickets. 1 about the lost account and the other about the lost progress. I also sent a separate email to the privacy center. 2 days before this happened, I got the game and it said something about my data and I'm tired of everything taking our data and selling it for profit. So, it offered to go to a site to request them not to sell it. They also offer to delete it, fix it, and see it. I chose to delete it to protect myself. I usually don't care but I guess I wasn't feeling it that day. And I figured why give it to them to play a game? Anyway, there's like 5 or 6 things to fill out like name and email and simple things. Then you submit it and verify your email from a link. NOWHERE in the process did I sign in my account or see anything about my account information. It just said ""data"". 2 days later, this happened. I'm waiting for a reply, but I think they delete your data as in ALL your data. Your account, saves, email, rewards, etc. So, if that's what happened, I'm going to see if they can recover my data. If not, then I know that I lost my account forever with a couple pieces of information to ""identify"" it's me and a vague website that doesn't explain what you're actually doing or use enough security measure to verify it's you and what you want to do. Which is worse than what happened with ""customer service"". I'll update when I have more information. But, DO NOT DELETE YOUR DATA JUST IN CASE. 

Original Review: 

I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER WB TITLE UNLESS THEY FIX ""CUSTOMER SERVICE OR MY ISSUES. I put in over 14 hours of game time and progressed a lot, unlocked a lot, crafted, grinded, etc. Last night I logged off the game with no issues. Today, I went to play and noticed I was in the tutorial now. If I quit the session, it quits the game. There is NO LOCAL SAVE DATA! It's all saved to the WB servers. I went to sign into my WB Games account so I can potentially fix the issue. I realized that I was not singing in but creating an account with the exact same information! This means that my F$#%ING account is GONE! I created the account about 1 year ago almost to the day. I checked my email from creating the account. I also saw the one where I changed my username to what it is. Then I saw the one email where I set up 2FA. I have NOT deleted my account, but it's just gone like my hopes for WB Games and their awful ""customer service"". I reached out on twitter since it seems to be the way when I tried to find out how to contact them. Their site is horrible and is not helpful for support. They asked me for a ticket number. So, I had to create a ticket and they sent me a link. It was ""successful"". I did not get an email confirmation and there is no place to see tickets. So, I did it again and got an email this time and gave them the code. They told me they will tell them to respond. So, they did NOTHING on twitter. I got a reply and started the conversation. I told them how I had an account already and it is gone. I told them the birthday is wrong on the new account I do not even want. I told them how my progress has vanished. Long story short, they ignored the fact that my account is missing, they said the save is made on a ""temporary account that I made while playing and refused to tell me how to retrieve the save, they told me to link Steam to my new account, then nothing was resolved and they told me they're closing my ticket and said they will tell the devs or whatever but ignored my missing account and wrong birthday and how to get the save. This is the most unacceptable experience I have ever had with ANY form of ""customer experience"" in my entire life. I am out an account, save progress, Steam linked to an account I can't unlink it from, and I'm out time and money. I even tried going through the tutorial until I get to the point where I can use the main menu and all I can do is play the current game. This means I can again lose my account and progress and have no way to get either back. I would NOT recommend purchasing this game unless they fix this, or you enjoy losing your account and progress and being ignored. I mean some people are probably into that.

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"To start with a disclaimer: I watched my friends stream the game after I got a refund after nearly an hour and a half of playtime. I did not enjoy my experience.

***THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS***

Let me begin this review with what little good this game has to offer since that list is shorter:

- The first encounter with Batman: it's just really cool to be on the other side for once and be the prey to the Batman.

-King Shark: not exactly a ""good"" character per se, but more of all of his dialogue was so bad it's good. Every word out of his mouth was hilarious. For the other members of the team, dialogue was just bad.

- Shark Lantern: even this was a wasted opportunity and clearly only exists for spectacle. I hesitate to even call it something good from the game because of how it's immediately undone and doesn't matter. After defeating the Green Lantern, King Sharks puts on his ring and creates a gigantic, green shark to attack Brainiac's ship. It's a genuinely cool experience until you think about it.
First off, it is immediately undone because King Shark with his new lantern power betrays the others by turning the shark against them, and of course they're saved at the last second by them removing his ring. The ring then falls into the water never to be seen again.
Secondly, this is such a huge missed opportunity. There could've been a much better sense of progression if every character somehow gained a power to compliment the JL in the mid to late game especially since these people are expected to fight Superman. Or just don't tease us with that scene at all.

-Not as buggy as your average modern game upon release. This is not saying much at all, there are still bugs, but there are surprisingly not nearly as many as you would expect seeing as how lazy the entire industry is. Not many game breaking bugs either.

Now that's out of the way let's get into the problems.

-The UI. This game is ADHD incarnate. There is way too much going on at all times to the point where at any given point you will likely not know anything that's going on. Furthermore, the UI isn't even unique. It just looks identical to every single AAA game released since 2020.

-The gameplay. To be fair, this does depend heavily on what character you play as, and it can be subjective. Overall it's fine. That's it. Nothing unique (a common theme with this game) or groundbreaking at all it's just fine. In my experience, King Shark was the best one to play as, but even that was a bland experience. Harley just felt like Batman, Deadshot is literally identical to Fortnite, and Boomerang was really bad.

-The story. Seriously, who wrote this? This might be the worst part of the entire game, I think I would be able to get past everything else if the story was written well but it just isn't. As stated before, dialogue is awful. If you've ever seen a Marvel movie, just imagine that. There is very little character development whatsoever, and while there are real scenes that try to be emotional most of them are either ruined by some Marvel tier joke or don't even work to begin with because of the terrible writing from the rest of the game. The only character who had an iota of an arc was Wonder Woman, and it really felt like this should've been a WW game because of it. Too bad she died before that arc could even finish.

-The boss fights/ending. These are members of the Justice League. The Flash and Green Lantern fights were fine, but it felt weird that Batman and Superman went down just like that. It felt out of character for them, but this could be from years of only knowing these two as being basically invincible.
But then there's the Brainiac fight, which is just a reskin of the Flash fight.

Also there are 13 of them. Only one is needed to beat the game but you don't even get the one from the correct universe. Oh yea the multiverse is here too because of course it is. Of course the only reason for this is to artificially inflate gameplay hours to make the game look good. Have fun spending however long it takes to fight 12 more Brainiacs.

And that's it. The game just ends and leaves you with 12 more Brainiacs including the one who attacked your Earth initially. There is no real conclusion to this. The game is just slop designed to keep you playing with no real artistic value whatsoever. This is not worth $70.",disclaimer watched friend stream game got refund nearly hour half playtime enjoy experience review contain spoiler review little good game offer list shorter encounter batman cool side prey batman king shark exactly good per se dialogue bad good word mouth hilarious member team dialogue bad shark lantern wasted opportunity clearly exists spectacle hesitate call good game immediately undone matter defeating green lantern king shark put ring creates gigantic green shark attack brainiac ship genuinely cool experience immediately undone king shark lantern power betrays others turning shark course saved last second removing ring ring fall water seen secondly huge missed opportunity sense progression somehow gained power compliment jl mid late game especially expected fight superman tease scene buggy average modern game release saying bug surprisingly nearly expect seeing lazy entire industry game breaking bug get problem ui game adhd incarnate time given furthermore ui unique look identical single aaa game released 2020 fair depend heavily subjective overall fine unique common theme game groundbreaking fine experience king shark best one bland experience harley felt batman deadshot literally identical fortnite boomerang bad story seriously wrote worst entire game able get past everything else story written stated dialogue awful ever seen marvel movie imagine little development whatsoever real scene emotional ruined marvel tier joke work terrible writing rest game iota arc wonder woman felt ww game bad died arc finish bos fight ending member justice league flash green lantern fight fine felt weird batman superman felt year knowing two basically invincible brainiac fight reskin flash fight 13 one needed beat game get one correct universe oh yea multiverse course course reason artificially inflate hour make game look good fun spending long take fight 12 brainiac game end leaf 12 brainiac including one attacked earth initially real conclusion game slop designed playing real artistic value whatsoever worth 70

1144200,Ready or Not,"Look, I am not exaggerating here when I say this but, Ready or Not is genuinely one of the most thrilling, nerve-wrecking, exciting and best games I have played so far this year. For someone like me that grew up playing SWAT 4 pretty much every day after school on my dad's old Dell PC this game brings back a lot of nostalgia for me which makes it even better. I think I speak for all of us that played SWAT 4 when I say we have all been waiting and seething for a similar title that can scratch that itch - Ready or Not does just that. The game is fantastic in every single aspect. I also love how punishing and difficult it can be at times. The margin for error is very small, which just adds to the realism. 

The game very much fits the ""Early Access"" model at this current state and content is neither here nor there in my book. At the moment there are currently 6 vastly different maps, a hotel, a gas station, a crack house, a port, a farm and a car dealership. All 6 of aforementioned maps are beautifully crafted with the visuals immediately immersing you in the world you are playing in. The sound design is awesome as well, might I add. The sound of explosions, flashbangs, the guns, they sound and feel impactful, something even AAA studios fail to replicate at times. 

The AI are either good or straight up stupid at times, they are definitely the one thing that needs the most work. But I find that most of the time they do work relatively fine. 

I hope to see the implementation of achievements - which would be cool to grind for/incentivise us to play - and more customisation - that stays true to real life, of course, Jesus forbid we get another RS6 - and potentially more weapons to fool around with.

230410,Warframe,"This story requires a bit of setup.

Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a ""Grandmaster"" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.

Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.

On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now.

We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.

I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for).

Thanks, Digital Extremes.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[h1] The Elder Scrolls Online - Tamriel Unlimited [/h1]

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Tamriel.  A continent at war. The Dominion, Pact and Covenant fight for supremacy in the Imperial province of Cyrodiil. Meanwhile, Molag Bal has stolen your fucking soul. 

[h1] Review -11/26/15 [/h1]
[b] Graphics [/b]

Tamriel Unlimited is pretty. It has a variety of different environments - from the sandy, sunbaked land of Elsweyr, to the frigid, unforgiving land that is Eastmarch. Whilst no, the graphics aren't particularly revolutionary, and definitely not the same quality as Skryim, this is to be expected. For an MMORPG, the Elder Scrolls Online is up there with one of the best looking. Occasionally the world looks a bit 'the same', but usually as you advance to other provinces, the environment and ambience is noticeably different. 

EDIT: After a discussion with someone who commented on this review (which you can read below) I'd like to add this: 
Skyrim was a very graphically capable game. The base game, on ultra, compared to ESO, on ultra, is more graphically detailed than ESO in my opinion. However, this may depend on different viewpoints and whatnot. The graphics design and feel each game wishes to portray is different, and this may lead to differences in opinion - which is to be expected.

8/10

[b] PvE [/b]

Player vs Environment is the part of this game that gets particularly monotonous. It's the easiest way to level up, as you gain a considerable amount of experience for each quest you complete, but  it does indeed become a chore. The characters are forgettable, the quests the same. Kill this, gather 'x' amount of this, talk to her/him. In my 145 hours of playtime, only a few quests have got me genuinely interested. You skip dialogue as it does not mean anything or add to the plot. It does, however, reveal some beautiful locations and there are a FEW interesting quests. For the most part, however, PvE in ESO:TU is pretty 'meh'.

4.5/10

[b] PvP [/b]

If you're not sure about buying ESO for the PvE aspect, definitely consider buying it for the PvP aspect. It is likely the most fun I've ever had in an MMORPG. Nothing quite compares to standing aside a host of 50+ players as trebuchets pound castle walls, the walls crumble, and hundreds of players clash on the field of battle. If you're an Elder Scrolls fan and have always fantasized about some sort of war in Tamriel - buy this game. You're allowed to enter Tamriel at Lvl 10 (3-4 hours of playtime?). Once you enter, your stats are boosted to Veteran Rank 1(?). This means a Level 10 can still be (relatively) effective fighting higher levels, so it's pretty balanced. The PvP itself takes place in the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which has been invaded by three seperate factions-

The Aldmeri Dominion (High Elf, Wood Elf, Khajit)
The Daggerfall Covenant (Breton, Orc, Redguard)
The Ebonheart Pact (Argonian, Nord, Dunmer)
(With Imperial package you can play as an Imperial in any alliance)

There are 15/16 castles around the province, 6 of which surround the Imperial City. There are also various outposts. Around the castles are resources, which, if captured, give benefits to the faction who owns them.
The PvP is what makes this game, and what convinced me to stay for 100+ hours.

9.5/10

[b] UI/Levelling [/b]

The UI is well-designed, not too obtrusive. Levelling up is also pretty simple - each time you level up, you get to choose which stat to invest in - stamina, health or magicka.You can then choose a skill which you can plonk in your hotbar and use. Nothing broken or overpowered, though it does take testing to find the most effective skill sets.

8.5/10

[b] Crafting [/b]

I'm not going to lie, I've not experimented in crafting at all, so this section is from friends' experiences.
It's good. Dying your items can make your armor very unique, the materials are varied and it does take up time. It's not simple. Which is good.

8/10

[b] Framerate [/b]

I play this game on a GTX 770 and i7 4770. In the midst of a battle, with dozens of spells and effects going on as well as 100+ players on screen performing their own actions, it did not drop below 50fps. Well optimized, large scale PvP is the only time I've ever dropped below 60fps.

9/10 

[b] Grouping [/b]

The group questing/dungeons in this game are good, again, but not particularly revolutionary or exciting. Standard group quests and dungeon, pretty simple. Not a huge variety right now, I think there are about 7/8 without the Orsinium/Imperial City DLC. I've had loads of fun playing dungeons with friends, but it does become a bit stagnant once you've repeated them several times.

7/10

[b] Conclusion [/b]

This game is good. The PvP is excellent, and while the PvE isn't particularly impressive, it still functions. Bugs have almost all been ironed out. Worth your money if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, and are willing to accept certain sacrifices made by Zenimax to make the game a better MMO.

2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST FIFA EVER!
I have bought and owned all fifa releases since 2002 on the day it was released. I have paid a premium to EA every year for the fifa franchise for 21 years straight.
The game is absolutely disgusting and ridiculous. Yes they have made a few improvements like they do every year, but along with those improvements which are minimal like always, the things that are wrong with the game made me feel like i just wasted my money and time. I know there is a crazy amount of fifa fans out there, Please do not waste your money. I understand all the latest squads and transfers and other stuff we look forward to which is always discontinued in the last fifa when the actual transfer window begins. Wait for EA to release an update addressing the issues that are there in the game, if they address the issues at all.

Issues that have nothing to do with the gameplay-
*The display refresh rate settings are locked to 60fps. (On Laptop) (Desktop is Adjustable)
*The game stutters and lags and is absolutely impossible at times. This happens even on menu screens in career mode or any other, when you are not even playing a match.
*Drastic and random FPS Drops every 5-10 seconds.
I have a RTX 3060 laptop with 64GB RAM and a RTX 4090 high-end desktop. Same lag and stuttering on both machines. So definitely the problem is with the Game software itself.
This is what i get after paying a premium to one of the biggest franchises in the gaming industry. The game overall feels like it was incomplete in its development but the launch date had to be met. What a shame.  

Gameplay Issues:

* The goalkeeper in the game is irrelevant. 
* Shooting and finishing is the worst ever.
* Even though the ball control is better and there is an element of ""centre of gravity"" in the movement of the player in control which is nice, i still feel there is so much wrong in the overall movement of the player in control. 
* Passing is the worst ever. 
* First touch is inconsistent.
There is so much more wrong with the gameplay. And i am hoping that these issues will be addressed with an update. I would be shocked if this is how the game is meant to be. 

To All the fifa fans out there. Wait for an update and fixes by EA. The game is not enjoyable and at times unplayable due to stutters and lags. Absolutely not worth a single penny of yours the way it is.",far worst fifa ever bought owned fifa release 2002 released paid premium ea year fifa franchise 21 year straight game disgusting ridiculous yes improvement year along improvement minimal thing wrong game feel wasted money time crazy fifa fan please waste money understand latest squad transfer stuff look forward discontinued last fifa actual transfer window begin wait ea release addressing issue game address issue issue display refresh rate setting locked 60fps laptop desktop adjustable game stutter lag impossible time happens menu screen career mode playing match drastic random fps drop 5 10 second rtx 3060 laptop 64gb ram rtx 4090 high desktop lag stuttering machine definitely problem game software get paying premium one biggest franchise gaming industry game overall feel incomplete development launch met shame issue goalkeeper game irrelevant shooting finishing worst ever ball control element centre gravity movement player control nice feel wrong overall movement player control passing worst ever touch inconsistent wrong hoping issue addressed shocked game meant fifa fan wait fix ea game enjoyable time unplayable due stutter lag worth single penny

1721470,Poppy Playtime,"The game isn't bad, as it stands now, there is only one chapter and it alone is really well made, enough to scare the shit out of most. Really nice stuff. However, I have a big problem with this game, more specifically the dev team behind it because as of now, they've released a set of video NFTs that cost WAY MORE than the game itself to create some kind of treasure hunt, remember those we had back when Scott Cawthon was making new FNAF games? Basically that but the execution is fucking awful. You need to buy a bunch of videos to piece together the evidence but you only get the final one if you pay for all of the other ones. 
NFTs do not belong in gaming, specially not like this. 
So basically, the game is pretty good but I don't trust the devs. Ended up refunding since I don't support NFTs in the slightest.

Edit: There has also been a confirmation that they basically stole creative property from the guy that made Venge. It's on Steam, and it's apparently a game way better than Poppy. There are some videos on YT talking more about that.

Edit 2: LMAO they made the game free",game bad stand one chapter alone enough scare shit nice stuff big problem game specifically dev team released set video nfts cost game create kind treasure hunt remember scott cawthon fnaf game basically execution fucking awful need bunch video piece evidence get final one pay one nfts belong gaming specially basically game pretty good trust devs ended refunding support nfts slightest confirmation basically stole creative property guy venge apparently game poppy video yt talking 2 lmao game

Fallout 4 was nearly 2600 hours and Fallout 3 was 818 hours [over the course of a year]. I find these games a challenge at 60 years of age, but immensly rewarding. I recommend this game to anyone of any age...don't let that be a barrier. I started with original Atari and N64 computers and the industry has come such a long way over the last 40 years.Give it at least 100 hours of gameplay to really get the true experience. Sure, its had a few bugs, but overall, has been good value for money. I live in New Zealand.

668580,Atomic Heart,"Atomic Heart is perhaps the most unique game I've played in a really long time. I can say with certainty that even though I might have played games where some of the features Atomic heart includes are present, nowhere were they implemented in a way that Atomic Heart has done so. That's not to say that the game is perfect, far from it in fact, but in this case I think saying ""imperfection has a beauty of its own"" is the right way to describe how I felt after finishing it.

At first I'd like to say that the story is a complete fustercluck. There is no other way of putting it. The characters all sound a bit off (especially the player character) and the dialogue simply isn't the best. Even though I don't think many would aproach Atomic Heart and expect it to be a storytelling masterpiece, it's still an important fact to be made aware of. 

Even though the game has been advertised as an open world game, I don't really think of it as such. And that's not necessarily a bad thing per se. The way I would describe this world is that it's a one giant linear level with optional detours with certain stages where after a certain point the player gets locked out of the place where he can't go back to anymore. At the start I was very confused by this progression but with a little bit of hindsight I appreciate it for what it is. It's just that the advertised description didn't really do this game justice. It's not necessary to make every game into an open world and I think the way Atomic Heart's world has been handled is both unique and effective.

Now to the combat. I cannot describe in words how good, polished, satisfying and rewarding it feels. Even though a lot of the enemies are what could be considered a bullet sponge at first, it all comes together near the end of the game when you have your entire arsenal and are let loose to cause as much havoc and carnage as possible. The way the robots react, the way your special abilities and weapons work together to slowly tear those robots apart, especially when upgraded, it's simply majestic (that also applies to the bossfigths which are also really great even if a little on the simple side in some cases). And all of that is accompanied by an amazing soundtrack. All the people who worked on it have done an amazing job creating something unique, fitting to the aesthetic of Atomic Heart and also sometimes nostalgic for those that remember some of the original classics that were remixed (I'm not one of those people, but I can only imagine what it must feel like to hear a song you've been listening to as a kid on a radio in this game completely remixed while ripping your enemies to pieces).

Let's talk about the visuals. Atomic heart looks pretty good grapics-wise, but the art style completely surpases the level of detail in my opinion. Sure, it might feel a bit schizophrenic the way it shifts constantly to a new theme and visual style all the time, but I found it actually quite fitting for the setting - the utopian Soviet Union. It's simply something that hasn't been done before and we don't really have anything to compare it to other than the real world history of the USSR, where, funnily enough, megalomania, utopian visions and plans for the future were quite common among the elite, not unlike those found in Atomic Heart (albeit with a more realistic visual style). I simply found it incredibly interesting to be interpreted in this way and thorouhgly enjoyed the art style/styles. Oh and let me just mention that the game runs like a dream so you can enjoy all of what is throws at you without worrying about awful fps drops, stutters or crashes (unlike many Unreal engine releases lately).

The final verdict is incredibly straight forward. If you'd like to play a game with great combat, great graphics and awesome soundtrack and you don't care as much about the story, Atomic Heart is a no-brainer. The best way to apporach it is to not compare it to what's already out there. It's not a ""Russian Bioshock"", or ""Russian Fallout"" like many would describe it, it's not even an open world game or an RPG in my humble opinion, it's its own thing and I love it for that. Maybe you will as well.",atomic heart perhaps unique game long time certainty game feature atomic heart includes present nowhere implemented atomic heart game perfect far case saying imperfection beauty right describe felt finishing story complete fustercluck putting character sound bit especially player dialogue simply best aproach atomic heart expect storytelling masterpiece important aware game advertised open world game necessarily bad thing per se describe world one giant linear optional detour certain stage certain player get locked place anymore confused progression little bit hindsight appreciate advertised description game justice necessary make game open world atomic heart world handled unique effective combat describe word good polished satisfying rewarding feel enemy considered bullet sponge come near game entire arsenal loose cause havoc carnage possible robot react special ability weapon work slowly tear robot apart especially upgraded simply majestic applies bossfigths great little simple side case accompanied amazing soundtrack worked amazing job creating unique fitting aesthetic atomic heart sometimes nostalgic remember original classic remixed one imagine feel hear song listening kid radio game completely remixed ripping enemy piece talk visuals atomic heart look pretty good grapics wise art style completely surpases detail opinion sure feel bit schizophrenic shift constantly theme visual style time found fitting setting utopian soviet union simply compare real world history ussr funnily enough megalomania utopian vision plan future common elite unlike found atomic heart albeit realistic visual style simply found incredibly interesting interpreted thorouhgly enjoyed art style style oh mention game run dream enjoy throw worrying awful fps drop stutter crash unlike unreal engine release lately final verdict incredibly straight forward game great combat great graphic awesome soundtrack care story atomic heart brainer best apporach compare already russian bioshock russian fallout describe open world game humble opinion thing love maybe

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"[h1]A dream for every Potterhead and those who want to become one![/h1]
[b][u]Spoiler free Review![/u][/b]


Sometimes games are getting released with way too much hype. Forspoken, as an example, would be such a game. Either is it because of bad optimization or misinformation by the studio, the disappointment can end up being immeasurable for people who already pre-ordered these games, or people who have those games on their wishlist for months. Sadly, we had a lot of those lately. Don't even get me started with license games in general....

Hogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, shows that sometimes the hype train can be true.

I don't usually pre-order games anymore, but the premise of being the best game based on the fantastic world of ""Harry Potter"" made me buy it in an instant.

The following review won't contain any spoilers! I also want to mention that I am not even close to the end of the game, because I have way too much fun exploring.

[i]Also I know about the controversy, but it won't be part of my review (Not even as a meme!).[/i]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2929913613


[h1]Story:[/h1]
So far so good. It starts off with a generic ""You are the chosen one!"" scenario, but it is going to get better and better the further you go. You just have to trust me on this one, because I don't want to give away too many information. All I can say is that the story fits the HP universe very well. If this game would be a book I wouldn't be able to stop reading it until the very end.


[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Overwhelming, would be the right word. There are so many mechanics in this game it is amazing and exhausting at the same time.

First off you have the exploration part, where you can move around freely and explore every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings. I tell you there is a lot to discover and to collect. Mysteries that need to be solved, locks that need to be picked and information about special places that need to be gathered. The amount of collectibles are insane and you will most likely spent hours over hours getting everything to 100%. The puzzles you can find are very well-made and solving them is fun.

Then you have your main quests and side quests. I really love the side quests in this one, because they involve your fellow students. You learn to know them a bit better every time and the most of the quests are very creative.

Also: You don't get exp by fighting enemies! You get exp by discovering new locations, doing mini games or other things like that.

If you want to get from one point of the map to the other, you can also use the ""Floo powder"" fast travel service, or use your good old broom! I prefer the last one. It just feels great to fly around and enjoy the world. It might even sometimes happens that I just fly around aimlessly just for fun.  

Decorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! 


[h1]The Combat:[/h1]

What would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. 

Fighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. 

For your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can't really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.
The further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.

As a sidenote: You also don't need to fight most of the time, if you don't want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.


[h1]The RPG Part:[/h1]

There is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don't really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn't fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.
I just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work! 


[h1]The Atmosphere:[/h1]

Just wow!  
Hogwarts alone is gigantic and it feels amazing to get lost in all those beautifully handcrafted and unique halls, rooms and dungeons. The living paintings, the ghosts and the students running around in the halls is so atmospheric. The neighboring villages and landmarks do the same trick. You maybe want to walk all the way to Hogsmeade and drink Butter beer, just to lose yourself in that weird looking, but fascinating architecture of the buildings. Don't even get me started with the Forbidden Forest and other locations, you would be able to recognize from the movies and books.


[h1]The Graphics:[/h1]

I play this game on a mix of medium to low, on my I7 4790 and my 1060 6 GB and the game still looks amazing. As a passionate screenarcher (screenshoter) I won't be able to make any good screenshots in the game, but just for playing it is more than enough. The fps are stable and I never noticed any pop-ins or any texture loading. The Unreal Engine 4 does a wonderful job and just shows how good it can still be (Compared to UE5)!


[h1]The Soundtrack:[/h1]

Simply magical!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAesuW6qZU8
I also love that they mix new composed songs with the soundtrack from the movies. It just feels right!


[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

[u]You know you want it! For me it is already GOTY. Not a single game in the last months kept me so occupied. Now if you excuse me I have to collect more things for my potions and maybe get lost on my way in a random ruin hunting for treasure.[/u]",dream potterhead one b u spoiler review u b sometimes game getting released hype forspoken example game bad optimization misinformation studio disappointment immeasurable already pre ordered game game wishlist month sadly lately get started license game general hogwarts legacy hand show sometimes hype train true usually pre order game anymore premise best game based fantastic world harry potter instant following review contain spoiler mention close game fun exploring controversy review meme http steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails id 2929913613 story far good start generic chosen one scenario get trust one information story fit hp universe game book able stop reading overwhelming right word mechanic game amazing exhausting time exploration move freely explore inch hogwarts surroundings tell discover collect mystery need solved lock need picked information special place need gathered collectible insane spent hour hour getting everything 100 puzzle solving fun main quest side quest love side quest one involve fellow student learn bit time quest creative get exp fighting enemy get exp discovering location mini game thing get one map floo powder fast travel service good old broom prefer last one feel great fly enjoy world sometimes happens fly aimlessly fun decorating crafting fantastic beast game spoilery mention combat wizard witch magical wand time puzzle lighten scanning surroundings stronger enemy face good learn attack defense spell soon handful key combine enemy 3 basic spell pull towards 3 time set flame push one different combo cause different effect combining make stronger learn combo experiment fighting enemy get old shield need right spell break others dealt get attacked fire defense shield spell dodge roll danger zone clear deflect power attack troll soul come parry button upgrade spell extra effect power sidenote need fight time option sneak past enemy silently stun game hoped negative feel control story outcome dialogue mean friendly difference wished get gold asking reward blackmailing fit overall appearance cut scene mean create choose house join skill tree thats throw voice actor amazing work atmosphere wow hogwarts alone gigantic feel amazing get lost beautifully handcrafted unique hall room dungeon living painting ghost student running hall atmospheric neighboring village landmark trick maybe walk hogsmeade drink butter beer lose weird looking fascinating architecture building get started forbidden forest location able recognize movie book graphic game mix medium low i7 4790 1060 6 gb game look amazing passionate screenarcher screenshoter able make good screenshots game playing enough fps stable noticed pop in texture loading unreal engine 4 wonderful job show good compared ue5 soundtrack simply magical http www youtube com watch v naesuw6qzu8 love mix composed song soundtrack movie feel right conclusion u already goty single game last month occupied excuse collect thing potion maybe get lost random ruin hunting treasure u

686810,Hell Let Loose,"My very first game on HLL: I join a server, select the Allies, enter an open squad (yes, they can be locked) and select a machinegunner. As soon as the match begins the squad's officer asks via voip if there are any new players. I answer ""me"", ask him and my other squaddies to forgive me if I make mistakes, and the squad leader just laughs it off and tells me ""no worries, just follow my directions, keep your eyes sharp and your ears sharper and you'll do fine"". And then, we start moving towards a quaint French town called Carentan. 

""See that church at the center of the map?"", the squad leader tells us. ""Our orders are to occupy it and defend the area no matter the costs. Watch out for windows and rubble because there'll be Krauts everywhere."" And there WERE lots of Krauts in the area. I run forward in the open like a headless chicken, and a German rifleman shoots me in the torso. I crumple to the ground, as the noises all around me grow duller and duller and my vision starts to blur as life abandons me. 

""Don't let go and hang in there mate!"", the squad's medic shouts. So I wait, while the medic tosses a smoke grenade to conceal his movements, reaches my dying frame and brings me back to the realm of the living with a quick morphine shot. ""Now dive for cover! Go behind those barrels over there!"", he tells me, which I eagerly do, still bleeding out. Once behind cover, the medic pulls out the bandages and starts to apply a field dressing, while the squad leader checks the surroundings with his binoculars.

""Enemy infantry in those windows! Shoot, damn it!"", and before I ask him exactly which window, he points me a specific one in the distance. I squint my eyes as hard as I can, and notice that there are indeed a couple of indistinct shapes looking at us. I then deploy my mighty M1919 heavy machinegun, ignoring the gunshots that plink all around me, and start laying down a withering hail of suppressive fire against that and nearby windows. I doubted I ever got a single kraut, but that wasn't what mattered - what mattered was that the jerries had no way of peeking out of those windows without getting mulched. With me supporting their advance, the remainder of my squad moves towards the building under the cover of smoke grenades, while our riflemen toss as many grenades inside the windows as they can. I hear gunshots coming from the buildings, a couple of players curse as they get downed while the squad leader shouts ""I've got 'em, I've got 'em! Come here gunner, we need your mg!"" 

I make a mad dash towards the building right as a hail of enemy machinegun fire is poured into the smoke, not aiming at anybody in particular but still managing to hit me - again - and cause me to bleed. Nevertheless, I manage to get inside the building and get the medic to patch me up again. ""This is becoming a habit, mate. I should start to charge you for every dressing"", he jokes. We both laugh, at least until a kraut tosses a grenade inside a nearby window, something the medic does not notice. ""Grenade right behind you! Run!"", I yell at him. We both run as far away from that room as possible right as the grenade goes off, I emerge unscathed from the blast but the medic is hit and starts bleeding. ""Cover me while I patch myself up"", he asks me, but right at that moment one of our squaddies who was garrisoning the building's ground floor yells ""OH s**t, they're insi-"" before an SMG burst causes him to scream. Realizing that there's only one way up the building and that I am right in front of the stairs, I lay on the ground and deploy my machinegun yet again. A kraut climbs the stairs and runs right in front of my machinegun, getting riddled with bullets and falling on the spot. Two more krauts enter after him, both of which get similarly cut down while I yell ""they're coming! Right up the stairs!"". A friendly rifleman arrives, tosses a couple of grenades down the stairs, and I see torn human limbs flying everywhere. ""Germs're sanitized"", he shouts back. The squad leader laughs it off, congratulates us both, and then orders us to keep marching towards the church at the center of Carentan. It's only 100 meters away from our position, but due to a german Tiger parked right in front of it and at least two German platoons, it might as well be miles and miles away.

The Tiger is relentless in its attempts to kill every single yank its spotter sees. At least until a Sherman outflanks and destroys it with its powerful 76 mm gun. Suddenly the tide of the battle has been turned, and the germans are the ones desperately scrambling away from that hulk of steel on tracks, falling back inside the church. Around the church, artillery fire starts falling on the battlefield like rain, tearing to pieces any soldier unfortunate enough to get hit. Undaunted, our assault specialist throws a couple of smoke grenades before getting cut down by submachinegun fire. His heroic sacrifice allows us to enter inside the church in relative safety and engage the last kraut holdouts in a desperate close quarters battle they are hopelessly outmatched for due to their bolt-action rifles and the elevated number of automatic and semi-automatic firearms we possess. 

At long last, the church of Carentan has fallen into Allied hands, but we do not even have the time to pat on each other's shoulders that a massive artillerly barrage rains all around the church. Allied soldiers who aren't quick or lucky enough to get inside are pulverized by the concentrated explosive fire, the sherman that was covering us gets blown to smithereens, and all that's left to defend the capture point is our 5-men squad and a rifleman from another platoon who somehow made it to the church by the skin of his teeth. 

""They're couterattacking. Run for the bell tower!"", our squad leader orders us. We dash for the church's bell tower like madmen, while the rifleman straggler tosses a couple of grenades to cover our retreat. Finally at the top of the bell tower, I realize that it is spacious enough to give us ample room for manoeuvers, gives us a very nice overlook of the entire town, and has only one way in or out. ""Defend the bell tower at all costs, G*ddammit!"", I hear the squad leader scream. Thus, I pick a spot with a clean line of sight to the stairs and deploy my trusty machinegun again. 

Kraut soldiers start coming our way, in unorganized waves that get mercilessly scythed down at first, and in coordinated attacks with grenades, smoke grenades and submachinegunners later. Me and the straggler get shot again, but the medic in our team quickly bandages up again. It is only in that moment that I realise my machinegun is completely out of ammo. ""Out of ammo!"", I yell to my squaddies, which prompts the straggler to drop an ammo box right next to me. Thanking him, I proceed to restock while the Germans keep on assaulting our position. The situation grows more and more desperate until, at long last, it happens.

Allied reinforcements arrive, three whole platoons of soldiers supporter by a Sherman Jumbo. Realising that they have been beaten, the krauts cease their attempts to storm the bell tower and focus on the attackers. It is at that moment that our squad leader orders us on the offensive. With the desperation that only a cornered animal can muster, we toss the very last two grenades we have down the stairway and catch the german defenders in a devastating pincer attack. The church of Carentan is now ours once again, for real this time. The squad leader congratulates us all, me in particular. ""You did very well for a first timer, mate"" - he tells me - ""now try to keep it up with the two remaining capture points. Let's go!""

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I was very skeptic to play Final Fantasy XIV at first. Coming from Phantasy Star Online 2 back in 2015, FFXIV looked slow, stiff, and overall not challenging to play. The subscription model made it even harder to justify playing it, as I had always seen monthly subscriptions as a way to milk players' money as much as possible. When I was gifted the game by a friend (there was no free trial back then), I decided to give it a try just to confirm my thoughts. I could not have been more wrong.

Disclaimer: as of writing this, I have around 500 hours of playtime on the standalone version. I've played through two of the first expansions and I'm halfway through Shadowbringers.

As someone who usually ignores stories in video games as they tend to not conform to my standards, I was blown away by how captivating this game's narrative is. It's incredibly refreshing to come across an MMO that not only has a good story, but *knows* it has a good story. FFXIV has no problem throwing you 10 quests in a row where you don't fight a single enemy, because it knows the story alone is enough to keep you interested, and it is absolutely right. Every sentence was crafted to enhance your immersion in the world through character development that goes way beyond what I've come to expect from JRPGs, and story beats that hit you like a truck when you least expect them. If you care in any way about story-driven video games, you cannot miss this game.

The combat, at first, is slow. You'll be pressing the same three buttons over and over for a good couple of hours when you first start this game. While I considered it a problem as an MMO veteran when first starting out, it makes sense as an introduction to non-MMO players, or even people not used to games in general. That said, the game quickly develops on your class' toolkit giving you action after action until you have two hotbars of skills that are all universally useful in the right situations. Some of the more fast-paced classes (Ninja, Astrologian) feel like playing Dance Dance Revolution as a kid, all while dodging whatever the gigantic f*****g monster you're fighting throws at you. I've not yet done end-game raid content, but from what I've seen of my guild mates they expand on this even further.

If you don't play this game, it's completely understandable to be flustered by the payment model. Paying for a game, expansions and a monthly subscription on top of that rings a siren in the ears of any sane consumer, but this is different. Final Fantasy XIV does NOT pull any tricks to keep you subscribed. You get a good game with a huge amount of content and that's *it*. If you play for the story, you can subscribe while there's story content and simply stop paying until the next patch. If you play for raids and end-game content, you can pause your sub once you're tired or feel like playing other games.

Three years ago, a japanese player asked YoshiP (the game's director, Naoki Yoshida) how to stay motivated to keep playing in between patches, when content naturally dries out for a little while. His response was the following:

""It's alright not to play it everyday. Since it's just a game, you can stop forcing yourself if it's hard on you to keep that up. Rather, it'll just pile up unnecessary stress if you limit yourself into playing just that one game since there are so many other games out there. So, do come back and play it to your heart's content when the major patch kicks in, then stop it to play other games before you got burnt out, and then come back for another major patch. This will actually make me happier, and in the end, I think this is the best solution I can answer for keeping your motivation up for the game."" (source: /u/elevenmile on /r/ffxiv)

Reading this response is what made me realize what kind of experience I was paying for. In PSO2, to play end game content you *have* to log in at certain times of the day where such content is available, otherwise you miss out completely. After playing for years I grew resentful of the game because it felt more like a job than an enjoyment for me, yet I couldn't quit because I'd be behind if I did. In Final Fantasy XIV, you're experiencing the world on your own terms. No pressure, no time gated content, no manipulative tricks to keep you subscribed. If you don't feel like playing, just don't. The developers very clearly respect the player's time and it shows in game.

I can't force you to play this game, but I hope my thoughts helped you decide for yourself. Even if you ultimately decide to not play it, I recommend you watch Noclip's FINAL FANTASY XIV Documentary on YouTube. The development cycle of FFXIV and how it went from a financial disaster to SquareEnix's biggest hit is a great story.

976730,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,"[h1][i]The best of an iconic franchise.[/i][/h1]

[h2][i]-[u]Overview[/u]-[/i][/h2]
[i]Halo: The Master Chief Collection (MCC)[/i] contains some excellent games, some great games, and an okay game.  All of these are high quality AAA experiences whose combined value far exceeds the price tag of the [i]MCC[/i] by virtue of their quality storytelling, considerable replay value and enjoyable gameplay.  Unfortunately, the [i]MCC[/i] has suffered various networking issues since launch, which still come and go.

All titles featured in the [i]MCC[/i] have been updated to use the same menus, settings, controls, and other features, in order to create a smooth, consistent experience.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2285444109
[h2][i]-[u]Gameplay[/u]-[/i][/h2]
Across the six entries contained in the [i]MCC[/i], various gameplay details and mechanics are added, changed and removed.  Consistent across all entries, however, is the distinctive [i]Halo[/i] gameplay feel, which can be described as somewhat old-fashioned, with many weapons fired only from the hip, no sprint function (in most titles), floaty gravity and no parkour/traversal system.  It is, however, smooth, precise and enjoyable.  Nothing else plays quite like [i]Halo[/i].

While mouse & keyboard works well enough with these games, they were designed with gamepad in mind, and, as such, it's what I recommend using.

[h2][i]-[u]Visuals & Audio[/u]-[/i][/h2]
Featuring six games released between 2001-2012, the visual experience understandably varies, though the first and second games have been remastered (in 2011 and 2014, respectively) to bring them in line with later titles.  All of the featured titles had impressive visuals at their time of release, and all can still deliver a beautiful view or breathtaking display of scale.  Similar can be said of the audio design, barring, arguably, that of [i]Halo 4[/i].

Soundtracks, meanwhile, do not suffer the effects of age as graphics do, and remain as excellent as they did on the day of their release. [i]Halo's[/i] beautiful music is as iconic as the franchise itself.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2294594715
[h2][i]-[u]Technical Issues:[/u]-[/i][/h2]
Numerous players have reported issues with connectivity since the [i]MCC's[/i] release, whether it be lag in co-op play, difficulty in matchmaking or failure to load into levels in co-op.  While patches have released over time, these gremlins still make themselves known to some, at times.  Having played through all of the games in the collection in co-op, I can testify to the latter of the aforementioned issues, though, thankfully, it has been rare.

[h2][i]-[u]The Games – A Brief Summary[/u]-[/i][/h2]

[h3]Halo: CE:[/h3]
The one that started it all; [i]CE[/i] is now a 19 year-old game, and even with the remaster in 2011, it feels it.  While still very playable and featuring a decent story and great atmosphere, this one feels a little rough. 

[h3]Halo 2:[/h3]
[b]Full Review:[/b]
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096374054/recommended/1064270/

Though its gameplay represents a significant step-up from that of its predecessor, [i]Halo 2[/i] is starting to feel a little dated as well, when compared to later titles.  It does, however, feature some of the best graphics in the [i]MCC[/i] due to its excellent 2014 remaster, and it remains my favourite of the franchise due to its level design, music and story.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2328699845
[h3]Halo 3:[/h3]
[b]Full Review:[/b]
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096374054/recommended/1064271/

This is the big one; it concludes the story of [i]Halo CE & Halo 2[/i], while featuring excellent gameplay, level design and story elements, as well as a beloved competitive multiplayer component.  As it's still running its 2007 graphics, it isn't the best looking game in the [i]MCC[/i], but it holds up fairly well.

[h3]Halo 3: ODST:[/h3]
[b]Full Review:[/b]
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096374054/recommended/1064272/

The first spinoff title, [i]ODST[/i] pairs [i]Halo 3's[/i] excellent gameplay with new characters and a darker, more grounded atmosphere that sets it apart from previous titles.  This game is shorter and smaller in scale than the main [i]Halo[/i] entries, but should not be overlooked; it has everything it needs to be a great game.  In addition, it adds a new PvE game mode called [i]Firefight[/i] in place of competitive multiplayer.

[h3]Halo: Reach:[/h3]
[b]Full Review:[/b]
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096374054/recommended/1064220/

Set shortly before [i]Halo CE[/i], [i]Reach[/i] follows in [i]ODST's[/i] footsteps with a new lineup of characters and a more somber atmosphere.  While [i]Reach's[/i] characters and story weren't as well-received as those of earlier titles, its gameplay experience is one of the best in the franchise, as it maintains the distinctive [i]Halo[/i] feel while refining and adding meaningful features to the experience.  The same treatment is given to the [i]Firefight[/i] mode first featured in [i]ODST[/i], adding a highly enjoyable game mode that offers plenty of replay value.

[h3]Halo 4:[/h3]
[b]Full Review:[/b]
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096374054/recommended/1064273/

In my view, this is by far the weakest entry in the [i]MCC[/i], and a poor [i]Halo[/i] title in general.  While it passes as a generic sci-fi shooter, much of what made the series special was lost in the making of [i]Halo 4[/i].  Nice graphics reveal a rather bland visual design, gameplay balance suffers, and story explores regions that should, arguably, have been left to imagination.

[h2][i]-[u]Summary[/u]-[/i][/h2]
While some of the games featured in the [i]MCC[/i] are showing their age, and all feel rather primitive to play compared to the latest, fast-paced FPS titles, there's nothing else quite like this franchise.  It's one I've loved since I first played [i]Halo 2[/i] on the original Xbox back in 2004, and playing the whole series again in 2020 has only reaffirmed my love for the franchise. I will continue to play these games for the foreseeable future, such is their quality and replay value.

[h1] Old 'happy' Early Access Review: [/h1]

They wrote ""SWAT 5"" wrong.

Seriously, though; the game is sick!
It is made to be highly replayable and punishing.

It has all the great things late SWAT titles had plus ergonomics simulation.

Pros:
Punishing.
Made to be as realistic as possible.
Weapon sounds are the BEST around, I'd risk saying.
More features coming on top of what we encountered over previous games.
Hostile AI is a challenge. (harder the better, without escaping from realistic)
Maps are well made.
Outstanding lighting techniques on graphics.
AMD FSR to keep your GPU happy and cold.


Downsides:
Graphical glitches.
AI glitches.
Limited content as in early access.
Weapon customization design makes it impossible to have flashlight and laser at the same time. (Escape from Tarkov still is king on weapon attachments).


Notes: RON doesn't compare to Ground Branch. If you have one, the other one will add a lot as they overlap each other very little.

PLEASE, DEVELOPER: Don't make this game focused on PVP. Single player and Co-Op is where the longevity is. Keep it as replayable and creative challenging as possible.

Honestly, its great to have such a fresh, unique game to play, playing the beta was the most fun I've had in a shooter game in probably 10 years.

Atomic heart is action FPS semi open-world game where you play as russian dude slapping robots.

Pros (+):
+ Performance is buttery smooth. almost all maxed and still run on 144 FPS.
+ Graphic is very great, not to mention great aesthetic too.
+ RPG system where you can upgrade and customize your weapon.
+ Melee has the ""weight"" feeling on it. Making satisfying slash.
+ Interesting story and world building.
+ Grandma with Rocket Launcher.

Grey (?):
? Alot of ""camera"" everywhere. alerting nearby enemy to you when spotted.
? Ammo management on guns.
? No running. Probably later on in game.. maybe??
? No photo mode.
? English dub is cheesy. Dude likes to jokes alot.

Cons (-):
- Fight is frustrating with alot of enemy surrounding you.
- Very slow climbing speed.
- No saving everywhere. Only auto save and save spot.
- No FoV slider. edit: FoV added

The game is totally worth full price knowing the game is not made by AAA studio but has quality of it.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:
- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.
- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world
- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign
- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.
- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.

There are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:
- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.
- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.
- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.
- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as ""respawn only"" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.
- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...
- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.
- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.

As with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.",medium performance issue 2 28 22 goty game game amazing dripping content fromsoft make dark soul 4 game dark soul 4 5 6 one massive game open world feel attempt pad game game picking item open world pickup animation dragon age inquisition talking pick item horseback animation greatly speed looting open world summoning pool make getting summoned boss easier ever general overworld location pool location get summon sign sooooo bonfire location fast travel almost anywhere game map packed stuff rarely walking riding long period running dungeon bos camp etc single side location discover plus get feeling discovery unlike game improvement previous installment particular order standouts powerstancing babyyyyy favorite thing ds2 slottable weapon art taking weapon art ds3 tied weapon affinity allows switch scaling weapon bonfire committing specific element stat open world make game accessible wall one zone else stronger sekiro little game extremely pronounced statue marika make runbacks boss nearly grueling statue work respawn bonfire choose respawn usually outside bos fight room lengthy rest adjust build prevent grueling runback allow smash face bos minimal downtime dedicated button power attack risky usually counter low swinging attack add next poise breaking enemy heavy attacking attacking guard countering add move type game make weapon totally different playstyle add replay value guard counter successfully blocking attack follow special heavy attack high poise damage allows critical hit make easier take skill time riposte feel good game everyone love soul game disservice missing one soul game best one accessible far crazy hard tutorial boss ashen summoning bell give great support difficult area leave harder fight make rarely situation booting game mean gon na brick walling bos dy

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"I remember hearing about Cyberpunk 2077 around when it was announced. I was interested because I could tell that it would be a tough game to run - performance wise, and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Then when it came out... It was everywhere, and everyone said it sucked. It was a broken mess of a game that wasn't even finished, so I vowed to myself that I would never buy such a hunk of garbage. 

2 years later... 
I'm bored, it's a Saturday. I'm on Netflix wondering what to watch; I had watched A Silent Voice & Breaking Bad a few days earlier, they were both great in their own ways. Then, on the main screen of Netflix I see: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. I think to myself, oh it's going to just be an advertisement by one of my favorite animation studios (Studio Trigger) that got paid to make this. I was wrong, the story swept me in like a storm and I was 200% engaged in all 10 episodes. 

1 day later...
I can't stop thinking about that show, the characters, and even more that was in it. I look on YouTube to people playing some Cyberpunk 2077. ""It looks decent and actually pretty fun now,"" I said to myself. I saw on YouTube that you could get Rebecca's shotgun, David's jacket, etc. in Cyberpunk 2077 and I thought that was dope. I want this game now.

2 days later...
I see everywhere how the player count has increased to 50,000 concurrent players on Steam; just crazy, and the game was on sale at the time, right after patch/update 1.6, so at 10:15 P.M. I bought the game and sold some Counter Strike cases to pay for tax. I let it download and got on the game after I was done with everything I had to do the next day. 

Present day... 
This game is insane, I love everything about it, the details put into the game, and the constant care that CD Projekt Red has given it after the game's launch up to today & onward. They fixed their game, and made a true piece of art. I've played a lot of story-driven games in my day, but none come close to the absolute experience that this game has given me: emotionally, mentally, etc. I love this game and trust me when I say that the game is fixed now & it is my favorite game of 2022 so far. (even though it came out in 2020, patch 1.5 - 1.6 has made it a new game with all of the features and bug fixes that they've added) Also, they got over 105,000 concurrent players just a day and a half later!

Some thoughts:
This game has too much to do other than the main story and (at the time of writing this...) I've sunk almost 40 hours into it already after only 7 days. It is an open-world experience to level the fun and quality of games like: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto: V, and much more. This game is amazing and I 100% recommend buying it. 

P.S.
Also watch the anime, even if you don't like anime that much, but you like this game... It's so great and the story in both the game and the show are breathtaking. 11/10.",remember hearing cyberpunk 2077 announced interested tell tough game performance wise keanu reef everywhere everyone said sucked broken mess game finished vowed hunk garbage 2 year bored saturday netflix wondering watch watched silent voice breaking bad day earlier great way main screen netflix cyberpunk edgerunners oh advertisement one favorite animation studio studio trigger got paid make wrong story swept storm 200 engaged 10 episode 1 stop character look youtube playing cyberpunk 2077 look decent pretty fun said saw youtube get rebecca shotgun david jacket etc cyberpunk 2077 thought dope game 2 day everywhere player count increased 50 000 concurrent player crazy game sale time right patch 1 6 10 15 p bought game sold counter strike case pay tax download got game everything next present game insane love everything detail game constant care cd projekt red given game launch today onward fixed game true piece art story driven game close absolute experience game given emotionally mentally etc love game trust game fixed favorite game 2022 far 2020 patch 1 5 1 6 game feature bug fix added got 105 000 concurrent player half thought game main story time writing sunk almost 40 hour already 7 day open world experience fun quality game legend zelda breath wild grand theft auto v game amazing 100 recommend buying p watch anime anime game great story game breathtaking 11 10

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[b]Is this game, like, multiplayer Skyrim?[/b] No. 

[b]Is this game Skyrim 2?[/b] No.

[b]Can I heal mid-battle by shoving 50 cheese wheels in my mouth and then unpausing?[/b] No. 

[b][i]So what is this game?[/i][/b]
This game is an MMORPG. It has the story elements that are familiar to Elder Scrolls fans, but the format is similar to that of any MMORPG. There is a lot of content you can play solo, but there is also content that can or must be done in groups. 

[b]Story[/b]: Depends on the zone, can range from 4/10 to 11/10. 

[b]Quest Design[/b]: Depends on the quest and on play style. Can be a 9/10 if you're interested in the lore, but if you're more interested in skipping any and all relevant dialogue and just doing tasks, it can get dull. 

[b]Content[/b]: 11/10, I am far-too-many hours in and I have about 30%-40% more content left in the game in terms of quests and areas alone, not including dungeons and trials. 

[b]Graphics[/b]: 9/10, the fantasy style means that the game ages well despite being 2014. 

[b]Difficulty[/b]: 3/10 to 9/10. (Easy to learn, difficult to master.) 

[b]Combat[/b]: 6/10. It's average, nothing too insane but not horrible either. 

[b]UI[/b]: 5/10 in its base form, but can be raised much higher with addons on PC. 

[b]Price[/b]: Low. It goes on sale often, and if you get the non-upgrade edition of the newest expansion (Greymoor at the time of this writing), you get all of the past major DLCs as well, so you don't need to play catch-up. Unlike what others may claim, [i]subscription is not required[/i]. You can get the subscription if you want to try out the DLC or if you are a hard-core player or interested in doing major crafting. However, if you are just a casual once-in-a-while player, there is no need to buy the subscription. This also means that if you are about to have a busy time irl, you can pause your subscription without being locked out of the game if you still want to plat occasionally but not enough to warrant it.

Yes, there are crown crates and a crown store and stuff that does cost real money in most cases. No, you can't collect everything in the game, even if you toss a Jeff Bezos salary at it. And that's part of the beauty of it -- no two people have the exact same stuff. Besides, all of the things that people cry are super expensive or in the crown crates? [b][i]It's all cosmetic!!![/i][/b] I really don't see why people are losing their ***es over it when they're the ones willingly paying stupid amounts of money for minor cosmetic changes.

1599340,Lost Ark,"If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you! Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead. Excited yet? You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job! Wait, there's more! If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content. That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of! Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside... This is a pay to win game. That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can. They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that. However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands. I'm serious, it's beyond insanity.

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you: it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content. You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up. It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players. All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression. Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character. Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too. The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold. What is gold good for? The Auction House. Upgrade items and gear. Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals. That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.

What the heck are Pheons? They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters. The gear you wear is what determines your item level. After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials. Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in. So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.

How do you get Pheons? You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals. How do you get blue crystals? By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons. Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.

Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server. These bots have one goal - farm gold. Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue. It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag. Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.

You see the problem yet? Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value. Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK, that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups. Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies. There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum. Maybe as many as 60? I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid. Almost all of them are unnecessary.

There are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous ""I'd rather watch paint dry"" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you'll try to participate in, and so much more.

899770,Last Epoch,"So I bought this for myself last week as an avid ARPG enthusiast with well over 2000 hours on Path of Exile and god knows how long on D2 back in the day, I blink, and 50 hours have passed. This game shows phenomenal promise, the devs are super active and pumping out content and fixes at a rapid rate and have been faithfully following the roadmap plan.

Last Epoch is far easier to get into than PoE, with a much more approachable passive and active skill system. Every weapon type can be used by every class which allows for some juicy build diversity, there's plenty of synergy between skills and passives and all upgrade points feel rewarding with a satisfying bump in power. 

Let's go over some pro's:

- Tons and tons of character customisation, got all the basic equipment, rings, belts, amulets and idols, a neat item that provide powerful buffs to stats. A 4x4 grid is provided to arrange idols in whatever way you want, with smaller idols providing smaller or more generic buffs such as flat health or a small % increase to fire damage, and larger idols providing big specific buffs such as % lightning damage but the value is doubled if you have over 300 max mana. These idols allow for a lot of extra customisation. 
- Enjoyable story campaign with good voice acting on top, granted the story isn't fully completed yet but I had fun! Time travel, cosmic horror, many biomes and environments, immortal emperors and imperious gods! What's not to like?
- Telegraphed enemy attacks!!! Words cannot describe how gratifying it is to see where the massive void bomb thrown at you is actually going to land, allowing you to dodge or time your defensive abilities accordingly. And if/when you do die, there's a death screen showing you what attack you died to and what damage type/s that attack dealt.
- An approachable deterministic crafting system is something PoE has been crying out for, and thankfully LE provides. Yes it does still require some luck, but basically how it works is thus; you find affix shards all over the place as a lootable ground item which provide a single use ""craft"" to forge onto an item or to improve an existing roll. Every possible affix can drop as a shard, or you can shatter an item with an affix you want to apply to another item and get a random amount of shards back from all the affixes on the shattered item. It's easy to play around with, and shards fly out of mobs and barrels so there's plenty to experiment with! The highest tier rolls (T7) are drop only, with item forging allowing a maximum affix tier of 5 so you can't fully power a basic roll therefore keeping loot valuable late-game. Fracturing an item prevents it from being modified anymore, and can even lower your affix tiers so it's basically a game of chicken if you want to upgrade your item more and more.
- The Monolith of Fate is a solid endgame grind, allowing you to unlock permanent character upgrades upon completing the mini quest lines contained with each Monolith stage. Endless Arena keys can drop from the Monolith loot chest allowing you to challenge the appropriately named Endless Arena against waves of mobs providing a good chunk of xp.
- Advanced affix descriptions provide a description of an affix, for example ""chance to inflict shock"" is a possible item affix, and if you hold ""alt"" while hovering over the item it will tell you exactly what shock does. All the defensive mechanics show the maths behind them. Basically the game is exceptionally well explained! 
- Level setting, backgrounds and atmosphere are top-notch and the End of Time ""town"" has a freaking black hole in the background which is cool as fuck.

Consequentially there are some cons:

- Gold isn't particularly useful yet, and items aren't worth picking up to sell as you get plenty from it dropping from mobs and breakables. However I imagine when the bazaar is introduced and allows player trading it will become much more useful!
- You can't modify uniques or set items which can be annoying if you get one with low rolls or implicits.
- While the game does run well generally, some skills and enemy attacks do slow the framerate down particularly the big screen size ones that can be used repeatedly. 
- No random terrain generation, as in if you run ""shining cove"" multiple times, the zone layout is the same every time. Personally I don't mind this but it could get a bit same-y doing the same layout over again.

1693980,Dead Space,"EDIT 2: Alright. It seems the game no longer crashes with the DirectX error. Some people are still complaining about other issues however. And I'm afraid they likely won't be fixed, because the devs have dropped support for the game. 
An unfortunate reality. Regardless of this, I'm still changing my review to a positive one seeing as it's truly a great remake (outside of technical difficulties).

EDIT: The Latest NVIDIA driver (version 536.99) seems to have potentially fixed the issue.
I was able to play a longer session recently without crashing. Although I feel we need more accounts to confirm. Please keep an eye on the forums of both NVIDIA and Steam to see if people share these sentiments. 
Otherwise the game is obviously a great remake and I hope it works for everyone who decides to buy it.

It's a shame the developers are unable to patch the game, seeing as some NVIDIA employees have stated on the forums that it is an application bug they've reached out to them about several weeks ago.

(What follows is my old review):

There has been a crash in this game affecting NIVIDIA players for months now and the devs refuse to patch the game for some reason.
It's super annoying to fix manually so do yourself a favor and spend your money on something else until they decide to patch the game.

Keep in mind this is only if you're using one of the latest graphics drivers. After a certain amount of playtime you will start crashing and you won't stop crashing ever until the issue is fixed. The DirectX profile for the game is simply outdated.

I'll change this review once they fix the game.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Do not, under any circumstances, buy Madden until they actually rebuild the game from the ground up. This is quite literally the same game they've been putting out since they moved to the Frostbite engine in 2017, with the devs continuously building on their spaghetti codebase. The UI is very obviously the same and just as cumbersome, except now it takes 5 seconds for anything to happen after you select something. Great. It genuinely baffles me how the game can get buggier and worse every year with the marketing being 'we fixed everything wrong with the game and added things that were in FORKING MADDEN 05 for your nostalgia'. Like somehow adding things that never should have been removed in an incomplete capacity warrants a $70 pricetag. I genuinely feel scammed out of my money. I put ~170 or so hours into Madden 23 (felt great about getting the last gen version of that /s) and it still somehow feels better than this.

But the gameplay has something for everyone atleast.  You can go and support your team as if your a pocket mercy and just heal and use gadgets for damage or even try to be a ninja and use cloak or dash and the sword.  But the 1 thing that I feel like really makes the gameplay good for everyone is how it challenges people.  Not every fight is good or skillful, your able to get rocket launchered, die to a guy sniping from far away baiting people, you can be shot in the back by 3 guys and not be able to do anything.  But I wen't from wiffing and dying to being able to get kills with every class and win 1v3's and hold cashouts solo.  

To me the best games are the ones that can include stuff for everyone, has stuff to earn, and that can challenge you.  To me this game has plenty of options of classes weapons to fight with and a lot of challenging and good fights and matches.  I believe that more cosmetics and items to earn will come in the future so I have hope for the game and will keep playing it through.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"It took me almost a year to finish this game because I had a really hard time enjoying it. It's not that the game is bad; it's because it's bland. To me, it feels like they were tasked with creating an RPG inspired by Harry Potter, and they had to check off all the ""standard RPG boxes,"" which they did.

The game does have some qualities, though! The castle is incredible, full of life, and very faithful to the Harry Potter universe. The first few hours were amazing as you get to explore, learn the initial spells in class, and discover the characters. Combat is also pretty decent, dynamic and fluid, which I enjoyed.

However, I quickly grew bored of this game. The main story and most side quests are poorly written (the only good one for me was Sebastian's). The acting and dialogues are also subpar.

Oh my god, I hate how they designed the equipment and inventory. Why is the inventory space so small for the HUGE amount of loot you find? Why do I have to complete Merlin challenges to expand my inventory? Why can't I have a fixed look and have to change it back each time I equip a new piece of clothing? Why do I have to unlock spell wheels with points; they should be given, etc. There are so many meaningless challenges and quests, and most of them are uninteresting.

ENDINGS SPOILERS [spoiler] They also failed miserably with the endings, seriously? They insist on the “removing emotions” part of ancient magic which is an intriguing topics, but in the end, it's like “fuck it” and decided to go with a ranrok dargon form (?). Even the Sebastian side quest ends on a very flat note. I loved his dark side and how he kills his uncle in cold blood, but then you tell him it's not the goblin that cursed his sister, and suddenly, everything is forgiven! [/spoiler]

Combat is also super repetitive because the bestiary is IMMENSELY small. Considering the vast Harry Potter lore, why do I have to fight humans, goblins, and spiders 95% of the time?

I think this game has two distinct sides:

The first one is the Harry Potter side. Yes, it's a good Harry Potter game, a great one even. If you are a fan, you will love this game because you can easily overlook all the flaws.

The second one is the RPG side. It's not a good RPG; I cannot bring myself to recommend it over other games in the same genre with the same budget.

So, because I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, I wouldn't recommend this game. BUT if you are a Harry Potter fan, this is the game you have been waiting for, and you should go for it.

230410,Warframe,"If you're here at the crossroads asking yourself ""Destiny 2 or Warframe?"" - then perhaps this review might clear a few things up for you!

To start with I have around 190 hours at the time of writing review and I approximately started playing Warframe around 3 weeks ago. I initially was looking for a game to keep me occupied whilst waiting for the Destiny 2 PC release.

Now I played Destiny 1 non-stop, I mean I grinded that game so hard for 4 months, achieved absolutely everything possible, obtained everything and then never touched it again. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED those 4 months. But this isn't a review about Destiny, but rather about Warframe... And man is it a good game!

Warframe at times can feel a bit overwhelming, there certainly isn't  the type of hand-holding that Bungie provide you with in Destiny. Whilst this hand holding can seem helpful at the start, it soon turns into a glass ceiling. Forcing you to go in a particular direction or playstyle - there is non of this in Warframe. 

In Warframe the universe is an open book and you approach it however you would like. There is a general linear progression to the missions, you unlock one planet move onto a next and so on, but warframe really lets you choose how you tackle this. The weapon system in Warframe is a prime example of how open it is: You can pick a starter gun, and because of 100's of mods available, this starter weapon can still kick a** in mid to end game! Every Primary, secondary and melee weapon feels unique and there are so many ways to alter these weapons: Want a machine gun that sets enemies alight? No problem, just add a Fire Mod! Want a bow that fires 2 arrows instead of 1? No problem, add a multi-shot mod! Want both of those? No problem, add both mods!

That's just the weapons, wait till you try the warframes! There are about 30 or so different warframes (basically characters) and each has 4 unique abilities. Each warframe is suited to a particular purpose: You like to control the sea and summon a Kraken to throw enemies about? Hydroid's your guy! You like to set every enemy on fire and watch the world burn? Ember's who you're after! Want to heal the rest of your teammates and be the lifeline of the team? Trinity is here! And guess what? Yepp, you can mod these just like you mod the weapons: Want more shield on your tanky Rhino warframe? No problem, we got that! Want more energy to keep using your abilities? Eyyy yepp that too! And that's just 2 examples out of hundreds!

Companions I heard you say? Oh yeah well in Destiny you have a futuristic rubix cube who attempts to make jokes. Whilst in Warframe you have about 6 different companions, 4 war wolves, some cat/fox breed and an epic looking alien bull! All of which have their unique abilities and purpose... And yes you guessed it: You can also mod them!

Next is customisation... Now wow oh wow is this impressive. Warframe lets you customise pretty much about everything. On a warframe you can add skins, you can add armor pieces, you can add sigils (tattoo type things), you can add capes, you can change helmet style and you can change the colour of every single one of these pieces and aspects. The same goes for your companions and weapons. Also you can customise the colour and skin of your ship, you can even change the colour of the walls inside your ship! There's ALOT to customise in this game, it's quite impressive.

Now at this stage you're probably saying: ""Yeah well I heard you gotta buy in-game currency to get access to this awesome stuff."" Incorrect! Warframe has a whole in-game market/trading system that often fuels the crafting system. Meaning that you can sell the drops you get from certain missions to other players for the in-game currency. Or you can keep it for yourself and once you've got all the bits you can craft it! Either way you will eventually earn platinum and be able to buy the epic stuff you wanted.

Lastly, the community. This is perhaps one of the nicest and most pleasant social aspects of Warframe. The community is so close, kind and caring. People have always helped me and some even gave me free stuff! This really is unique in an online game and boy is it nice to see.

All in all, I came to Warframe to keep me occupied and now I'm hooked. I STRONGLY recommend you try Warframe, you will not be disappointed. Great work DE!


* EDIT 1: Thank you all for your thumbs up, feedback and comments! I'll do my best to answer a few valid points that I've seen come up in the past week or in the comments.

1) ""Certain Warframes are OP"" - Well Yes and No, I don't think the term over-powered can be used here. I think certain Warframes are more USEFUL than others, but then again that will entirely depend on what mission or purpose you are doing. For example: Sure I can run through a difficult Spy mission with Ember (an incredibly offensive fire based Warframe) but I will have an easier and smoother time tackling it with Ash (a stealthy, silent, single target based Warframe).

It's also important to remember that a Warframe, weapon or even companion is only as powerful as the mods you put on it. Meaning that you can completely transform a warframe from something ""meh"" to something godly just by using the right mods, and good ones too! But remember, the better the mods, the harder they are to find / more expensive they are to buy with plat!

2) ""The graphics are horrible"" - I'm going to use World of Warcraft to demonstrate my point here (I'm sure there are many other examples, but WoW is the one I can think of right now!): - World of Warcraft is a long-running game and like in Warframe, the often beginner areas (which were created right at the start of the game) look barren and terrible. This is somewhat true about the first few planets in Warframe, certain areas at the start look lifeless and without depth BUT as you progress, the planets become more detailed and graphically nicer.

Furthermore, recently DE just remastered Earth (the first planet) and it looks MUCH nicer! So be patient, DE definitely know that certain areas look crud and they are working on it I'm sure! I expect more planets will get a make-over just like Earth in the near future.

3) ""Plains of Eidolon is boring and filled with bugs "" - Okay sure, Plains of Eidolon (the newest, semi-open world area) is not entirely what we expected but think of this: This is the first time DE have attempted anything like it, they clearly said prior to the release that they were expecting feedback and will continue to add more content to PoE. They are a small studio and don't necessarily have the resources that large studios like Blizzard or Activision might have. Give them time, give them feedback and be patient. I am almost certain that in the coming weeks DE will be adding more content and tweaking the existing stuff to make it smooth and enjoyable.

Also, Plains of Eidolon is not meant to be the bulk of the game, there are still many other planets and things to do! It's just a new area in an existing planet. Everyone chill and give DE some room to breathe and work things out, they have in the past and they will do so now too.

[td]
- A vast, detailed and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and its neighboring regions, packed to the brim with locations to discover, collectibles and activities to clear. A Potterhead’s wet dream made manifest.

- Varied and satisfying combat system that constantly opens up new opportunities as you learn more spells, and stays fresh, engaging in the long run.

- Excellent customization possibilities, featuring a myriad of cosmetics and skins, other than your very own customizable ‘base’ to furnish by hand at leisure.

- Exciting progression that portrays your growth as a wizard (or witch) rather well, giving you new tools and utilities to access previously-locked content and areas.

- Solid roster of side characters; most of them are likable / unique enough, and incredibly, their writing isn’t complete garbage - kudos to that.
[/td]
[td]
- Excessively repetitive open-world activities in the long run, that create bloat and annoyance for those who want to complete all side activities.

- Combat balance issues with potions, ‘healing spam’ and unforgivable curses: especially when upgraded they prove overpowered and make most fights quite too easy.

- Most named foes and quest bosses (but not all) are just normal enemies on steroids, that don’t vary in mechanics and don’t have unique behaviors.

- Some inconsistencies with lore and character behavior. Example: if you use unforgivable curses in public or during quests (with witnesses), nobody will give a damn.

- Underwhelming finale that doesn’t really reflect the importance of what you accomplished, and doesn’t give any detail about how your actions influenced other characters afterwards.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
Hogwarts Legacy takes place in the iconic Wizarding World setting created by J.K. Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. 

The main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.

[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]
The world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. 

Most dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898

[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]
Magical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. 

Combat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.

Quests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. 

Challenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",sum h3 depth analysis h3 table tr th b pro b th th b

1593500,God of War,"It's rare to see this much polish (on a console to PC port) right out of the gate. Sony has really put a lot of time and effort into making sure that this game was ready for release. It is even equipped with DLSS and FSR right ""out of the box"", which really shows that Sony are treating PC gamers to a level of optimisation rarely seen from other developers (cough Rockstar). Jumping into Ultra settings gets you the visual upgrade you would expect to see on PC over console. While the story and controls are as solid and intuitive (respectively) as they were on console.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Until the senior leadership team (SLT) and Pete Parsons resigns, I see no point in continuing to play this game.

SLT are solely responsible for the current state of Destiny that has been slowly simmering up until this point. Few Examples here:

- A downright terrible and offensive Lightfall expansion (that cost $50 at launch BTW)
- Lack of consistent ritual content, it took HOW MANY YEARS AND EMPTY PROMISES to get more Crucible maps? 
- The past two or so years have had issues with power creeping and loot feels less and less meaningful each season. Why bother chasing new stuff? its too late to address this now.
- Seasonal content structure is stale and boring. People are tired of playing boring seasonal activities that irrelevant and throw away after a season. This has been a recurring thing since Season TWO.
- Nobody at Bungie can decide if the non endgame content should be hard or easy. Constant whiplash of buffs and nerfs, its impossible to keep up. 
- Predatory monetization and over abundance of micro transactions. $50 expansions with $50 deluxe editions. $20 armor sets. Like when is enough?
- Inconsistent quality of story telling and plot delivering. How can this be some sort of epic conclusion when the past 9 years have seen one good campaign (The Witch Queen) and everything was mediocre to good at best? Hell, before Beyond Light, a large chunk of the story telling was in lore books hidden away. No matter how The Final shape ends up, good or bad, will it feel fulfilling? Hell no!
- The lack of the new player experience. This has been a problem since they vaulted a bunch of content in Beyond Light. Its been over 3 years since that happened HOW is there STILL no adequate new player experience? People have been asking for this and we still have yet to see anything meaningful.


I could keep going but this is off the top of my head. I'm so tired of the ""we hear you"" and promises that never get fulfilled. SLT could have led their team of very talented developers to fix and address the game's core pain points. But they are too busy ignoring their own team's feedback and player feedback. Instead, they are figuring out what the best way to further monetize and exploit players for more money is. 

I will no longer support Destiny or Bungie until their SLT is gone. They think they know what is best for the game but they have zero idea what is needed for a healthy state of the game and refuse to change. And when their vision fails, they layoff the people who implemented their vision instead of taking responsibility. How is that fair? Destiny is one of the best examples of a ""what if"". So much missed potential due to a few individuals who seek profit and money over anything else. Look at what happened at 343i, they cleaned up shop and Halo Infinite is slowly and surely getting into a better spot. Thats what happens when you put the person who led the fix of the disastrous Master Chief Collection as studio head.

I love this game. I hate saying this as if its some sort of +1 over other people to make my opinion worth more than others, but up through Season of the Deep, I was playing every single season / content drop since the Destiny 1 beta (except season of the worthy). But I am SO tired of the constant whiplash of good times and bad times, so its time to stop for good. It shouldn't have to be this way. I have met some great people playing this game and it sucks I cannot continue to play Destiny with them. Some of my favorite gaming moments and memories are from this game. But in its current state, stay away from this game, especially new players, there are way better ones out there that respect your time.",senior leadership team slt pete parson resigns continuing game slt solely responsible current state destiny slowly simmering example downright terrible offensive lightfall expansion cost 50 launch btw lack consistent ritual content took year empty promise get crucible map past two year issue power creeping loot feel meaningful season bother chasing stuff late address seasonal content structure stale boring tired playing boring seasonal activity irrelevant throw season recurring thing season two bungie decide non endgame content hard easy constant whiplash buff nerfs impossible predatory monetization abundance micro transaction 50 expansion 50 deluxe edition 20 armor set enough inconsistent quality story telling plot delivering sort epic conclusion past 9 year seen one good campaign witch queen everything mediocre good best hell light large chunk story telling lore book hidden matter final shape end good bad feel fulfilling hell lack player experience problem vaulted bunch content light 3 year happened adequate player experience asking meaningful top head tired hear promise get fulfilled slt led team talented developer fix address game core pain point busy ignoring team feedback player feedback figuring best monetize exploit player money longer support destiny bungie slt best game zero idea needed healthy state game refuse vision fails layoff implemented vision taking responsibility fair destiny one best example missed potential due individual seek profit money else look happened 343i cleaned shop halo infinite slowly surely getting spot thats happens person led fix disastrous master chief collection studio head love game hate saying sort 1 make opinion worth others season deep playing single season content drop destiny 1 beta except season worthy tired constant whiplash good time bad time time stop good met great playing game suck continue destiny favorite gaming moment memory game current state stay game especially player one respect time

381210,Dead by Daylight,"""Nothing is meant to be fair, and apparently by design"" - Mathieu Cote (Game director On Dead by Daylight)
I will try to explain why I write a negative review despite having a lot of hours and constantly playing this game to this day.
[b] The game lures people into gambling addiction!!! [/b]
If you're online enough, you could have seen people complaining over the fact that they don't really appreciate Dead by Daylight but they are unable to quit it. The fun fact is the game that is based a lot on RNG factors, aka luck, and tries to look ""competetive"" develops gambling addiction. 
You win, then you lose, after that you go for another match to show off your skills of defeating the unfair events and survive or killl every survivor. It's addiction is based on a constant feeling of irritation, the developers acknowledged it during one of their interviews. Gambling addiction funnily comes from losing, not winning. You will be annoyed by everything. By one of the most toxic communities, by poor balance decisions, countless bugs. Despite bringing the feeling of satisfaction sometimes, your mental state overall will be worse by the end of most play sessions. You won't play this game because you like it, you will play it because you're addicted to the constant feeling of surpassing the irritation. And the worst part is that you will feel rewarded because of the fact that you outsmarted players who are there to mock you and verbally abuse you by the end of a game. It's not healthy no matter how you look at it. Even if you have ""thick skin"", it's simply unenjoyable to waste your time on such people when you think about it.

Talking about the other reasons why I can't recommend this game: 
- It requires you to waste too much time grinding and paying. Licenced characters can only be purchased via real money and if you want to get original ones for free, you need to put 100 hours for each character. And there are so many of them, it may take 1000, if not more, hours to gain them all for free. 
- The developers work on their game when they WANT. The reason for that is the fact that this game does not have any competition. This brings flaws and small patches that do not really feel drastic and entertaining. Moreover, if the upcoming changes are disliked by the community, they will be rolled anyways since what can people do, find another Dead By Daylight? Money were put into creation of the things players didn't like, get it or leave. Oh, wait, you won't. 
- The game feels dull. We have no new content despite new killers and perks that kind of change gameplay. The issue here is that the perks don't do much, currently the game has a few strong perks that the community takes and the other perks are not being used at all unless a player wants to feel less powerful for some reason. And the killers often feel dull as well. Instead of constantly working on the previous perks and killers the developers prefer to make new perks and killers for the sake of pumping up money. They rarely change anything, it's lucky to have a patch with some big interesting changes at least once a year.
- The developers obviously lean towards the side that brings more money with the help of the cosmetics. It's not a secret that killer issues take much more time to be solved than the survivor ones. It brings unfairness into the game in certain cases.
- Moderation on the Steam and the official forums will literally ban you for showing any concern about the game's health. If you complain too much, well, stop spreading negativity. This creates a false sense of positivity when the community is furious at BHVR.
- The support isn't really helpful and deals with many issues quite poorly. The in-game report system only flags certain players, they won't get banned if you press a few buttons there. To have a person banned for sure you need to take extensive amount of steps and most of the times you need proof. So if you don't have your games recorded, you can't sumbit tickets to support effectively. 
- They have started doing limited time payed content, they even took out certain cosmetics that existed before that decision. Feels icky, you can see how they try to pump the money out of you. 
- You will have to close your comment section. I've never seen a community being this obsessed with leaving toxic comments on your profile. 

Please, do not support this mess. It looks fun on the outside but it's a mess.

----
I would like to mention one pretty significant thing about the game's developers that had happened at some point.
The community asked for colorblind setting for more than 4 years. This request had been dismissed until some point when the scandal occured because of it.
One of the developers called the whole thing boring. Clearly they aren't interested in wasting resources on something that won't bring them much income. The game has lost it's initial charm long time ago and has nothing passionate about it.

1203620,Enshrouded,"This game is amazing. Basically Valheim but IMO better than valheim was when it first released and honestly can hold its own against present valheim. Mostly all positives but there are a couple things i would like to see changed. For one, setting options like palworlds has would be nice, being able to switch loot dropping on death to it not dropping on death. I honestly hate that in survival games considering its not a difficulty thing per say, its just a time consuming thing which imo is a waste of time. I wanna be exploring and doing productive things not going back to my dead body cuz i accidentally slipped off a ledge into fire. Again imo thats not difficulty its literally just wasting the gamers time.
I also came across a little issue with roots, playing coop in my cousins hosted game, i destroyed a root when he wasnt there and he didnt get the skill point for it and when he went to the spot the root was still gone. we thought he might be screwed out of the point but we just had to restart the server. but what if your playing on a server you pay for thats always online, then what? Another little nit pick, the hit boxes sometimes seem a little wonky, example ill be standing completely behind an enemy and theyll swing, the axe makes no contact with me yet i take damage.. 
Again tho those are little nit picks cuz overall without question i recommend buying this game. Shit I wouldve paid 59.99 for this game, its far better than some triple A titles! I love the variety in skill tree, might of put double jump inside the circle  with skills like the wood cutting and mining skills, rather than on one of the class part of the tree but again this is an opinion based nit pick. The building in the game is SOOO good. The fact you can place square by square for roof and wall pieces, most games just have full walls and limited roof pieces.. Im excited to see 6 months from now some of the insane builds people come up with. 
THE MAP IS INSANELY LARGE.. i was shocked at how big this map is. I would say this game is basically Valheim had a baby with Breath of the wild with a dash of minecraft. if you enjoy any of those games, BUY THIS GAME",game amazing basically valheim imo valheim released honestly hold present valheim mostly positive couple thing changed one setting option palworlds nice able switch loot dropping death dropping death honestly hate survival game considering difficulty thing per time consuming thing imo waste time wan na exploring productive thing dead body cuz accidentally slipped ledge fire imo thats difficulty literally wasting gamers time across little issue root playing coop cousin hosted game destroyed root wasnt didnt get skill spot root thought screwed restart server playing server pay thats online little nit pick box sometimes little wonky example ill standing completely enemy theyll swing axe make contact damage tho little nit pick cuz overall question recommend buying game shit wouldve paid 59 99 game far triple title love variety skill tree double inside circle skill wood cutting mining skill rather one class tree opinion based nit pick building game sooo good place square square roof wall piece game full wall limited roof piece im excited 6 month insane build map insanely large shocked big map game basically valheim breath wild dash minecraft enjoy game game

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"99% of gamers will know what Skyrim is, but this review will be for that 1% who have heard the name and are looking into it, but know nothing about it. 

Basically, Skyrim is the 5th instalment in the Elder Scrolls series. The game is set within a fictional world called Tamriel and in this particular title, you play within the province of Skyrim, the icy home of the Nords (Think ancient Norway). 

You start the game as a prisoner of the Empire (Roman-esque faction) on your way to be executed. You create your character by choosing your gender, selecting from one of several different races and customising your appearance. 

By chance, the return of the dragons (After being gone for a thousand years) occurs just before you're executed and you are able to escape. From this point onwards, the game opens up to you... You are free to do as you please. You can crack on with the main storyline revolving around the return of the dragons, or you can go seek out some of the staggering amount of side quests. You can even join up with factions, such as Assassins, thieves, warriors or mages. 

Throughout the game, you level up your skills. These range from combat abilities such as different schools of magic, archery etc. to production type skills such as blacksmithing or alchemy. 

It is a fantasy style world, full of Orcs, humanoid Lizards & Felines, Elves and so on. It is filled with mystery, magic, lore and captivating story. What you do, is up to you. There is an entire province (And more with the DLC) to explore. 

If you've somehow never played Skyrim and you're interesting in fantasy worlds, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go. It's been out for 12 years at this point and the game can feel a little outdated, but it's still a fantastic game with plenty to offer.",99 gamers skyrim review 1 heard name looking basically skyrim 5th instalment elder scroll series game set fictional world called tamriel particular title province skyrim icy home nords ancient norway game prisoner empire roman esque faction executed create choosing gender selecting one different race customising appearance chance return dragon thousand year occurs executed able escape onwards game open please crack main storyline revolving return dragon seek staggering side quest join faction assassin thief warrior mages throughout game skill range combat ability different school magic archery etc production type skill blacksmithing alchemy fantasy style world full orcs humanoid lizard feline elf filled mystery magic lore captivating story entire province dlc explore somehow skyrim interesting fantasy world strongly recommend giving 12 year game feel little outdated fantastic game plenty offer
976730,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,"Okay, I love the Halo series to death. It has given me so much joy and fun over the years... I've poured thousands upon thousands of hours in to the franchise as a whole and some individual titles, like Halo CE and 3, are among my favorite games ever. I played all of the titles in this collection at or near release on their original platforms.

All that to say: this collection needs work. As I write this review, I am nearing 500 hours on the steam version alone, not to mention the Xbox One version of MCC. There are several main issues with this version of MCC that will impact your enjoyment to varying degrees, depending on what modes you like more or what you find important in a PC port. Let me list them out, starting with a big one:

-Abysmal matchmaking system. This game has no ability to replace lost players on your team mid-game, and quitting is rampant. You can and will find yourself on the giving and receiving end of lopsided games, frequently. Teams are supposedly balanced (even in social gamemodes) to try and prevent this but in practice games where the majority of people playing are meaningfully contributing and having fun are very rare. AFK players, smurfs and assorted fun-sucking players are a big problem too. Ranked modes have low population, and therefore will match you with people way farther above or below your skill, but can in my experience lead to marginally more balanced and/or fun games than social, which is unexpected. You can still have fun in MM, but I would strongly recommend bringing friends along and not getting too invested in it as a competitive game.

-Technical issues are steadily being fixed but are still numerous and range from annoying to game breaking. Disconnects and crashes are a big source of frustration, especially in matchmaking and tragically are also a problem in coop campaign and Firefight modes. Xbox Live functionality is fickle, and windows generally has tons of obscure bugs and frustrations associated with it, but that's not exactly the game's fault. I will also warn that those who care about accurate and detailed game stats and achievements (which this games has tons of) are going to have a bad time. Halo MCC is notorious for glitched achievements, leaderboards and general statistics. Part of it is the game being buggy, and the other is the Halo Waypoint backend stuff that 343i uses to manage player stats is incredibly unreliable. I'm currently at 638/700 achievements and also care about stats, so it's a huge sore point for me.

-No in-game player blocking or reporting. Are you kidding?

-Hit registration, in some of the games in the collection, frankly sucks.

So this sounds really awful, right? Why is this game recommended? Well, to put it simply, a shoddy port of a great game is still worthwhile. I'm not a fan of Halo 4, but every other game in this collection, IMO, is goddamn amazing. Such a blast to play with friends, tight gunplay, creative level designs and fun weapon sandboxes and game mechanics abound. If you are new to Halo or have played the games before, I would totally recommend getting this collection and experiencing these formerly (for the most part) console-bound FPS masterpieces with a surprising amount of PC-centric upgrades that bring the games (when MCC isn't acting up) above and beyond.

The second reason I recommend this game, and perhaps even the most important one is that once 343i delivers a fully functional custom game browser (which they are in the process of doing) and official mod tools are released the game can realize it's true potential: a community-driven, highly customizable, moddable social FPS with tons of content, tight mechanics and a great way to make some friends on the internet

Halo MCC is not there yet, but it's close. It needs a push.

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"Rolled credits and completing the endgame loop once (If you've seen or played you know what that means) and the idea that this game will survive a year baffles me. 
Traditionally Looter shooters' stories are extremely weak, especially when they launch. Destiny 1 and 2, Anthem, Division 1 and 2, Avengers, all have very middling launches, and survive based on their audience's ability to tolerate their bullshit. I can look past the story. I'll say I'm definitely not happy about how the entire Justice league is unceremoniously killed, and barely acknowledged for most of the game, but I tried to turn that part of my brain off and just focus on getting to the meat of any looter shooter, the endgame. 

The endgame loop in this game, along with the spam of IPad-kid looking combat with flashy numbers that barely mean anything, is abysmal. Without spoiling too much, they want you to run this endgame 13 TIMES over what seems to be the course of a year if not LONGER, and without any signficant changes other than the elseworlds you'll visit while you do them, this game will die within that year, easily. If you check the steam charts page for this game, it peaked on February 3rd, 2024 at the time of writing with 13,459 players. Right now as I'm typing this, we have 6,877 players on February 5th, 2024. 

It really doesn't matter what my opinions are on the game, I can sit here and type that I like the traversal, or that metropolis looks cool, or that while the Justice league is disrespected by a seemingly absent writers room for its 9 hour runtime of a shitshow story, their designs are great, etc. The proof is in the playercount that this game was an abject failure, and has now wasted Rocksteady's past 8 or so years of development. I never WANT a game to fail, I love videogames, I love this studio, but they're going to have to take a good hard look as that playercount sinks even further as to why they should keep this game running at all. 

Your mileage can vary. Some people really like the combat, some people can look past the shit parts of the game and just enjoy having a DC focused game to play in, that actually has some cool loot when you get to the notorious/infamous stuff. Personally I will be playing the loop at least for the next month or so as Joker gets released, and I'll be closely following to see if WB really wants to sink more money into what looks like an already capsized and sunk ship. I cannot however recommend the game. Rocksteady and WB have some serious work to do that will take time, money, and effort, and if the base game is anything to go by, I don't think they have a snowball's chance of turning this around, and I don't know why they would given the playercount and retention is so abysmal only 3 days  after its actual launch (Not counting early access) 

I won't recommend this. If it's on sale and you want to hop in before the servers are inevitably shut down, go for it. I hope I can be proven wrong in the long run. But to me, this looks like another Avengers or Anthem, and without some serious help in the next 3-6 months, I can already see the tweet rocksteady will send out stating that they're pulling this from sales or delisting it entirely.",rolled credit completing endgame loop seen mean idea game survive year baffle traditionally looter shooter story extremely weak especially launch destiny 1 2 anthem division 1 2 avenger middling launch survive based audience tolerate bullshit look past story definitely happy entire justice league unceremoniously killed barely acknowledged game tried turn brain focus getting meat looter shooter endgame endgame loop game along spam ipad kid looking combat flashy number barely mean abysmal spoiling endgame 13 time course year longer signficant change elseworlds visit game die year easily check chart page game peaked february 3rd 2024 time writing 13 459 player right typing 6 877 player february 5th 2024 matter opinion game sit type traversal metropolis look cool justice league disrespected seemingly absent writer room 9 hour runtime shitshow story design great etc proof playercount game abject failure wasted rocksteady past 8 year development game fail love videogames love studio good hard look playercount sink game running mileage vary combat look past shit part game enjoy dc focused game cool loot get notorious infamous stuff personally playing loop next month joker get released closely following wb want sink money look already capsized sunk ship recommend game rocksteady wb serious work time money effort base game snowball chance turning given playercount retention abysmal 3 day actual launch counting early access recommend sale hop server inevitably shut hope proven wrong long look avenger anthem serious help next 3 6 month already tweet rocksteady send stating pulling sale delisting entirely

1778820,TEKKEN 8,"[h1][b]Thank you, [i]Tekken 8[/i][/b][/H1]
For the past few years, I've genuinely struggled to get excited to play any game I own or could buy. My passion for gaming reached an all-time low near the end of 2023. And 2024 brought more of the same—[b]a new year, same old burnout plagued me.[/b] Things weren't looking good, bruv.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147207996
I was legit thinking of calling it quits, but only after publishing my cute little flipbook project I worked on for the past 6+ months. Plus, I was once again (still am) tormented by (I assume) RAM issues, despite already getting a brand new kit from G.Skill on the 3rd of January after going through their RMA process.

But that's a story for another day.
Back to [i]Tekken 8.[/i]

On [i](Orthodox)[/i] Christmas Eve, I was scrolling through my YouTube feed, and [i]Tekken 8's[/i] teaser popped up. I already watched it back when it was first shown—[b]I did not care![/b] Yet, now I did!? After that, I watched the story trailer for the first time. My tummy felt weird—[b]'twas butterflies![/b] I was giddy with excitement. I was looking forward to a game for the first time in forever! And it was a game from a franchise I did not care for and from a genre I don't even like. It was an [i](Orthodox)[/i] Christmas miracle! Then and there, I decided—[b]I must play it day 1![/b] As fate would have it, I had just enough TF2 keys sitting in my inventory to fund this desire of mine. So, I did.

To pass the time until it fully came, [b]I played the demo, loving every second of my 23 hours spent with it.[/b] Sure, its content offering was small: only 4 (out of 32) playable characters, the first battle of the story mode, the intro section of the Arcade Quest mode, and a few Super Ghosts fights that let me reach only the [i]Warrior[/i] rank. But it's the motion of the ocean that counts! And, oh boy, [b]did it rock my boat![/b] The 26th just couldn't come soon enough.

The gameplay shocked me by how easily I jelled with it. Fast, flashy, and furious, yet it was welcoming to a complete noob like myself. I was loving the learning process, and it didn't feel overwhelming. I even managed to get gud at doing some simple combos and air juggling, so that's nice. And I love the new gameplay addition—the [b]Heat[/b] system. Being able to stop my opponent's attack flow by using the [b]Heat Burst[/b] attack, which is uninterruptible, is music to my ears. Sure, you can easily block it, but this is where the fun begins—[b]trying to time it, [i]just right![/i][/b] Plus, the [b]Heat Engager[/b] and [b]Heat Smash[/b] [i](I do be engaging in smashing)[/i] attacks can be used to extend combos and deal even more damage in the process. Simply majestic. The trade-off is that [b]Heat[/b] only lasts 15 seconds. But do you really need more than that? Sometimes less is more, you know.

Speaking of cool attacks, [b]Rage Art[/b] is present once again. This is essentially a super funky high-damage special move you can only do when your health is low. I can't count the number of times using it saved my noob behind from dying. And I gotta say, they are always a treat to watch. [b]This superbly animated sequence, combined with the game's insane visuals, sparks joy each and every time I watch one play out.[/b]

And all the fighting is [i]extra[/i] spiced up by the crazy amount of special effects on the screen each punch, kick, grab, or flying leg kick thrown produces. I can't explain why, but I love the sight of them. [b]It makes watching the punch land that much more oh-so-satisfying.[/b] The animations are also fantastic, further adding to the amazing feel of the combat.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260998
The visuals are simply insane. [i][b]Unreal Engine 5[/b][/i] shines, and so do daddy Kazuya's massive [i]pecs[/i]! Everything, from the arenas, some with multiple rooms you can blast your opponent into, to the character design, is superb and extremely rich in detail. Just amazing stuff. But there's one complaint from me—[b]Paul lost his iconic hair and looks like a Karen[/b] (why [i]Bamco?[/i]). 

Also, if you enjoy character customization as much as I do (a lot), then the Arcade Quest mode will be your wet dream. Here, all bets are off, and we'll get free reign over how our fighters look. Will they look wacky? Yes. Creepy? Also yes. Lewd? [b]Hopefully.[/b] Giving players more customization options and freedom is always a plus in my book!

Lastly, the over-the-topness of the story seems to be intact.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3147260668
I can't wait to see what one of gaming's most dysfunctional families, the Mishimas, is up to. Likely a lot of half-naked men fighting each other, preferably near a cliff, volcano, or maybe a cliff overlooking a volcano. We shall see.

Simply put, [b]it's all (gonna be) perfect![/b]

And after having written 99 reviews, my 100th review will be the first and last [i]improper[/i] one. But [i]Tekken 8[/i] deserved this sacrifice, as it reignited my passion for gaming when no other game could.

So, thank you, [i]Tekken 8.[/i]
Thank you to all the developers who poured their hearts and souls into this game.
Lastly, thanks to all of you, top bananas, for coming to my [b]TEK[/b]talk.
I hope you all enjoy [i]Tekken 8[/i] as much as I am.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'll start by saying this. I have played many MMOs in my days. Some more than others such as Ultima, Runescape, World of Warcraft, FF14...but Elder Scrolls Online, mind you this is in this gamer's opinion, has been the richest, immersing, and positive community driven MMO I have ever played.

-:::The community:::-
The player community of ESO has always been thoughtful, encouraging, and kind. There have only been probably two occurrences of a player being toxic in my 1200+ hours of playing. Even if you're not in a guild and you want to ""Sword Online '' it a bit, players you meet in the game are in one word, Awesome! Want to hear something even more dope? Players will sometimes help you get the gear you need by being on the lookout in rando dungeon runs. I do this myself and just trade the gear without asking for anything in return. Why? Because others did it for me when I started to play. Don't know when it started, but this mindset really is helpful for new players or vet players working up an alt. The forums and redit and great places to go for information and if you want to mention something.

-:::Money Stuffs:::-
First, the base game is $20 (USD) with NO subscription cost required. The base game is loaded with content on it's own. There are free-to-play events that last for about a week or two. During the event, usually the base game is even cheaper. Micro transactions exist and expansions will cost extra, but you don't need to spend an extra dime when you start to play. If you want to get a ESO plus membership...you'll mainly do it for the Crafting Bag! You can pay for one month, farm your behind off, toss it in the bag, and you will still have access to the materials even as a non member. Personally, I don't let my membership drop. I have enjoyed Bethesda games for many, many years and I believe in their mission statement as a company. This is my way of supporting them. In truth, I have spent roughly hundreds in a combination of micros/Xpacs/ESO Prime memberships. If you have a tattoo that says ""No Regrets"", give your tat a double pat, because it is how I feel about the money I have spent.

-:::The gameplay:::-
Ughhh...where to start...
There is so much to do in the game. 1200+ hours and I still have things to do and explore. It's mind blowing! Each zone has unique story lines and quests/daily quests with awesome rewards. There is the main quest, which I recommend before doing anything else. It will get you attuned to the game mechanics, your race/class/weapon types/armor, and learn some awesome lore along the way. The character creation and race/class/weapon/armor combinations are endless. Pick the Race and Class you find that most speaks to you, but let's face it, you'll eventually want to build alts to see what else is awesome!

-Character-
The max level is 50, and more growth with Champion Points after capping. Character creation is just as in depth as any Elder Scrolls game. While questing, sometimes your race or class can trigger a line in NPCs to make it more immersive. Each race and class has their own special abilities and passives. There are the ""End-Game"" builds for grrrr dps, beefy tanking, and poofy Healing, but you can customize your play style for questing and solo-work in your way. Example? Hmmm? Dragon Knight...usually seen as a tanking class using one/two handed weapons with shields while breathing fire, throwing rocks, battle screaming, and jumping into battle like a Barbarian Berserker in DND, but...go ahead...equip a bow or a staff and do those same things and go Ham if you want to. Possibilities are endless for each combination of race, class, weapon and armor types.

-Content-
Bethesda is continuously adding new content and revisiting the game to keep it fresh and fun. They just revamped Champion Points...I haven't delved into the new system enough to make a bias comment, but I can say this; ""HOLY CANNOLI BATMAN"", there is great potential and growth for your character in the new system for PVE and PVP. There is usually a new expansion every year and it is treated like a year-long event with a prologue quest, updates, and things to do that get you ready for what is coming. As with most MMOs, there are also seasonal events like the New Life Festival (my favorite), Jester Festival, Witches Festival, Midyear Mayhem...just to name a few. All have great rewards, quests, and things to do. They add to those rewards each year!

-PVP-
You into PVP? Good, cause I'm not (lol). I can't accurately comment on PVP, because I am mainly a questing player trying to build his own home. That said, I can say this; It's a typical MMO PVP experience with dailies and stuff, but it has quite a few modes to choose from with unique objectives! Wish I could comment more, but maybe once I join a guild, I'll team up with those who can teach me the ways of ESO PVP. I'll edit this when that happens.

-Guilds-
Another area I can't accurately comment on, but what do guilds have in them? People! The Players! Look online about people in their guilds, no matter the game. No matter the size of the guild (and they can get big) they have long lasting friendships built with others they have met. Example I can give is my WoW days. I still talk to my old Guild Master and friend. She is like my Big Sister in a way and we live states apart! The people you meet in your guild could bring you joy. Meet with them and become family! Learn with them! Fight with them! FOR THE HOR...sorry, wrong game...the family aspect still applies though. No matter your race or banner you join, your guild could be that family you were looking for.

-Homes-
Yes, you can buy homes in ESO, just like in previous games. Buying homes makes them account wide, so your alts will be able to go into those same homes. Some players have built their own home. I am currently doing this and it is a massive undertaking, but I am enjoying it! You can even invite other players and guild mates into your home! ""Say What!?"". If that's not cool, then how about this. Your non-combat pets and mounts...you can set paths for them to walk or fly while you are in your house...Awesome! There are so many furniture items to collect and showcase. Get enough of them and you’ll eventually need more than one home to place them in!

582660,Black Desert,"Note to considering buyers, the $10 price tag is false; you'll probably need to end up spending probably another $20 or so to feel like you're not being hindered in terms of bag space, weight, or auto loot speed. This game is an extremely long term game--there are no gear resets when new content drops. 

So if the idea of getting near to max gear in 2 weeks is what you need to have fun, then this game isn't for you. But the flip side of that though is this, the progression is always there. Concerning the length however, they did add seasonal servers which slingshot new players to a spot where they can actually start working towards end game gear. When this game first came out, you had to go Rags-to-Riches all by your lonesome, but now it's really not the case.

Concerning RNG, I've heard that they have made ways to get around it, but I personally haven't reached that point--but I have been getting some of said items needed to bypass the RNG.

Concerning P2W, it most definetly is possible BUT it is--in my opinion--a complete waste of money due to how inefficient it is. Though players most certainly can--and a small minority do--buy cash shop items and sell them for in-game money, you would probably need to spend no less than $10,000 USD to get anything close to end-game gear from 0. So yeah, whales can exist, but you likely won't encounter them and they make it so we don't need to pay a subscription to keep the servers running.

If you're looking for a game where you can AFK and make some money, love being able to play by yourself for high-end content, having the option for group PvP, and love complicated systems, this game is likely gonna be a good fit.

If the way you enjoy games is through dungeons and raiding, end-game content requiring groups, or systems that can be learned within a relatively short time span, this may not be the game for you. This isn't to trash anyone who fits in this category though, I really want to emphasize that everyone just has fun in a different way :)",note considering buyer 10 price tag false probably need spending probably 20 feel hindered term bag space weight auto loot speed game extremely long term game gear reset content drop idea getting near max gear 2 week need fun game flip side progression concerning length add seasonal server slingshot player spot working towards game gear game rag rich lonesome case concerning rng heard way get personally reached getting said item needed bypass rng concerning p2w definetly possible opinion complete waste money due inefficient player certainly small minority cash shop item game money probably need spend 10 000 usd get close game gear 0 yeah whale exist encounter make need pay subscription server running looking game afk make money love able high content option group pvp love complicated system game gon na good fit enjoy game dungeon raiding game content requiring group system learned relatively short time span game trash fit category emphasize everyone fun different

Got bodied by another player online? Download their ghost and you can have as many practice matches against it as you like it to learn how to handle their moves, without having to set up a study session in practice mode (which is also greatly improved, btw.)

899770,Last Epoch,"There have been recent review bombs because of multiplayer ""launch"" issues. Basically, the developers spent a long time working on making their single-player game multiplayer, and launch got hammered by 3-4x their expected player numbers, so the servers had massive issues. I personally don't think people should review games based on server issues that are in the process of being fixed in a game that's still in beta, but I digress. 

At the time of writing this I have 30 some odd hours on steam, but maybe 100-200 with their standalone launcher throughout the past few years. I've watched this game grow from the most barebones, amateur looking RPG, to a super polished, promising soon-to-be competitor to the loot-based ARPG behemoths (PoE, d4). 

Last Epoch is an uncut gem. I've watched the passionate developers work based on community feedback and vision for years now. I cannot wait to see where this game is in a year or two at this trajectory, because the 0.9 multiplayer launch has already far exceeded my expectations. I don't think it's in a position to compete with PoE and D4 at the moment, but as it grows and gets better and better it definitely will. This is a developer team to watch closely, and It would be dumb for GGG and Blizzard to not take a look at how they've taken outdated systems from other ARPGs and made them a lot better. 

This game as is pre-launch is already a 7/10. As they flesh out end game, add their 3 launch classes, and stick to their philosophy on game design and working with the community to make a good game, I can easily foresee it being a 9/10, and I expect that it will end up sharing the top few spots in viewer numbers with PoE in the ARPG genre.",recent review bomb multiplayer launch issue basically developer spent long time working single player game multiplayer launch got hammered 3 4x expected player number server massive issue personally review game based server issue process fixed game beta digress time writing 30 odd hour maybe 100 200 standalone launcher throughout past year watched game grow barebones amateur looking super polished promising soon competitor loot based arpg behemoth poe d4 last epoch uncut gem watched passionate developer work based community feedback vision year wait game year two trajectory 0 9 multiplayer launch already far exceeded expectation position compete poe d4 moment grows get definitely developer team watch closely dumb ggg blizzard look taken outdated system arpgs game pre launch already 7 10 flesh game add 3 launch class stick philosophy game design working community make good game easily foresee 9 10 expect sharing top spot viewer number poe arpg genre

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I don't often review games because I am lazy, but this game deserves it. I am a 32 year old gamer and my fps experience goes back to Doom. I played all the FPS games. A few of the cod's, all the counter stirkes, most the battlefields, tribes,unreal's, quake's, titanfalls, rainbow six etc. This game is different then them all. Team work isn't wanted its absolutely needed. There is no kill feed, no glamour for the solo person with 50 kills at the end you just get to celebrate the win while your countries music plays on the score tab. Its a very, very different game. I am not super familiar with this genre having only played ARMA 3 for a few hours but the people playing this game are passionate. A lot of them take everything super serious which has its ups and downs but mostly ups. The player base is small enough you start to see the same people in games, but its large enough its always possible to find a full server to play on in less than 5 minutes. There is so many niches to fill in this game I suggest watching a youtube video before loading it up. The strats you need to win in this game take a lot of team coordination (average game has around 10 diff squads all geared towards diff tactics to help you win). I'm semi drunk and rambling but I really enjoy this game, yes there are times where you are getting crushed and you basically spawn in, run for 5 mins and die but those are few and far between.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"8/10 Rainbow six siege is a damn fine shooter 

BUT that doesn't mean its perfect so im gonna explain whats good & whats not 

-whats good? 

Most of the time shooting in this game seems very fun and balanced unless its a relatively new operator that was just added (more on that topic soon) 

the game rewards map familiarity, some maps can have destructible floors, walls and ceilings which makes it highly rewarding to go into custom games and learn them on your own.....speaking of which 

custom games! this is such a blessing to have if you really want to take your skills to the next level, also it may help you study any new dlc maps so you can at least know what you're about to get yourself into this season 

Free dlc!!!! finally a decent shooter that doesn't seem like all the devs want is money. yes there is cosmetics in game but nothing like ""pay to win"" but most members of the siege community may disagree with me due in part with the events that happen usually half way through the season (there are 4 season through the year, so you get 8 new ops per year and usually a new map and possibly a new rework on older maps to make them ""better"") each event is different than the last one minute you are carebears shooting each other the next you are rootin tootin shootin cowboys (at least from what the data miners have found) but they have loot boxes that you must buy at least 50 dollars of if you want All the cosmetic for the event in question 

this game heavily requires communication and strategy. Every single operator on the rainbow six team differs from the others, one places bear traps that downs enemies, another has a infra-red sniper scope that can pierce through thick smoke and highlights enemies making it much easier to get distance kills but with that there is weaknesses. the bear traps can be shot to be destroyed and are fairly easy to spot due to how massive they are. the sniper glaz is a powerhouse but when you take a slow sniper against smgs that can shoot faster than you can make a bowl of popcorn, you need to make sure you keep a distance and use recoil against them but also make every shot count one miss could mean it all. 

there is an operator for everyone.
you like being slow and able to take some damage? we have that. you can play as fuze who releases a cluster bomb of grenades in a small area that can pinch off the enemy team if placed right. or as doc who heals your team with stimulant shots. 

you like being faster than god itself? play ash shes a fast operator that rewards the run and gun style plus her ""gadget"" is a grenade launcher that allows you to blow away any soft walls that lay in your wake. or as bandit whos able to place car batteries on barbed wire making them electrocute anything that may cross as well as add electricity to any reinforced walls. 

or how about a nice mix? you have twitch who can take her drone around and remove enemy's gadgets, cameras and can even inflict damage on the enemy team. or you may play as frost (the bear trap operator). 

there is pve as well but its very lacking but it does exist 

the devs are also very quick to fix MAJOR bugs in game.

but my favorite thing about this game is the content creators, they all are very fun loving guys and gals and they help support this amazing community. 

-whats bad? 

there is moments when ranked play can just feel like udder crap, toxicity is very common in this game most time its just bland dry sarcasm or humor that can be taken the wrong way. 

new operators are kinda always broke when they first release but are usually fixed not too long later but other times its too long 

this game has a high learning curve 

headshots are instakills! sometimes it will feel unfair because you will turn a corner and get domed seemingly out of nowhere. so get that aim up dude. 

this game has frequent updates to fix a bug or issue but sometimes that just creates more bugs

1462040,FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE,"Final Fantasy VII Remake is a visually stunning and ambitious reimagining of the classic RPG that captivated players in the late '90s. While it successfully captures the essence of the original game, it does suffer from some notable issues that prevent it from reaching its full potential. 

One of the main drawbacks of FF7R lies in its early chapters, where the pacing can feel uneven and disjointed. The initial hours of the game tend to drag, with an abundance of slow-paced sidequests that fail to engage. The uninteresting tasks can disrupt the flow of the story and make it difficult to maintain the same level of enthusiasm experienced in later chapters. In the original FFVII, Midgard took like 6-8 hours and was basically a prolonged prologue to a much grander world and story. Here in Integrade this was stretched to 35+ hours and even after finishing it I'm still on the fence if focusing on that specific part of the original was a good idea or not. Some areas or scenes improve the story significantly, others really drag and feel like they are just there to fill the time. I guess you can't justify a high fidelity, expensive remake of a beloved title to be so short.  Thankfully it gets better around halfway where story finally picks up and even sidequests become more enjoyable.

On the positive side, the combat system is one of FF7R greatest achievements. The real-time action seamlessly blends with strategic decision-making, offering players an exhilarating and dynamic experience. I wasn't a fan of this new battle system at first, but it grew on me over the time. The variety of playable characters, each with their unique abilities and playstyles, adds depth and excitement to battles. The strategic use of the ATB (Active Time Battle) system allows for tactical decision-making, ensuring that combat remains engaging throughout the adventure. It shines especially in boss battles. The intensity and grandeur of these battles are magnified by the outstanding soundtrack, which skilfully blends nostalgia with new compositions, enhancing the overall experience.

Furthermore, the presentation of Final Fantasy VII Remake is nothing short of breathtaking. The graphics are stunning, bringing the iconic locations of Midgar to life with meticulous detail and awe-inspiring visual effects. The character models are beautifully rendered, and the voice acting is superb, adding depth and emotion to the already beloved cast of characters. 

HOWEVER

FF7R came out on consoles first, and I'm so tired of games that have to be designed for outdated systems in mind. There are so so so many long corridors or places where you walk or crawl really slowly. On consoles, they were used to hide loading times, but on PC they just pad the time even more.

Sadly, I really can't say anything good about some changes to original plot. The introduction of the arbiters of destiny/fate/whatever... Every time they appeared, my immediate reaction was ""Please just go, and let me enjoy my FFVII"". Instead of enhancing the story, they only serve to complicate matters and detract from the core themes and emotional resonance of the original game. I also have no idea what to make of Sephiroth. I'm not opposed to Sephiroth being present, but how they handled it was not something that sat well with me. I will have to say I don't like how heavy they shoved him into the game at almost every point. He was a mysterious figure in the original, and in this one, he pops up way too much to be considered as such. 

So now we know that it is a first part of a Final Fantasy VII Remake Trilogy Project, and I'm not really a fan of that. While the intention was likely to expand on the original game's narrative, the execution feels disjointed and left me with an unsatisfying sense of incompleteness. Instead of delivering a comprehensive and cohesive experience, the episodic format ultimately feels like a cash grab, unnecesarily fragmenting the story. While the game may hold moments of brilliance and nostalgia for fans of the original, it fails to live up to its predecessor's legendary status.

But I guess we will see. Maybe it will be good, once everything comes out.

Also this game is WAY TOO OVERPRICED. When compared to other games of similar length and caliber, the cost feels unjustifiably steep.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I have logged 29 hours so far on this game. Sure, probably not impressive. But I'm a dad, married and have a needy dog. Logging that many hours is a big deal to me because that means I successfully snuck that many hours of gameplay in. So, if you're someone like me that loves video games but has to sneak away at night after the spouse falls asleep and the kids are down for the count after 13 bed time stories, keep on reading.

I bought HLL in lieu of Battlefield 2042. I have logged many years of gameplay on the Battlefield series. But, the reviews came out and I was let down. So, I browsed and browsed for a game to play. I have experience on Squad, liked it, but it wasn't fully drawing me in. Was very complex. A fun game (definitely check it out), but there was so much going on I just couldn't commit. Hell Let Loose is very simliar to squad. So, I'mma break this down as best I can.

What I like: 

o 1 shot 1 kill, for the most part. It's hardcore. Literally. Don't worry about pumping rounds into people's bodies. One shot will do.

o Games can last for 1.5 hours, so you get REALLY into it. You have to, just so the game can end.

o It is extremely well balanced. It doesn't matter if you are level 3 and the other team is level 132. You all get the same guns. Snipers get scopes. That's it. None of this ""oh well in WW2 they had a type of red dot site"" garbage that some games do. Nah, fam. That carbine? Iron sites. That STG-44? Iron sites. That LMG? Iron sites, my guy. Which is great, because that means when you die, it wasn't from some garbage or BS. It was a legitimate kill.

o The community is fantastic. I was so lost when I joined my first server. Had no clue what was going on. I hopped into the ""recon"" squad and was the spotter. Told the dude ""Hey man. First time playing this. What do I do?"" You know what his response was? ""Not a problem man! I'll walk you through it."" This dude literally explained how this game worked for me in one match. It was fantastic. When you join regular infantry squads, I have had the same experience. ""Hey, how do I do nodes? How do I mark things?"" The community has been my favorite part. They're all there to have fun, and they hate toxic individuals. Very rarely do I encounter someone who is toxic. And if they're a dee-eye-see-kay, they usually get booted from the game.

o Are you a tank guy? You like driving around in track vehicles shooting big rounds? You can do that and not get destroyed by a squad full of rocket launcher dudes. Nah, each squad gets 1 person to have an anti tank launcher. Which means it takes coordination and team work to take down armored vehicles. Don't worry, to run a tank? You need 3 people. Everyone plays a role in the tank, not just 1 person. You need driver, gunner and tank commander. So, that helps offset the fact that they're giant beasts and gives the guys on the ground a fighting chance.

There's a couple others, but overall, this game is exactly what I was looking for. Big maps, great graphics, SO MUCH CHAOS oh man the audio! It's insane. Artillery blowing up everywhere, machine guns ripping over your head to where your screen goes blurry and you got the spins like it's St. Patty's Day and you're in Boston.

But overall, it's just the balance of the game. No squad can be overpowering and dominating. No vehicle is overpowering. It's all balanced as it should be, because neither succeed unless everyone works together.

So, if you're like me who's a sort-of-casual-player-but-also-wants-to-be-hardcore, get this game. It's a breath of fresh air from Battlefield, the community is great, and it's nice to play a game where everyone is communicating but also, for the most part, treats each other with respect.

9/10.

It would be a 10/10 but I'm not that great at the game and too prideful to admit that it's actually me who's bad, so I'll blame the game.",logged 29 hour far game sure probably impressive dad married needy dog logging hour big deal mean successfully snuck hour someone love video game sneak night spouse fall asleep kid count 13 bed time story reading bought hll lieu battlefield 2042 logged year battlefield series review browsed browsed game experience squad liked fully drawing complex fun game definitely check commit hell loose simliar squad mma break best 1 shot 1 kill hardcore literally worry pumping round body one shot game last 1 5 hour get game extremely balanced matter 3 team 132 get gun sniper get scope oh ww2 type red dot site garbage game nah fam carbine iron site stg 44 iron site lmg iron site guy great mean die garbage b legitimate kill community fantastic lost joined server clue hopped recon squad spotter told dude hey man time playing response problem man walk dude literally explained game worked one match fantastic join regular infantry squad experience hey node mark thing community favorite fun hate toxic individual rarely encounter someone toxic dee eye kay usually get booted game tank guy driving track vehicle shooting big round get destroyed squad full rocket launcher dude nah squad get 1 person anti tank launcher mean take coordination team work armored vehicle worry tank need 3 everyone play role tank 1 person need driver gunner tank commander help offset giant beast give guy ground fighting chance couple others overall game exactly looking big map great graphic chaos oh man audio insane artillery blowing everywhere machine gun ripping head screen go blurry got spin st patty boston overall balance game squad overpowering dominating vehicle overpowering balanced neither succeed unless everyone work sort casual player want hardcore get game breath fresh air battlefield community great nice game everyone communicating treat respect 9 10 10 10 great game prideful admit bad blame game

1151340,Fallout 76,"This is a great game. But I'm giving it a negative review for one reason:

Not because it was a hot mess on release and it took Bethesda a year and a half to fix it with the Wastelanders update.

Not because Bethesda insisted on only selling it for their own launcher in order to make as much money as possible (the Steam Store takes a cut).

Not because of the Atomic Store, in which you can buy insanely overpriced cosmetics through micro-transactions (in a $40 game, yeah..)

[i]Not even[/i] because the Atomic Store also offers Repair and Scrap kits (i.e. [u]NOT[/u] cosmetics) despite Pete Hines repeatedly promising players that the micro-transactions would be limited to cosmetic items.

But because since release players have been requesting unlimited stash space for junk, and Bethesda have ignored this for more than a year only to offer a monthly subscription allowing you to pay $15 dollars a month [i]for unlimited junk space[/i]. 

Since release the excuse for not giving players unlimited stash space for junk has been that it was not technically possible, that it would crash servers. Fallout 1st proves that that was bullsh*t.

EDIT (~60h): I see a lot of people in the comments misunderstand the review. I'm not asking for unlimited stash space. I'm only asking for unlimited junk storage.

EDIT 2 (~65h): I have subscribed to Fallout 1st. Let's see if this changes my perception of things.

EDIT 3 (~120h): My perception of things has not changed a bit after 50+ hours with Fallout 1st. The scrap box should be free. Maybe even the tent (which serves as an extra camp with a stash and a scrap box, so you always can unload your items if you get overencumbered while exploring). The fact that I could not enjoy the game after 60 hours without Fallout 1st is bad. Really bad.

<EDIT: In light of the games current microtransaction model, I feel compelled to lower my praise of the game on that front. An overwhelming majority of the skins now are tied behind lootboxes, conspicuously the higher quality ones. Even among those that aren't there are time limited events to get those skins, so in addition to gambling we're now exploiting fear of missing out(FOMO). 

I returned to the game to find they had FINALLY given Ares a couple good skins... one I wasn't allowed to get even if I was willing to drop the $100+ dollars to get it... and another restricted to those who spent money on Paladins, a game I don't play. But these couple disappointments would be easy to ignore were this not how majority of skins are handled now. 

I used to go to a gods page, see something I want and pay a reasonable price for it. Now the price to quality ratio on skins has double and even were I willing to pony up... I'm not going to support the psychologically manipulative nonsense that is lootboxes and timed exclusives. These are just flags on my account, the only reason to make getting them complicated is to artificially inflate the value.

This runaround in the cash shop isn't the worst one in gaming.. but it's way past my line, it's way past where the line ever should have gotten to. As such I won't spend any money on the game anymore, even on the rare ocassion there's a straightforward transaction for something I want. I don't want to support what they're doing the majority of the time. I used to be happy to spend a few bucks a month on the game... no more. END EDIT>

If you've got the stomach for objective based multiplayer deathmatch, you should give this a try. For those familiar with MOBAs the structure of the game will be familiar. But for those that don't know, two teams of 5 try to push across a field to each others base, breaking defensive towers on the way, trying to stay alive and make the enemy die. There are other game modes but they mostly sit as variations on this theme. 

What really sets SMITE apart is the way you control your hero. Rather than the awkward click to move and attack system of other MOBAs you move with WASD, and aim your attacks as you would in a shooter, with your mouse. In SMITE 99% of the attacks are skillshots. Dodging is a real tactic, and you do it by moving, not submitting a request to move via your mouse cursor. There are more than enough characters for you to find several you're excited about playing. The game comes to you in layers, as you become comfortable moving around, aiming, and dodging, you begin to see new opportunities to improve. Whether it's making a smart predictive shot through the wall, or suckering an opponent into attacking you when you have a hidden teamate nearby, you'll start to get hype on smart plays, and you'll feel the pressure of avoiding your opponent's in turn. Integration with curse voice is nice, and even if you don't feel like jumping on the mic, there are shortcut keys to make tons of useful communications. This takes some getting used to but you get fast on it.

The game is at it's best in Conquest(the primary mode), but sadly is plagued by the same problem every other MOBA has. There is one map, with one set of objectives. As far as I know Heroes of the Storm is the only game that has bothered offering some variety in the 5v5 queue. I'd like to see them slow down the release of new heroes a bit, and offer some interesting twists in the 5v5 matches.

There is absolutely no pay to win system, and while there's always a lingering balance issue here or there, it's usually not really gamebreaking, and rarely will be enough to stop the better player from winning. You can unlock all the gods through gameplay, and color swaps for thier default skins. That said, the ultimate god pack, unlocks all the gods, current and future, and I strongly recommend it. It's a good way to support the game and it gives you all the toys to play with in your matches. I paid $40 for it, and I ain't even mad. The rest of the cash shop is premium skins and other vanity items, my only gripe in the cash shop are the ""chests"". These are virtual lottery tickets, the kind so popular in eastern free to play models, and some skins and vanity items are exclusive to these tickets. For me personally paying for a digital item is enough, I don't need to pay for a random digital item.

Pros
+Simple, responsive, movement
+All skillshots, aim and win, miss and lose
+~70 Gods to play, with a good range of abilities,
+Good character balance
+Mostly straightforward cash shop, that doesn't blackmail you with pay to win items, and makes it easy to get ALL the characters
+Robust quick communications system built in.
+Geb

-One map(in conquest), OVER AND OVER AND OVER...

899770,Last Epoch,"I wasn't going to buy this title until is came out of early access, but I got a gift card for Christmas and I couldn't resist...

I've played: 
22 years of D2,
2000+ hours of PoE,
1000+ hours of Grim Dawn,
300+ hours in Wolcen and more.

This is easily the best title in the genre.
I'm 25h into the game so far, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. Unlike similar games, going through the beginning stages of the game does not feel like a grind. Leveling and developing a build feels exciting and is part of the experience, rather than something to get through.

The crafting system is gold. It doesn't rely on pure luck like PoE, so you're not going to spend tons of materials on crafting something just to end up with nothing useful and no materials.
There is some luck involved, but often times you can choose what stats you'll be adding to an item. It's simple enough to get into as a Newby, but complex enough to be engaging and exciting as you become more experienced.

The skills are awesome.
I went full lightning mage.
I feel like a thunder god!
Every skill has a skill tree and can be changed and augmented in a ton of different ways. I also like that the game encourages you to use more than 1 ability as a primary ability, without nerfing the usability of any of the skills. My current set up has a lightning nova skill for AoEing big packs, chain lightning as a single target DPS skill - chaining multiple times on a single target and adding a ton of shock stacks, a teleport skill that triggers lightning nova, a static charge skill that passively triggers Chain lightnings, and fireward which gives me ward (think temporary energy shield), plus a myriad of damage and defensive buffs for several seconds.
My whole screen is lightning pew pew and exploding baddies.

The game isn't complete yet and it shows. There are a few bugs and some class masteries aren't released. I still think it's worth every penny.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"This is my favorite game that I can't recommend. I love this game, as my playtime will tell, and I will continue to pour more hours into this game. I'm not giving a negative review because of the game's ""fun factor."" It's very destressing, it's chill, its difficulty is all in the hands of the players. The modding scene is great, and the creative possibilities are infinite. On paper, the Sims 4 seems like the dream game. A perfect game that even people who have literally never touched a game before in their life can pick up and play. In reality, EA has erected a massive series of walls that you have to scale to reach that state, and this is the crux of the review. The ultimate problem is, and is the whole reason I'm giving this a negative review, is recommending people to buy this game because of the aforementioned walls. To say that they have become untenable is an understatement. They are nigh insurmountable at this point.

The first wall, and this is the point where most people stop at, is the pricing. It being free-to-play as of October 18th does not save this from being HORRIDLY expensive through DLC cost. The base Sims 4 with no expansions or packs, makes the game EXTREMELY limited in scope as to what you can do. Want to be a spellcaster? Want to attend university? Have cats or dogs?  Have changing seasons in the weather? Form clubs? Get famous? Have a job? That's ALL locked behind DLC that is either the same price as the base game, or, get this, DOUBLE the price of the base game. All those things I listed? Those are SEPARATE DLCs! If you were to not get them on sale, it would run you a couple HUNDRED already! And this just getting started. On the store page, as I'm typing this right now, it lists 56 different DLC, and to buy them all in one fell swoop costs just short of a THOUSAND  dollars. Nobody in their right mind should make that investment, and I can't be of the mind to tell someone to spend that much on a single game.

Now, to play Devil's Advocate for a moment, this is only as bad if you buy it when it isn't on sale, which the game goes on quite frequently. Deep sales, in fact! Up to 75% a lot of things, which bring down the price for everything by a couple hundred dollars. In fact, with the Summer Sale that's coming up as of the time of writing this review, this game will most likely get significant price slashes. However, to counter that point, the asking price is still SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. The prices become more manageable, but it is still a SIGNIFICANT investment. More of an investment than, frankly, I think this game deserves. And considering how Sims 3 with everything still costs such an outrageous amount, it would seem that those prices aren't going anywhere for the time being. 

If a high asking price was all that kept people away, I suppose you could argue the point that not recommending a game you like because of pricing is silly. That if you put hundreds of hours in like I have, the price is ""worth it."" Perhaps that argument would have grounds and I would entertain it, if not for the fact that the game in of itself just fundamentally DOES NOT WORK with everything combined. These are the other walls, and this can become overwhelming for the inexperienced. Even if you buy everything and you jump in, the Sims 4 is a strange program that seemingly randomly decides to brick itself every so often, without you even really being the cause of it. There are so many bugs and glitches that have no fixes for it, merely ways to temporarily relieve of you of it, much like ibuprofen for a headache. And they aren't the silly, funny glitches  seen in Skyrim. 

For example, randomly, the game will begin to run under 30 frames after exiting build mode, and you solve it by merely pausing the game and unpausing it. Not a terrible bug but it's pretty much the epitome of the problems I have with this game: everything is just player made solutions rather than an official bug fix. It will happen again, and instead of just fixing it, EA just tells you what you can do to help yourself with it. You'll be doing this often, spending hours looking up some obscure error, through no fault of your own, because either Sims 4 randomly decides to brick your Resources.cfg after update and makes it impossible for you to play with CC of any kinds, or your anti virus somehow marks this entire game as potential ransomware, or the Sims 4 randomly just corrupt your save file and you're trying to figure out how to fix that. And that's just on the meta side of everything.

File headaches aside, the game itself just acts wonky as well, adding its own walls to scale. A cursory glance at the reviews for the DLCs illustrate the absolute nightmares that spawn with these additions, but I'll share some of the errors I've had on my end. I've had multiple instances where I tell a Sim to fulfill their hygiene need and their immediate first instinct is to...run out and clean a solar panel? In place of just taking a shower in one of the MULTIPLE showers that exist in that house? I tell them to fulfill their energy need, thinking they'll go to bed, and they'll either randomly decide to back float in the pool, or drink an incredibly irresponsible amount of coffee, like a third shift worker going off of only three hours of sleep.  Fixed all of this by manually telling them what to do. I've also had moments where I couldn't wash laundry because the game bugged out my washer and dryer, where the prompts for washing never came up. Only the prompts for putting the dirty laundry in and taking the dirty laundry out. Fixed by selling the set and then buying another. I've also had my weather permanently glitch itself into never changing at all. Where it snows all through winter and all through spring, causing me to have to buy a weather changing device in game and use it. Sims will randomly drop whatever they are doing to do some unrelated task, such as stop cooking to randomly mold some hunk of clay sitting in some corner of the room. Sometimes, my Sims will also stand still with the ""chat with (sim)"" action in the queue, but then never actually chat with that person,, for whatever reason, causing them to bug ouit and need them to be reset. The list goes on and on, and I think you've gotten the point already.

Again, these are fixed by just manually selecting actions, using console commands, and removing the bugged items in question. I know what you're thinking. Why are you complaining about bugs that have an in game solution? The issue is, again, that this is just player solutions for problems that aren't being fixed. You're paying hundreds of dollars for this game and the DLC. You'd expect a level of polish to behind this, but there isn't. Players shouldn't have to actively fight against a game they bought, only to find a bunch of band-aid, player made solutions a because the FEATURES IN GAME THEY PAID HUNDREDS FOR DOESN'T WORK AND EA DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO FIX THEM. 

It's all the same hackneyed excuse of ""there being so much in this game"" and sounding like they are some small game dev studio. All of this frustration after the ludicrous pay wall is just simply unforgivable, and to recommend people this game knowing the hours worth of troubleshooting and fixing I've had to do is like to encourage self destructive tendencies. I made the investment, I bought the steam edition to make a review. I sunk a lot both in time and money, and have got to a point where I can say I enjoy this game, perhaps through Sunken Cost reasoning and Stockholm Syndrome. But it required me having to scale multiple walls and slaying multiple beasts to get there, and that's just simply not a journey for everyone. I cannot look at someone and genuinely tell them to make the same investments I have, nor do I think EA should benefit from having people do so.

236390,War Thunder,"As a player who's been playing since the beginning of Raining Fire (released September 2020) I'm proud and disappointed at the same time of this game.

When I first started playing, my dreams weren't focused on the F-4E or MiG-21 variants. I stuck to the US tech tree, and the thought of just strafing ground targets in a SBD-3 as you fly low to the ground was neverending fun for me. I wasn't trying to go grind for top tier jets, I just wanted to have fun with what I had.

New Power came (November 2020) and I think that's where this game started to go downhill. New premium jets were being added alongside standard jets, and, as time went on, I started to change my mindset to grind for jets. That's where my problems begin.

I can applaud the developers for modeling every single aircraft, but i'm not happy because of the grind. Youtube channels rumored a F2P player to finish a tech tree within a year - if they were lucky.

Now, you may be wondering ""why did he give this game a thumbs up if i was going to talk bad about it?"" ""what went wrong?"" 

I gave it a thumbs up because it has the potential to be one of the best combat games out there. Thousands of vehicles, a nice community (no-one really complains about losing or anything or ranting about (X) jet from my experience) the developers are working hard in the midst of the pandemic, and more.

Now, here's the current problems with War Thunder.
1 - The grind is almost unbearable if you have a F2P (Free 2 Play) account

I've tried to grind the US tree with standard planes alone, but that was extremely hard to a point where I felt the need to buy premium vehicles/bonuses/time.


2 - The system is designed to pressure you into spending cash

Although this is classified as a ""con"", the true reason for Gaijin to do this could be because War Thunder is a free game. Because of this, they have to make packs/vehicles/premium currency a thing so that way they can maintain the servers and keep the game alive. Without cash, they can't manage the servers. Without servers, they can't manage the game because the servers can't be used. Without managing the game, War Thunder will slowly die.


3 - Vehicles in Rank IV or V and onward tend to have extremely high repair costs, crew trains, research requirements, and high purchase costs

If you managed to grind a rank V vehicle, you still have to play games in order to get enough currency (Silver Lions) for the vehicle purchase. If you have enough, you still have to deal with a Crew Train (doesn't cost as much as purchase) though poor management of currency can lead you to have extremely low amounts of Silver Lions.


4 - The game needs to decompress

If you never played the game before and don't know what I mean by this, tanks and aircraft have this system called ""Battle Rating"". They are divided into said battle ratings which fit them best. Currently, the game has stopped at Battle Rating 10.7 for tanks and aircraft (ships at 6.0/6.3). 

However, the problems start when the developers add more modern aircraft, and, if they don't decompress soon, players may have to deal with F-15s (if they ever get added), F-16s, Su-25s, etc as a F-100 who was unlucky enough to get put in a Battle Rating 10.7 game. F-100s were made in the '50s. 
They could face aircraft made decades after them 
(all the vehicles mentioned in this portion of the review were made in the 70's except for the F-100)


5 - The team needs to advertise their game better

If you don't know what I mean, almost all of the ads shown featuring War Thunder always have a top-tier tank, plane, or helicopter (top-tier in the community means modern-day vehicles or similar). 
So imagine someone seeing these ads, saying ""oh what a cool M1 Abrams! i can't wait to download and play with it!"" and then downloading the game and realizing that instead of a M1 Abrams, they get a M3 Stuart, a World War 2 era vehicle. 
They then see a M1 in the US tech tree, but come to the realization that they will have to go through hours of struggling, grinding, getting enough currency for the vehicle, only to finally get a M1 Abrams that they will have to use at one of the most dreaded battle ratings of the game.


If the game developers fixed some of the issues here, that would improve the quality of their game by a lot. War Thunder has the true potential of being one of the best combat games out there, but the developers don't seem to be trying to fix the current issues, which, if fixed, could have the game be a lot better and live up to it's old status of being one of the best combat games.

Would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what goes on within. 
If you want to stick to 'low tier',  where it's mostly fun (no grind, no high repair costs, etc) you can, and if you want to play this game for the sole purpose of having fun with early World War Two tanks, planes, or ships, this game would be great for you.

That's all I have to say for now about this game.

Update (5/21/2021):
With Update 2.7 (Red Skies) introduced via trailers and videos from content creators (it's not out just yet), I have taken a look at the dev server streams and saw that they have fixed quite a few things. Thus, I may do a revised review of the game, though not until the game updates to Update 2.7, because we can't judge books by their cover.",player playing beginning raining fire released september 2020 proud disappointed time game started playing dream focused f 4e mig 21 variant stuck tech tree thought strafing ground target sbd 3 fly low ground neverending fun trying grind top tier jet wanted fun power november 2020 game started downhill premium jet added alongside standard jet time started mindset grind jet problem applaud developer modeling single aircraft happy grind youtube channel rumored f2p player finish tech tree year lucky wondering game thumb talk bad wrong gave thumb potential one best combat game thousand vehicle nice community one complains losing ranting x jet experience developer working hard midst pandemic current problem war thunder 1 grind almost unbearable f2p 2 account tried grind tree standard plane alone extremely hard felt need premium vehicle bonus time 2 designed pressure spending cash classified con true reason gaijin war thunder game make pack vehicle premium currency thing maintain server game alive cash manage server server manage game server managing game war thunder slowly die 3 vehicle rank iv v onward tend extremely high repair cost crew train research requirement high purchase cost managed grind rank v vehicle game order get enough currency silver lion vehicle purchase enough deal crew train cost purchase poor management currency lead extremely low amount silver lion 4 game need decompress game mean tank aircraft called battle rating divided said battle rating fit best currently game stopped battle rating 10 7 tank aircraft ship 6 0 6 3 problem developer add modern aircraft decompress soon player deal f 15 ever get added f 16 su 25 etc f 100 unlucky enough get battle rating 10 7 game f 100 50 face aircraft decade vehicle mentioned portion review 70 except f 100 5 team need advertise game mean almost ad shown featuring war thunder top tier tank plane helicopter top tier community mean modern vehicle similar imagine someone seeing ad saying oh cool m1 abrams wait download downloading game realizing m1 abrams get m3 stuart world war 2 era vehicle m1 tech tree realization hour struggling grinding getting enough currency vehicle finally get m1 abrams one dreaded battle rating game game developer fixed issue improve quality game war thunder true potential one best combat game developer trying fix current issue fixed game live old status one best combat game recommend game yes go stick low tier mostly fun grind high repair cost etc game sole purpose fun early world war two tank plane ship game great game 5 21 2021 2 7 red sky introduced via trailer video content creator taken look dev server stream saw fixed thing revised review game game update 2 7 judge book cover

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Disclaimer: I survivor main. 

I play games for fun, not for competition, so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps, oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately, hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops), and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with), then no biggie. Next game please~

I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.

As a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up - there is always the next game :)

That being said, this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it, have fun with it, and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ;) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine - just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!), and even then, recognize that there are jerks who play this game, like any other game, and have fun while you compete!",disclaimer survivor main game fun competition dbd community get get bad killer face camp oh die move next game get good killer find immediately hook bc juke whoop patrol camp 100 ok biggie next game please community salt killer come dealing rank one survivor game properly flash killer face legitimate strategy take fun game opinion killer horrible one called name survivor tell get gud older player ruin newer player player 1000 hour relax fun game pip next game said game crazy fun saltiness community buying game grab fun ignore hard time fixate ranking process unless absurdly highly competitive reason fine push spout anger recognize jerk game game fun compete

440,Team Fortress 2,"In a land a long, long time ago, Team Fortress 2 would be a critically acclaimed first person shooter. Boasting its colorful characters against the dreary palette of the Badlands, this game offered to many a wonderful experience. Later updates would add cosmetics, weapons, and a ton of other things to sink your teeth into. Some of those updates are not as well viewed by the community as others, like the addition of crazier and crazier hats. In recent years, the community has felt somewhat negatively towards the team of developers and their updates for this game. Though, there is something important to remember...

We first saw those deranged mercenaries nearly a decade ago! This game has been alive and kicking for a long time, and I doubt that you will soon see a day where these mercs aren't defying laws of physics, common sense, and sometimes all laws in general. You won't find many other games with a soviet in love with a 300 pound minigun that he just lugs around like it's nothing. Nor will you find a quick-witted, caffeine-fueled Bostonian who dances around the battlefield, dodging rockets and bullets like a madman. This game is very outlandish, and incredibly enjoyable. Even after years and years of pushing a payload down a track to blow up the enemies... people want to come back, because although there's some basis and objectives for the game modes, you never play the same game twice. Every match is a total surprise. Even competitively, the 9 classes and variety in what you can play with, it will give you a new experience nearly every time you play.

Years of pushing a cart filled to the brim with explosives is a hard task. Thankfully, there are new faces, hats to wear, weapons to try, and a new experience to be had every single day.",land long long time ago team fortress 2 critically acclaimed person shooter boasting colorful character dreary palette badlands game offered wonderful experience update add cosmetic weapon ton thing sink teeth update viewed community others addition crazier crazier hat recent year community felt somewhat negatively towards team developer update game important remember saw deranged mercenary nearly decade ago game alive kicking long time doubt soon mercs defying law physic common sense sometimes law general game soviet love 300 pound minigun lug quick witted caffeine fueled bostonian dance battlefield dodging rocket bullet madman game outlandish incredibly enjoyable year year pushing payload track blow enemy basis objective game mode game twice match total surprise competitively 9 class variety experience nearly time year pushing cart filled brim explosive hard task thankfully face hat wear weapon experience single

1203620,Enshrouded,"After 22 hours, I don't recommend playing Enshrouded [i]yet[/i]. The game has lots of potential, but several kinks and growing pains to work out. Here are some of my thoughts divided into specific categories: 

--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Exploration: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]The world feels a little hollow and empty. Too many open and winding roads with no POIs, enemy NPCs, or interesting ""hey what's that?"" The world needs more density.

[*]Many building types are copy-pasted and have the same layout. I'm surprised many people aren't mentioning this because New World got obliterated for this same thing. Once you've seen a tomb/basement/decrepit house/campsite, you've seen them all.

[*]The ancient spires, which have a 'Legend of Zelda dungeon crawler with puzzles"" feel to them, are very simple and lack challenge. Hopefully they'll add more difficult puzzles in later spires.

[*]You can simply break down doors that require switches, thus bypassing the puzzle altogether.

[*]While a neat concept, clearing a shrouded area and chopping the giant red shroud root becomes tedious after the 2nd time. They are not unique enough at this stage in the game, containing all the same enemies, aesthetics, and gameplay. Again, once you've seen one, you've seen them all and unfortunately Enshrouded currently locks skill points behind clearing them, making them more or less mandatory. I'd like to see this system improved upon by adding in some of the puzzle systems from the ancient spires.

[*]The large overworld map lacks essential details like bridge locations/decals once discovered. This should be painted into the base artwork of the map. The map also doesn't differentiate between biomes. The map only shows verticality and important POIs like shrines and quest areas.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Combat and Enemies: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]Though simple, the combat feels responsive and fluid. All weapon types appear viable based on damage numbers.

[*]The skill tree is fun and offers unique gameplay experiences, but leaves me wanting more. I look forward to seeing this expanded.

[*]PvE and AI are incredibly underwhelming and simple. They often cycle between one or two attack animations, including special boss enemies.

[*]There aren't enough mob types currently. After exploring the playable areas in EA, you'll find the same enemy types scattered throughout. The ones that currently exist, look nice and polished.

[*]What enemy NPCs lack in mechanical depth, they grossly overcompensate in numbers and are overtuned. Even with food buffs and a tankier build, some enemies will still 1HKO, even if they are couple levels below. 

[*]While I'm sure a bug, enemies will often get stuck underground or on terrain. 

[*]There is no CC or stagger protection after a certain point. Meaning if you get swarmed or cornered, you can easily be chain staggered to death.

[*]Dodge rolling doesn't roll through enemies due to collision, meaning if you're cornered you'll likely be staggered to death.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Loot: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]Enshrouded commits the greatest cardinal sin when it comes to loot: You can find epic and legendary quality items early on, only to replace them with an uncommon green a couple of levels later. Often the raw damage upgrade is far better than the minor perks from upgrading a lower-level legendary weapon. It NEVER feels good to move from a unique legendary with a cool model to a common green because of numbers. Epic and legendary weapons should be saved for end-game PvE and crafting.

[*]Looting items can add them to your hotbar with no option to toggle this off.

[*]Loot often feels underwhelming. I feel like after 22 hours, I've seen 95% of the possible loot drops. At this stage, it feels like Diablo where I'm waiting for a specific weapon to drop at higher quality for the extra upgrade slot.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Crafting: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]Crafting is fine. What you'd expect from a crafting survival RPG, is not bad, but nothing inventive either. 

[*]Crafted gear options look nice and function well.

[*]The game offers a ""craft from chests"" system by requiring items be placed in specific ""magical chests"", making other chest types completely obsolete. This feels redundant and should be the baseline for any chest.

[*]You can't salvage gear you've outgrown. Giving back at least a small amount of materials like cloth or metal scraps would feel better than simply being forced to delete the item.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Other: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]I experienced very few technical issues.

[*]UI can be confusing and tedious with so many windows to cycle through trying to figure out what you're looking for.
 
[*]Gliding is quite fun and needed for a map with so much verticality.

[*]Fall damage is VERY unforgiving, sliding down a slope means taking massive damage once you finish sliding.

[*]The friendly crafting NPCs are slightly annoying, especially the blacksmith who is constantly berating you.

[*]Sound design is excellent.

[*]You can roll up a steep hill, while helpful, looks very unintended and goofy.

[*]Mining sulfur yields WAY too much EXP. Sulfur instantly breaks and yields 10EXP per swing. Within minutes ~level 10, mining sulfur leveled me up. I did this for several levels, as the EXP rate from mining sulfur felt more efficient than exploring and killing NPCs at my appropriate level.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[b] TLDR; [/b] The game lacks density, difficulty, and depth. It needs more time to cook in the oven and needs to greatly improve upon it's selection of enemies and their combat. I don't feel incentivized to explore, as even the later areas in EA share many of the same loot tables and gear drops from early areas.

This game isn't bad, but I wouldn't say it's great either. Right now I'd rate it a 5/10. I'd say wait at least 6-12 months before investing time and money into Enshrouded. I will revisit my review as the game updates.

--------------------------------------------

Edit: Grammar

Edit #2: In response to some comments, these are my observations and primarily a list of things that came to mind as I was playing over the 22 hours. You're welcome to like the game in it's current state, and I certainly don't [i]dislike[/i] the game, however that doesn't mean I feel its recommendable as is. I love this style of game and would love for it to succeed. I have no problem supporting the game in EA and expect some hiccups, bumps, and incomplete gameplay. That doesn't excuse it from criticism as it's still a product that I paid for. Nothing I saw in Enshrouded seemed particularly unique to make it stand out from other competitors in the market. This is primarily the reason I rated it a 5/10, as it feels middle-of-the-road in it's current state. I have played many games in EA, and most get better over time as development continues.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"This game is good but it's far from ideal.

Pros:
- amazing interactive while you create your character (with choosing the wand, patronus and faculty)
- very interesting fights. You should use different spells for different enemies, blocks\conter attacks. You can use the elements of the environment in the fight. Interesting animations of spells. You always need to play on the keyboard like on the piano. It's 10\10
- Hogwarts Castle is breathtaking. It's alive, you meet students who do different things (trying to cast spells, craft potions, read books, or a lot of other things). You meet familiar places from movies and books, you find tons of secrets and easter eggs. Hogwarts is amazing
- Some side activities in the game are interesting (like beasts hunting, finding secrets, plant growing)

But what should be improved for becoming a legendary game:
-add more types of the enemy. You enter the dungeon and you know that you will face spiders and in the end you will see the boss - troll or big spider. It's boring and after 3-4 dungeons you no longer want to go into them. People and goblins have different classes, but they are still the same types of enemies. You can add bogarts, wervolves, vampires, some magical creatures etc
-Useless loot. All loot in chests is coins or equipment items. But the problem is that by the middle of the game, you will already have enough equipment to complete the game to the end. And there are no unique items or sets in the game. Because of this, you lose interest in exploring locations and dungeons, because you will either find useless glasses or gloves that will be worse than yours. In addition, the price for them is low and it makes no sense to even collect them for sale. It would be much more interesting to look for some unique Hogwarts sets, Deathly Hallows, or some cool wands with unique abilities. Unfortunately, this is not the case, all things are the same and differ only in skin and armor or attack indicators.
-Strange economics in the game. You don't want to find some rare beasts or loot because it cost like one portion of the healing potion) The rare phoenix which is alone on the map costs the same as Niffler which you can find in any place on the map.
- all of the above make the Hogwarts Legacy world investigation boring and trivial. You don't want to go to the cave because you wouldn't be rewarded for this.",game good far ideal pro amazing interactive create choosing wand patronus faculty interesting fight different spell different enemy block conter attack element environment fight interesting animation spell need keyboard piano 10 10 hogwarts castle breathtaking alive meet student different thing trying cast spell craft potion read book thing meet familiar place movie book ton secret easter egg hogwarts amazing side activity game interesting beast hunting finding secret plant growing improved legendary game add type enemy enter dungeon face spider bos troll big spider boring 3 4 dungeon longer goblin different class type enemy add bogart wervolves vampire magical creature etc useless loot loot chest coin equipment item problem middle game already enough equipment complete game unique item set game lose interest exploring location dungeon useless glass glove worse addition price low make sense collect sale interesting look unique hogwarts set deathly hallows cool wand unique ability unfortunately case thing differ skin armor attack indicator strange economics game rare beast loot cost one portion healing potion rare phoenix alone map cost niffler place map make hogwarts legacy world investigation boring trivial cave rewarded
1203620,Enshrouded,"Completed the game in a group of 4 people (finished all quests).
General impressions and information regarding the content for Early Access:
-Level cap at level 25. After reaching level 25, you receive 0 XP, which can demotivate further grinding, but it takes time to reach it.
-Altar cap at level 6. The last Altar unlocks a very small section of the desert biome where enemies can be level 30.
-The winter biome is unavailable in early access.
-The surrounding fauna changes depending on the biome, but enemies or mini-bosses not (I'm talking about bandit camps. It would be nice to see diversity in this aspect in the future).
-Temples of the Sun, etc., add a very interesting puzzle aspect to the game, giving depth and a pleasant feeling of exploration.
-Waiting for some resources to craft can take 10 minutes, which I believe artificially extends the game time.
-Boss fights are often engaging and give off a very Soulslike atmosphere due to the difficulty level and combat system.
-The building system is enjoyable, although initially it may seem clunky.
-Lack of ability to change enchants or enchant armor. Considering how rarely we are able to find new equipment (not talking about crafting), such a feature should be available, and I also hope this will change in the future.
-Exploring the map is fun. Finding villages, resources, interesting locations creates the impression that behind every hill, we can discover some interesting point. The world definitely gives the impression of authenticity.
-The lack of physics when cutting down trees or destroying surfaces can detract from immersion.
-Skill tree could offer better and more useful skills.

Despite numerous flaws or unmet expectations in several areas, for an early access game and at a reasonable price, I consider it worth recommending for those who enjoy games like Valheim. There are clear inspirations from Dark Souls, Zelda, and Valheim, but this does not hinder the game from delivering fun. I don't remember the last time any survival game has hooked me enough to play it for three days straight.

It's worth supporting this game at this stage, it's fun a can be much better in future.

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"Its a pretty fun Looter Shooter with interesting gimmicks going on for it, but bogged down by repetive missions and endgame.

Gameplay:
Honestly the best part of the game, the moment to moment gunplay in battles feels amazing. Every character handles very differently even though they use mostly the same weapons, because of their travel abilities, the game gets VERY hectic on higher difficulties and you have to constantly on the move. Guns feel good and punchy, abilities feel really cool when they oblitiriate a group of grunts and the overall gameplay feels really unique with all the arcadey effects going on. I can't think of a game that feels quite like this.

Loot:
The loot has some really interestign aspects here, first of all there are no level requirements or gear level, if you find a legendary gun in hour 1, it can still be used pretty much as well in hour 40. Speaking of legendary effects, many of them really feel like you could make a build just around them, the effects are interesting and you unlock more legos when you go up in difficulty tiers.

Story:
The main story was there, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Best part of the writing was all of the banter going on, and multiple long running jokes from the start to the end. I was almost constantly smiling listening to the characters talking, but it also wasn't a story just about jokes, i found them to be mixed in really well.

Endgame: I'm still going through the endgame after leveling all launch classes to max level. The loop seems to be: Do short missions in open world to get currency, and use the currency to open a map into a 5-10 minute missions with loads of enemies and good loot. This is where the repetetion comes in, i have 4 missions unlocked, and they are always same ones, only with some different modifiers depending on RNG and difficulty setting.

Final thoughts:
I like the game, but i understand a lot of the critisism for it too, some of it is really blown out of proportion, but there is really fair critisism going on too. I wouldn't give it a 5/10, maybe 6 or 6.5 currently. Its really fun, but i don't think there is currently enough content to go around. We'll see how the first season does. I hope that the game survives for a long time and becomes better with age, but we will see what the future brings.",pretty fun looter shooter interesting gimmick bogged repetive mission endgame honestly best game moment moment gunplay battle feel amazing handle differently mostly weapon travel ability game get hectic higher difficulty constantly move gun feel good punchy ability feel cool oblitiriate group grunt overall feel unique arcadey effect game feel loot loot interestign aspect requirement gear legendary gun hour 1 pretty hour 40 speaking legendary effect feel make build effect interesting unlock lego difficulty tier story main story bad great best writing banter multiple long running joke almost constantly smiling listening character talking story joke found mixed endgame endgame leveling launch class max loop short mission open world get currency currency open map 5 10 minute mission load enemy good loot repetetion come 4 mission unlocked one different modifier depending rng difficulty setting final thought game understand critisism blown proportion fair critisism 5 10 maybe 6 6 5 currently fun currently enough content season hope game survives long time age future brings

[list]
      [*] [b]The community can be toxic as hell. There's three basic types of toxicity.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] New players who are uninformed (not your fault) who do things the community considers bad manners.
            [*] Experienced perfectionists.
            [*] People who enjoy other's suffering.

      [*] [b]Higher learning curve than some expect. [/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Learning survivor and killer perks is important regardless of what you main.
            [*] Common tactics to avoid getting downed or looped.
            [*] Prioritization/situational awareness. Where is everyone, what are they doing, what should you be doing?.
            [*] Community slang.
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]Matchmaking leaves a lot to be desired. [/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Inexperienced paired with experienced... but in a ""one gets dunked on"" arrangement, not teaching.

      [*] [b]DLC characters can be unlocked through gameplay.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] It takes 9000 iridescent shards, which are gained through leveling one's account up.
            [*] The Shrine of Secrets changes every week, and potentially has perks from DLC characters available. 
            [*] Folks who can't afford DLC can still get the characters & perks.
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]Friends not required but make experience better.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] No in-game voice chat for survivors, some use Discord instead. 
            [*] In-game emotes used to communicate, as well as crouching. 
            [*] Relatively easy to find new friends if you're nice, most people who play survivor want full SWF crews.

---------------------------------------

[h1]UPDATE (May 28 2021):[/h1]

[list]
      [*] [b]New content is still being released![/b]

      [olist]
            [*] More mechanics are being added to the game, which changes how survivors play. Ex: Zombies being added in the R.E. chapter (in Player Test Build at the time of this update). 
            [*] Some cosmetics can be purchased with shards, unlocked through game-play, or redeemed via codes released by BHVR.
            [*] Periodic events. Currently, there's an event to find Gnome Chompski once the exit gates are powered. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]Map and graphical updates.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] The game generally looks a lot better now.
            [*] Multiple variants of maps.
            [*] Maps tend to be smaller now, which can be both good and bad. Gens feel closer together but that also applies to hooks. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]The Rift[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] A battle pass has been added to the game.
            [*] Auric cells (paid currency) are part of the reward system- if you complete the Rift you actually get your money back!
            [*] Players are rewarded with cosmetics, lore (The Archives), and various forms of in-game currency. 
            [*] Challenges from the Rift add an extra layer of fun (or psychological distress and anguish) to matches. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]Matchmaking... Again[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Queue times are substantially faster for survivors in the morning than in the afternoon/evening.
            [*] I'm a filthy survivor main heathen, so I can only assume that means killer queue times are better in the afternoon/evening. 
            [*] Still occasionally end up in lobbies that are very unbalanced or entirely unfair, but it's better than it used to be. 
            [*] There's a lot more player consistency in terms of skill, but also toxicity, in higher ranks. 
            [*] If you want to meme and enjoy, the higher ranks tend to be very serious... 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]HIT BOXES MAKE ME CRY.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] This is just a game.
            [*] Please, self... It's just a game...
            [*] [i]Sobbing intensifies.[/i]
            [*] In all seriousness though, the hit boxes need some improvement. Lag, frame-perfect timing, and other aspects all influence whether the hatchet hits your face or clips through your face. 
            [*] I may be a survivor main, but if a Huntress nails me across the map, I'm impressed with the shot and outraged on the killer's behalf if it doesn't register. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]What accessibility options?[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Changing the struggle phase on hook to a series of skill checks was a huge improvement in terms of accessibility for wider audiences. 
            [*] An option to suppress screen flashing effects or toggle an alternate view for them would be helpful. A fade-in, solid color, then fade-out screen aura might be a good option for this? It would preserve visual information without giving an 'unfair advantage' to players.
            [*] For the record, players with disabilities just wanna grind for bloodpoints and cry like everyone else. If your primary concern is giving players an 'unfair advantage,' please remember that accessibility options compensate for a set-back so that people with disabilities have an even playing field. 
      [/olist]
[/list]

[h1]I'd say that the changes boost my rating to a 9/10, but the hit box issues can definitely make this game feel like a 2/10.[/h1]

To BHVR, if they ever stumble their way into this review: 
The new content is great but please look into hit registration and hit boxes. Accessibility options for a wide range of players would also be highly appreciated [i]and[/i] it would increase audience reach and profitability. Keep up the good work.

230410,Warframe,"[h1]Update (24/4/14):[/h1] It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had. 

The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind.

Multiple new game modes exist, including ""Invasion"", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission.

The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat.

The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy.

In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new ""EVE Online""-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard.

[h1]Original Review (25/11/13)[/h1]

A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole.

Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. 

Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. 

Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character.

So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a ""community effort"" in which everyone can participate.

The only ""issue"" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games ""premium"" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. 

The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its ""free to play"" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds.

Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.",24 4 14 fairly significant chunk time wrote review warframe element game expanded way alleviate issue originally premium currency platinum traded player provides option player wish money game participate storefront user comment pointed powerful item available store need grind multiple game mode exist including invasion mode allows player team corpus grineer work opposing faction mode give player agency kind reward receives completing mission latest introduced melee 2 0 delivered improvement game melee combat interesting come form dark sector clan alliance part solar fight contested ownership clan alliance set tax resource requirement access conquered territory leading territorial battle supremacy conclusion decent content added game core argument review hold true warframe finally approaching depth required elevate mere grinding game eve online esque sector mechanic particularly promising regard hr original review 25 11 13 great looking initially interesting game feel one compelling greater warframe interesting entry space look begin feel lacking substance largely involves clearing various mission type progress rank leveling weapon warframe game metaphor various class unique ability advantage disadvantage shoot myriad alien grineer infested horde corpus robot mission range rescue scenario hostage located escorted safety mobile defense mission wave increasingly difficult enemy held protect moving objective completed solo interesting grouping player higher mission tricky teaming attractive proposition weapon warframes augmented various modifcations apply standard action fare elemental damage bonus increased critical damage faster reload speed name allows diversity player opt build warframe supportive role stock mod provide tanky far game supported semi regular content update special event usually form warframes weapon community effort everyone participate issue game bit grind complete grinding game main reason mission hope accumulating various material craft warframes weapon game premium currency expedite process manufacturing said item hour day real time craft simply outright storefront weapon warframes grind efficiently material strike monotonous loop extent joy go allievating game total bore inevitably tired treadmill game sometimes feel skirting boundary gross nature certainly get almost everything game spending willing commit grind sometimes feel game system designed encourage bring wallet namely sheer material required craft equipment time spent waiting item built questionable f2p game includes long timer alongside button make pound ultimately looking good looking nice playing third person shooter online component decent aesthetic far worse warframe spending time wind wishing little experience currently available

899770,Last Epoch,"I recommend the game to any ARPG fan, but it's a ""mild"" recommendation for now. The game has a lot in it, and definitely worth playing, but as I reached the endgame, some things started to bother me more and more. Below, I'll talk about three biggest issues I have with the game, but please keep in mind, as an Early Access game, things might change; I hope they'll change. 

[h1]Map Variety[/h1]
Last Epoch has no procedural map generation. In the endgame, the ""Monolith""s you choose will often feature the same subset of maps, along with same subset of enemy archetypes. You'll face similar enemies on the same maps over and over in other words. Sometimes, you get to play on the same map that you've just finished. 

In my opinion, in ARPGs, a map is a canvas, and having a different canvas' each time keeps things fresh by putting you under an illusion that keeps your mind away from the idea of you doing a repetitive task over and over. This is certainly not the case in this game. 

A proper procedural map generation is urgently needed in short. Without it, I get burnt out rather fast, and it could be the same case for you as well. Other aspects of the game has been keeping me from feeling the burnout so far, but I'm afraid I'll buckle before reaching 100+ hours just because of this reason alone. I've started making other characters to keep myself interested further.

[h1]Endgame: Monoliths, Echoes[/h1]
I like the base endgame, you select a monolith (storyline) that is available to you, and essentially design your own maps as you progress through echoes (maps). After each echo, you are given two options to pick from, which adds a modifier to the enemies, and may last a few echoes, stacking the difficulty up. I really like it. However...

At the end of the monoliths, you get to choose one blessing among three, and these blessings are drawn from their own pool, and has a power rating attached to them. They could be simple drop rate boosts, to a vital stat improvements that'll enhance your build. You need to complete 3 quest echoes, and while the first few monoliths are easy, the later ones require you to maybe go through 30 echoes in order to finish a monolith, or even more as encountering a quest echo is chance based.

The problem with this is, if you were after these blessings, you only get a chance after a long patience, and are at the mercy of the RNGesus to get a blessing you want with a good roll. If we could improve our blessings somehow; like incrementally raising their power roll for each completion, it wouldn't be a big issue for me as the long wait would yield something rewarding. But right now, the reward for completing a monolith could be extremely unsatisfying.

I hear you asking; is the game about loot, or is it about blessings? Well, blessings are part loot in essence, but let me stop being a smartass for a second. It is of course about the loot, further enhancing your character at the core. And the next part is dedicated to the itemization & crafting, specificly in the endgame.

[h1]Itemization & Crafting[/h1]
At first, the game might look like the complete opposite of the PoE, especially crafting. You use affix shards to add up to four affixes you want to an item, or improve their tiers up to tier five. You have support runes and glyphs that you can use to do different stuff, like removing an affix, randomizing affix values on an item within their tiers, and so on. However, with each crafting done on an item, you add instability to it, and higher instability may cause a fracture during crafting, at which point, the item cannot be worked further on.

When you get to the endgame, you realize that there is another rarity for items: ""Exalted"". The affix tiers go up to T7, but you can only craft up to T5. Exalted items are rare items that feature these higher tier affixes on them, and you can only get them as drops. This makes crafting more of a supplement; before this tier; it's a pre-determined risk & reward to progress your character further to the max, but with this tier, getting to the max is entirely at the mercy of RNGesus.

Some affixes are extremely hard to come by. From my experience, the class-specific affixes found on class relic items are extremely rare, for example. If you fracture (damage) an item while trying to add these, or shatter (salvage) an item in order to try and get your affix shards back and get nothing, it's extremely annoying. 

To put my experience in crafting for this game in PoE terms, you have ""orbs of annulment"" in the form of a rune, but the affix removed is one at random. Then you have ""exalted orbs"" in the form of affix shards, but the added affix is pre-determined, and the same affix shards can be used till you reach tier 5. Then you have ""divine orbs"" in the form of another rune that randomize the values within their tiers. However, every craft action will add some sort of instability, and the higher instability the item has, the higher chance a fracture may occur. Fracture is similar to ""corrupt""; cannot work on the item any further, and you may lose some affix tiers in the process if it is anything but a minor fracture.

Lets say you want to craft a good item. Due to the added instability, trying to craft an all affixes @T5 item from the ground up from a white item is highly improbable; the higher quality items, will have much less instability on them for the affix tiers they've got, and you'll have a better chance to craft the item through those. If you want a specific T6/T7 affix, you'll definitely need it drop anyway. So you seek an item with the affixes you can work with as a base, and try to add the affixes you want, remove the ones you don't want, or improve existing ones up to T5. 

If you are unlucky, a fracture occurs. You can use glyphs (crafting supplements) to have a chance to reduce the added instability, or mitigate the damage of the fractures. A minor fracture locks the items, major / destructive fractures lower the tier of some affixes in addition to locking them. 

During crafting, if the affix you want gets removed, or de-leveled, or if the item gets fractured before you are done with the affix you really want, the item is essentially bricked. And I've bricked way too many items without any wins in between as RNGesus told me to fuck off even with a 1% fracture chance. Yeah, I'm mad...

I really hope that the devs will add very rare crafting supplements that'll protect your item when you are working on it, or something like a very rare ""magic glue"" to put the fractured item back together, because finding a good base is a big hassle, and when you do find one, seeing it fracture is extremely annoying, especially if the fracture occured on a very low percentage, and/or on the last step of the crafting.

In short, crafting is still as dependant on RNGesus as any other ARPG out there, and you [i]will[/i] brick good items. There is a risk involved in crafting, and you'll experience extremely unsatisfying results, and reliefs here and there after a successful craft. Just because I have some negative views on the matter due to my bad luck (streak) doesn't mean you'll definitely have a similar experience.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I've listed (cried about) the points that I don't like very much about the game but could be improved. If some of the things I mentioned bother you, you might want to think twice; I want to highly recommend the game, but these things make it a ""mild"" recommendation for me. 

The developers seem to be listening to feedback, and not entirely disconnected from their playerbase or from their game like some other devs (*cough*PoE*cough*) are. As a game still in Early Access, nothing is set in stone. 

If you are in-love with ARPG as a genre, get it. It'll keep you busy for at least 20-30 hours even if you are not that into ARPG as a genre, in my opinion. A solid entry to the genre, I hope it won't get bloated over time.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"I kicked a goblin into the abyss while he was peeing.

Game of the Year.

100 hours in.
Still creating my character.

I genuinely don't know how human beings made this game. It's like the video game version of the pyramids. It’s better than the hype. It's the best money you will spend this year.

As someone who played Dragon Age Origins so many times as a teen, playing this game felt like meeting a long lost friend and it made me so happy. To me Baldur's Gate 3 felt like a fully realized version of DAO.

After the first 20 hours, I was simply stunned. They managed to take everything that I've loved about D&D, and distilled it into a video game. To say it’s been worth my time is an understatement. This is like showing up to play D&D and your DM has every battle map, mini, a binder of world lore ready to tie into your own backstory, voices every character perfectly, lets you pickpocket the boss because it’s fun, and tells you they got nowhere to be so you can play for the next four days.

I literally cannot get the game out of my head. The combat. The lore. The story. The sheer audacity they thought they could this and they did. I love it very, very much - pretty much everything is of such an outstanding quality. The voice-acting, the plot, the visuals, the cinematic qualities, the soundtrack (ohh, the soundtrack) It's intense and beautiful, hauntingly sad. It's about deeply flawed people, about redemption and love and forgiveness. There is a vast amount of quests, often compellingly written. You get attached to characters, you take your time reading notes because not only do they tell you more about the lore, they help you understand what is happening and make decisions upon it. This game is 123GB and they're all used for something that matters.

I think the complexity of the game is its selling point.  The world is so dense with content, filled with characters who directly influence the story and are directly influenced by it.  Even a random NPC that you chat with in Act 1 could end up playing a major role in the story by Act 3... or no role at all if they die instead.  You can see the layers within the decision making, which gives weight to everything you do.  Who you save, kill, team up with, etc. all end up telling a different story, making the game really feel like it's YOUR story being told. Then they did that thing that separates good writers from average: make absolutely memorable characters, make you invest yourself emotionally in them and then put them into impossible situations where they can’t possibly win.

The fact you can play 100+ hours on your first playthrough and come back for round 2 to have a literal UNRECOGNIZABLY DIFFERENT STORY play out is part of the magic. There will be ""did you know in Baldur s Gate 3"" videos for years to come as people find more and more. It’s actually so amazing, my wife’s boyfriend is doing his own play through and then doing one with me and he's getting a completely different experience and dialogue. 

I have three saves right now & each one feels so dramatically different from the others. From timing changing world events, to origin companion dialogue, to choices you make as you're playing - there're so many aspects that change completely. It’s so interesting and shows your actions really do change the story. This game rewards creativity in an almost infinite number of ways. The choices presented to the player during the course of the story are staggering in number and a lot of them are impactful. Few games will reach this level of excellence. Well done Larian.

I also really can't get over how every little piece of extra attention you give to an item or an area is rewarding. You can go from stumbling onto a regular book or chest in a random area to having a 3 hour quest you'd otherwise have totally missed. There's probably 50+ hours of content minimum that the game doesn't steer you towards at all. Like there's entire areas you can only find by hovering your cursor over a small hitbox that some players may never discover. All my friends who played had vastly different playthroughs from one another.

The voice acting alone makes this game perfect. It just feels like you are part of a big adventure and there is so many things to do and so many ways to do it that it begs playing it over and over again. Even letting the dice fall as they do vs save scumming is a strategy. The characters take me back to caring like I did back in Mass Effect. And it's true turn-based which I have grown to love as I've fallen out of FPS's and moved to a primarily single player game player.

The rule set, which is the hardest thing to comprehend for non D&D people, is pretty accessible and the tutorials work well.  It does require some planning, but you can watch a video or two and get a gist. There's also no Ironman mode or anything, so you can literally mess up an infinite amount of times with no repercussions. If you get it, make sure to save frequently! The game saves at odd times and isn't very consistent. There's no rolling ""save every 15 mins"" or anything.

On top of that, the tactics of the combat is immensely satisfying.  It can be obtuse at times because there are LOADS of status effects, environment effects, spells, items, and conditions that can overwhelm you if you're not paying attention.  But to those who WANT to pay attention, there is nothing more fun than examining an enemy, determining their weaknesses, seeing they have a weak WIS and using a spell with a WIS save to completely neuter them. In that way, fights have a way to be incredibly difficult if you're not paying attention to the details or an absolute breeze if you know how to use every tool at your disposal.

Yes, this really is a once in a decade kind of game. Crazy it is also a $60 no strings attached no shops, no passes, no DLC, just one huge and complete game. Truly has permanently raised Larian into RPG developer godhood among the likes of those like Square and Bioware. I'm convinced this masterpiece will be studied by many game developers for years to come. It’s a game that will be referenced for decades. As far is the specific genre goes and arguably gaming in general it just set a high bar. Much to the displeasure of dogsh*t publishers and devs everywhere.

BG3 is not a perfect game but man the experience, replay value, freedom is unparalel to anything I have ever seen. You can just feel that every person involved with this game has put all their efforts and devotion to this. It's made with so much love. It's a game that stays with you.

If you like Dragon Age Origins, I guarantee you'll like the game. It's a CRPG but also a successor to BioWare games like DA, Kotor, and Mass Effect (and obviously the original Baldurs Gate games if you're old like me). I highly recommend it.

252490,Rust,"So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.

Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.

Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.

I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.

Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.

Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.

1151340,Fallout 76,"I came into this with low expectations but it's a fairly priced game and The Pitt expansion was included in the price so that seemed like value enough to finally make the plunge. Maybe it was my low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved the first 50 levels of game play! I played solo the entire first 50 levels and didn't regret it in the least. I have played every Fallout game in the franchise, including Fallout Shelter AND Fallout Shelter Online (which I do not recommend). I've logged thousands of hours in this franchise, so I'm fairly invested in the series and an admitted fanboy even before Fallout 3. 

I don't want to steer you from playing this game, it really is a genuine entry in the Fallout world. Exploring Appalachia is as rewarding as exploring any other place in Fallout's America. And the card system, while not perfect, isn't as bad as it first seems. There's a lot of interesting dynamics and you can change out your cards on the fly. You aren't locked into any build, though you will need to lock yourself in if you want to expand your Legendary cards early on. That's the trade off between choosing to keep your card pool diverse and choosing to exchange your sideboard for points in order to level your Legendary cards. It's give and take and I enjoy that. 

I'm a big time CCG player (as well as Blackjack and Poker) so it's appealing to me, even if I prefer the more traditional Fallout SPECIAL, perks, and skills system. Bethesda found an interesting and dynamic way to integrate everything into one system. Kudos for following through on that, but I'd prefer that future Fallout games stick to a more traditional leveling system. Having to open my perk card menu and change out my DPS cards for Lockpicking and Hacking cards every time I come across a terminal or safe and then reopen the perk card menu to change back to my DPS build, while not the worst thing to be forced to do, is still a totally unnecessary task. 

Once I got past level 50 I got into a daily challenge routine and started farming the nuke sites for my stable flux, which is the logical progression in the end game; but, it's also a long, long, long grind and you end up just doing the same stuff over and over, hour on end with little to no nuance. How many times do I need to kill this Queen Scorchbeast before I have all the plans and the perfect items set? Obviously well over 1,000 hours, considering I'm already around 300+ hours in and the people farming alongside of me are level 1,000, even 2,000+. 

Once I matured past the level 110 mark the game's tedious daily quests, ops, and especially The Pitt expeditions wore me out. I'm just not a fan of The Pitt, which seems like a completely lost opportunity to draw in new players and old Fallout veterans who have waited until now to finally play Fallout 76. 

What really gets me is how linear The Pitt is. There's no map, no sandbox exploration; it requires multiple daily quests to fuel a vertibird to entry, not once but every single time you want to play the expansion; the difficulty makes it a grind to solo, but if you want to enjoy it for the first time playing with a group, everyone wants to steam roll it and you're left behind and lose out on that first essential enjoyment of the atmosphere. 

I ended up soloing it with a stealth rifle/shotgun/explosives build, but it took me FOREVER and it was not very fun constantly kiting and retreating. I enjoy stealth kiting gameplay, otherwise I wouldn't choose that play style, but not when that's all you're doing in a tedious and linear expedition. 

So neither group play, nor solo play of The Pitt is inspiring gameplay. I just don't understand why The Pitt wasn't like the original Fallout 3 expansion with it's own map and nonlinear sandbox to leisurely explore. 

I do plan to come back and play Fallout 76 again, but I'm just burnt to a crisp and dreading the hours long, passionless daily grind. I realized the only reason I was playing was for some meaningless costume reward for killing things with an auto-axe -- even though I'm a stealth sniper. Why do I have to be meleeing trogs to get this reward? I don't want to be forced into a play style I don't prefer just to get a reward. I don't want to kill things with a melee weapon and I especially don't want to have to do it in the Pitt. 

When I realized I was playing content I didn't enjoy in a play style I didn't prefer for a reward I didn't really even need, and I was required to do this every day for two weeks in a row, I made the decision to stop playing.

1151340,Fallout 76,"I bought this game in December 2020, as someone who absolutely loves Fallout 3 and 4. Here is what I have to say about it.

When I bought this game (about 6 months ago), there were a few major issues I had:
- The game was as optimized as a potato, and no matter how beefy your machine was it ran like garbage
- It's fun solo, but even more fun with friends. Not many other people were playing at the time.
- Content was somewhat lacking.

Now, in June 2021:
- I don't know what they did, but it runs similarly to Fallout 4 now, much much better.
- It's still cool solo (quests feel similar to Fallout 4), and with more of my friends to play with, it's a blast.
- They've added the Brotherhood of Steel, and have fleshed out the map more.

The takeaway? This game isn't a blockbuster, world shattering experience. It feels like Fallout 4, but with new lore, stories, and multiplayer. It's tons of fun and has what I would estimate to be 100s of hours worth of playability.

Combat is fun and engaging, the lore is good (and there's a lot of it), most of the environments are pretty interesting, and blasting ghouls with friends is satisfying.

If you're on the fence about buying it, I'd spend about as much on this as I would on a good movie ticket (~$10). Definitely recommended, but not at full price (it's good, not great). If you do end up getting it, I'm always looking for teammates.",bought game december 2020 someone love fallout 3 4 bought game 6 month ago major issue game optimized potato matter beefy machine ran garbage fun solo fun friend playing time content somewhat lacking june 2021 run similarly fallout 4 cool solo quest feel similar fallout 4 friend blast added brotherhood steel fleshed map takeaway game blockbuster world shattering experience feel fallout 4 lore story multiplayer ton fun estimate 100 hour worth playability combat fun engaging lore good environment pretty interesting blasting ghoul friend satisfying fence buying spend good movie ticket 10 definitely recommended full price good great getting looking teammate

1203620,Enshrouded,"Gonna just cut to the chase on this one, 

The game itself is fantastic, the world feels amazing and full of things to do but that is also a problem, if you play on a server with more than a few of you, the world will not regen its monsters, loot, resources or anything for that matter as its on a 2 hour refresh rate that can also have that timer reset if someone enters that area, this paired with the fact quests are not shared nor the progress and can cause issues for others to not allow them to finish them is a huge flaw in the co-op aspect, and well also this game was marketed heavy towards co-op and multiplayer even the launch trailer was co-op heavy.

I saw a review stating the game seemed more catered to the single player survival game, and i cant help but shake that feeling that this game is more appealing if played as single player as opposed to playing with friends.

If your a person who plays solo in survival games then i can openly recommend this game and hope that you enjoy, However if you play survival crafting games to play with friends, explore and farm materials, I cant recommend right now as this game seems to punish you for playing with others.",gon na cut chase one game fantastic world feel amazing full thing problem server world regen monster loot resource matter 2 hour refresh rate timer reset someone enters paired quest shared progress cause issue others allow finish huge flaw co op aspect game marketed heavy towards co op multiplayer launch trailer co op heavy saw review stating game catered single player survival game cant help shake feeling game appealing single player opposed playing friend person play solo survival game openly recommend game hope enjoy survival crafting game friend explore farm material cant recommend right game punish playing others

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"I've only put in 7 hours so far (with plans to put in many many more), but the game has been a really enjoyable experience for me so far! I have personally had 0 crashes, 0 framerate issues, and the game runs a flawless 60 or 120fps for me. 

The story has been nicely paced, keeping you in the action for a majority of its duration, which I appreciate since I think the main appeal of this game is its fun action combat and character progression systems. It is not a long story, which I think is a good decision for a game like this. The main meat of the game are the epic boss fights, grinding your characters up to absurd strengths, and having a blast with the combat while doing so. This formula extends well past the story, where the meat of the game is with its many quests sending you to fight, most of which you can play online in co-op with up to 3 others for a full party of 4. There are more than a dozen characters, and let me tell you - they all play very differently and you are sure to find a playstyle you really enjoy and vibe with to have a lot of fun!

If you like action combat, the art style, and seeing your character get absurdly strong over a long period of time, questing up solo or with a bunch of friends to beat the crap out of enemies to get even stronger to fight even stronger enemies, rinse and repeat, this game is going to be fantastic for you!

It sucks to see so many people having crashing issues during this launch period, and I hope the developers stay on top of things to patch things up soon. Keep an eye on reviews to see if this is the case. With that said, here are my personal issues/things I would like to see in the future:

As of 2/1/2024:
- The game supports dualsense controllers, but no button prompts for PS4/PS5. Come on, guys. It's 2024. Button prompts for playstation controllers, please.
- The game does not support ultrawide, but it does support up to 4K resolution and 120FPS. I understand ultrawide users are a minority, sitting under 1% of users on steam, but it is always very appreciated when I see the implementation. It's totally understandable it does not support this, however.
- This game makes my 4070 TI run 80-100% GPU load at 120fps in 1440p resolution, which is kind of wild. The game runs great, but it is very demanding. The game is very pretty, but it's making our GPU's work hard. Maybe some more optimizations or implementation of DLSS/FSR could really help with this, especially for weaker hardware to increase accessibility for players.

With all of that said, this is a really fun game, and I think if the developers take good care of it, it's going to be a joy to play for a long time coming. Here's hoping they show it strong support after their long 7+ years of development! 

And no, the translation is fine despite the few complaining about it, and the censorship is seriously not significant at all. Please don't listen to the hardcore jrpg fans getting upset over these really minor things, or at least do some research to see how negatively those changes may affect your enjoyment of the game. (For me, it ruined my enjoyment by 0%.)

This review is for regular people looking to buy this game with no context, like me.

It's fine. Style is cool, nice concept, interesting puzzles etc.

But it's clear to me that this is the literal physical manifestation of the syndrome FNAF started in ""horror"". Ultra marketable family friendly spooky games like hello neighbor and bendy, which loose a lot of heart after the creators discover the gold mine.

This is the worst case. One half hour chapter is out for 5 dollars and there's already merch, NFTS, a movie in the works, and each chapter is being milked for more cash.

I don't want to tell you your business, but I wouldn't bother supporting if I were you.


UPDATE 5/8/22: Now this game is free, but chapter 2 costs 10 dollars. So for those who bought this when it was 5, now have to spend a total of 15 bucks to play a fraction of the full game.

230410,Warframe,"upd8: please look at the first two comments for more things I reviewed! comments contain spoilers!

this game tends to be one of two things for most people: either you love it & sink countless hours (and maybe dollars) into it, or you pick it up for a couple hours & put it back down.

this doesn't need saying, but I fall into the former category.

Warframe is a masterfully done game that offers its players a lot of choices not just for what they want to do, but also how they want to do it. you can spend your days designing rooms and outfits. you can sneak through puzzles trying not to get caught, or slash through wave after wave of enemies where your only objective is don't die. you can play as a swordsman, or a magnet, or a golem, or a dj, or something else out of the 30+ warframes they have available (each with their own unique kit of abilities).

pve has never felt this satisfying and engaging. the game has a good balance of quick ""get in get out"" missions, as well as endless missions with rotating rewards (this way you get incentive to stay, but also you don't feel bad for leaving). the sound design team deserves a medal, because this game is the only fps I've played that makes me feel satisfied through sound, not just rewards.

speaking of design, the world is incredibly interesting, & so are all the factions living in it. each has its own unique visual style & moral code, we're not seeing reskinned enemies going ""I wanna destroy the tenno cause reasons!"" or reskinned npcs going ""help me obi-wan kenobi, you're my only hope!"" over and over again. but that doesn't mean they're disconnected; we're constantly seeing people from different factions talking to each other & mentioning each other in passing. the connectedness of the people living in this world is a level of realism I'm not accustomed to in games that aren't 100% story driven, & it makes me appreciate the level of detail the devs use for this game.

that's not to say Warframe doesn't have a story. it's not always easy to find, & at times very frustrating to work through, but it's there and it's interesting and strange. (fwiw, a LOT of the story is told/enhanced through environmental storytelling. you're going to want to hunt for kurias, cephalon fragments, & synthesis targets. or consult the wiki!) the most I can say without spoiling things: you're caught in the middle of factions trying to fight each other, & they either want you with them or they want you dead.

Warframe is optimized to hell and back, to the point where I suspect it could run (poorly) on an apple watch. this optimization HAS gone down in recent months (they recently said that they're no longer supporting 32 bit machines and OS's before Windows 7), but that's still a lot of ground they cover. I was able to play Warframe with little to no issues on a laptop with a terrible graphics card (seriously it couldn't handle Skyrim with the lowest settings). this is an incredible achievement, especially when you consider the details and particle effects the game contains.

also you can get dogs, cats, & pet robots. petting your animals is a game mechanic that gives them buffs. you can fly around in space. you have dance emotes. you can get capes & jet packs & bobbleheads & action figures. you're a robot ninja in space! and all of this is free!

now I've spent a lot of this waxing poetic about how great Warframe is, but this game isn't without its faults. you should know what you're getting into if/when you get this game.

if you're strictly free-to-play, this game is a huge grind. gaining platinum (the paid currency that allows you to get cosmetics, progress boosters, weapon/warframe slots, and weapons/warframes if you don't feel like building them) is best done by getting things called prime parts, which are random drops from relics. you can trade these prime parts to other players for platinum (there are other things you can trade, but prime parts are basically the only things that'll get you any platinum). I wouldn't go so far as to say that rewards in this game resemble a loot box system (the devs have removed systems in the game that act as slot machines), but that doesn't mean it's without frustrations. basically, if you don't want to give Digital Extremes your money for platinum: you have to grind a lot of missions to get prime parts, which you can trade for platinum, which then makes grinding less frustrating. life's rough if you don't have money to spare.

it's also frustrating when you want to get That One Thing you need, but it's the rarest thing on a drop table. again, I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate the devs going out of their way to eliminate loot box/slot machine systems from this game! but often you're stuck with either 1) deciding if you want to take a shortcut by spending platinum, or 2) not having any shortcuts to take so you just keep grinding and grinding. (one time I asked someone if they played Warframe, & they said ""if I wanted to grind I'd go to a club."")

the story doesn't get engaging until Natah. Natah is a quest which you can't access until you can do missions on Uranus, which is also the planet where enemies suddenly get a LOT harder. this point is basically where the game is like ""we're not holding your hand anymore, you need to start upgrading your weapons/warframes."" (funny enough, upgrading your stuff ALSO involves unskippable grinding, but this time it's less rewarding!) Natah has been out since 2015, and by now it's what brings new players into the game (along with the quests that come after it). trouble is, new players are going to want to rush to get to these quests. and by rushing, without taking the time to upgrade their stuff by painstakingly grinding it to rank 30 over and over again, they're going to suffer and get frustrated. this game needs to do more story-wise to not just capture new players' attentions, but to also keep them. (seriously, when I played The Second Dream for the first time, I had to take a long break from Warframe. I was rank 6-7, I was constantly overwhelmed, & I was too busy trying to stay alive to actually pay attention to the story. it sucked.)

DE enables this by making Natah available to people who are as low as rank 3. that's not to say I have a problem with newbies playing the main story! my problem is with DE making it available, but also making the level scaling completely inaccessable. if you're going to make this quest available to people as low as rank 3, you need to make it so that they can actually succeed at it. otherwise what's the point?

not all the quests in your codex are repeatable. so far only the ones that are directly tied to the main storyline can be repeated, & even then it feels really random. I can replay the quest that introduces me to the infested faction way at the beginning of the game... but I can't replay Natah? the quest that basically starts the whole mess of events that we're going through? come on!

now this IS a free to play game, more often than not. so maybe these things won't bother you. that's totally fine, it's just something you should keep in mind if you ever feel like spending money on this game.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn't want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.

The dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.

People who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won't replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don't use the boxes.

PvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules ""No healing potions, no ultimates"" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it's my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can't do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I'll leave it as ""I'm new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being"".

Addressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don't feel it's a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That's pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don't have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it's not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.

Classes. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won't be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren't available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I'm not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn't' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.

So to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on.",0 expectation sunk 20 hour alpha burn idea game launching took gunlance class 40 game fantastic excited launch dungeon interesting far mini cutscenes character slowly climb ladder walk across skinny beam story decent found spam clicking 20 get action able respec talent nice allowing different ability different modifier progressed saying game easy weapon box high item weapon replace anytime soon obvious completing dungeon hard mode drop lower item weapon one get gate 10 good thing otherwise progression slow spongy enemy result authentic experience whatever box pvp side met group player dueling consistently alpha time 30 gunlance dueled artillerist 28 player participating 15 rule healing potion ultimate z v ability generate time perhaps lack knowledge game ranged class ability stagger lock artillerist flame thrower caught anywhere massive cone flinch damage diminishing return saw warlord dodge unique hop hated giving small dodge rarely took danger ability super armor leave game ranged class kick as time addressing pay 2 win concern feel pay 2 win model traditionally upcoming top guild recruiting player platinum founder pack rushing 50 spending premium currency load character rolling map pure speculation understand pay upgrade gear game time pretty frustrating knowledge guild war priority streamer state country 100 stuff paying real money perpetually allowing bonus spending dime good thing imo class class balance strange 5 class released launch available country access 14 power house class available scouter demolisher lance master arcanist desired based general chat feel gating player dump time pay gear class release fan game content ready slowly introducing cash grab 14 class plenty gender lock major issue outside wanting look waifu wrap someone 0 expectation 0 knowledge game enjoyed market serious need format game gamble

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.

There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. 

More tips:
-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. 
-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. 
-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. 
-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. 
-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. 
-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.
-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.

668580,Atomic Heart,"Atomic Heart, what can I say...

It's not bad, but not great either.
The musical accompaniment is terrific.
The combat mechanics are fun, the puzzles are entertaining too.

I also like the environment and the whole sci-fi setting.
It suits my taste, but there is a big but:

The open world isn't really open and is also full of enemies, which just gets annoying at some point.
The story feels patched together and is rushed through very quickly towards the end.
The entire scene feels somehow lifeless without being empty.
Although it is graphically implemented first-class.

I won't play the game a second time even though it was a lot of fun at times. And unfortunately I'm not interested in the DLC either.
On Sale For $30-40 or less I would definitely recommend it.

All of that work to hone for a CHANCE of getting your item level to qualify for the newest content. Then there’s gatekeeping where it’s essentially a job interview. Your hard work of grinding dailies every single day to qualify for the raids aren’t enough, because now you have the meet the expectations of other players who expect you to have the perfect gear, have the boss memorized to the core, and make zero mistakes. So you have to do even MORE grinding in order to get the right equipment and engravings, somehow become experienced in the raid but no one will accept you because you’re not experienced, and become a robot that perfectly executes every single mechanic.

It’s also pretty long, lots to discover, many many secrets if you take your time. Absolutely enjoyed every moment of it.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"[h1] Sum up[/h1]

+ A single character can learn all classes and jobs in the game.
+ Insane variety of content, even without the expansions. Up to 2000 hours easily.
+ An MMO that starts simple, looks appealing and raises the difficulty in later levels.
+ Dungeons, bosses and raids look amazing, featuring rich details and lots of effects.
+ Community is very social and they enjoy helping other players in anything they need.
+ Party finder for those lacking a party going solo, as well as other features to keep players together and make it easy to connect.

-  Monthly subscription can repel new players.
- Lots of content to do in order to catch up with the latest expansions.
- Early parts of the game can be quite dull and boring, though it gets much better.
- The duties which are solo instances can break a party temporally and be bothersome.
- Later in the game, it becomes a trial and error experience when battling new bosses and exploring new dungeons.

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is an MMO game base on the series with the same name. It features elements from all the entries and creates a huge world filled with lots of things to do. What set it apart from other MMO’s is that it looks visually appealing, that its system is easy to learn but hard to master and that it has a lot of versatility when it comes to its players. It is a fluid system with a good amount of room to explore and take it easy.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The gameplay features common elements of what an MMO would have. Players do quests in order to gain exp and level up, once they do they are able to queue up for dungeons, trials(bosses) and raids which they can battle together with friends or with other players through the party finder, which works like a charm.

Each player is required to choose a class, then at lv 30, that class will become a job. Job is a more specialized class. Depending on the class the player chooses, gameplay will vary and while it would be impossible to mention all of them in a review, I will give some examples. Classes are divided into three roles:

[h1] Healers [/h1]

Their job is to keep their fellow peers alive through the art of healing. They can range from the classic white mage with lots of healing spells, to a more offensive approach with the scholar who has damaging spells. Players can also opt to get a mix of both with astrologian, which depends on the high skill of the player and some RGN but features the higher arrange of abilities.

[h1] DPS (Damage dealers) [/h1]

They are the ones who kill the monsters. DPS is the role with more classes in the game and they feature different types of jobs such as black mages, which enjoy lots of damaging spells but lack utility, to bards who can buff their whole party with beneficial effects while keeping up damage or ninjas, who mix different kinds of abilities to generate powerful ninjutsu.

[h1] Tanks [/h1]

The heart of the party, they always must protect their fragile party members and be the shield that guards the realm of men. Like their description says, they keep everyone out of harm's way by provoking monster, rushing to deploy barriers or just being a pain for bosses to get rid of in general. Tanks will redirect all the damage towards them so that the healers and dps’s can do their jobs without preoccupying about dying.


Is the mix of all these roles that create a functioning party, and with the finder, you are always guaranteed to get a good balance of all of them. Each of these roles is equally important as they are pieces of a greater whole. The healers keep everyone alive, the DPS kills the enemies and the tanks keep the other two out of harm's way. No matter which role you choose, you will always be important for your party.

Speaking of side activities, there is another type of roles I haven’t mentioned yet. These are the disciples of the hand and the disciples of the hand. In these fields, players can find classes ranging from blacksmiths to fishermen or even culinarian! These jobs tend to break the normal pace of the game and offer a more relaxing environment. They might sound boring at first, but players often find themselves lost in them for hours. Once you get going, you just want to do more, and they are beneficial to yourself and your other classes.

If you are a culinarian, for example, you can make your own food which allows you to get bonus exp modifiers. If you are a blacksmith or an armorer, you can craft your own weapons and armors to use in your other classes. If you are a fisherman, you can sell the fish for lots of money on the player market and well, who doesn’t love fishing in a game?

[h1] Story [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a game that takes its story very personal and treats it with the utmost care. It does start pretty boring and dull but catches up fast and it can feel like watching a series or a movie. The richest stories are in the expansions, unfortunately, but these are quite enjoyable, filled with lots of believable characters, conflicts, development and more.

 Reading all of it or catching up to the latest expansions can be quite daunting, so if you are not into spending a lot of time reading/watching cutscenes, you can always skip them and rewatch them later at an inn’s room. There are also plenty of summaries only that are well written and consist of thirty to an hour reading material per expansion (game+2 expansions= 3 hours of reading total) so feel free to skip it if you do find it boring or exhausting to sit through. Do however note that the story is one of the strongest points of the game.

[h1] Some Notes [/h1]

The game runs well on any system that meets the requirements. Some areas might decrease your fps depending on your settings and the sheer amount of player characters that are present in the zone but fret not, this is not a big issue by any means. Duties can be bothersome when you are at a party with friends but are overall enjoyable. Probably the easiest MMO to get into has a UI that the player can adjust to fit their playstyle or needs and the game lacks any sort of pay to win or in-game advantage bought with real money, only shortcuts for those that simply don’t have a lot of time.

[h1] What Makes It Special [/h1]

What makes Final Fantasy XIV special is that it is well balanced when it comes to all the classes and jobs. That it looks more realistic when compared to its peers and that it features a dynamic, fluent system with that is easy to use but hard to master. By sharing all classes across one character, the player will never need to go back to the start of the game in they decide that maybe that class they picked, in the beginning, wasn’t the one for them. 

The game makes an effort to make fights different from one another. Players can find themselves fighting in Rubik's cube, getting devours by a Cerberus and fighting the beast from its stomach or even getting split from their bodies and have to move across a labyrinth of AOE’s in order to go back into them and continue the fight. There is always something new in waiting for the player in the next encounter. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a fantastic MMO, it is filled with great amounts of content and different ice breakers to teach new players how to play and hold their hands until they can go by themselves into the wild worlds of Eorzea. There are a bunch of side activities to break the normal pace of the game and have some fun if you are ever tired from questing, and each dungeon or trial keep adding new mechanics, keeping the game entertaining and making you wonder what you will encounter in your next adventure. I recommend this game to those that haven’t experienced an MMO, and to those that have as well.

552990,World of Warships,"Alright, let´s get the positives out of the way first.

- The ships are stunning, I mean that they are pieces of art. 
- Ships say boom, big ships say BOOM.
- the core gameplay is easy to learn but difficult to master. Expect to waste your first 150h properly learning the game. There is so much to learn, armour scheme´s, gun calibre´s, what ship can overmatch what kind of armour,...

The cons:
- community-gamedev interaction. All the interaction revolves around. ""Hey, this is something that takes the fun out of the game/is unblanced"" ""stfu, pay 100+ euro´s for a scam or ship no one needs or wants (arp yamato, pay-to-rico (look those up for an example))

- f2p but p2w, most tech tree (free obtainable by regular grinding) ships are meh or alright at best, some are good and a few are op, butif you want the best ships you´ll have to open up the wallet.

- expect a scandal every few months. What made me write this is the current scandal. Every Christmas, WG (the company) sells santa crates with big stuff in them (even premium ships). This year they just lied to us, saying you could get any premium but in truth only a handful shitty ones. When people complained on their twitch stream WG started to actively sensor them.

- unbalance, and it gets worse. One of the few historically accurate things in this game is that carriers are op as hell. They ain´t fun, you can´t punish them if they screw up and the counterplay is non existent. Many other ships are either useless or super op. There is no change on the horizon.

My advice is to not start or download or whatever. This game is beautiful on the surface and could stay beautiful, but now it is a toxic place.",alright get positive ship stunning mean piece art ship boom big ship boom core easy learn difficult master expect waste 150h properly learning game learn armour scheme gun calibre ship overmatch kind armour con community gamedev interaction interaction revolves hey take fun game unblanced stfu pay 100 euro scam ship one need want arp yamato pay rico look example f2p p2w tech tree obtainable regular grinding ship meh alright best good op butif best ship open wallet expect scandal month write current scandal christmas wg company sell santa crate big stuff premium ship year lied saying get premium truth handful shitty one complained twitch stream wg started actively sensor unbalance get worse one historically accurate thing game carrier op hell fun punish screw counterplay non existent ship useless super op horizon advice download whatever game beautiful surface stay beautiful toxic place

Desync is absolutely rampant in Matchmaking, pathetic map and gametype rosters, jaw-droppingly poorly implemented ""events"" comprised of re-skinned fiesta slayer matches, zero meaningful updates and a microtransaction system so deliriously avaricious it's practically demolished the multiplayer armor customization system only to sell it back to you $20 per pauldron, one piece at a time. 

This is not a live service game. This is a money laundering scheme with a thin veneer of Halo slathered over it.

As an avid fan of the Halo franchise I am disgusted with the mismanagement of this series perpetrated by 343 industries. These buzzards have taken what once was a icon of game design and mangled it into a cynical cash-grab riddled with microtransactions, absent actual content.

This game should have been a masterpiece, instead it's a 500 million dollar failure six years in the making.

A 500 million dollar failure I wanted to fall in love with, which just sucks even more.

Don't waste your time with it, not for full price, not for the battle pass, not even for free.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I have read stories about people getting false bans, but never thought it would happen to me until it did. Got perma-banned for ""cheating"", tried to dispute it, they wouldn't tell me the reason and sent an automated email response instead. I have never cheated (I don't even know how?!) or bought gold or anything. I've just been playing everyday, enjoying with my family and my boyfriend. I even recently decided to support the game and put in real money to buy skins.

The fact that they took my money and then banned me a couple days later for no reason is enough to turn me off from this game. If anything, THEY are the ones committing fraud, not me... It makes me really sad because I only got to enjoy having my character wear a cute pink swimsuit for a couple of days. :(

Also this game is not friendly to new players (hell, I've heard even new players are getting banned for no reason). I have a lot of hours, but I didn't play the first couple of weeks when it was released and I still feel behind. Imagine just starting the game now. The beginner areas are all full of bots and some co-op quests that new players need to do are all devoid of any players. (Gesbroy is the worst),

Thanks AGS for robbing me of my money and my happiness. It sucks that they're the publishers because the game itself is really great. The graphics are nice, I generally enjoyed the story line, and was enjoying the horizontal gameplay (mokoko hunting is the most satisfying thing). It's just sad that this is happening to innocent players. Take this from an avid player who tried her best to contribute positively to the community: Save yourself the heartache and don't invest as much time into this game as I did, only to get abandoned and treated as a criminal and a number. </3",read story getting false ban thought happen got perma banned cheating tried dispute tell reason sent automated email response cheated bought gold playing everyday enjoying family boyfriend recently decided support game real money skin took money banned couple day reason enough turn game one committing fraud make sad got enjoy wear cute pink swimsuit couple day game friendly player hell heard player getting banned reason hour couple week released feel imagine starting game beginner area full bot co op quest player need devoid player gesbroy worst thanks ag robbing money happiness suck publisher game great graphic nice generally enjoyed story line enjoying horizontal mokoko hunting satisfying thing sad happening innocent player avid player tried best contribute positively community save heartache invest time game get abandoned treated criminal number 3
2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"To preface, I have probably another 1000 hours in Arena from the several years it wasn't on steam. As it sits now, it in an easy way to get into Magic for free, and with enough grinding, you can avoid paying any money on it at all.

Major Cons are:
1. No Trading
2. New Developers dont care to optimize the game so it gets laggy and crashes on occasion.
3. Can't just buy the cards you want, you have to spend money on wildcards, which means a $0.30 rare on paper might cost you a few bucks if you want to just buy a deck outright.
4. Most of the good dual lands are rare/mythic which makes building decks with multiple colors grindy or expensive.
5. Difficult to get started against other players and win without spending to get a good starter deck, but there are still good budget options. YouTube helps with finding budget options.
6. Not great for playtesting eternal formats since there are only full sets going back to about 2016-2017 (The number of sets is increasingly slowly though).
7. STILL NO 3+ PLAYER MODES, WIZARDS. WHEN CAN WE GET 4 PLAYERS IN A GAME??

Pros:
1. Common and Uncommon wildcards are plentiful and I have never run out, making the bulk of decks easy to build.
2. Gold is easy to grind by just playing the game.
3. The cards you own can be put in multiple decks at once, unlike MTG Online.
4. If you do spend money, a $50 card on paper only ever costs as much as a wildcard, which can make expensive cards cheap, making wildcards a double-edged sword.
5. Play newly released cards early on arena, which is nice.
6. Unique formats to arena can be fun (i.e. Alchemy, Historic, etc) and give some variety compared to paper Magic.
7. Deckbuilder is pretty intuitive and makes finding cards that fit a theme pretty easy. Also supports importing decklists, which is very useful when you want to netdeck.

Overall I recommend. The game has its quirks and perks, and I dump a lot of hours into it despite its flaws. It satisfies the craving to play more magic when my playgroup isnt available to play in person.",preface probably 1000 hour arena year sits easy get magic enough grinding avoid paying money major con 1 trading 2 developer dont care optimize game get laggy crash occasion 3 card spend money wildcards mean 0 30 rare paper cost buck deck outright 4 good dual land rare mythic make building deck multiple color grindy expensive 5 difficult get started player win spending get good starter deck good budget option youtube help finding budget option 6 great playtesting eternal format full set 2016 2017 number set increasingly slowly 7 3 player mode wizard get 4 player game pro 1 common uncommon wildcards plentiful bulk deck easy build 2 gold easy grind playing game 3 card multiple deck unlike mtg online 4 spend money 50 card paper ever cost wildcard make expensive card cheap wildcards double edged sword 5 newly released card early arena nice 6 unique format arena fun e alchemy historic etc variety compared paper magic 7 deckbuilder pretty intuitive make finding card fit theme pretty easy support importing decklists useful netdeck overall recommend game quirk perk dump hour despite flaw satisfies craving magic playgroup isnt available person

I honestly recommand this game when it comes to story telling that makes you feel part of the fight through its challenges, battles & each boss felt like a darn boss alright since I like souls games and tales of series, Thats why since it has wonderful visual combat & atmosphere and each character with their unique fighting style that you may build them according to your fighting standards of approach as you level up finish quests to earn skill points & get stronk each chapter or mission.
Edit:-
Honestly for knowing there is an aftermath story just made it better for me glad kept doing side missions & putting my characters to work and facing few new bosses for a change.

-The only downside I had is:-

-The release pre-download where everyone could start playing on time because not everyone has time to download since our schedule could be tight.

-Would be nice to add Playstation control buttons as an option in the menu which is a minor issue ""got used to it""

-Sometimes you may glitch against boss if your character has a striking attack from above like zeta or lancelot against the magma boss and register you as fall while fighting his chest area

But if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.

Of course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win.

My RIG

RTX 3080 10GB VRAM

Ultra settings 2k res
Game is running fairly well, I see a lot of people complaining about game not even launching, IMO skill issue.
There are frame drops in some areas like in the forest it dropped to 90 or in town it dropped 80 from 120.
I feel hardly pressed to complain about it, because it's still smooth, unlike some other releases from last year that would be hiccuping hard even with DLSS turned on and whatnot (like for example Remnant 2).
This could still be improved but is not a major problem since the game is still playing smoothly.

IMPORTANT: Does not feature Ultrawide Support and max refresh rate is 120Hz

Done with performance talk.

I'll combine my demo experience from PS5 with what I played here.
The combat is very satisfying it's kinda of a meld of Platinum Games' and recent aRPG style Final Fantasy games.
Like Platinum games it has very fast paced and fluid combat with cancellable at any time attacks with big dodges (features the limit to the 3rd dodge being slower like in Darksiders for example, you can continue combo after dodging like in PlatGames' tho!).
The animations and character presentation is top notch also not unlike something you would find in a Platinum Games' title.
All characters feel very distinct and have their own quirks and gimmicks, some of them might feel familiar if you played Granblue Versus, like for example Gran/Djeeta feature a chargeable heavy while Narmaya also features a stance.
These gimmicks are at core of each characters gameplay and it is key to utilize them to maximize each characters' potential.
Where the game is similar to Final Fantasy is it features a similar skill wheel, when you hold R1/RB your X/Y/A/B buttons change functionality to allow for ""Skills"" which are self explanatory, starting from a basic fireball, heal or a big sword swing to something like a parry or a team wide buff.
Speaking of teams, game heavily leans on teamwork and has a lot of very interesting features that will be key to playing in coop.
Enemies have a Stun Gauge that when fills up you can activate a Link Attack simultaneously with another character (or in COOP with a player) and will fill a Link gauge that when full will buff the entire party.
This gauge is filled through other different means, one of them is Skybound Arts.
This is essentially a Super meter not unlike in a fighting game, once you're at 100% you can activate a Skybound Art which will deal significant damage HOWEVER
The more interesting part is that using Skybound Arts will fill other characters/PLAYERS Skybound Arts gauges that can be further combo'd and if all 4 characters use their Skybound Art they will activate Chain Burst.
This Chain Burst will not only damage but also stun the enemy for inexplicably long time and is key for getting higher ranks on your quests.

582660,Black Desert,"You need to understand three things about this game.
1.) The game is gorgeous, but, it's a glorified interactive casino. Everything in this game is RNG dependant. 
2.) Like all forms of gambling, this game is extremely addicting. At first it may not be apparent, but, if you're running a beefy PC your electric bill will inform you that this game is consuming your life. 
3.) Like all forms of gambling, this game has the potential to be extremely expensive or extremely cheap while providing the same level of ""fun.""  The ""Pay to Win"" aspect of this game solely exists in the form of convenience. It is 100% impossible for you to spend $100,000 an expect to be the best geared player in the game. That said, it is 100% POSSIBLE for you to spend $100,000 and feel like you still need to spend more. 

So let's talk about that Cost for a second...

The game is designed to make it seem as though you need to spend, roughly $150 in order to have enough pets (for auto-looting), carry weight, and inventory space. However, if you're not a ""hard core"" player the 4 pets you get from questing and the additional 1 pet (5 total) you eventually get from your log-in bonus are more than adequate to keep up with most people's grind habits. The additional inventory slots you get from questing are also more than adequate for most people. Additionally, as a new player you receive several free Value Packs.

The Value Pack acts as a $15/month subscription service. However, if you focus your first month of the game on learning and gearing up you will easily find yourself having an income high enough to purchase a new value pack every month with in-game currency. In the event that you are a little slower on the uptake, you could join any guild that offers 5m silver / day daily pay and push all of that money into a city storage you don't often visit. Then, at the end of the month, you will find that your guild has effectively paid for your value pack. 

TLDR: If you are not a Hard Core player then the purchase price of the game is the only money you will ever *need* to spend. 

But what if you are a hard core player? Well, then, your entry fee is closer to the ball park of $150~250 depending on your Luck with obtaining Tier 4 pets, which is a gambling process involving purchasing multiple of the same type of pet and combining them for a chance at increasing their Tier. You're also going to want as many character slots as you can so that you 1) camp every boss site, 2) have a daily/weekly life skill character at each major resource hotspot, and 3) increase your family fame fund (daily silver awarded to you at log-in). As a Hard Core player you're also going to keep your Silver focused on obtaining stronger / better gear so you'll have a recurring payment of $15/mo ($45/90-day) Value Pack *and* an additional $25/mo for Blessing of Kamasylve (increases drop rate). The Kamasylve cost is mitigated by events where they give 7~15 day kamas out like candy so you can think of this in annual terms at about $150/year. As a Hard Core player you also will want to, later on, protect your TET and PEN enhancements using Cron stones. If you're lucky enough to be in a siege or node warring guild you might already have enough SILVER to buy Cron stones. However, only about 20% of players fall into this category. For everyone else there's Master Card. Reach into that wallet and spend roughly $68 on Costumes to extract Cron stones from *PER ATTEMPT.* Remember what we said about gambling? You can absolutely spend a million dollars here and never get any further. 

But Z!! This sounds an awful lot like Pay to Win!! 
True, depending on your definition of Pay to Win. But consider the following: if you're not a hard core player then you probably aren't ever going to bother with high level enhancing. This means if you decide to get stronger you're probably going to spend in-game currency. Mister Mastercard might spend  $10,000 on his first PEN item. You're going to spend about 17 billion silver on your first PEN. Most casual players at end game can rack in 400~800m/week which means you will see that PEN in about 28 weeks. Most Pay 2 Win type of people are not wealthy enough to drop $360/week into a video game. Do they exist? Sure, but, you have the same chance of meeting Clint Eastwood in Japan as you do of meeting one of those players. At this stage in the game, who is to say the person you run into isn't just someone who has played since launch?  Point is, it's not going to affect your experience on way or the other. 

So now let's get REALLY dramatic. Let's say money is no object for you and you want to be the best, of the best, of the best. Grinding is for peasants, you want to make all of your money and obtain all your gear without even leaving Velia. Bad news, bud. This isn't the game for you. The number of Pearl items you can sell is directly affected by the number of characters you have at level cap. If you only get 1 character to level 60 before you decide you're going to be a wallet warrior, you're only able to sell 10 Pearl Items / week. That means you are hard-capped at 3.35 billion silver / week on money. Your first PEN item is going to take you a minimum of 5 weeks to pay with cash BUT WAIT! There's more! As of writing this post there have only ever been 121 PEN Kzarka Blades sold on the central market place. Meaning, even if you have the silver you are still relying on the rest of the community to make the item.

Okay, so what? You'll just Master Card your way through the TET and PEN attempts. Well, we know of at least 1 player on the NA server who has, so far, failed 85 times in a row on safe TET attempts. But let's say you don't have the worst luck, let's say you have fairly average luck. You are going to attempt about 8 times for TET and about 20 times for PEN. If all of these are going to be safe attempts that's $1,360 for your PEN after you spend $240 on your TET. For simplicity sake let's call it $1,500 per PEN.. this will see you at $10,500 for PEN Armor and Weapons. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!

Accessories will always downgrade on fail when using crons, or break without crons. Let's be generous and say you have average luck, you're using crons, it's all pay 2 win, and we'll call it a conservative $2,000 per PEN accessory. That's an added $6,000

In short, the cost of outright pay 2 win in this game is a paltry $16,000 for the gear BUT DON'T STOP THERE!  Did you think having full PEN would make you formidable in the game? HA! You still need your Dream Horse.  Let's be generous with that too and tack on another $2,000. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!! You need a Frigate! And your Frigate has to be the best of the best of the best.  Let's call it $1,000 per piece of gear to hit +10 (frigate equivelant of PEN) and ignore the cost of actually buying blue gear. So there's another $4,000. So now we're at $21,000 to pay to win the game.

BUT WAIT!! Did you think having a fully decked out frigate was going to make you the strongest master of the sea? WRONG!! Because the free to play pleb has a Carrack. You need to get yourself a Galleus or a Carrack to keep up the pace. Can't let yourself be sunk by some guy that maybe spent $100 on the game. You're a Wallet Warrior, you fall to nobody! So you swipe your card.....  only to find that every single item required to make that ship can only be obtained through Bartering. A long process that requires your physical labor. 

 Where does a full PEN level 60 Wallet Warrior fit in? Bad news, guy. You have to grind. Because unless you are level 62+ you aren't scary even with full PEN. The cost to make you a God amongst players your same level without lifting a finger? $10~20,000 USD. The cost to make you useful in a siege or node war? Priceless. 

TLDR:
It is possible to ""pay 2 win"" this game. But it is inconceivably expensive to do so, would take a minimum of 65 weeks, and the margin between you and the Non-P2W player after 65 weeks will be negligible.",need understand three thing game 1 game gorgeous glorified interactive casino everything game rng dependant 2 form gambling game extremely addicting apparent running beefy pc electric bill inform game consuming life 3 form gambling game potential extremely expensive extremely cheap providing fun pay win aspect game solely exists form convenience 100 impossible spend 100 000 expect best geared player game said 100 possible spend 100 000 feel need spend talk cost second game designed make need spend roughly 150 order enough pet auto looting carry weight inventory space hard core player 4 pet get questing additional 1 pet 5 total eventually get log bonus adequate grind habit additional inventory slot get questing adequate additionally player receive value pack value pack act 15 month subscription service focus month game learning gearing easily income high enough purchase value pack month game currency event little slower uptake join guild offer 5m silver daily pay push money city storage visit month guild effectively paid value pack tldr hard core player purchase price game money ever need spend hard core player entry fee closer ball park 150 250 depending luck obtaining tier 4 pet gambling process involving purchasing multiple type pet combining chance increasing tier slot 1 camp bos site 2 daily weekly life skill major resource hotspot 3 increase family fame fund daily silver awarded log hard core player silver focused obtaining stronger gear recurring payment 15 mo 45 90 value pack additional 25 mo blessing kamasylve increase drop rate kamasylve cost mitigated event 7 15 kama candy annual term 150 year hard core player protect tet pen enhancement cron stone lucky enough siege node warring guild already enough silver cron stone 20 player fall category everyone else master card reach wallet spend roughly 68 costume extract cron stone per attempt remember said gambling spend million dollar get z sound awful pay win true depending definition pay win consider following hard core player probably ever bother high enhancing mean decide get stronger probably spend game currency mister mastercard spend 10 000 pen item spend 17 billion silver pen casual player game rack 400 800m week mean pen 28 week pay 2 win type wealthy enough drop 360 week video game exist sure chance meeting clint eastwood japan meeting one player stage game person someone launch affect experience get dramatic money object best best best grinding peasant make money obtain gear leaving velia bad news bud game number pearl item directly affected number character cap get 1 60 decide wallet warrior able 10 pearl item week mean hard capped 3 35 billion silver week money pen item minimum 5 week pay cash wait writing post ever 121 pen kzarka blade sold central market place meaning silver relying rest community make item okay master card tet pen attempt 1 player na server far failed 85 time row safe tet attempt worst luck fairly average luck attempt 8 time tet 20 time pen safe attempt 1 360 pen spend 240 tet simplicity sake call 1 500 per pen 10 500 pen armor weapon wait accessory downgrade fail crons break crons generous average luck crons pay 2 win call conservative 2 000 per pen accessory added 6 000 short cost outright pay 2 win game paltry 16 000 gear stop full pen make formidable game ha need dream horse generous tack 2 000 wait need frigate frigate best best best call 1 000 per piece gear 10 frigate equivelant pen ignore cost buying blue gear 4 000 21 000 pay win game wait fully decked frigate make strongest master sea wrong pleb carrack need get galleus carrack pace sunk guy maybe spent 100 game wallet warrior fall swipe card single item required make ship obtained bartering long process requires physical labor full pen 60 wallet warrior fit bad news guy grind unless 62 scary full pen cost make god amongst player lifting finger 10 20 000 usd cost make useful siege node war priceless tldr possible pay 2 win game inconceivably expensive minimum 65 week margin non p2w player 65 week negligible

[tr]
[td]
- An exceptional remake that not only captures the essence of what made the original great, but also expands upon it with more lore, additional characters and interesting situations.

- Engaging, dynamic combat system with a good level of mechanical depth to it.

- Well-designed multiphase boss fights that mostly prove challenging, feel unique and epic as such confrontations should be.

- The side content such as quests and minigames is worth doing, as it gives good rewards.
[/td]
[td]
- Some bosses, a few quests and optional battles are barred behind replaying the entire game in NG+. There isn’t enough replayability to warrant doing so at all.

- Even if worthwhile, the optional content often proves dull and acts as filler to inflate the campaign's length in a cheap way.

- Intergrade’s story goes on until the party leaves Midgar for good, which is about 35% of the total. This isn’t a complete remake, as the devs decided to split the whole thing in three instances, for whatever reason, instead of doing everything in the same game.

[td]It took me 46 hours to complete the story on Normal, while also clearing all secondary content. After that, NG+ mode with some additional battles / bosses, and spin-off episode “Intermission” offer more content. Despite that, the game is largely linear and I don’t see a reason to replay it once cleared, as the NG+ content doesn’t warrant going through mostly the same stuff again.[/td]

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Premise, Setting & Writing[/h3]
The city of Midgar stands as a shining beacon of technology in an otherwise desolate wasteland, using the all-powerful Mako energy to maintain its modern standards of living. Shinra Corporation de-facto rules above all, being the ones that built and maintained the reactors. Turns out using the planet’s vital energy as fuel isn’t the best choice long-term, so a group of ‘eco-terrorists’ called Avalanche wants to put a stop to Shinra’s ambitions by destroying the whole shebang. Protagonist Cloud Strife, ex-Shinra elite now turned rogue, is hired by the insurgents to help them fight the power - that’s how your story begins.

This remake not only expands upon the original characters, but introduces many all-new ones, each with their own backstory. Generally speaking, they’re interesting enough and add to the story in a good way, with personalities distinct and remarkable enough to not feel generic. Between item descriptions, enemy files and lore entries, there’s a good amount of optional info about the world for those interested, personally I found this aspect interesting, as much of it wasn’t elaborated upon in the original FFVII.

[h3]Exploration & Level Design[/h3]
Until late-game the levels will be largely linear, with just a few side-areas to explore for loot and some ‘open’ areas that act as containers for side-quest-giving NPCs. Later on, fast-travel between various sectors becomes available, allowing you to finish eventual leftover quests and explore each area accurately at will - not much to find, though, as far as secrets go. Vendors are available in some places in the form of machines or actual people, who will sell you new weapons, unique accessories, Materia, and sometimes give you quests and minigames  to earn trinkets or other stuff not obtainable in any other way.

The ‘random encounters’ with enemies have been reworked into seamless transitions between battle and exploration, that you can also skip by simply running away in many cases - a welcome addition. It’s annoying that many sections have scripted sequences where characters move at a deliberately slower pace, in most cases adding tedium instead of scenic buildup.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835932350

[h3]Combat System[/h3]
Instead of the turn-based system of the original VII, this remake opts for real-time battles where you control one character at time, while the other two are left to the AI, though you can switch between them at any time. Hitting enemies with basic attacks will fill your ATB gauge, essential to use spells, abilities, items and pretty much do anything else - your companions will behave competently while in the hands of the computer, but won’t use higher skills unless you switch and order them directly - mostly, they’ll just stand there and soak up damage, or attack enemies when appropriate.

The combat mechanics have been expanded upon, now featuring ‘Stagger’ and ‘Pressure’ effects, both critical to winning battles; deal great damage in a short time, and enemies will progressively build up stagger, making them extremely vulnerable for a short time - a circumstance that can also be triggered by targeting weak points or other specific actions unique to each enemy. For the rest, expect abilities, spells and items as in any JRPG, with particular emphasis on elemental weaknesses and status effect dispelling as keys to winning the more demanding fights. Summons are also a thing, but only in specific battles, and work as temporary NPCs you can’ìt control directly, but spend ATB to trigger their abilities instead.

Special mention for bosses, which prove elaborate and unique at all times, not to mention challenging and full of interesting mechanics that break the canons of battle, forcing you to get creative. The only critique I would make to bosses is that they won’t allow you to fully go through a well-planned combo if their health goes low enough, thus triggering a cutscene and resetting their status immediately, even while staggered or otherwise incapacitated.

[h3]Character Management & Progression[/h3]
Completing quests and killing mobs will credit you EXP, AP and SP. Now, these ‘currencies’ of sorts can be used to respectively increase character levels, something that happens automatically, level-up equipped Materia (also automatic) and enhance weapons, since each of them has its own skill tree of passive abilities, and is generally better-suited for different roles. Not only that, but each new weapon comes with a unique signature ability you can ‘master’ and permanently learn as a skill. 

Think of Materia as swappable abilities you can slot in weapons and accessories, to build your characters for the roles you prefer - only equipped materia will level up, thus unlocking new proprieties or stronger spell versions, so make sure you focus on what you really need as it’s impossible to get everything maxed out in one playthrough, unless you do a hell of a lot of grinding.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"So I am over 60 years old and fairly new to gaming in general. Jumping from World of Warships (fairly new at that also) to this gives you an idea. Before this it had been many years since playing ANY games. So, I am floored by this game. To me its amazing. Now I set the combat at an easy level and I bumble around in here and am in no hurry. I explore around sometimes doing nothing but looking around. I have gone through a fair amount of the story line - again - its all amazing to me. In short I love it. I now am branching to more games, as I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time. I love the characters of this game, the visuals of it, and have no complaints. Occasionally I run across a very minor glitch of getting stuck or something, but this does not bother me. I do not expect perfection. But I want to emphasize this is very rare. Well done to the developers of this game.",60 year old fairly gaming general jumping world warship fairly give idea year playing game floored game amazing set combat easy bumble hurry explore sometimes looking fair story line amazing short love branching game enjoy playing one game time love character game visuals complaint occasionally across minor glitch getting stuck bother expect perfection emphasize rare developer game

315210,Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"[h3] From the creators of Batman: Arkham, Suicide Squad: Kill the Arkhamverse is a genre-conforming third-person action shooter where the ultimate band of 4 useless douchebags must do the impossible: Kill the beloved franchise. [/h3]

[b] The following story section contains SPOILERS [/b]

Truth be told, the caption was for the purpose of memeifying, IYKYK. It became highly controversial in a short span of time, and perhaps didn't born under a bright star in the first place. In no way would I think the late Kevin Conroy is disrespected. It's a retrospective thinking given his unfortunate passing. He had volition, and he accepted the role, imaginably knowing the script beforehand. I respect his autonomy and his ultimate decision, but I still do think it was a character assassination to Bruce Wayne. Getting killed off by a juggalo groupie before listening to a morale lecture from Harley Quinn, who can never have a moral high ground over the symbol of sheer will. You might want to read that scene about more 'winning' than morals though. Still, there is a clear tonal dissonance between the previous Arkham Trilogy/Franchise and Suicide Squad. Unlike Arkham, there's not much morale or gravitas. It's your typical 'beloved superheroes gone mad/bad' bs which is not something I am fond of. A lot of trouble could have been easily avoided if they switched the roles of WW and Batman. I am pretty sure Rocksteady knew Batman would have fixation set on him after we played almost a decade with him. SS does not only dissapoint Batman but all the members of the JL, perhaps the slight exclusion of Wonder Woman, who was the only one uncorrupt at that time, killing them off in uncreative, anticlimactic ways. In all fairness, I do get SS are a bunch of trash persons, and certainly, the game is self-aware. All the voice actors did an incredible job. They are portrayed faithful to their comic book counterparts (albeit probably a bit closer to DCEU), and they are incredibly self-centered. They even try to run off before inevitably failing to do so. While the game tries to give a backstory to each character, especially by creating a personal beef between them and the members of JL, it ultimately fails. The story is overcooked with bunch of armor plots and plot devices, and winks to the multiverse, another pain in the ass concept. It's a way to reintroduce Joker and the upcoming chars, but don't get surprised if JL is back (ehm datamined voice lines) or the story is changed up to a point where it'd be almost unrecognizable or simply retconned. I don't like the idea of progressing the story with each season. It's a risky decision to take. The game might die as well soon enough therefore the plans get shelved. Btw, the game also disservices its own protagonist; Deadshot. He's still a serviceable character. But introducing him as the 'real' Deadshot not only fucks with all the people who loved the representation of his alleged doppelganger by turning him into a goof but also makes the Clown Prince of Crime look like a dork. Arkhamverse's Joker is extremely intelligent; wouldn't you think under the Black Mask moniker he already ran an extensive background research on the very assassins he hired by himself? The story is often undeniably lame-ass. The humor is sometimes on point and just nails it, and sometimes it's at best on MCU level, coming off as unnecessarily corny. The suspense is usually hard to keep. That is why this should have been completely an Elseworlds story given the fact each season will be adding one after all.

[h3] Gameplay & Traversal [/h3]

For some people, this will be the ultimate factor that truly matters. Traversal is GOATed in this game. It's akin to Sunset Overdrive and allows you to lose yourself in flow. Each character is quite agile and has unique aspects to them. Traversal not only plays a huge factor in exploration but also in moment-to-moment gameplay as it lets you create unique chains of combos and not lose any momentarily heat from action. Solid pacing. You can switch your character at will almost instantly and some characters will be psyched up meaning if you play certain missions with them you'll be granted with bonus exp and loot, a great way to encourage player to test out & play as the other characters. You can pause the game at pretty much any given time. Offline play is desperetely needed sometime soon.

Gunplay is not the absolute beast but is solid and competent enough compared to ones like Borderlands or Outriders. You have traversal attacks that play like your 'ultimate.' These attacks aid you in clearing large groups efficiently and look pretty cool. Some attacks need to be countered, requiring you to time your attack and a shield system precisely aim at certain points (e.g. legs) & melee to break shield and harvest. The game's reliance on shields heavily reminds me of Borderlands, as you are quite fragile without them. There are shield mods, a variety of weapons, etc., to be found, and while it follows the traditional looter-shooter formula, it rewards you legendary stuff rather quickly. Yes, you'll keep grinding for better gear; however, it doesn't make it overly painful, which is a rare sight to behold. At the end of the day, it's still an engagement-based product; however, it is more pro-consumer. Battle passes do not expire, and you can work on whichever you like the best, even after a season's end. Bad marketing caused lots of confusion, I'd suggest to keep up with the Q&A team on Discord for clarity.

[h3] Mission & World Design [/h3]

Missions are apples and oranges. Bunch of them are your generic open-world activities that you must bear through to progress the story, highly repetitive in nature while the others are actual story missions with top notch cinematic story presentation. Open-world activities and side stuff consist of generic tasks like holding off enemies in waves or killing X number of enemies, and so forth. However, since the gameplay loop is often addictive, you are most likely not going to mind doing these. Yet, it still fells flat and leave a lot to be desired.

Metropolis is dead. I mean, how could it not be? Invaded, turned into the goons of Brainiac, if not vaporized. Might not be the most vivid and alive version of Metropolis you could ever have, but Arkham was not too different, being mostly occupied by mobsters and thugs. The map is highly vertical, much like the Arkham games. You'll be running through walls of buildings and jumping off from rooftops for the most of time.

It ain't without problems. You can't force exclusive full-screen (ik, DX12 and W11 compatibility yada yada). It would heavily utilize your CPU, but ever since the newest generation of consoles stepped up their game, more games capitalized on processors, only more will keep doing so. I wouldn't call it Jedi Survivor/Forspoken level bad, but with a 3080ti+12700kf, I ended up getting 40-50 fps in most of Metropolis. Good ol' bottleneck. Honestly, the tutorial did trick me into thinking it was beautifully optimized, but the reality left a sour taste in my mouth. Indoor areas, as opposed to outdoors, usually achieve your targeted FPS easily. Upscaling does not work as intended. Lots of stuttering. Game is a pleasure to look at; granted. Transitions from cutscenes to gameplay are a bit off at times specifically with the bosses.

[h3] Closure [/h3]

Mixed. SS will be forever haunted by its afterthought writing tho it should not distract you from the fun gameplay, then the lack of content and the repeats of horrific missions... I don't think it's end all be all but buy it on deep sale. I urge people to at least try to be kind against the devs whom I imagine did put their heart into the project. I also do know appreciation often works reversely and that Rocksteady needs to grind and hard-earn their rep back. A harsh and sober criticism might be needed but better poised toward WB first. DOA.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"My mother has always been a gamer. She played many various series throughout the decades, but her most recent interest was Elden Ring. I've personally never played any of the Souls games for my own reasons, nor did I have much interest, but my mom would tell me about her grand adventures exploring The Lands Between. She was always enthusiastic about it and I would listen, even if I had no idea about anything she was saying.

On April 7th, my mom had a stroke and I found her slumped in her chair. She was rushed to the hospital but, after five long days, she passed away. After the funeral and some time to grieve, I was going through her things and found Elden Ring on her computer. It dawned on me that she never finished this game she was so ecstatic about, so I decided I would complete it in her memory.

Elden Ring is a fantastic world of exploration and discovery. It allows the player to cheerfully change course as they discover the next distraction every few seconds. There's hardly any required order of activities to perform and you can serpentine across the world at your leisure.

The gameplay is challenging, but rewarding and exciting. Hitboxes are tight, animations are fluid, and everything controls well. Melee combat is weighty and the enemies react in a satisfying manner. Magic is powerful and varied in execution to keep things fresh. Just about everything is viable, so have fun with it. There's many small rewards to enhance your gameplay hidden around, so it pays to take your time and comb over areas you think you've completed.

Dueling against other players is also exciting. They're capable of everything you are, so you have to stay on your toes. Be ready to counter their actions and punish openings.

Difficulty is high, but not impossible. I spent enough time wandering early on that the first real boss fight was no issue at all. You can also level up and grind stats, if you want/need. Some fights are obviously going to be harder than others, but you can learn most of them and overcome anything the boss throws at you if you relax and read their inputs.

The story is interesting, but obtuse. Not enough is explained well in-game, and I relied on some abridged lore videos to better understand what's going on. I'll refrain from spoiling anything here though.

I played through the first half of the game on my own, offline. Then I decided to try online when a friend was continuously asking if he could join. Both are enjoyable experiences, but I would suggest offline/solo play if you're a slower and more thorough individual.

I enjoyed the time I spent in Elden Ring alone, with friends, confused, triumphant, and even despaired. It's an exhilarating experience that invaded my dreams and had me theorycrafting builds during my work hours. I'll enjoy many more hours in the near future when DLC arrives.

I hope my mother enjoyed watching me play and was satisfied with the story path and ending I chose. I will never forget the life she gave me and the struggles she faced along the way. There are so many things I never got to say, so many milestones in my life she will never get to see, and locations we never got to visit.

To anyone reading this, please do not take for granted the time you have with your loved ones. Life really can surprise anyone at any time, anywhere. Every day you wake up with breath in your lungs on this beautiful planet is a gift.
