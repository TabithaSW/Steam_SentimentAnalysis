306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"The Elder Scrolls Online Tamriel Unlimited is a beautiful MMORPG which is well worth the time and investment. After a somewhat underwhelming start, I have come to love playing this game (500+ hrs in and there's still so much left to do).

Pros:
+There is an epic and beautiful world to explore solo or with friends.
+Game has strong character creation and progression.
+Solid quest design with a multitude of quests to choose from.
+Quite a few DLCs available to further expand the world and quests available.
+Relatively simple crafting system available in game.
+Wide range of armor sets, character customization items & crafting motifs available in the base game & through DLCs.

Cons:
-DLCs along with cosmetic items, mounts and pets can be quite costly even when on sale.
-Multiplayer rarely feels like a crucial aspect of the game.
-If you're lucky enough to get stuck in a pile of rocks, you have to pay gold to get unstuck >_<(sigh! srsly devs?).

At the end of the day, a game should be fun to play, and this one was not it for me.

I expected a lot more from the trailers and the tons of information about the game. It was full of graphical glitches; I played it on my stream when it came out.

The first hour is very fun, and then when the game opens up, you notice how half-baked the game feels.

238960,Path of Exile,"I gave this game an attempt some years back, clocking at a mere eight hours while looking for an alternative to Diablo 3. I had made two rangers, several months apart, and only managing to get to Act 2 and into the low 20′s a couple of times before finding myself ultimately bored at every attempt. The world felt empty, the zones were lonely. There was no flavor, and there wasn’t even much of a game beyond completing the story. So I just went back to Diablo but as crisp as D3 is, their seasonal mechanics have done nothing to liven up the game and it’s just become a waiting game for the next update in that franchise.

So I’ve returned while waiting for some of my other, bigger games to get some patches and content including Cyberpunk and Valhalla. I’m very happy to report that some updates have really livened PoE up, something it has sorely needed. The rituals for example (an incredibly new update, about a week old as of this review) add shrines (two to four) in every zone you come across. Activating them spawns a horde of enemies, which generates a currency to use at said shrines which randomly generate all kinds of gear and resources. You can spend some of that resource to have a nice item that you can’t afford to carry over to other zones.

Also new to me (though not new to others), are various mine excursions, temple assaults, and heists. Each with a unique mechanic they defy comparison. They are all littered within your leveling experience from time to time (though it is of course, generally more profitable to do deeper delves once you’ve hit the endgame).

It has done the general mapping of the game a great service, helping the game feel like an actual game beyond a point and click adventure. There’s so much more to do than ever before.

Another thing I’ve liked is that I have seemingly walked backwards into greatness. I’ve read no guides and have only used the ingame global channel to ask questions, but ultimately I rolled a witch and concentrated on the tried and true minion master build. Merely asking global if it was viable, I was met with several responses akin to “oh yea necromancer is strong.” Some claims of golem nerfing but certain ones still seem viable through support. Beyond that, I have basically just hunted every minion-based node and eventually found a support skill that set my skeletons on fire, and a perk that makes them explode. So, skeletons are temporary anyway (while zombies are permanent so mostly ask as my all-around dps), so attaching a life-draining fire aura and then a self explosion has been hilarious. My gameplay mostly consists of spamming skeletons whenever possible and just watching enemy health bars melt and explode as I run in circles to escape enemies grasp. I use the Carrion golem which buffs my minions damage, and sometimes plop a fire-spewing totem down that still manages to do decent chunks of damage despite me having no perks or gems to support totems in general. The Diablo 3 MM build wishes it could be this fun.

All I did was just make a beeline for all minion-related nodes, with some health on the side.

Edit: I did have to reroll eventually with a guide in hand, as this kind of minion-node-only build had trouble surviving later on. I'm still playing a necromancer, though!

Honestly, I’m having a great time. Enough to have spent some real money on this. 

So yea, let’s poke the microtransactions a bit. Mercifully there’s nothing pay to win, but there is pay to convenience which does still irritate me. You have to pay real money for extra stash tabs, which also allow them to be generally more customizable than the default. It’s damn near a must-have at a certain point if you’re an avid ARPG player. Everything else is largely cosmetic, which I don’t mind terribly much.

Another point of contention is that the game can feel incredibly complicated. It’s not Korean MMO levels of convoluted, but it takes certain quality of life concepts in recent gaming conventions and decided to add some extra steps. In order to craft decent items, you must first find a basic white. Then you put several gems on it to get some desired effects, then you go to a crafting bench to roll out some other modifiers. If you can’t get what you want, there’s a gem you can use to start it over. There’s a gem for everything, from changing the color of sockets to adding any number of modifiers and upgrades. It’s wild and confusing and you will most certainly need some player assistance by Act 5, wherein I started to take some real damage for once because some acts artificially tanks some of your resistances. So if you don’t pay attention, you can start melting and will be forced to upgrade your gear. I had a dual set of wands that had everything I wanted. Big minion damage and all my spells, but ultimately had to start giving certain things up just so I could take a hit, and I could only get through that hump because of a helpful and charitable player. This is a game that requires a small bit of homework, which I feel should not be present in a game.

Regardless, once the learning curve is done and over with (I still don’t know how crafting works), the game is great fun. If you’re anything like me and you’re sitting around waiting for Diablo to get good again, then PoE has vastly improved itself over time.","Very Positive89% of the 227,830 user reviews for this game are positive.",gave attempt year clocking mere eight hour alternative diablo 3 ranger month apart managing act 2 low 20 couple time finding bored attempt world empty zone lonely no_flavor completing diablo crisp d3 seasonal mechanic liven waiting next franchise returned waiting bigger game patch including cyberpunk valhalla happy report update livened poe sorely needed ritual example incredibly week old add shrine four zone across activating spawn horde enemy generates currency shrine randomly generate kind gear resource spend resource nice afford carry zone not_new others mine excursion temple assault heist unique mechanic defy comparison littered leveling course generally profitable deeper delf endgame general mapping great service helping actual click adventure s_emphasizedo liked seemingly walked backwards greatness read no_guides ingame global channel ask question rolled witch concentrated tried minion master build merely asking global viable met response akin oh yea necromancer strong claim golem nerfing certain one viable support basically hunted minion based node eventually found support skill set skeleton fire perk make explode skeleton temporary anyway zombie permanent mostly ask damage per attaching life draining fire aura self explosion hilarious mostly consists spamming skeleton whenever possible watching enemy health bar melt explode circle escape enemy grasp carrion golem buff minion damage plop fire spewing totem manages decent chunk damage despite no_perks gem support totem general diablo 3 mm build wish fun beeline minion related node health side reroll eventually guide hand kind minion node build trouble surviving necromancer honestly great spent real yea poke microtransactions bit mercifully pay win pay convenience irritate pay real extra stash tab allow generally customizable default damn near certain avid arpg else largely cosmetic mind terribly contention incredibly complicated not_korean massively multiplayer online level convoluted take certain quality life concept recent gaming convention decided add extra step order craft decent item basic white gem desired effect crafting bench roll modifier gem gem changing color socket adding number modifier upgrade wild confusing certainly assistance act 5 wherein started real damage act artificially tank resistance pay attention melting forced upgrade gear dual set wand wanted big minion damage spell giving certain thing hump helpful charitable requires small bit homework not_be present learning curve crafting work great fun sitting waiting diablo good poe vastly improved
2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"After much anticipation, I finally had the chance to delve into Black Myth: Wukong. Here’s my take on this visually stunning yet somewhat uneven experience.

Visuals and Art Direction

From the moment you step into the world of Black Myth: Wukong, it's hard not to be impressed. The game’s visual design is nothing short of extraordinary. Character models, environments, and special effects are meticulously crafted, reflecting a deep respect for Chinese mythology. The art direction captures both the otherworldly and culturally authentic aspects of its source material. Whether it's the detailed textures or the grandeur of the set pieces, the game feels like a living, breathing work of art. It’s clear that the developers poured their heart into these details.

Combat: Exciting but Repetitive

The combat in Black Myth: Wukong starts off exhilarating, combining elements from modern action games like Sekiro and Nioh. The fast-paced action and variety of abilities and transformations provide a thrilling experience. However, as you progress, the excitement begins to wane. The combat system becomes somewhat repetitive, with the same light attack combo being used extensively. Despite the initial variety, the stances and combos lack the depth needed to keep the action fresh over long stretches. Boss fights, though, are a highlight. Each encounter feels unique, and the sheer number of bosses is impressive, making these battles some of the game’s most engaging moments.

Level Design: Visually Stunning but Lacking Substance

While the game’s environments are visually striking, the level design often falls short. Chapters 2 and 3, in particular, feel like barren wastelands, with desert and snow areas that lack depth and density. The repetitive nature of the combat only exacerbates this issue, turning exploration into a sometimes tedious task. It’s a shame because the visuals promise so much, but the actual level layouts don’t always deliver.

Story and Atmosphere

The story in Black Myth: Wukong is rooted in rich folklore but struggles to stand on its own. It relies heavily on the mythological background without crafting a compelling narrative of its own. The writing is vague, which might leave players who aren’t familiar with the source material feeling disconnected. However, the game’s atmosphere remains captivating, driven by its strong world-building and mythical elements. The setting and ambiance create an immersive experience, even if the story itself doesn’t quite hit the mark.

Overall Impressions

Black Myth: Wukong is a game with clear highs and some noticeable lows. The visuals are spectacular, the boss design is top-notch, and the atmosphere is enchanting. Yet, the repetitive combat, lackluster level design, and a story that doesn’t quite engage detract from its overall impact. It’s a good game, but it doesn’t fully realize its potential. I’d rate it a 7 out of 10 – a solid and enjoyable experience with room for improvement.

If you’re drawn to visually stunning games with engaging boss fights and a rich setting, Black Myth: Wukong is worth checking out. Just be prepared for some repetition along the way.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"[h1]""Say Hello to Democracy!""[/h1]

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Helldivers 2 is the sequel to the top-down action shooter, Helldivers, taking a brand new direction with this title in the form of third and first-person shooting and numerous additional mechanics that vastly set it apart from its predecessor. But were these changes enough to survive the Helldive, or did the squad wipe to triviality?

    [th][b]🟥 Negatives[/b][/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
    [td]🟩 Fun, fast-paced extraction shooter mechanics focusing entirely on PvE rather than the more genre-common PvEvP.

🟩 A vast array of planets and mission types to keep you busy on your journey towards liberation.

🟩 One of the most impressive visual experiences I've had in gaming. Explosions feel genuinely impactful, and the world is affected by your influence upon it.

🟩 Extremely high-quality audio intrinsically couples with the visual experience to deliver something almost cinematic and entirely immersive. [/td]
    [td]🟥 Customisation is extremely limited. There's a limited selection of body armour variants, and both helmets and cloaks don't offer any unique traits themselves, and guns are entirely non-modifiable.

🟥 With the servers being the main antagonist, the Helldivers 2 launch was particularly difficult, but thankfully this has been resolved for the most part. [/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story of Helldivers 2 is limited. You are one of Earth's finest warriors, a Helldiver, and you are sent to the front lines to face off against the terrors that threaten Super Earth and its ideals of peace and prosperity.

Both the Automatons and the Terminids will fight ruthlessly against you and your squad as you push back against their tyranny in the name of justice and democracy.

The best part of the story is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. While heavily saturated in dark and somewhat adult themes, Helldivers does an exceptional job of taking potshots at itself and its crisis while adding elements of urgency and threat to certain situations. Fuelled by lowbrow comedy and consistent propaganda that this war is all for liberty and justice is the icing on the cake.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[h3]How about a cup of Liber-tea?![/h3]
With a primary focus on being a third-person co-op shooter with scaling difficulty and extraction elements, Helldivers 2 takes the genre into a somewhat fresh frontier.

The general combat has been thoroughly fleshed out and impressively detailed to provide a comprehensively immersive experience from mission start to end. An arsenal of weapons to choose from allows you to determine how and where you wage war, and it's vastly customisable on a mission-to-mission basis despite the lack of itemised modifications to weapons and armour in its current state.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3164963354

The ability to customise your loadout before the mission starts is a critical aspect of the game, as it determines your capabilities against the enemy you're facing, and it can be particularly impactful depending on the difficulty you have selected.

In addition to your ability to choose your armour and weapons, you are also provided the ability to call in orbital assistance from the destroyers in the atmosphere. These are called Stratagems and are game-changers in this war effort. Being able to call in orbital strikes, missile and napalm bombardments and even support weapons like MG placements and turrets improve your survivability by an enormous amount.

[h3]For Freedom![/h3]
The current war effort has the Helldivers facing off against two major factions, the insect-like Terminids and the robotic killing machines, the Automatons. Each side fights in vastly different manners, as the Terminids are more primal and aim to close the distance with you and your squad with sheer numbers and brute strength. The Automatons are more focused on warfare, utilising weapons similar to your own, and are proficient in keeping you at a distance.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3164962734

But the enemies aren't the only thing on your path to glorious victory. The planets and mission types also play an enormous role in the outcome, and different biomes offer different challenges to overcome, such as desert planets drain stamina faster than colder planets and forest planets inflict slow debuffs as you enter thick brush. Mission types are less impactful but something to be aware of, as many missions have multiple sub-objectives to complete before extraction, and awareness of where you drop and what your intentions are will sway the outcome of the battle and the mission.

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
This is one of the most immersive war simulations I've ever had the opportunity to play. While Helldivers isn't a simulator in the strictest sense, the general ambience and immersion on the battlefield provide a great deal of simulated realism to the experience. Enemies bleed out and take visible damage from gunshots, and the world is morphed by your impact on it and blood/dirt splatters on your armour as you venture across the battle to really give you the feeling of being in it.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3164962278

The audio is of the same high quality and assists enormously in the immersion aspect of the game. Guns sound devastating, and explosions and the ensuing shockwaves that follow are encompassing in absolutely the best way. But it's not just the combat that brings you into this world, as the general ambience of each planet is diverse and unique in its ways and gives you the sense that you're somewhere totally different, not just a planet-wide reskin.

[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]
With Helldivers 2 set to maximum and playing on a 2560 x 1440 monitor, I didn't see the frames drop below my set cap of 120 FPS. I have seen quite a few issues with AMD GPUs, and the general performance with those cards currently seems significantly worse than the Intel counterpart.
🟧 Many of the bugs that riddled this game have been resolved, but it's far from a perfect experience yet. There are still considerable quantities of glitches and issues within the game that need to be resolved to provide a streamline experience.

[h1]Final Thoughts - Good[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
Helldivers 2 has done an exceptional job at providing a fun and intuitive gameplay experience that is evolving around its player base, with loads of items to unlock and levels to gain as you travel across the known galaxy. A rocky launch caused this game to drop significantly in standing, but those issues have now been mostly resolved and the game has taken it's first true step forward toward the game it wants to become. While there are still a lot of issues, such as stats not loading and graphical issues, on top of vast balance concerns, this game is one that definitely should be played, but I'd still wait for some more patches to be put in place before investing.

236390,War Thunder,"I swear to god I have no fucking idea how I'm going to list all the problems of this game in this one review, so I won't. I'll just tell you what it was like for me:

During the early years of this game, it was incredibly fun. You could climb rather quickly through the tech trees and while there was still some grind, you would be greatly rewarded by that fancy new plane or tank you wanted in the end. 

It was like that for some time, but over the years, I've noticed this game get grindier and grindier. I found that in order to get that cool new jet fighter or modern tank, I would need to spend hours upon hours of playing boring, repetitive matches to make any amount of progress. 

Then, even when I did get that coveted jet fighter or modern tank, I would get absolutely destroyed every game. Why? Because at that point, you're going up against veteran players that spend unhealthy amounts of time and money on this game just to make you helplessly eat a missile from kilometers out of your range or a tank shell from a cheeky camping spot looking over your spawn.

Then I decided I would spend money on this game. I wouldn't mind spending money on a game, even if it was free to play, if it means I would enjoy it. So I bought some new premium tanks and planes and even a helicopter (mind you, this is like a hundred dollars tops. I was really devoted to this game). I would find some success, until, of course, they nerfed those premium vehicles and added even more over powered vehicles to dominate the game with. This is their way of making you spend EVEN MORE money on the game. 

Still, I went along, and bought another helicopter and tank. Same story. Fun, until you get nerfed and out-classed. Not to mention, those sweaty try-hards from earlier are even more present and sweatier at these tiers. They are always a part of some elitist clan whose sole goal is to shit on everyone else with the most OP vehicles. 

At this point, I couldn't even play the game. I get spawn camped, out-classed, out-matched, and eat missiles from kilometers out of my own range without even getting a single kill. I spent good money on this game and I wish I didn't because I don't even get anything out of it. 

TL;DR: This game is a money trap. It pulls you in with fun game play before hitting you with pay wall after pay wall.

I really like this game. It's the only one I play.

You want to delete one and make a different one? No problem.
I have yet to find something I require, for which I need to pay real money.
You get free daily items. Some of these are crates containing items only available in store.
Dont like the items you got? Trade them for gems, save up gems and get what you want.

If you have the money to spend on subscription gaming, perhaps there are better options out there.
For a gamer on a budget, like me, this is by far the best value I have ever got from any game.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"That's right, played it for nearly 4000 hours and wouldn't recommend it to other players. Why not? Because the developers are more interested making money via re-skinning the same old crap in the crown store, than they are in fixing the many, many bugs. Newer content comes out? So do new bugs. Patch updates or maintenance? More new bugs. Fix certain bugs? Break something else instead. And not fix it for ages, if ever. Because, y'know, crown store shinies more important.
Add to that the incompetent and clueless customer service (e.g. expecting me to acknowledge T&C/TOS in a language that was _never_ selected as my own; ridiculously long gaps in addressing forum concerns) and the ongoing price for having such basics as a crafting bag, etc. Why keep paying over and over for a game that is this broken, with crappy developer service, when there are other games you can enjoy for a one-off price?

2669320,EA SPORTS FC™ 25,"This game is borderline unplayable.

The Good:
 - The new game mode on UT, Rush is actually quite fun however, often there are people not playing which makes the game pointless
- Gameplay is probably slightly better than last year
- Career mode has finally seen a few changes, better but still nowhere near what it used to be

The Bad:
- Servers are atrocious, you get booted out frequently
- Not sure whether a player count issue but the online experience I've had is awful, huge ping spikes every 30 seconds or so and my internet is not the issue (Avg 100 MBps Down, 35 Up, Ping between 10-60ms)
- The game freezes incredibly often, I've had instances of the game crashing, restarting and it crashing within 30 seconds
- EA being EA, vast majority of earnable rewards on UT are untradeable so if you want to make money from packs you have to pay for them

All in all shocking state for a game to be released in, do not recommend you spend your money on it but hey, at least controllers work now on PC (as they should have from second 1 of release)

Someone began playing All star and we were shot immediately. We tried to stealth kill a boar, and it wasn't a boar. It was a bear. We made a shed, and I locked all of my friends in. We began to expand, and we got some decent gear. We met someone named Anal, and he said he could suck us up. We killed him because he wouldn't give us his pants. We met someone who would not shut up with an Asian voice, and continued to say ""Ding ding madafaka"" so we took about 10 minutes to kill him with arrows and rocks. We lost our house in the process. We finally found out house again, and it was inhabited by what I like to call ""The Machine Gun Men"" one of my friends began playing ""This is the End"" as we made out final stand on the roof. We jumped off, broke our legs, and were unmercifully killed with M4's. We found Anal again after we all died. I then met someone called Iron Tarkus whom I had recently summoned in Dark Souls. We made a group oath about killing the Machine gun men. We met the ""asian"" man again and he challenged us. Bears and wolves began to chase us as we attempted to kill him with rocks. Iron Tarkus, Anal and I finally managed to kill him. We were making a new house when a Machine gun man broke in. He was wearing a towel over his head and gave me a MP5. I decided I would have my revenge and killed him. Anal, Iron Tarkus and my friends met up again and we met someone called Kim Jong Un. He asked us if North Korea was that way, and we told him he'd just missed it. He typed kill in console after screaming ""NORTH KOREA!!!!!!"" Ironically enough we met Joseph Kony not far afterwards and we decided to keep him in our group. Kim Jong Un found us again, and we shot him once again. We then had a battle with the machine gun men while unarmed. We lost. I met a very generous individual who gave me multiple shotguns and tons of ammo. While we were setting up another army of sheds the ""asian"" man had found us again. He kept screaming ""ding ding motherfucker"" once again. He said we couldn't kill him, because he had his die move. I then proceeded to shoot him, but on sunglasses and say ""Good thing I brought my kill move then."" And upbeat jazz music began to play.

238960,Path of Exile,"""Path of Exile: Where Your Inventory Management Skills Get a PhD in Chaos!""

If life were a game, ""Path of Exile"" would be the master class – a quirky, addictive rollercoaster that turns ordinary people into inventory management ninjas. Forget about your mundane responsibilities; this game has more loot than a dragon's hoard and enough skill trees to make Ents jealous. Strap in, folks, because we're diving into the abyss with ""Path of Exile.""

Graphics: 5/5 - It's Like Picasso Painted a Digital Dungeon

The graphics in ""Path of Exile"" are as beautiful as a rainbow after a storm, if that rainbow consisted of spells, explosions, and the occasional gibbering monstrosity. Every dark corner, every eerie dungeon, and every skill effect feels like a digital masterpiece. It's like playing an interactive painting, but instead of a serene landscape, you get a zombie apocalypse with extra tentacles.

Gameplay: 4.5/5 - Skill Trees Bigger Than My Life Decisions

Remember when you had to choose between a warrior, mage, or rogue? Well, in ""Path of Exile,"" you can be a Duelist who flings fireballs while summoning zombies. Why settle for one skill tree when you can have a Skill Forest? It's like choosing your character's major in an RPG university where every class comes with a minor in chaos.

Story: 3/5 - Wait, There's a Story? I Was Too Busy Hoarding Gems

The narrative in ""Path of Exile"" is like that friend who tells you a great story but gets sidetracked by every shiny object along the way. The lore is there, and it's intriguing, but let's be real – you're here for the loot explosions, not the deep philosophical discussions with NPCs. Still, it's worth paying attention to the story between inventory Tetris sessions.

Inventory Management: ∞/5 - Forget Tetris, This is Tetra-dimensional Chaos

Speaking of Tetris, your inventory management skills will evolve from basic to interdimensional. Between gems, currency items, and gear, it's like trying to organize chaos itself. Your inventory is a Rubik's Cube, and every item drop is a new layer of confusion. But hey, it's all part of the fun – who needs sanity when you have a perfectly sorted stash?

Overall: 4.5/5 - Path of Exile: Because Normal RPGs are for Casuals

""Path of Exile"" is not just a game; it's a lifestyle choice. Dive in if you dare, but beware – your free time may become a relic of the past, much like your character's sanity. In the end, it's not just a game; it's an odyssey through a sea of loot, skill trees, and enough chaos to make even the most chaotic neutral character reconsider their life choices. ""Path of Exile"": where your loot is legendary, your skills are overpowered, and your inventory is a puzzle that would make the Sphinx cry.

1283700,SUPERVIVE,"i played in the closed alpha tests for a year or so.

the bones of this game are okay. The movement feels good, the maps are interesting, the combat feels snappy.

unfortunately, the devs do not appear to have any fucking idea how to balance a game. some of the characters don't even feel like they're in the same game, tbh, where you pick Void (for example) and are playing a control mage archetype who has clear weaknesses and important abilities to dodge, and then the enemy picks Brall and you're playing against a hypermobile melee assassin with 8 abilities who has one of the only iframes in the entire game that also resets and can execute wisps. You pick Celeste and you are an ice-themed control mage focused on kiting and punishing enemies for grouping up and you play into Jin who can teleport across the map, catch you easily, and then either execute you or easily escape (because he's basically just ""what if shaco but he can swap places with his clone and also it's got 100% uptime"")

there is no kit parity. some characters have extra abilities, some don't, some of the extra abilities are just ""you have a dash and an air dash"", some of them are way more complex than that, and it means your enjoyment of any given match or fight is basically entirely dependent on who else is in the lobby.","Very Positive89% of the 2,849 user reviews for this game are positive.",closed early development version not_yet complete test bone okay movement feel good map interesting combat feel snappy unfortunately not_appear fucking idea balance character tbh pick void example control mage archetype clear weakness important ability dodge enemy pick brall hypermobile melee assassin 8 ability iframes reset execute wisp pick celeste ice themed control mage focused kiting punishing enemy grouping play jin teleport across catch easily execute easily escape basically shaco swap place clone 100 uptime no_kit parity character extra ability extra ability dash air dash complex mean enjoyment given fight basically entirely dependent else lobby

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"Decent game but I'm just tired.

Arrowhead and the base game:
- 'community manager' spitz is like a pit bull off leash, emotions of a teenager when attempting to interact with community
- Game has had significant and recurring bugs/crashes patch after patch and rather than pause the purchasable content to focus on stability for a patch cycle, they continue to add new guns and such that are typically broken themselves on release and causing more instability with the game.
- Not a fan of the balance approach but that could be hit or miss depending on who you ask.

The greater problem is this sudden requirement/enforcement of a playstation account needing linked to steam in order to play this always online game. Context: Steam page said a PSN account was required however when you first logged into the game there was a 'skip' button for the PSN account popup. This led many players (myself included) to believe this was optional and you could play the game without it and thus I purchased the game. Even worse, these changes weren't announced or brought up until months after launch which is well past the refund window of the game for a large group of people (2hrs playtime, 2weeks from purchase) hence the rug-pull feel.
- There was no communication and more importantly enforcement of this PSN account link requirement, they even provided an option to SKIP linking it when you first launched the game.
- There was no indication that the skip button was a temporary thing or that you'd be required down the road to make and link a PSN account (via in game communication or announcement from the devs themselves on steam/discord/etc)
- People want to be able to purchase a product on steam and play/use it without the need for extra launchers and accounts no matter how 'quick/simple/easy' it is, it isn't necessary and just serves for more obstacles and data collection.
- A significant number of users purchased the game in countries where PSN accounts cannot even be created and thus will lose access to the game when these changes go into effect. (remember, refund window has expired for majority of these players)
- Some countries like UK/Ireland require personal information to create a PSN account, a 'selfie' for biometric identification and/or name/address/etc.
- If you make a 'dummy' account and it gets reviewed, it can be banned and along with it - your access to the games you've linked.
- SONYs own terms on their website indicated that 'PSN account isn't required to play games purchased on steam' and the text was quickly changed within hours of people pointing that out.

'Arrowhead Studios' the game developer are just as much to blame for this situation as SONY. Their lack of communication about the situation from the start until this sudden pop-up announcement months later is a huge misstep. The game has functioned fine without the need for PSN account linking for the past few months, many people would gladly give up cross-play with playstation if it meant not needing to mess with an account. Unfortunate and annoying but on the bright side Ubisoft isn't alone on my game publisher/developer blacklist now.

1790600,DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO,"Short version: Wait for it to go on sale. It's a great DB game but 70$ is far too much for it right now.

Long version:
In many ways it lives up to the hype, but not so much in others. I think this game still needs some ironing out. Most glaring issue with it to me is the *severely* lacking training mode. Besides that, the delivery on some voice lines is oddly weak (i.e. Super Saiyan Goku's lowercase ""full power"" line during his Kamehameha ultimate), certain character-specific things look wonky (i.e. Z Broly's unique grab on Goku - the latter's facial expression just ain't right) and I also think that many of the ultimates just lack impact. A lot of them feel like they should have a ""big boom"" at the end but they just don't, like Base Goku's Super Spirit Bomb, Ssj3 Goku's Dragon Fist or Super Vegito's Spirit Sword slash at the end of his (that ult also feels too drawn-out imo). Some of them are better when they kill, but it's important for them to feel powerful outside of that too. Heck, some of the standard supers look better than the ultimates for some reason. Sometimes they also just don't *sound* very strong, most notably the ones where they punch the crap outta you - it almost sounds like they're punching carton or something to me (in terms of sfx, not voice work).
Considering the absurd amount of sales this game has already gotten, I hope these things get adjusted over time. The game got many changes over the course of those few months before release, all according to feedback from the fans, and I really hope that that continues to happen.","Very Positive91% of the 36,092 user reviews for this game are positive.",short version wait sale great db 70 far long version way life hype not_so others need ironing glaring issue severely lacking training mode besides delivery voice line oddly weak e super saiyan goku lowercase power line kamehameha ultimate certain specific thing wonky e z broly unique grab goku latter facial expression ultimate lack impact big boom base goku s_emphasizeduper spirit bomb ssj3 goku fist super vegito s_emphasizedpirit sword slash ult feel drawn imo kill important powerful heck standard super ultimate sound strong notably one punch crap outta sound punching carton term sfx not_voice considering absurd sale already gotten hope thing adjusted change course month release according feedback fan hope that_emphasized continues happen

2537590,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024,"Server issues aside (I've saw the game once within the character creator and the it crashed), the whole streaming architecture is a pile of garbage.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"Another masterpiece from FromSoftware. Taking performance aside which i didnt have issue with and im sure its fixed now. The atmosphere, the level design, the enemies/bosses design, the amount of side stuff to do and explore its MIND-BLOWINGLY good.

2379780,Balatro,"I'm *bad* at this game. I'm not a Poker player, I don't like/am not good at keeping track of odds and numbers (me, 'counting cards'? Absolutely not), am likely to be thoroughly unimpressed at minimum if I am made to Do MathTM to make game decisions, and all things considered I should hate deckbuilding games. And yet, some of my favourite games are deckbuilder roguelites. 

It took me over 20 hours to win my first Balatro match. I considered giving up multiple times, convinced it wasn't for me... And yet, 35 hours later, I'm still playing it and do recommend it.

For reference, my favourite game of the genre is Monster Train. Meaning: I love being able to find synergies that just go bonkers insane to make huge combos, as well as the rewarding feeling of plainly getting better at playing something 'just' from playing it and being able to learn from my mistakes (because the game design allows me to learn from those mistakes with clarity rather than plain confusion and pure RNG). 

There's a lot more RNG involved in Balatro than others in the genre, which is understandable (it's literally Poker), and in comparison to those it also allows less modifying of your deck. It doesn't *not* allow it, it's just harder to e.g. remove playing cards from your deck at all in the first few (many) matches; but more opportunities for that unlock as you progress and unlock new Jokers, vouchers, etc.

Having gotten frustrated with this game, plus what with everything I opened the review with, being here still and fully recommending the game means that it's just good. It's a refreshing take to the genre, despite and because of its going back to the origins of deck games, and it does allow a lot of fun scaling and strategic decisions if you stick with it. Has enough going for it to appease both tryhard snobs of the genre likely to deride anyone who doesn't appreciate torture of the hardest Slay the Spire levels, as well as the more relaxed players who don't want to necessarily sit down with the intent of burning through neurons to have some fun engaging gaming. 

Each run also has a fairly good runtime and needed focus level to allow you to put on a podcast/essay/audiobook while playing at the same time. All in all, good game design, pleasing UX, nice learning curve, and many many hours of potential fun.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 47,019 user reviews for this game are positive.",bad not_a poker not_good keeping track odds number counting card not_am thoroughly unimpressed minimum mathtm decision thing considered hate deckbuilding game favourite game deckbuilder roguelites took 20 hour win considered giving multiple time convinced 35 hour recommend reference favourite genre monster train meaning love able synergy bonkers insane huge combo rewarding feeling plainly able learn mistake design allows learn mistake clarity rather plain confusion pure rng rng involved others genre understandable literally poker comparison allows modifying deck not_allow it_emphasized harder e g remove card deck match opportunity unlock progress unlock joker voucher gotten frustrated plus opened recommending mean good refreshing genre despite origin deck game allow fun scaling strategic decision stick appease try excessively hard win succeed snob genre deride appreciate torture hardest slay spire level relaxed player necessarily sit intent burning neuron fun engaging gaming fairly good runtime needed focus allow podcast essay audiobook good design pleasing ux nice learning curve many_emphasized hour potential fun

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"Well, I've only just started the game and will adjust my rating over time, but there are already some serious negative points from me when it comes to character creation. I simply cannot/may not create a woman there. No feminine proportions. Everything is smooth and genderless. What's that supposed to mean? I am a woman! I also want to portray a woman in the game! I want to feel and look feminine and not like a genderless alien. 
This is already robbing me of all immersion! And it pisses me off!

Edit after 10 hours of playing:
Pro:
- good character creator
- beautiful graphics and environmental details
- intuitive gameplay
- action-packed battles
- immersive sound effects
- beautiful music
- semi-open world
- exploring off the beaten track is rewarded
- you can always change your appearance
- there is transmog
- very good work by the voice actors
- clear and minimalist interface
- the companions never get in the way

Contra:
- strange body proportions
- no feminine body shape possible, although everything else seems to be possible
- superficial dialogues that seem AI-generated, without soul
- characters without depth
- superficial story that doesn't really make sense to me
- the motives of the characters and Rook are incomprehensible, seem artificial
- battles always feel the same

It's a nice game, but definitely not Dragon Age.
I skip through dialogues, which I never did before.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I bought this game during the summer sale 2017 and this is prolly the greatest buy ever. In the last 5 days. I have completely stopped playing all others game just to spend time in this. 47.6 hours and I have no idea what the hell I'm doing so far. I've been doing some quests which I have no idea if it's main quest or not. I joined Dark Brotherhood and been sending bodies to Sithis -> HAIL SITHIS! 

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS GAME:

- OPEN WORLD -> Literally you can do what ever the fck you want in here. So far in my opinion you don't really have to follow the quest. I've been enjoying the game by just going around explore and killing NPCs . . .

- ABSOLUTE AMAZING OST/VOICING -> Jfc, I feel like they put 90% of their budget in this area. EVERY SINGLE FCKING QUEST AND DIALOGUES ARE VOICED WHAT THE FCK! Holy shjt even just a normal conversation with NPC. EVERYTHING is voiced. Moreover, when I'm tired of playing, I don't even need to quit the game. All I did was pretty much sit in some corner that has NPC playing instrument and enjoy my time. The musics in ESO are so great. From OST to just some songs that NPC singing. It's so amazing. I really really really love this area.

- COMBAT SYSTEM -> I would say it's great. Dodge/Block/Attack aiming combat system, I've always like these kind. If you played Black Desert Online before, ESO does require a bit more of aiming. SKILLS TREE -> You can combine and create your own skill set and it's VERY VERY abundant (is it a good word? idk sr). There are so many way you can build your skill set without much of restriction. 

- GRAPHIC -> I do enjoy the world design and monsters design. Also the skills animation and effect. It's very beautiful in my opinion -> Though I don't really like character design, 7/10 in my score. It's not that bad, just my personal taste, don't pay much attention to this.

- STORIES -> OF COURSE, 47.6 hours is NOTHING you know, compare to players who spent thousands of hours. BUT I believe I can say, as expected from Bethesda and Skyrim series. These stories are AMAZING, side quest, guild quest, main quest, they are all so unique in their own ways and it's just great. It's really hard to get boring of enjoying the quests in ESO. -> Unless you get bored by running so far without mount . . 

WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE:
- FLY / DIVE / SAIL -> There is a vast ocean and sky that can be take advantage off. Since this is an open world MMORPG, I really wish to see these features get in the game. Though I think at this point it's kind of hard to bring it in the game. But again, this is just my hope. 

- CLIMB OVER OBJECTS -> You know that feeling when you underwater and you wanna climb up on the dock but your jump is too short so you can't jump over it? It must be GREAT if the character can grab to the dock edge and climb up. You know what I mean?

1245620,ELDEN RING,"Elden Ring was released almost 3 years after the first announcement but i can easily say that it was definitely worth the wait till the end. 

I think it is an excellent upgrade to Dark Souls 3. I loved mechanic of the ashes of war, big open world, and build variety quite. There are badass and cool bosses like Malenia, Maliketh, Mohg etc. but i have to say Dark Souls 3 has cooler bosses like Slave Knight Gael, Sister Friede and Nameless King. 

PvE: I have stopped counting after the 15th run. Lore in the game is beautifully and smartly designed.

PvP: It is hell of a fun but please don’t use hp estus in the middle of the duel guys come on! In addition, maybe u can show some respect to people who duel by not interrupting their fight. These criticisms are for people who play that way, so i don’t blame people in general or the game itself.

Long story short, Elden Ring will be on the top unless Bloodborne 2/Elden Ring 2/ Dark Souls 4 releases.

The graphics are excellent and most of the time the game looks exactly like the anime except for the deflated muscles. The animations are gorgeous (except for Jiren's goofy walk) and the effects are a sight to behold.

I see a lot of people complaining about how the game is simple or not complex enough in terms of combat, how it's just a mash fest and requires no skill, but I haven't noticed that. Maybe it's because I'm a casual/bad player, but I find the combat excellent and immersive, but then again I loved the combat in Raging Blast 2 as well.

I love all the secret pre-battle interactions between various characters, all the special grabs that only happen if you choose the right characters, etc.. There are many secrets to be discovered and there's a reason to use all characters.

The developers are obviously quite passionate about the game and are constantly making changes/adding things based on players' opinions, which is sadly rare in the gaming world of today. I hope they keep it up and improve the game even more.

To be fair, that is ""First day blues"" and will resolve this week. That will not resolve the fundamental software architecture flaws that the title has.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"DISCLAIMER: If you're a CSGO addict like me but may get triggered by things that you don't agree with in terms of R6 Siege's pros and cons, feel free to ignore this review.

(This game is gifted to me on my birthday by the one and only Damien. Hooray!)

After spending hours upon hours playing this game, as a CSGO addict, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Of course, I will be explaining this review in a CSGO addict standpoint (mainly because I am), but I will make sure that other people can understand this despite some CS references here and there.

Rainbow Six: Siege is a tactical, team-based FPS game that manages to have some sliver of what I wanted from a Tom Clancy's game. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six games have always been games that emphasise on tactics rather than skill, even though you still need to have some skill in order to ensure that you don't fall behind. While the later Tom Clancy's games like Future Soldier and Phantoms deviate away from what Tom Clancy's is all about, Siege manages to somewhat evoke that tactical gameplay that Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six was all about. Like the older Rainbow Six games, the game is all about exposing yourself as little as possible to minimise risk as well as to ensure that your enemies die quickly before you do. While Siege isn't like the older Rainbow Six games where you die in one shot, it doesn't take much bullets to kill you anyway. And regardless of what weapon you're using, enemies die in one hit to the head and so do you. This is one of those games where ""headshot is king"" and you'll do your absolute damnest to ensure that your head isn't anywhere near their crosshairs lest the spray inevitably hits you.

In this game, your environment and surroundings matter to you. A lot. Any breachable walls is going to have holes which will give away your position if you aren't too careful. Players have a nasty habit of blasting holes in walls to provide greater dynamic in how they can execute their enemies rather than barricading them, which seems to be the meta in this game. Heck, walls are a facade for safety in Siege as any wall can be blown up suddenly when you least expect them or be filled with holes by a hard-hitting rifle or a shotgun. Or even a sledgehammer. You have to be constantly aware of your surroundings to ensure that nothing is out of place, that you aren't vulnerable to fire or explosions and that anything you do to the surroundings works to your favour. Any player can make any wall work in their favour with a little ingenuity and a few well-placed shots. The environment in Siege is possibly the coolest because unlike Battlefield where you can blow cover up gratuitiously or unlike CSGO where it's actually impossible to do such things, you can shape the environment to ensure your enemies die in the least expected way. This also keep maps unique while staying the same.

Siege has operators which have special abilities unlike the recruits that you would normally play if you can't afford an operator. All of these operators have their pros and cons and Ubisoft has done a great job balancing them, although some operators do require a buff. For example, Tachanka was an operator that had a deployable, stationary MG. When the meta game proved that Tachanka would be far too easy to overcome due to how stationary Tachanka would be in his MG, Ubisoft added a tacked-on shield that covers the sides of the MG to provide cover in both sides except Tachanka's head. This ensures that anyone using Tachanka's deployed MG would not be so vulnerable that he/she would be a sitting duck while still giving enemies the incentive to go for headshots to deal with a deployed MG user. The same can be said for Blackbeard when he was released with a special ability of being able to equip a rifle-mounted shield. When it proved that he was a tad OP due to how much the shield was able to absorb damage, his shield was then nerfed and he was given two rifle mounts instead of just one, resolving the issue. Needless to say, Ubisoft has done a satisfactory job of balancing each unique operators so they they're all somewhat equal.

The game modes are nothing to write about, as far as I'm concerned. You have three game modes. PVE, PVP Casual and PVP Matchmaking. PVE is basically you (or a team of 5) against a swarm of enemies where the number of enemies depend on the game mode (Terrorist Hunt, Defuse and Hostage Rescue). PVP Casual and PVP Matchmaking are exactly the same, only Casual has fewer rounds at just 3 wins max while Matchmaking plays in a span of 15. To me, this is something CSGO should've been as Casual is nothing like Matchmaking when it comes to CSGO. Otherwise, the game modes are what you've come to expect in a game like Siege.

As for the community, it's actually pretty clean. I've not met any salty or jerk players like you normally would in CSGO (probably because this game isn't as accessible or as appealing as CSGO) so most of the time, servers are filled with fun-going players who probably don't have qualms making silly mistakes as long as you're having fun yourself. It's a fun community to be in and I love it. Though your mileage may vary.

I do have a few things regarding Siege that I am not too fond of. The new operators that have been added post-release requires a hefty amount of Renown to unlock. You can unlock them instantly with R6 Credits but R6 Credits require real money and therefore isn't a thing if one plans to use the money for other, more useful things. Although you can buy all the new operators in one bundle for a discounted price, this is still unacceptable as people have already paid a good amount of money to acquire this game in the first place. This wouldn't be a problem if you have played the game since day 1 as the amount of Renown that players collected would be enough to purchase all of the new operators with Renown alone. Another issue is the offline functionality. As of right now, there isn't any. The reason why CSGO is still ranked highly in my list is due to that you can still play it offline, meaning I am still able to sharpen my skills with modded bots if I ever go anywhere that isn't the sanctuary of my fiber optics internet. With Siege though, you always have to be online even if you're going Lone Wolf in PVE, which is quite a shame. With offline functionality, I would've rated this game higher provided the offline functionality is reasonable enough. As of now, I keep a pirated copy just for that occasion that it might happen, and it will happen if you travel a lot like I do.

Oh, and unstable servers. Sometimes, I can't connect to servers or play with friends at all. Ubisoft, fix this shit, will ya?

Overall, there isn't much to complain about, except for the cons I've listed above. Like CSGO, you still feel the adrenaline rush when you score a kill and the nothingness and silence that occurs in the game can be unsettling and sometimes unnerving, like you would in CSGO. However, Siege deviates that from CSGO as it offers a unique experience unlike CSGO. It is inherently a better game than CSGO, I will admit. I do find myself playing this game more often, despite how much I don't want to admit it. Put it simply, it's a game. And it's a damn fun game.","Very Positive84% of the 1,131,227 user reviews for this game are positive.",disclaimer csgo addict triggered thing agree term r6 pro con ignore gifted birthday damien hooray spending hour hour csgo addict thoroughly enjoyed course explaining csgo addict standpoint mainly understand despite c reference six tactical based shooter manages sliver wanted clancy clancy six game game emphasise tactic rather skill skill order ensure fall clancy game future soldier phantom deviate clancy manages somewhat evoke tactical clancy six older six game exposing possible minimise risk ensure enemy die quickly older six game die shot t_emphasizedake bullet kill anyway weapon enemy die game headshot king absolute damnest ensure anywhere near crosshairs lest spray inevitably hit environment surroundings matter breachable wall hole position t_emphasizedoo careful player nasty habit blasting hole wall provide greater dynamic execute enemy rather barricading the_emphasized effective popular strategy character build heck wall facade safety wall blown suddenly expect filled hole hard hitting rifle shotgun sledgehammer constantly aware surroundings ensure vulnerable fire explosion surroundings work favour wall favour ingenuity placed shot environment possibly coolest unlike battlefield blow cover gratuitiously unlike csgo impossible thing shape environment ensure enemy die expected map unique staying operator special ability unlike recruit normally play afford operator operator pro con great balancing operator require strengthen improve effectiveness example tachanka operator deployable stationary mg the_emphasized effective popular strategy character build game_emphasized proved tachanka far easy overcome due stationary tachanka mg tacked shield cover side mg provide cover side except tachanka ensures tachanka deployed mg not_be vulnerable sitting duck giving enemy incentive headshot deal deployed mg user blackbeard released special able equip rifle mounted shield proved tad op due shield able absorb damage shield nerfed given rifle mount resolving issue needle satisfactory balancing unique operator they_emphasized somewhat equal mode write far concerned three mode versus environment versus casual versus matchmaking versus environment basically 5 swarm enemy number enemy depend mode terrorist hunt defuse hostage rescue versus casual versus matchmaking exactly casual fewer round 3 win max matchmaking play span 15 csgo casual matchmaking come csgo mode expect community pretty clean not_met salty jerk player normally csgo probably accessible appealing csgo server filled fun player probably qualm silly mistake long fun fun community love mileage vary thing regarding not_too fond operator post release requires hefty renown unlock unlock instantly r6 credit r6 credit require real plan useful thing operator bundle discounted price unacceptable already paid good acquire problem 1 renown player collected purchase operator renown alone issue functionality csgo ranked highly due play meaning able sharpen skill modded bot anywhere t_emphasizedhe sanctuary fiber optic internet online lone wolf versus environment shame functionality rated higher provided functionality reasonable pirated copy occasion happen happen travel oh unstable server connect server play friend fix shit ya complain except con listed csgo adrenaline rush score kill nothingness silence occurs unsettling unnerving csgo deviate csgo offer unique unlike csgo inherently csgo admit despite admit simply damn fun

2408820,Luma Island,"Easy recommendation. It's not exactly Stardew Valley. It's more focused on whatever profession you choose. So, based on the profession you choose, you can play it like a farming game if you want. You can also focus more on mining, or treasure hunting, or fishing, etc. You can have multiple professions if you want, your choice merely determines the types of items you make to sell for money, and the method you obtain those items (like by fishing).

The story feels barely there, and it can be a bit grindy, but it makes up for it with how fun and polished it is. It's a super chill, casual game that's delightful to look at and relaxing to play.

2842040,Star Wars Outlaws,"I'm an old school Star Wars movie fan, and I've played more than my fair share of open world Ubi games over the years. Although admitted I feel the formula has become rather stale of late as the amount of filler content rose.  I've also played plenty of Star Wars games over the years, including of course Respawn's Jedi Survivor.

From a Star Wars perspective there's a lot to like here. The environments, especially the towns are absolutely rammed with Star Wars fan service and they really feel like something George would have approved of. The outdoor open world sections look nice enough but they honestly could for the most part be from any open world game, I feel Ubi missed a trick here by not doing Coruscant and calling it a day. Maybe next time.

The game itself is a pretty by the numbers third person action game. If you've played an Uncharted game you'll know what to expect. There's climbing with obligatory yellow paint, there's some stealth, and plenty of shoting. It's well done enough and plays fine on M+K.

As for how bloated or for want of a better word, how Ubisoft this game is, so far it's fine. There map isn't covered in hundreds of fetch quests and the way side quests are revealed, be it through overheard conversations or by getting tip offs from gang members is different enough to make it not just feel like another AC or Far Cry game.

It's interesting too to compare it to Jedi Survivor. From a visual standpoint they're somewhat similar, both using RT GI and RT Reflections, although the reflections are vasty superior in Jedi Survivor.  Neither supports path tracing sadly, which is a shame as while RT GI is nice enough, it's also very much a half way house to realistic lighting. Once you've played Cyberpunk path traced it's tough to accept anything less. Both have a lot of geometric detail in the environments. Where they differ is in character rendering and engine performance. 

Jedi Survivor infamously uses Unreal Engine 4 and runs catastrophically poorly on PC. No CPU or GPU can fix its abysmal performance. It's just a disaster. Meanwhile Outlaws runs on Frostbite, which is a demanding engine but one which does scale and runs well on high end kit with no stutters.  As for character rendering, I felt this was just about acceptable in Jedi Survivor. In Outlaws it's unfortunately bordering on poor. Faces are pretty inanaminate the mostly look like they're made of rubber, and lip sync barely exists. Much has been made of the main player model and I think it's fair to say that it's not Ubi's finest work, but I think it would be less of an issue if it at least had believable facial animation, and if the rigid hair cards didn't jitter and snap to new positions every time the engine tried to move them.

One other point of comparison I think is sound. This is a Star Wars game so I expect an absolutely outstanding soundtrack and sound mix. Jedi Survivor delivered on that. Outlaws doesn't. It's not bad, and it has its moments, but the score is fairly forgettable and it can be a little odd sounding for a Star Wars property at times. And the sound effects and mix are also just okay, I feel they could have been a lot better.

For me then this is a very solid Star Wars game which ticks more than enough boxes as both an old school Star Wars fan and a fan of single player story driven games.  I just hope Massive can work on their character tech for the next game, as it really lets the side down here. And add path tracing please!

Two other final PC nit picks- UbiSoft Connect. Why does this exist? It defies logic. It's pointless. It's bloatware. It's a launcher within a launcher. Steam is my launcher. Please, destroy UbiSoft Connect, it's just awful.  And finally, there's no FOV slider. Again, why? This is a PC game and it has pretty much every other option in there, but no FOV control.

238960,Path of Exile,"PROS:
Monetisation Model: Spend 20$ for stash tabs cuz of your hoarding problems, if you don't collect literally everything in the game the ""Premium stash bundle"" of 6 is more than enough and it does even go on sale once in a while. The rest are cosmetics only, but you will definitely look homeless without them. For the amount of content you get for a 1 time payment of 20$, this game is unrivalled, even against monthly or fully paid games. The best f2p model with no extra bullshit, you don't necessarily need to spend any money and if you think you do, it's cheaper than buying any other game.

Amount of content and updates: They pump out huge updates, skills, unique items, boss fights, balance changes, visual updates, mechanic overhauls, whole expansions etc. every six months. Lesser patches and new leagues every 3 months. Now imagine you have 8+ years of this content in a game, this game is so far beyond any other ARPG out there, it's insane. People like to compare this game to diablo 3, I really don't get it because the comparison is equivalent to a steaming pile of shit that may come with a raisin on top of it once in a while (d3) to an almost perfectly cut diamond (poe).

Skill/Knowledge ceiling:
Transform from a complete noob who struggles to finish the campaign with your half-assed barely mediocre skill tree and randomly cobbled together items in a week or 2 to speedrunning to end game within a few hours or even to lvl 100 within a few days. Discover op item and skill interactions and keep learning new shit as you go on playing, people with thousands of hours still got something new to learn, especially if you skip a league or 2. The crafting item system alone has more depth than most of the games combined.

Extreme level of variety:
In the current state, you have so much variety to choose from on how you're going to play the game. Once you reach endgame you can take a completely different route from someone else. For example, you can literally play this as a pure clicker game, just walk around in a unique map only opening chests with no danger and just chill. Play tower defence only in pure ""blight"" maps. go delving with ur 1 shot or get 1 tapped build. Be a map zoomer and clear whole maps within under a minute. Juice your maps to the max and become a literal god stomping through hundreds of mobs per second whilst stealing all of their power. Be a pure boss slayer and carry others through their struggles for some currency. Just sit in your hideout and trade with people or be a pure crafter and try to create something people will buy for their riches. Buy gambling currency from others and gamble all your riches away. And the best part is all of this is profitable (apart from a lot of gambling options) and will reward your current character and any new characters to come. Find a build enabling unique item on the ground and start contemplating your next build for the next 4 hours, planning on what kind of items you need, what skill tree you should go for, what defensive layers are available etc etc. There's just so much.

No time-gating:
No artificial time gates for your progression, no shitty dailies and weeklies, no boss fights locked behind timers. Play the game at your pace and progress as fast as you wish. No feeling of ""I have to log in and do my chores to actually play the good part of the game"" every day, which ruins other games for me every single time. (Like WoW and Lost Ark)

Level of difficulty:
This game can be brutally hard to learn if you don't look up any information whatsoever online. If you enjoy the struggle, you can do that and I'd recommend this as you learn a lot from your mistakes. If you're the type of person that would rather have the strongest character possible and want to push through content easily, there's hundreds of guides every league for starter builds that will take you through the whole journey step by step, make it as easy as it can be and it will all feel like a dream. You choose. The build variety is what makes this game so amazing and even though a lot of people like to follow the meta, there's some really weird and wonky shit to experiment with that can make a specific type of content way easier than any other build would. Also if you're a complete masochist, hardcore mode exists, in which you lose your current character and everything on them (but not the bank) on death.

CONS:
The only problem I have with this game is the trading system and a lot of people feel the same, but I see how some would disagree because they make the most amount of their wealth through flipping items, buying currency for slightly cheaper and reselling it for more. The developers are hard set in their ways and will do anything to keep this messaging people and  face-to-face 90s diablo 2/ old runescape trade system in place, which makes it easy for people to price fix, scam etc etc. some crafting systems (Harvest) even require you to pay the person and hand them over your item to do it, which can get your item stolen or ruined by someone who doesn't know what they're doing. If you play the game a lot and you're in trade league (Where most people play the game), you will spent way too much time doing this and it gets to as bad as spending 50% of your time just trading. The worst part is, the marketplace already exists on their website, a lot of the currency market is already run by bots, and it all just takes way too much time and effort to deal with, for no apparent reason as opposed to just having it in the actual game. You even have to use 3rd party macros to price check items, which could be easily done in game too. I just don't get it and all the problems they say an in-game marketplace would create already exist and some are even easier to abuse currently, because the marketplace already exists, just not in game and with extra steps, risks and hassle for average players.

I rate this 9.5/10 and if they ever manage to make the trade system feel better and less time consuming in some kind of way, 10/10.","Very Positive89% of the 227,830 user reviews for this game are positive.",pro monetisation model spend 20 stash tab cuz hoarding problem collect literally premium stash bundle 6 sale rest cosmetic definitely homeless 1 payment 20 unrivalled monthly paid game best play model no_extra bullshit necessarily spend cheaper buying update pump huge update skill unique item bos fight balance change visual update mechanic overhaul expansion six month lesser patch league 3 month imagine 8 year far arpg insane compare diablo 3 comparison equivalent steaming pile shit raisin top d3 perfectly cut diamond poe skill knowledge ceiling transform complete inexperienced unskilled struggle finish series connected mission level form storyline half assed barely mediocre skill tree randomly cobbled item week 2 speedrunning hour lvl 100 day discover op skill interaction learning shit thousand hour learn especially skip league 2 crafting alone depth game combined extreme variety state variety choose play reach endgame completely different route someone else example literally play pure clicker walk unique opening chest no_danger chill play tower defence pure blight map delving ur 1 shot 1 tapped build zoomer clear map minute juice map max literal god stomping hundred mob per whilst stealing power pure bos slayer carry others struggle currency sit hideout trade pure crafter rich gambling currency others gamble rich best profitable apart gambling option reward character build enabling unique ground contemplating next build next 4 hour planning kind item skill tree defensive layer available etc_emphasized no_time gating no_artificial gate progression no_shitty daily weekly no_boss fight locked timer play pace progress fast wish no_feeling log chore play good ruin game single wow lost ark difficulty brutally hard learn information whatsoever online enjoy struggle recommend learn mistake type rather strongest possible push easily hundred guide league starter build journey easy dream choose build variety make amazing follow the_emphasized effective popular strategy character build s_emphasizedome weird wonky shit experiment specific type easier build complete masochist hardcore mode exists lose not_the bank death con problem trading disagree wealth flipping item buying currency slightly cheaper reselling developer hard set way messaging face face 90 diablo 2 old runescape trade make easy price fix scam etc_emphasized crafting system harvest require pay hand stolen ruined someone play trade league play spent get bad spending 50 trading worst marketplace already exists website currency market already bot take effort deal no_apparent opposed actual 3rd party macro price check item easily problem marketplace already exist easier abuse currently marketplace already exists not_in extra step risk hassle average player rate 9 5 10 manage trade consuming kind 10_emphasized

fun game to play with friends or with pubs. The developers are very active when it comes to delivering new updates and game play. Sure, there are only a number of maps so far but each game is always different due to the type of ghost that resides in the location, the type of people you team up with, and the equipment available to you. 

The community has been great so far. You get a few boring or annoying teams in the public server here and there but you eventually find the right fit for your preferences. 

It's also pretty easy to earn money and level up in the game. So just keep playing and you'll be able to afford buying new equipment no matter how many times you die. 

there are still a few bugs here and there but they're not the type of bugs that piss you off. They're the type of bugs that... when you discover them, can add more laughter to your games.

It's the fun kind of scary. The hunts are still terrifying until now.

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"TLDR:
Pros:
- Earning a free pack a day is nice.  
- Historic Brawl is fun.  

Cons:
- Alchemy Sucks but has potentail
- the Standard Rotation changing every 3 years sucks
- Direct-Challenge matchmaking has been broken for years
- The fact that they can't do 4-player game-modes when they did it in 2012 on the Xbox 360 is frankly embarrassing 
- WoTC is in it for the profits - the fact that they haven't added commander when it's the most popular format is mind-boggling.  Should be the #1 priority


Historic Brawl is the only game mode worth playing, and even then it's just Commander-lite in a 1v1 format.

People giving bad ratings for Pay-To-Win are being disingenuous - Magic has been pay-to-win for over 30 years at this point, the fact that you can earn a pack a day is fine.  My negative recommendation is for everything else wrong with the game itself - that the Devs don't know how to program anything beyond the mechanics of cards.
If you want to play Ranked, you have to play something Meta because you're thrown into a pool of the top 10 decks from MTGGoldfish.

Unfortunately, even if you aren't playing ranked, 4/5 times you'll still be going against meta decks (seriously, why play mono-red aggro in Standard play).

They also, for whatever reason, havent rotated old sets in years.  Dominaria was released in September 2022 and it won't be rotated out until Q4 2025?

Alchemy sucks, and they took out the Core sets in favor of Alchemy core sets.  On paper (pun intended), Alchemy has a lot of potential to do cool stuff that you can't do in Paper formats like what Hearthstone and Legends of Runetera does (Traps being placed on random cards from Runetera immediately come to mind), but the Alchemy effects are just so uninspired: conjure a card, pick a card from a spellbook, perpetual effects, ""search the top third of your library"" - these are all just so boring.

The games Direct Challenge / matchmaking with friends has been plagued with issues that have gone unfixed for years.

WOTC knows that Commander is the most popular format but they're too incompetent to bring it to Arena.  They've gone on record saying they have a game engine that uses machine learning to implement rules for cards introduced to the client, so it's not like they can't just go through previous sets due to having to program older mechanics one-at-a-time.  Even then, they don't even [i] need [/i] to re-introduce sets all at once.  They already do historic anthologies for older staples, they could slowly bring older sets to the client if they wanted to.

I get that there are fundamental issues like vastly differing power levels, but they could even take out immediate matchmaking in favor for a searchable lobby / ready-up system so if someone's running a powerful commander, the lobby can adjust by switching decks or just looking for a new lobby.

Two-Headed giant was in Duels of the Planeswalkers, a game on the Xbox 360 from 2012, yet it seems to be too much of a challenge to try to implement even in 2024.  

I've been playing since Beta, and I obviously love the game and have a large collection to build off of, but there's just so much wrong with it that I can't recommend it.  I have recommended it to friends to try to get them into it, but you can't just hop into Historic Brawl on a new account - you're stuck playing in a meta-cesspool that is standard.

252490,Rust,"Rust is a game that delivers as a true survival experience.  In Rust you may choose to play alone or with others to survive, build, and loot.  The game is at its best on its community servers as the official ones tend to be overly crowded and very intense for a beginner.  In Rust you spawn in a random area of the very large map with nothing at your disposal but a rock, a torch, and bandages (Depending on the Server).  With that rock you begin your seemingly overwhelming journey of gathering supplies, supplies allow you to create tools, and buildings.  From there most players choose to explore their surroundings and upgrade their defenses.  

This game while enthralling is a time consumer and requires a lot of your attention, other players can kill you and loot your corpse.  I've spent hours upon my intitial spawn working in a community of players building a small city and upgrading to metal walls.  We traded supplies, hunted together, looted nearby rad towns, and even slowly accepted new players into our ranks.  Our small group had become a society, we aided those who needed help and defended our small city from other players masked as bandits.  We had come to know each other by first names and trusted that our things be safe while not ingame, as there was always another player on watching over your city.  

This game is perhaps the first game to create a challenging but engaging true to life experience.  Things I had never experienced in a game before such as trying to decide amongst your fellow founding members if the lone newbie could be trusted behind our walls?  Do we let him in?  Should we make him bunk in the Newbie quarters overnight until he pulls his own weight?  Are our walls truly safe?  Who should be allowed to carry rifles?  How can we expand our society and truly be able to keep our loot safe?  All of these questions come into play at any given point.  

Play with the right people, on the right server, and you too can have this experience.  As for that society?  What led to our unavoidable demise?  One lone player trusted behind our walls was able to level everything in just a few hours.  That is part of the game though, that experience, is what defined for me what games should be aiming to deliver a one of a kind experience I can experience nowhere else.  

Your experience may vary, your story may differ, but mine definitely enables me to recommend this game to the average player.  

If you enjoy working hard at something, having a totally different survival experience, definitely buy this game.

1283700,SUPERVIVE,"**Why I like SUPERVIVE the Game:** 

***You are never out until your out""**
SUPERVIVE is a MOBA Shooter BR that combines Macro and Micro in teamplay in order to be the last team standing. Similar to other BR's it has the concept of third partying, ""poverty runs"" when you unfortunately fall behind, really lucky finds to get you ahead, and a final storm collapsing in a circle around the map to have players converge. However, I think the main difference in SUPERVIVE compared to other BR's is really just, ""you are not out of the game until you are really out."" I've played BR's in the past of watching my teammates try to rez me for 10mins and seeing no hope in being able to 1v3. At some point in those games it feels hopeless and you are sometimes trapped watching as a spectator. I think that the thing SUPERVIVE does better than any other BR is that you are never really ""out"" until your last teammate dies. 

""Most Wanted' is an item that can bring your whole team alive in the late game if you manage to clutch and get a kill. Additionally, there is also the rez beacons scattered across the map that alert enemy players but can bring your whole team alive. These ways of rezzing are very much a core fundamental change to the genre. Yes, in Apex and Fortnite you can rez your allies, but in SUPERVIVE it is inherently more designed to be within the game from the start, rather than a tacked on feature that was just added to reduce frustration. Very consistently especially earlier on in your SUPERVIVE play you will run into games where maybe you die 3+ times, and still win the game. I can't really think of another BR that does that. This also means that in general you can be more aggressive and look for more fun plays because you know that as long as someone lives you might be able to win the match.

**""Intense moments and Clutch plays""**
Second, I think that SUPERVIVE scratches my particular itch of teamgfighting that I got from League of Legends. My favorite moments in LoL were those epic teamfights that the whole game leads up to, you are nervous, at the edge of your seat, and feel electric when you win, and sorrow when you lose. In my experience, when matchmaking is really good in SUPERVIVE you get those kinds of experiences significantly more often than a game like LoL. The late game fights and feel chaotic, and adrenaline pumps through my veins. The feeling is pretty addicting.


**""Sharpness""**
Third, the game is ""sharp"" - When you die in SUPERVIVE, you often know how you died or why you died. Did Shrike hit you while you were marked by her passive, Did Void catch you with his black hole, did Bishop punch you into a wall? Maybe you just got spiked? In general the characters in this game tell you ""this is why you lost"". I find this type of design to be better and more accessible to new players once they learn some of the hunters abilities as well as find it interesting to find new ways execute the sharpness on each character. Often the game is compared to Battlerite since it has similar controls, however if you watch gameplay of SUPERVIVE vs. gameplay of Battlerite, you will realize much sooner, how ""Sharp"" the gameplay really is. Battlerite you can make a play at the first 10 seconds of the match and have it be doomed for the next 2 minutes and by the time it is over, you have already forgotten your mistake or maybe you didn't know it at all. In SUPERVIVE it is very clear cut. This is what you messed up, try to do something else because well... you usually will die. But as mentioned earlier, dying isn't the end all be all like other BR's. The Sharpness works because of the plentiful ways to rez in the game.

**Where do I think SUPERVIVE struggles**

**Matchmaking and Ranked:**
Right now in the higher ranks there is not enough players and so unfortunately sometimes the higher ranked players will be put into lower level lobbies. I expect this to improve with time, but it definitely is my top concern for the health of the game. As a top ranked player I don't want to be in these lobbies but I also want to play the game, we simply just need more players and hopefully we will get more!

**SoloQ vs Premade experience:**
In LoL I was an avid soloQ enjoyer and then also played a ton of normal games with my lower ranked friends. I felt like I had 2 different modes to play. One of them I could test my skills and the other, I could relax and have fun with my friends. I feel like in SUPERVIVE it is harder to make that line of differentiation because there is no SoloQ specific mode. I think it is one of those things that if enough players want it and the playerbase is there to support it, then it will happen. I'd say the one issue I have with this topic, is that SoloQ Ranked has never even been tested in previous playtests ever. It kind of surprises me, because as a game that feels like it attracts a lot of LoL players it misses something that they find so integral to the health of their game.

EDIT: 11/21/24

I didn't think my review would be so high up here... I think that a review near the top should focus more on the game than the actual company that makes it. So I edited my review. The Original post is still relevant and down below!


--
Original Post 11/20/24:

As of this review I am the player (non-dev) with the most in-game hours played. I will tell it to you straight up, you are going to regret not playing the game now in Beta, because it's going to be BIG.

The developers of this game sincerely care more than any other game I have come across. SUPERVIVE isn't simply just a way to make money or a job for them, it's pure passion and it shows. The Devs listen to their community, some freely work past 3 AM fixing bugs, others reach out to one tricks to see how they feel about their mains, and the executive producers just straight up have public discussions on their discord. Theorycraft Games is involved and doing everything they possibly can to make this game succeed, and the best part is, the game is already the most fun game I have ever played and it just keeps getting better every update. There is seemingly infinite skill cap, but still a lot of room to make hype and crazy outplays when you are just starting out.

Some people have told me they feel behind because they look at my hours played. I am in the .0001% minority of time played and this really is just the beginning of everything. Everyone is learning and now is a perfect time to play. It is way easier than picking up a game like LoL, OW, or APEX that is riddled with smurfs and people who have been playing for the last 10+ years.

If you're someone who feels like they don't have a ""home"" in gaming anymore and are just hopping from one game to the next, give SUPERVIVE a try. It is literally free to play, so you have nothing to lose, and who knows it just might become your new home—just like it has for me.

--

Additionally to respond to some of the glazing accusations in the comments (disabled now) (which are definitely fair) with a real example, today on launch for SUPERVIVE, NA had a rough start with packet loss and some connection issues with the servers. Theorycraft Games team to fix those issues is extremely small and they managed to fix it within 3-4 hours. If it was another studio like Riot or Blizzard the servers would have been down for hours longer. I know because I've played those games on their big launch days. Sometimes giving credit to the devs when credit is due is okay, and we don't need to be upset about having hope in the world in appreciating someones craft, whether that be game dev, sports, or anything. I think y'all are right for calling me out on it, but I do think that you should still hear me out.

252490,Rust,"before i bought rust i was looking for some reviews about the game and i found this one pretty much usefull that's why i thought it will be a good idea to post it in here
Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I've ever played. You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer, so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet, as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax; enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you're particularly industrious, you'll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources—the entry-level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign.

But then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It's another idiot in Rust. 

I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored, maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design, or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings, but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance, so when you're spotted by an idiot, you'll start hearing the shit-talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer, they get louder and more confident, and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.
No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust, and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement.

It's so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn't love it. I wish I could say that it didn't feel incredible when one of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the battle axe I fashioned out of scrap metal (which he almost certainly didn't know I was carrying), and put him down with a single well-placed strike. I wish I could tell you that, as I was standing over his fatally wounded body, that I didn't laugh my ass off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting, ""Hey man, wait a second!"" I wish I could say I didn't kill him anyway. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust, and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement.

If it feels like we've been living with Rust for a long time, that's because we kinda have. The game was first released in Early Access in late 2013 by developers Facepunch Studios, and it's been a mainstay of goofy YouTube send-ups ever since. If you're somehow unfamiliar with the premise, think of Rust as a dumber, more nihilistic Minecraft. You wake up on a map armed with only a rock and a torch. You quickly figure out that, by banging your rock on a few environmental doodads, you can harvest a few basic resources (stone, wood, and cloth) which you can parlay into a few prehistoric instruments, like a spear or a hatchet. This is similar to the scrounging mechanics in plenty of other survival games, but what makes Rust different is how deep that tech tree goes. Eventually, from those same basic ingredients and a few mechanical leaps of faith (like work benches and furnaces), you'll be able to craft pistols, flamethrowers, and rocket launchers. Rust famously does not quarter off its servers to keep entry-level nakeds away from the roving troops suited up in advanced firearms, which means that occasionally, your journey will end with you matching another player's revolver with a rock that you've tied to a stick.

This is the heart of Rust. Wake up naked, run for your life, do horrible things to one another. There is no grander narrative, or mythos, or win condition. Most of the servers are on a strict weekly or monthly reset schedule, which scrubs the island of any lingering housing or fortifications left behind by the players, which gives the experience a strange sense of futility. Yes, you will need to manage your hunger, thirst, and health—and as you ratchet up the tech tree you will discover increasingly effective ways to stay alive—but that's it. Sure there are some areas on the map that are stricken with radiation, which leads to the implication that perhaps you and the rest of your misanthropes are occupying a far-flung, post-collapse society, but those moments feel more like window dressing than anything else.

I spent the vast majority of my time in Rust playing solo, but I don't want to discount the notorious community of players that band together in clans, and wage wars of aggression along the shared hunting grounds. One of the fascinating kernels of Rust's brutality is how everything in the world remains persistent, even if you're logged off, which means that smart players arm their bases with land mines, punji sticks, and keypad locks while they're away. (Some clans even recruit players across all time zones, to make sure there's always someone on guard.) 

That's a coordination I appreciated from a distance. There are a number of YouTube documentarians showing off the multi-man raids that spawn from committed Discord channels all over the world. Instead, I engaged with the population of Rust on a purely incidental level. An extremely geared man takes pity on you, and drops a crossbow at your quivering feet. That's Rust! A kid and I are raiding an abandoned gas station for food and weapons, and I give him the extra pair of pants I was carrying around. When I'm turned the other direction, he bashes his rock right through my skull and runs off with the rest of my stuff. That is also Rust.

I'm utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along.
Given the tone, it shouldn't be surprising that the community I found in Rust tended to be fairly juvenile and toxic. There's a high concentration of racism and misogyny in the global chat, so much so that I eventually left the channel entirely. 
And unsurprisingly, the new player experience is quite prickly. The development team didn't spend any time cooking up a tutorial (which makes some sense, when you consider how long the game has been available). Instead, when you join one of the many servers, you're presented with a few faint hints in the top-left corner of the screen: ""harvest wood!"" ""build a hatchet!"" The crafting system itself is fairly intuitive, with well-written tooltips for each of the items in the catalog, and you can fast-track yourself into some serious munitions if you get lucky with a few resource spawns. The PvP combat won't win any awards, but it's tactile and packed with wonderfully sadist bone-crunching sound effects—connecting your hatchet with an idiot's head feels great, and really, that's all I needed. There is also a strange post-release monetization model, in which you can buy ugly paint-jobs for your weapons and clothing. Rust is fascinating for a hundred different reasons, but Counter-Strike-style weed-leaf AWPs isn't one of them. 

Still though, I think everyone should at least have a taste of Rust. It's hard to think of many other games that are this uncompromising in its worldview, and I'm utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along. We could build a utopia on this island! We could cast aside our weapons, and construct a peaceful commune where everyone is fed, warm, and loved. I love how Facepunch dangles that potential in front of our face, with no real incentive pushing us in any direction.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Arguably one of the best subscription-based MMORPGS ever. There is so much to do across all the expansions. Probably one of the biggest selling points for me were:
1. The Story
How surprising, huh? Let's be real. The story of ARR is kinda stiff and slow. It is at Heavensward where things pick up DRASTICALLY and i can't put more emphasis on that. 
2. The Trials (Bosses)
Oh, my lord. Never have i had this much fun fighting a big baddy. Even in Story or off-Story. The fights are really well made, in fact, they are so well made it is even fun learning all the patterns/attacks. 
3. The Classes (Jobs)
The fact that you can have ALL classes on ONE character still surprises me until this day. Not in the mood to play the class you selected? Hell, just unlock another one and go on. All classes have a unique twist to them, be it a healer, tank or DPS. I recommend trying them all!
4. References from other FF games
And by references, i mean actual characters from other FF's (excluding multi-universal ones, yes, we have Gilgamesh too.) In fact, it is possible to fight some baddies you remember from other FF's, like Kefka or Exdeath (I won't tell you where they are though :P) We even have Raids situated in locations from other FF's, Like the Ridorana Lighthouse from FFXII or the Orbonne Monastery from FFT.
5. The Music
As is custom in other FF games, even FFXIV's music is absolutely nuts, some musical pieces are even reinforced with the inclusion of ""The Primals"" and believe me when I tell you, their pieces never cease to amaze me.

In conclusion: Would I recommend this game? Hell yeah i would, no doubts there.
For those who are yet unsure if they want to commit to this, there is still the Free Trial available, which includes the Heavensward expansion, it gives you the most major grip of how the game works. 

PS: During my time of playing, i have encountered second to no toxicity ingame, the people here are really nice and helpful. Don't be afraid to ask!

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"This game is the equivalent to watching someone you love slowly asphyxiate. The developers hit the lottery out of the box on this and have made the tragic mistake of listening to the wrong voices in the community. This is a PVE GAME, and anyone who recommends a nerf to any gun is a saboteur to this games full potential. It almost seems like the devs don't even know why the game WAS fun, which is a real head scratcher.

The game definitely has a fun aspects to it, but please refer to my first sentence. 

If this review is fortunate to be read by someone who has influence on the dev team, you have one shot to get this game back on track to its original glory.

ROLL BACK ALL WEAPON NERFS SINCE LAUNCH WHEN THE ILLUMINATE ARRIVE. The data shows you have spikes every patch, but the community shrinks shortly after. You need to restore this game to opening day fun/carnage levels. You claim you've done all nerfs in the name of balance and you've achieved the exact opposite by making everything equally suck instead of equally good. Bring stats of other weapons up instead of lowering a favorite. The carnage IS the fun. If a gun is slightly OP, THAT IS THE FUN. You can solve the problem of ""being too easy"" by adding difficulty levels, much like you just added Super Helldive. That way your weapons stay balanced in all levels and the harder you make it, the more the ""OP"" weapons are leveled.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is Square Enix's way of showing that they care about our experience and is the reason why I love the Final Fantasy series.

There is no reason why you shouldn't try this MMO. There is a 14 day free demo (with some chat and levelling restrictions but still enjoyable), and if you like what you play, then you can get the game along with 30 more days of free (non-sub) game time! That's a whooping 44 subscription free days! 

Now let's get into the pros and the cons.

Pros: 
- Fantastic soundtrack (as expected from a final fantasy game) composed by Nobuo Uematsu.
- Polite and helpful player base. (Don't know what to do? Ask a bypassing player and they'll usually answer and provide even more help than you would initially expect.)
- Role Playing is an option and you can create custom macros!
- Enjoyable story to share with your friends
- You can play and level all classes with just ONE character!
- Frequent patches 
- Not pay to win
- A plethora of side and main content
- Controller support (you can also change button layouts from Xbox to Playstation)
- CROSS PLATFORM!
- New player friendly (story mode is basically a tutorial that teaches you new things slowly as you progress)
- Seasonal events such as Halloween and Christmas
- The pleasure of making new friends and joining a guild for the first time.

Cons:
- Small instanced zones (though it shouldn't be a problem after the Stormblood expansion comes out with the end of PS3 support)
- There are a lot of kill and collect quests that may become repetitive (but to be expected of in MMOs)
- The story almost seems nonexistent somewhere in the mid-game
- Non-story quest dialogue is somewhat uninteresting to read most of the time.

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"This game has been a really great experience for me. I've been longing for a fantasy setting and Metaphor: ReFantazio satisfies that longing. It does have a lot of similarities to the Persona series, but I personally enjoy this game more than the Persona games. I have not played through Shin Megami series yet so I cannot give an opinion on that. 

The writing in this game is done so well. There is something about it that is very captivating and I am really glad for that because it is what keeps me going through the grind. Be prepared for some difficult fights... the JRPG grind is the one thing I dislike about the genre, but the archetype system at least makes it a bit more fun because you can switch it up and there's a lot of fun classes to play. One thing in particular that I really like about this game is the bond lvls with characters will rank up no matter what dialogue options you choose. It definitely makes it a lot easier to max out all bond lvls in a single playthrough.

It's really fun to travel and explore in this game, despite some places taking multiple days to get to, which means you really need to manage your time well between doing side stuff and main story quests.  Each area is so different from each other and this game really touches on cultural differences and displays many occasions of prejudice, which I can appreciate since it adds a bit of realism to the game. Aside from seeing more places, there are various activities you can do while traveling and some social links need to be done while you are traveling, which is even more of a reason to do it.

Most of the characters have amazing backstories and they felt like real people. I was really surprised by a couple of them because of the emotional impact. Also, the Japanese voice acting is amazing and fits all of the characters well. In particular, the voice actor for Heismay makes him come across more as a bad ass rather than some annoying squeaky character. The latter is what I expected when I saw his character. 

This game is beautiful. I am so in love with the art style. There are not enough words to describe how much I love it. I could praise this game forever. It has become one of my favorites and I have not even finished it yet. I knew within the first five minutes of the game that it would be one I would really enjoy. It is pricey, but I think it is worth the full price. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a lengthy JRPG to sink your time into.","Very Positive91% of the 10,386 user reviews for this game are positive.",great longing fantasy setting metaphor satisfies longing similarity persona series personally enjoy persona game not_played shin megami series cannot_give writing captivating glad keep grind prepared difficult fight jrpg grind dislike genre archetype make bit fun switch fun class play particular bond lvls character rank no_matter dialogue option choose definitely make easier max bond lvls single playthrough fun travel explore despite place taking multiple day mean manage side stuff quest different touch cultural difference display occasion prejudice appreciate add bit realism aside seeing place activity traveling social link traveling character amazing backstories real surprised couple emotional impact japanese voice acting amazing fit character particular voice actor heismay make across bad as rather annoying squeaky latter expected saw beautiful love art style not_enough word describe love praise forever favorite not_even finished knew five minute enjoy pricey worth price highly recommend lengthy jrpg sink

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"[h1]My Review of The Sims 4.[/h1]

The Sims 4 is arguably seen as the worst of the Sims titles. It gets a bad rep from those who prefer the previous titles. Let’s jump into this further.

Here are some features and game mechanics that people usually bring up and that I personally miss.

[h1]1.	Create-A-Style[/h1]
The ability to change the texture, colour and material of surfaces and clothes for extended customization.

[h1]2.	Sliders for Create-A-Sim[/h1]
Another staple in The Sims 3 CAS was the ability to tweak the colour of your Sim’s skin and make-up to almost anything you desired giving you yet more customization and personality.

[h1]3.	Open Worlds[/h1]
This feature was a staple in the Sims series. It gave you the ability to move across the entire world, and see other Sims interacting with things around them. It gave the world more depth.

[h1]4.	Trait System[/h1]
In the Sims 2 and 3, you had a plethora of traits that you could assign your Sim giving them a more complex and realistic personality.

[h1]5.	Story Progression[/h1]
This isn't really a feature commonly explored in the Sims series, but it was there in tandem with the expansion packs if you so wished to pursue.

Okay…so…The Sims 4 has a few technical limitations and is missing some features from previous titles that we all know and love, but people tend to highlight the faults and failures and gloss over the positives. Here are some of my personal favourites.

[h1]1.	Expanded Create-A-Sim Features[/h1]
Sims no longer all look the same! Did you ever notice that Sims in 2 and  3* all looked a bit similar? There weren’t many facial features or structures for you to mould to your liking. The new* click-and-drag feature in Create-A-Sim gives you so much more pliability and with preset facial features to play with, you can make something really unique. For further detail I would recommend watching [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmtGfTj-to] The Sims 4: Create A Sim Official Gameplate Trailer [/url]

[h1]2.	Extended Build/Buy Mode[/h1]
Creating the perfect home has never been easier. It’s now so more fun to build than ever, and with Build & Buy Mode merged into one it’s a more fluid experience. For more detail I would recommend watching [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KSFkcKBBMo] The Sims 4: Build Mode Official Gameplate Trailer [/url]

[h1]3.	The New art Style[/h1]
A new art style that I believe harkens back to the roots of classic style of The Sims. While The Sims 3 tried to go for the more realistic overtones, it didn’t succeed very well and sadly stepped into the uncanny valley.

[h1]4.	Multi-tasking Interactions[/h1]
Most* interactions are more believable. The new feature of being to multi-task is quite handy…and while it isn’t perfect, it still makes some* interactions more realistic and fluid rather than waiting for the next thing in the queue to happen.

[h1]5.	Hardware Performance[/h1]
Unlike The Sims 3, 4* is extremely well optimized. I tested this on of my lowest-spec laptops and at maximum settings  it hardly dropped in frames.
Granted 3* goes for the more realistic approach but can be costly.

[h1]Epilogue[/h1]
I think we should talk about the elephant in the room, and that is overpriced, overvalued expansion and game packs.
EA have always made bad business decisions that have deterred their customers from this franchise. The one that stands out the most is the marketing DLC. In my personal opinion and the opinion of others, game packs are marketed at exorbitant prices, some costing even more than base game’s value. Believe it or not, this is still an issue even with The Sims 3. Game packs don’t seem to have decreased in value over the span of 12 years. This definitely threw me off initially…but I’m a sucker for interesting DLC.

[h1]Note[/h1]
When disputing the bad business decisions, please do not confuse EA with Maxis. EA are the publishers and the ones in charge of business. Maxis are the true beholders of the Sims series. sadly, in some cases, publishers like EA turn games into cash cows and they become soulless corporate entities.

After having played The Sims 4 for over 250 hours, I can definitely recommend it.

I hope this short review helps you decide what to do,

This game is NOT the result of veteran mmo devs who learned from past mmo mistakes. This game is NOT the result of a game studio that had a bigger budget than any other studio in history to make a quality mmo.

They should have followed FF14's example, and put the game back into development for however long they needed to fix the engine, finish the various game elements, and replace all the copy/pasted content with actual hand crafted content.","Mixed68% of the 243,329 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_the proud honored dedicated development prioritized shortcut copy paste lack effort else result vastly unfinished buggy glitchy not_the result veteran massively multiplayer online learned past massively multiplayer online mistake not_the result studio bigger budget studio history quality massively multiplayer online followed ff14 example development long needed fix engine finish element replace copy pasted actual hand crafted

I tried this game with low expectation. And to be honest, surprisingly I'm having a blast playing it. It doesn't really bringing anything new compared to the other Battle Royale MOBA, but almost everything in this game is really well done.
It also has a heavy ""aim vs dodge"" mechanic like in Battlerite, which I really miss. So its a huge plus for me.

2344520,Diablo® IV,"'Play for free' means silently and factly 'play the demo which is free anyway but Steam doesn't know'.

[i]Two days ago I saw the 'play for free' tag in my store front page for this game. Having no desire to grind this game forever this looked like a perfect opportunity to experience most of the story. [/i] 

[h2]The positives [/h2]
Blizzard has very talented employees to create beautiful games. 

[h2]And the rest... [/h2]
Before D3 I was a massive Blizzard fan. Got every collector's edition of every game they made. With D3 they experimented on their customers with their real money auctionhouse, and prioritising this portion while the game was a buggy mess. I completely abandoned my fandom and went to play Torchlight 2 on Steam. Meanwhile Blizzard completely destroyed itself by executive decisions and inappropriate behaviour. 

Yet, there still is a lot of good people working there too, so when I saw the advertisement of play for free I liked to check out what 11 years has done. As I was playing I got an advertisement to buy the game. This is weird in my eyes, because if you want to give players the opportunity to try the game, the game has to speak for its own. Giving advertisements during game play, that's just mobile practices, with no confidence in the game nor respect for players. Predatory. And then shamelessly kicking players out of their game at level 20 without a notice beforehand. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3096757650

It's surprising that Blizzard came to Steam, home of many of their fled customers. On paper looks like a sound business decision, but also a platform for reviews. Boy, there is a lot of nostalgia with boomers like me, and indeed the play for free dragged me in. I would have even written an overall positive review if I was able to continue. 

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
I wasn't prepared for the speed of levelling, gear acquisition and the story progression. I haven't played an action RPG in a while, so I guess the genre as a whole is way more streamlined. And I also guess that's more tailored for younger people. I like aspects of it, for instance one-click vendoring. But the world matching your level is a bit boring for me. You're never over- or underpowered which is important for me, but maybe I'm alone in that view. 

The story after one act is boring. I don't care for Lilith, and thus far it's incredibly dull. She feels close to some humans, humanlike even. The appeal from the old games was the vast power of Diablo, and for me Deckard Cain. The most stupid decision was to kill him off in D3. 

The game has five classes to choose between, and this feels lean. The music feels dull. Not the impressive Matt Uelmen score. I hope they payed royalties for the iconic guitar moments. The pets magically teleport ladders and cliffs *points at BG3*.

The experience is a good reflection of Blizzard today I'm afraid.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Destiny 2 is a ""loot & shoot,"" MMO based FPS game. Destiny 2 features a wide variety of options and play styles to comfort you, the player; whether you're an aggressive fast-paced player vs. player gamer to relaxed team based player vs. environment gamer, Destiny 2 has something to offer you.

 Destiny 2 itself without DLC's as of 01/02/21 gives you access to only first year content for the majority of itself, however, the content provided is enough to generate an idea of what the game is and has to come in future years. Based off of it's predecessor, Destiny 1, it follows the same mechanics but more fluent and provides a clean and polished feel in the player vs. environment field and the player vs. player field. The first year of Destiny 2 content provided allows you to try; player vs. player content, and player vs. environment content. These activities ranging from the crucible, to the strikes, and to gambit. Destiny 2 itself is optimized exceptionally well and is able to perform well on mid-range computers, and possibly low-range depending on build.

Per Bungie, this game does have a roadmap for what's next in the Destiny series to come after the year of ""Beyond Light."" Over the term of each annual expansion a seasons pass will be optional to purchase, allowing the player to new seasonal content, content ranging from new player vs. environment activities, to new player vs. player activities.

Destiny 2 unfortunately does require the last 3 expansions to have up-to-date access to all activities, these expansions being; ""Forsaken"" (2018), ""Shadowkeep"" (2019), and ""Beyond Light"" (2020). ""Forsaken,"" following a story about Fallen antagonist escaping a location named the Prison of Elders. ""Shadowkeep,"" following a story about the Hive retaking the moon and bringing back alternated versions of previous bosses. And ""Beyond Light,"" which follows a Fallen antagonist, Eramis, discovering a power called ""Stasis"" to use and take over Europa.

Overall, Destiny 2 has a variety for all players ranging from the player vs. player field, to the player vs. environment field. 
Try out the free version, it has lots to offer and show off. Ranging from the crucible, to the strikes, and to gambit.

Engineers rejoice. Learn Technology, Automation and Efficiency in one easy to learn package. No? Seriously. this is a hard game to put down. 

Let's take a typical late game scenario.

Assembler #28, manufacturing Advanced Electronics (let's call it a PCB) has a bottleneck and it's dragging down the entire electronic circuit assembly line.

I took a look at the insertor (a small robotic feeder arm) sitting idle as copper coils were swallowed up by the identical assemblers before it reached #28. Obviously I need to increase copper coil production.

Soo... I took a look at the copper coil assemblers, already sporting a Tech III speed beacon and Tech III efficiency modules and noticed that the copper plate was in short supply.

Sooo... I took a look at the copper ore smelting furnaces, also sporting (hard earned) Tech III modules and noticed the selectors feeding those were too slow and were skipping every second ore.

Sooo... I upgraded the selectors to fast selectors and solved the problem.

Or did I?

10 minutes later, Assembler #28 is doing it again. I repeat the above mitigation steps and notice the increase in insertor efficiency at the furnaces is depleting the ore feeder line. I have to increase ore production at the mining drills. Obvious right? 

Sooo... my first thought is to add Tech modules to increase speed but... because the PCB production line is effectively in stasis I can't make more modules just yet so I have to do it the more obvious way. Add a new mining drill. Right?

Sooo... I went to get some iron plate BUT... there is none free because it's also being used on the PCB production line. I ran down the conveyor belt, scooping up iron plate, made my mining drill, ran down to the ore fields, installed a power line, placed the drill and.... lost power.

Sooo.... While I started to manufacture more panels and accumulators to add more power... the aliens came and with no power on my defenses, it took a superhuman effort to eradicate them using my flamethrower and Power Armor (Mk II of course). My personal construction bots all the while repairing what I damaged with my aggressive flame attack.

Meanwhile.... Because I had stolen the iron plate off the PCB production line the copper coil problem was sorted... at least... temporarily.

Then my sulfuric acid production stopped, which makes my batteries which is used to make my logistic bots that supply the whole higher end production chain... including my research.... because I ran out of..... iron plates.

I'll have to redesign the whole damn thing. Tomorrow. 

Or maybe I can just do this little bit now...

..oo00oo..

To sum it up, the slowish start and slightly difficult-to-get-used-to UI initially only lasts a few minutes. There is plenty of online information to get started but half the fun is working it out for yourself. Within a few hours your plan and the objectives become clear and obvious, 

The best methodology required to achieve those objectives? A whole new matter.

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"This game has so so many bugs. Most of them you can overcome with a fast restart. But if there is a queue for over 3 hours, that is not an option. So you just play along, bug and all. 

Then I decided to use my transfer token to move to a much less crowded server. I don't care much for PVP or endgame at this moment because I play this game very casual, a bit of gathering a bit of fishing a bit of questing. Not rushing to get to endgame. So I transferred from Hellheim (queu 3h+) to Amenti with my two friends. It was back than only 68% full so a good choice to migrate to. Now a week later... the server is again full and there are queues.... Why does Amazon even allow people to transfer to an already full server???

But to make matters worse, today I tried to login and it seems that my login has been blocked because of suspicious software or corrupted installation. I tried to fix it with all kinds of tips people suggested online. Reinstall the game, removing a certain file and verifying steam files, etc. Nothing worked. 

After browsing on the New World forum, it appears that a lot of people had this issue. Some  got a perma-ban shortly after seeing this message. I have never done anything weird or abuse an exploit/glitch/dupe in the game. But yet I still am scared that the ban-hammer will hit my account by mistake. After having spoken to an Amazon representative they could confirm my account was not flagged for a ban. 

Instead of enjoying a bit of gathering and a bit of PVE to relax... this game is giving me so much stress right now.

If you doubt about getting this game. PLEASE DON'T GET IT. Wait for them to fix some of these annoying bugs and sort out their server population.

*Update: I can confirm, yesterday I received a perma-ban for ""cheating"". I am so disappointed and so furious. Reading on the forum that a lot of people received this ban after the first login error message. People have different claims why this happened for no reason. Some claim it happens when you fish too long (the system thinks you are a bot), some claim it happens when you lag too much (the system thinks you are trying to bypass something and try to dupe). I appealed the ban. Just have to wait to see what happens. I will post an update once I get a confirmation from Amazon.

*Update 2 I received a reply to my appeal. Here is what they said: "" We reserve the right to determine what constitutes unfair play and to take corrective action we deem appropriate.

As a result, your New World account remains permanently banned.

We can’t share any further information about our decision, and we won’t reply to further emails about this issue.""

So a ban without prove or explanation... 

*Update 3 After years of waiting, I decide to give it another try and see if perhaps I could be unbanned finally. They admitted at least the reason why I got banned, although again with no evidence and also incorrect information about a penalty.

Their reply: We reviewed the information you provided on appeal and have confirmed that the original disciplinary action was merited in your case for Cheating: Botting Behavior based on in-game data and reports.  You have been issued 1 penalty within 11-05-21 but have continued to exhibit Cheating behavior. / The account was found to have used a known cheat program. Given the history of penalties on this account, any further appeals on this issue will not result in a different outcome. We take these issues seriously as it is harmful to the community and violates our Code of Conduct .

There was no way to respond on their message so I send a message to customer support. 

My reply: According to the moderator I was issued 1 penalty on 11-05-21, but this is NOT correct. I NEVER received any penalties to point out my violation of the code of conduct. I haven't cheated and nor will I condone any such thing. My account got instantly banned, with NO explanation and NO communication from your side.  I made already a few appeals, without receiving any further evidence or any HUMAN reply. Your assessments are wrong and unjust and unless you are willing to provide evidence to the contrary; then I am prepared to initiate legal proceedings to force the matter.

But of course in reply they just claimed a decision is made and that it can't be undone. This is so unfair and I wish there was a way to take on such a big scamming company as Amazon.

1282270,Strinova,"This is more fun than I was expecting. I have friends who really did not want to touch a shooter that I convinced to try it out, and they begrudgingly admitted they enjoyed it. So, if you're a beginner that wants to play a shooter, perhaps this one could be for you.
Its an interesting take on the whole counterstrike clone thing, being able to turn into a jpeg at will (looks as goofy as it sounds), and the characters are actually unique and fun, which is where quite a few live service games like this fall flat, I feel.
What else, what else... Oh, theres a story that seems... Mildly interesting.
There are a few problems with this game - the UI, while very clean and easy to use, is a bit glitchy at the moment. Sometimes I need to click out and in because it'll freeze up for no reason. I expect them to get that sorted though.
Also, they removed cross-region, which is the only reason why people are downvoting this game. I personally don't give a crap, I like having a region-locked matchmaking system, but it was like that in the beta, and now people can't even join their friends who are in different regions, which was just a bad decision. They could've kept their old system and been fine.

You literally have around 10-20% of the people using mods, who just mess with you when you try to do missions (putting you in cages, killing you over and over again with their godlike/teleportation mode on etc). 

I would have bought in game money for real money if it wasn't for the cheaters. Why would I spend one dollar more on this game where other players can just download cheats and give themselves infinite money? GTA Online could have been one of the biggest, if not the biggest online game if your management weren't absolutey morons. Happy you guys never became as big as Fortnite, you idiots don't deserve it at all.

Edit: To make things clear, I hate Fortnite lol. I've tried it twice, uninstalled both times within 30 minutes. You can go check Twitch, movies, shows, everyone is streaming/talking about Fortnite. Never said it was a good game but at least they try and they put out a lot of content and deal with cheaters which is why they've had big success. You can't argue against their success no matter what you think of their game. Rockstar pretends like nothing while so many cheaters are running rampart, ruining everyones experience. Real shame because I really loved the game itself, but I'm tired of cheaters messing with you for NO reason. Just for the attention because their life have no meaning and no one cares about them in real life.","Very Positive87% of the 1,741,767 user reviews for this game are positive.",today guy original feared gta online die slow death arrival red dead redemption 2 mode multiple player interact compete real mode console no_gta online died moron decided pay play peer peer connection dedicated server mod cheat consequence literally 10 20 mod mess mission putting cage killing godlike teleportation mode bought real cheater spend dollar player download cheat infinite gta online biggest not_the biggest online management absolutey moron happy guy never_became big fortnite idiot deserve thing clear hate fortnite lol tried twice uninstalled time 30 minute check twitch movie show streaming talking fortnite never_said good deal cheater big success argue success no_matter rockstar pretend cheater running rampart ruining everyones real shame loved tired cheater messing no_reason attention life no_meaning no_one care real life

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"As many have said, it’s an average game, but a very-very bad Dragon Age.

It looks like Bioware needed to find money for a new Mass Effect or justify its existence, I don’t know. This game, developed in 2-3 years at most, has typical action patterns on the level of Assassins Creed, simple side quests, corridor locations, and sponge enemies.

Nothing to say about dialogues, lore, narrative - ChatGPT level, no depth (only GODS). Don’t like the new canon story either - why make up something new when the old one worked well?

What’s good - graphics, 2D art (as always), voice actors, only a couple of quests and some new companions/regions. If you just want to chill and push buttons sometimes - The Veilguard will be a decent decision.

But if you want to spend 40-50 hours and get rich lore/cool mechanics or just an interesting RPG - play Dragon Age: Origins /  Inquisition, Baldur’s Gate 3, Planescape: Torment, Tyranny, you name it.","Mostly Positive71% of the 24,035 user reviews for this game are positive.",average very_emphasized bad age look bioware needed mass effect justify existence developed 2 3 year typical action pattern assassin creed simple side quest corridor location sponge enemy dialogue lore narrative chatgpt no_depth god canon old worked good graphic 2d art voice actor couple quest companion region chill push button decent decision spend 40 50 hour rich lore cool mechanic interesting role play age origin inquisition baldur gate 3 planescape torment tyranny name

1790600,DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO,"From a fellow PS2-era BT3 player, this game is a dynamic yet nostalgic reboot of the series with so many great pros that far diminish the (valid) cons. Absolutely recommend it to BOTH Dragonball and non-Dragonball fans as just a good combat game.

Looking at its face value core gameplay- this arena fighter's hand-to-hand combos and Ki ability based combat is jawdropping. The hand-to-hand combat feels so tight and intuitive once YOU LEARN IT. It gets quite deep but if you practice enough, it becomes muscle memory. You can chain combo opponents into oblivion but theres also a variety of defensive counters to help you against getting combo'd (Not to mention the offensive counters to the defensive counters x_x) which is best left to the surprisingly in-depth tutorial system to explain. Just trust that you will feel extremely rewarded to learn how to extend you chain combos. Whether in singleplayer or multiplayer- you can get by with typical button mashing- but the challenge will ramp up eventually in both areas where you WILL need to learn the combat mechanics.

With the Ki based abilities (beams, blasts, bombs etc)- what can I say- it feels as stunning as it did back in the good old BT3 days, except it now also LOOKS stunning in Unreal Engine. The colours, particle effects, fidelity and all just FEEL right.
 
Coming to my cons for this game- like everyone who's reviewed the game so far has echoed- the story mode (episode battle) feels incredibly lack-lustre and I cant believe this series which used to be renowned with excellent singleplayer modes has resorted to Sparking Zero's approach of powerpoint-esque slides with barren dialogue style of storytelling. It takes away SO MUCH of the emotion that you may have gotten from watching the anime or reading the mangas, especially since the game RUSHES through the arcs so fast you would miss them if you blinked. Now the speed of storytelling may be a good or bad thing depending on what type of player you are. So if you ARE looking for a serious, cinematic story based Dragonball game- stick to Kakarot. You would think after 13 years since the last entry, they would have put more effort into the main gamemode for many players.
HOWEVER, one factor absolutely SAVES the episode battles- the What-IF scenarios (sparking episodes). There's quite a respectable amount of them in the game. Some of them may end very abruptly with little open ended interpretation, some may go through unexplored paths in certain arcs that will eventually line back up with the main canon timeline, BUT some of them create entirely new timeline arcs that are vastly different from canon. And its the combination of ALL of these sparking episodes that makes the episode battles worth playing, as each sparking episode has different unlock criterias. 

Next, the lack of any OTHER gamemodes other than the various tournament gamemodes, most of them feeling just the same as each other with minor rule changes.

Further, A lot of the playable characters are straight up locked behind long gameplay commitment. As your player level rises by playing, you unlock the ability to purchase more characters in the shop. Alternatively, a vast range of characters are also unlocked by completing episode battles AND sparking episodes. So, you gotta commit quite a while to unlock everything. I personally dont mind this as its Bandai's way of ensuring some sort of gameplay loop and replayability. But unlocking all characters personally took me around 25 hours of gameplay. 

Finally, the multiplayer- be aware that this game IS unbalanced with its character rosters, The obviously stronger characters perform and intuitively feel better than the obviously weaker characters. This is part of the Tenkaichi/Sparking series identity to make you FEEL powerful when playing as those characters. You WILL feel proud if you take down stronger characters with weaker characters if you are better than your opponent player if thats your thing. But if you expect all characters to be equal- this is not it. PS.- I DONT MIND THIS, I ENJOY THIS ASPECT OF UNBALANCEDNESS.

TL;DR Incredibly strong fighting game, let alone a dragonball game with high highs but mediocre lows. Graphics are excellent. combat is butter, what-if stories are crazy, strong characters FEEL powerful, multiplayer can be fun if accepting the series identiy.

238960,Path of Exile,"I've spent about as much money on this game as I would have on a similar non-F2P RPG and I still feel guilty.

There is no mechanical advantage to paying for the (kick-ass) cosmetic changes. But if I'm ever flush with cash I'll be sinking more coin into Path of Exile.

1401590,Disney Dreamlight Valley,"I have mixed feelings about Disney Dreamlight Valley, and unfortunately, the negatives far outweigh the positives. On the surface, it's a charming game with potential, but the developers' relentless focus on squeezing money out of players through microtransactions has tarnished the experience.

One of the most frustrating aspects is the constant testing of players who paid to be testers themselves. Instead of genuinely valuing their input, it feels like the developers are using us as guinea pigs to determine just how much they can get away with charging for in-game content.

The pricing of certain items is simply outrageous. Charging $20 for small quests is downright excessive. These quests, while enjoyable, are not worth the steep price tag, leaving a sour taste in the mouth of those who expected fairer pricing.

To make matters worse, the inclusion of a Scrooge skin priced at $10 is a perfect example of how out of touch the developers are. This skin doesn't even contribute to the immersive experience as Scrooge remains confined indoors, completely detached from the magical valley. It's a clear cash grab, preying on players' nostalgia without providing any meaningful content.

Additionally, the star path rewards are heavily skewed towards motifs, which are predominantly useless in the grand scheme of gameplay. Obtaining 50% or more motifs as rewards feels like a slap in the face to dedicated players who invest time and effort into progressing.

Disney Dreamlight Valley had the potential to be a fantastic game, but its monetization strategies have severely compromised the enjoyment and value for money. The constant testing of players and exorbitant prices for trivial content, combined with underwhelming rewards, demonstrate a lack of respect for the player base. It's disheartening to witness such exploitative practices in what could have been a truly magical experience.

Please note that I have spent hundreds of hours playing Disney Dreamlight Valley, and my criticism stems from a genuine desire for the game to reach its full potential. While I have invested my time into the experience, it is essential to emphasize that being a dedicated player should not translate into being treated as a mere source of revenue.","Very Positive91% of the 16,111 user reviews for this game are positive.",mixed feeling unfortunately negative far outweigh positive surface charming potential developer relentless focus squeezing player microtransactions tarnished frustrating aspect constant testing player paid tester genuinely valuing input feel developer guinea pig determine charging pricing certain item simply outrageous charging 20 small quest downright excessive quest enjoyable not_worth steep price tag leaving sour taste mouth expected fairer pricing matter worse inclusion scrooge skin priced 10 perfect example touch developer skin contribute immersive scrooge remains confined indoors completely detached magical clear cash grab preying player nostalgia providing meaningful star path reward heavily skewed towards motif predominantly useless grand scheme obtaining 50 motif reward feel slap face dedicated player invest effort progressing potential fantastic monetization strategy severely compromised enjoyment value constant testing player exorbitant price trivial combined underwhelming reward demonstrate lack respect base disheartening witness exploitative practice truly magical please note spent hundred hour criticism stem genuine desire reach potential invested essential emphasize dedicated not_translate treated mere source revenue
236390,War Thunder,"[h1] The non-exhaustive list of scummy things Gaijin does purely for profit. [/h1]

Disclaimer: This is a list compiled by u/agysykedyke on Reddit. It aggregates and summarises the abhorrently antagonistic and hostile behaviour Gaijin has shown their community and players throughout the years. This is but a fraction of the malevolence characteristic of this company.

Addendum: My total hours played on Steam are not representative of how long I've spent in War Thunder. I've been playing this game since the beta and have played it on multiple platforms throughout the last ten years with much of it being played through Gaijin's own launcher. After having been disgusted and physically repulsed by Gaijin's treatment of their community over the last two years, I've decided that enough was enough. I have watched this game deteriorate and it is no longer the game that I once enjoyed and hoped would become a maverick of its genre. It exists only as a tragedy of what could have been.

[quote=agysykedyke] [i] In light of the new awful economy changes, I have compiled a list of all the scummy things Gaijin does which worsen the experience for all players, in the name of profit only. I really hope they change some of these things for the better. [/i]

[olist]
[*]Intentionally releasing new vehicles in an overpowered state in order to make people grind as quickly as they can to abuse them before the nerfs.

[*]Intentionally releasing overpowered premium vehicles and not nerfing them, in order to make people purchase them.

[*]The price of said premiums being equal to triple-A games. I don't know how it's excusable for some premiums to be $70 when they already sell premium accounts for $10 a month.

[*]Intentionally making SL modifiers low and repair costs high, so that the average player cannot break even in SL after a game. This encourages them to purchase a premium account or a premium vehicle. This also encourages players to leave after one death to minimize losses.

[*]Implementing research efficiency and tiers to make players buy more than one premium per nation in order to grind. Keep in mind each premium can cost up to $70.

[*]Forcing players to buy a vehicle previous to the one they want to buy, regardless if they ever want to use it. A lot of vehicles should be in a folder but are not, because Gaijin wants you to spend more SL.

[*]Forcing players to buy X vehicles from the previous tier before they can buy vehicles in the next tier. This increases the grind and forces you to buy vehicles that you might never have any intention of playing.

[*]Still making the SL and RP grind painfully slow even if you are using Premium vehicles and a Premium account, especially at the top tiers. Mind you you are paying $10/month + the price of 2-3 premiums per nation you want to grind and it's still very slow.

[*]Intentionally making stock vehicle performance extremely insufferable by locking away essential needs such as Spare Parts, FPE, NVD, usable ammo, and countermeasures. This is to make players purchase these modifications with GE.

[*]Introducing crew qualifications, which are arguably a pay-to-win feature. Aced crews provide significant advantages over basic. The SL cost for expert crews and the grind for Ace crews are not viable for the average player, people just purchase Ace crews.

[*]Putting players in debt over their own mistake after the January 2022 incident. They could have just let those players keep their 7 days of premium as a New Year's gift and take the good publicity but they doubled down. This was so bad that some players were going to take legal action because they felt as if they got scammed, and Gaijin was forced to remove the debt because of the insane backlash.

[*]Selling pay-to-win bush cosmetics, which otherwise are extremely hard to grind for, are unavailable for half the year, and you only get one random bush.

[*]Implementing an RP soft cap, which punishes skillful players because otherwise they would grind too quickly and won't be compelled to spend money.

[*]Introducing strike drones, to make the game more frustrating and to make people lose SL. If you get 2 kills and then die with your drone it will be less SL earned than the repair costs of what you killed due to the modifiers, a net negative overall.

[*]Intentionally making one nation overpowered, then making a different nation overpowered in order to make players purchase premiums to grind the new overpowered nation.

[*]Intentionally keeping the BR's compressed in order to make the game more random and frustrating, to limit skillful players, and make players more likely to spend GE on mods, crews or premiums.

[*]Intentionally making minor nations have underpowered vehicles with very high repair costs and low modifiers, because they are played by mostly experienced players who would otherwise grind too quickly.

[*]Making Boosters expire for no reason other than to take advantage of FOMO

[*]Slashing the economy time after time but disguising it as a net positive. For example, making the players ""choose"", but nerfing the economy either way and putting the blame on the players.

[*]Introducing extremely grindy events with vehicles that never return, or are sometimes OP, capitalizing on FOMO.

[*]Introducing lootbox-style crates bought for GE, or ridiculous amounts of SL, with very low chances of getting the reward you want. This is effectively gambling at worst and very predatory at best.
[/olist]

[i] They do not need to be this aggressive when it comes to monetization. This game already makes so much, I just hope they start caring more about their player base and less about their profits. [/i] [/quote]

The collective anger and frustration felt by not only myself but the community at large cannot adequately be expressed in writing, but we shall still make the attempt. Any prospective players beware, [b] you will be actively punished and penalised for playing this game and not giving your money over to Gaijin. [/b] I have seen the community take action before, but I truly hope that this marks a period of reckoning and penance for Gaijin's actions against us.

Edit: 8 June 2024. Gaijin has relented and acquiesced to some of what the community has been asking for throughout the years but it is not enough and it has come with its own set of problems. They have also decided that charging $75 USD for top tier premium vehicles—something they previously stated they would never do—is acceptable and will no doubt continue to add more of these premiums as time goes on. They are refusing to reimplement Air RB EC, a mode that the community has been pleading for since its brief introduction, and instead have opted to reduce team sizes at top tier to 12v12 which is still not enough to remediate the problems plaguing Air RB. Ground and Naval are both facing their own share of issues which have yet to be addressed nor rectified. Essentially, nothing has changed. Take your time and money elsewhere and to those more deserving.

EDIT 2: 26 July 2024. Another review bomb for Gaijin, it seems. Well, it is certainly deserved. They have not only reversed the gains of the past year by spitting in the players faces with yet another insulting economy change but the recent Battle Passes have been nothing short of disgraceful. AI profile icons. Unfinished vehicles. LESS vehicles than before—­as a matter of fact, the most recent BP only has TWO vehicles. The ""roadmap"" was smoke and mirrors. After the initial implementations, the additions have all come with caveats and now they are outright degrading. The economy RP update does nothing to aid players in researching their vehicles quickly and effectively. Gaijin wants you to suffer, and it up to you whether you want to be a willing participant in this. Any and all passion for this game that those at Gaijin once had is long gone and will never return.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Completed the game in a group of 4 people (finished all quests).
General impressions and information regarding the content for Early Access:
-Level cap at level 25. After reaching level 25, you receive 0 XP, which can demotivate further grinding, but it takes time to reach it.
-Altar cap at level 6. The last Altar unlocks a very small section of the desert biome where enemies can be level 30.
-The winter biome is unavailable in early access.
-The surrounding fauna changes depending on the biome, but enemies or mini-bosses not (I'm talking about bandit camps. It would be nice to see diversity in this aspect in the future).
-Temples of the Sun, etc., add a very interesting puzzle aspect to the game, giving depth and a pleasant feeling of exploration.
-Waiting for some resources to craft can take 10 minutes, which I believe artificially extends the game time.
-Boss fights are often engaging and give off a very Soulslike atmosphere due to the difficulty level and combat system.
-The building system is enjoyable, although initially it may seem clunky.
-Lack of ability to change enchants or enchant armor. Considering how rarely we are able to find new equipment (not talking about crafting), such a feature should be available, and I also hope this will change in the future.
-Exploring the map is fun. Finding villages, resources, interesting locations creates the impression that behind every hill, we can discover some interesting point. The world definitely gives the impression of authenticity.
-The lack of physics when cutting down trees or destroying surfaces can detract from immersion.
-Skill tree could offer better and more useful skills.

Despite numerous flaws or unmet expectations in several areas, for an early access game and at a reasonable price, I consider it worth recommending for those who enjoy games like Valheim. There are clear inspirations from Dark Souls, Zelda, and Valheim, but this does not hinder the game from delivering fun.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn't recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level.
I hope this review is helpful.

230410,Warframe,"Caution: Overly detailed, so I am very sorry

      So I've been playing this game for about 3 years now, and this has easily become one of my most played games that I own. Not even exclusive to steam. Warframe is a game that takes place in space, where you take control of a 'Tenno', which is the faction/race of everyone else that plays. What is a Tenno? Well... play for yourself, and you'll find out with time. -wink-

""What is a Warframe?""
      Warframes are the battle-suits that you control. You walk as them, you fight as them, you hang out as them...you pretty much ARE the Warframe. (Yes, I told you that you are a Tenno as well. Like I said, it's just a suit. It's complicated.) There are currently 29 different Warframes to collect/build and use, each with their own unique set of flashy abilities. I say 'currently' because the development team behind this game are constantly working on it and sending out updates (also, one of the most enjoyable development teams I've ever seen, tbh), and the community helps shape the game greatly. 
      Anyhow, the Warframes are battle-suits for a reason. In this game, you are a freaking ninja, in probably the most ninja way possible. From wall jumps, slides, air-kicks, backflips, gliding, rolling, super jumps, throwing stars, dual daggers, etc.. You name it, it's probably possible. There is so much movement and control, you can fly through areas like a breeze if you get the hang of the movement system. There is also so much customization in this game. Assault rifles, rocket launchers, bows, crossbows, sniper rifles, shotguns, laser-beams, sawblade launchers, wormhole creators, grenade launchers, laser cannons, lightning shooters, gas cloud launchers, laser-rifles, infested growth that shoots bullets and grappling hooks, freeze-rays, and much more. Also, most of what I just listed are primary weapons, meaning you ALSO have secondary weapons, which are your sidearms, and melee weapons. There are an equal amount of interesting categories for sidearms, but if you are an in-your-face type of player, then enjoy your collection of melee weapons, including single swords, dual swords, katanas, daggers, glaives, bo staffs, polearms, hammers, axes, whips, whip/blade combos, energy-blades--well, you get the point by now. There are many skins for your weapons and your warframes as well. Another thing that heavily affects customization is the fact that you can color anything that you own, from warframes, weapons, companions (little robotic fellows that float behind you with their own supportive abilities..or, you know, a cat or a dog.), armor pieces and scarfs (this game is called Fashionframe by the community for a reason), and even your own ship.
      Your ship serves as your personal hub, where you can access the star chart for missions, your arsenal, your foundry (for building weapons, warframes, gear, and everything else), your mods, and more. What are mods? Mods are these little cards that drop from enemies in the game, some mods being specific to certain enemies. They also have tiers of rarity. Anyway, mods are a very important feature, and are used for upgrading your warframes and weapons. There are hundreds of different mods, ranging from additional health percentages, additional damage, elemental damage (which you can mix different elements to form new elements, might I add), ability range, and just...pretty much anything you need to help you progress and spice up the gameplay a bit more. Want a silenced loadout for stealth? There are mods for that. Screw stealth, you want explosions? Mods.

""Who are the bad guys?""
      There are a handful of different factions in the game, mostly all of them against the Tenno. 
There are the Grineer, who are crude, ugly, bulky clones of other Grineer, made to produce a massive army. Usually found in their battleships, or their own settlements, destroying the planet's landscape with machinery. They look dumb, but can be pretty tough.
      Another faction is the Corpus, who are driven by greed. They are more technologically advanced than the Grineer, using robotics, drones, and lasers in their favor. 
      The Infested is another faction. They are...a bit of a mess. Disgusting heaps and masses of flesh, screeching as they charge to attack. They are basically zombified, destroyed forms of Grineer and Corpus, but you really don't see them that way, considering how mutilated they become. They don't have much of a role other than to spread the virus, and, most importantly, kill you.
      There are a couple of other factions, but they are a bit spoiler-y, so I'll avoid talking about them.

""Why are we doing any of this in the first place?""
      Because Space-mom tells you to, and you must listen to Space-mom.


""....who tf is space-mom?""
      Upon the Tenno's awakening, you are contacted by a mysterious woman by the name of Lotus, who first appears to be an AI of sorts, although taking a humanoid form. You have no memory of anything before this 'awakening', so you should probably listen to her.
      She guides and cares for the entire Tenno faction, alerting them of dangers and important events happening throughout the solar system. She is your leader.

""So what is the main objective, overall?"" +bonus info i dont know where to fit otherwise
      Really, it's anything you want. A lot of players get lost because they don't know what they should be doing, but you are just supposed to make your own personal missions, which you can invite friends to. Also, this is a very heavy co-op based game, so have as much fun as you want with up to 4 players in a squad (or up to 8 in raid missions). You can play this game completely solo if you want, of course. It will be pretty challenging, though.
      So let's start from a new players point-of-view. You have unlocked your first planet. You can continue to do the mission-nodes that it has to offer, all the way up to the planet boss. Each planet also has a newly-added feature, which are known as Junctions. Junctions are what players have to go through to get to the next planet, and will offer a variety of trials before passage. Upon completing a Junction, you are rewarded with a few things, such as blueprints for weapons, a few parts for building a few specific warframes, and they will unlock quests. Quests are side-things that you can do, which also give you some rewards. There are a handful of warframes that are quest-exclusive if you want to obtain them, as well as some helpful items to assist you along the way. Another recent addition (as in since December) are Cinematic Quests. These are main story-related quests that have cutscenes, and usually have a lot to reveal about the lore, and will unlock some other nice things (You still have to unlock these quests from Junctions, or even just through the market.) The in-game market shows mostly all of everything you can get in the game. The best part? You can get most of this for free! Of course you can add money to just BUY weapons, warframes, gear, companions, etc., and gain access to them immediately, but this is not a pay-to-win game. Not at all. It's more of a 'pay-to-progress-faster' game. However, building these things by yourself without paying any real currency can be a fun time-consuming process. The word Fun can be taken literally or sarcastically in this subject, depending on what the building requirements are, for what you are making. You gather resources to build and complete these things from different planets throughout the solar system, each having their own set of different resources. They drop from enemies, loot lockers, and storage containers (there is even a warframe that increases loot drops, while simutaneously punching souls and raising the dead!). Also, you can earn the real-money currency in this game by trading with other players. I'm out of space at this point, but all I have to say is I wish more of my friends could get into this.","Very Positive87% of the 598,811 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

My internal clock runs off of my TC upkeep, I have nightmares of hazmats and grenade launchers. I know the vents on large oil like the back of my hand. I've gotten deeped on by BChillz, dropped low grade to Coco so he can entertain me by taking small oil while I sit in my base. Lifestomper ordered a hit on me and Wild Mike donated my group lots of AK's. I can't bow kids like Posty, but my game sense is equal or better than iRisk. I always finish a wipe after using up a box of rockets or getting raided myself, usually while I toss and turn in my bed. I learned the AK spray and then FacePunch changed it. My first wipe with boats was amazing, I kept 14 in a boat base to myself. My first ever wipe I met friends I still talk to 3 years later. HJune has highlighted me, and I have highlighted him as well. You don't play this game to get a sense of accomplishment, you play to make plays. After raiding a compound with your friends and finding a box full of GP and another box of rockets, you realize you can snowball. What you don't realize is that you're hooked. You progress so much that when you wind up back to a rock and torch, you don't see it as a set back, but as a chance to do something different. Add in insane building mechanics and an electricity system, monuments, helicopters, zergs, cheaters, and finding Helk playing on a 5x solo/duo/trio, you realize the community isn't as big as you think it is. This shit game becomes a way to pass the time, and hot damn. I've loved every hour.

2537590,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024,"EDIT BELOW

People complaining about the game loading. I was just patient and after clearing about 17-19% it took off, immediately loaded packages and even is sensing long load time and creating a report. Not going to let overloaded servers within 1h of launch be the difference between a positive/negative review. 

Looking forward to it and will leave positive unless something actually related to game-play/streaming comes up!

EDIT: After about 30 hours in, subtracting the initial launch problems and the computer waiting to get in, the game is overall fantastic. The career mode is one feature I was awaiting and I'm happy to say, other than a few minor bugs and glitches here and there, it's fantastic!

Graphics over all for my rig are great and the new terrain detail enhancement when doing Rotorcraft SAR missions is a HUGE plus to immersion compared to 2020. Trees have some difference now depending on what terrain is local to that area and a lot of places I've gone back to visit in 2024 that I free flew over in 2020 are updated well as well!

Some cons would be the bugs/glitches on career mode. Given that your graded on performance that helps your overall level to progress some ""dings"" to the grade come from bugs. A prime example is activating flaps in some aircraft leads to a ""Max speed with flaps"" ding although ground speed is zero. Some of the flight path tracking is a little odd and not very cohesive as well, but I've been able to follow it well enough to consistently get A or S grading on my missions.

Overall, the game is gorgeous, addictive, and career mode and progression has given me a goal every time I hook up the SIM controls!

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"With over 11,500 hours played since Realm Reborn, I'll throw in my 2 cents.

I started this game off with the free trial with no expectations, knowledge of the game, or the online community other than the server Balmung was 'the' RP hotspot. Being an RPer myself, I was curious to see what it's like but I had no plans to play past the trial period at that time.

The Pros:
- Beautiful Graphics, great soundtrack.
- PvE is chocked full of simple and fun game mechanics, and even more challenging elements offered to the 'hardcore raiders'
- Lots of different things to do accommodating your interests, goals and play styles. (IE: alternate classes, or gathering and crafting professions)
- Glamour prism system is great for the creative folk that wanna dress up their characters.
- Fun mini games at the Gold Saucer
- Great story content (if you enjoy watching cut-scenes and want to follow the craziness unraveling with every patch)
- Standard leveling is not as grindy as most MMOs I've played in the past.
- One of the Best RP communities I've seen for an MMO (see: Hydaelyn Roleplayers)
- Lalafells

CONS:
- With the game's popularity rising, so too does the odds of being matched with random people with WoW-tier toxicity.
- Player housing is -very- limited, but there is a timeout that make them available for people that wanna try their luck (good luck though) Only downside is the previous owner loses their home, logging in before the timer resets prevents this however.
Which is great for the folk on extended breaks, but frustrating for the folk that want a house.
- End game grinds are grindy
- No world PvP elements (but that could be another 'pro' for some folk)

If you can get past the cons, (needless to say that I did) Final Fantasy XIV can make for a very fun, unique and interesting experience. 

And I happily recommend this over any other MMO currently in today's market.

I played all of the ARPG's out there, and i enjoyed almost all of them but i always had a special place for this series in my heart. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3180832424
To be honest i didn't paid the best attention to the game's story, so i won't be talking about it that much but i can say that it has a decent story. Gameplay is fun, grinding for experience and loot doesn't feels like you're working on a full time job  so it's perfect in my book. World dungeons, World bosses, quests, events and strongholds are entertaining and they contain the best exp and loot for the early and midgame so don't sleep on them. Nightmare Dungeons are the main source of my joy in this game, and that dungeons are the only way to level up your glyphs which is essential to make your character even stronger. Helltide and other endgame content are relatable and i'm glad that they are not exhausting, because it's the only way to get the endgame boss summon items, i hope they will add more sources to get them in the next updates. Classes are self explanatory, i like playing melee characters so Barb and Rogue gameplay is enjoyable for me, but playing a caster is not my style so i don't usually play other than Barbarian and Rogue. It's simple as that, no need to make it complicated. Your items though, you need to pay close attention to them or you will get pretty harsh times on Nightmare difficulty, below nightmare is safe of course but you need to check your character, stats, skills and synergy around them before getting into harder difficulties. Basic ARPG stuff. Tier +100 dungeons... Just experience it, and you will understand that +1 stat and synergy are how important. Game looks stunning for an ARPG, it's definitely a feast for eyes in my opinion. Cinematics are chief's kiss, all of them has an incredible visual and detail in every shot, it almost feels like you're watching a movie for sure. Map is massive, and you got different kind of atmosphere, environment and mob/creature for each region, i hope they will add more mob variety, because i'm kinda greedy. I bet they will add a lot of things season by season, and they will polish the game even more. Overall it's a pretty entertaining game, just don't forget that campaign was just a greeting.","Mostly Positive71% of the 28,017 user reviews for this game are positive.",care love diablo wait play season diablo ii arpg probably addicted genre arpg enjoyed special series heart http steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails id 3180832424 honest paid best attention s_emphasizedtory talking decent fun repeatedly performing action gain resource item reward dropped defeated enemy feel working perfect book world dungeon world boss quest event stronghold entertaining contain best exp item reward dropped defeated enemy early midgame sleep nightmare dungeon source joy dungeon glyph essential stronger helltide endgame relatable glad not_exhausting endgame bos summon item hope add source next update class self explanatory melee character barb rogue enjoyable caster not_my style usually play barbarian rogue s_emphasizedimple no_need complicated item pay close attention pretty harsh time nightmare difficulty nightmare safe course check stats skill synergy harder difficulty basic arpg stuff tier 100 dungeon understand 1 stat synergy important look stunning arpg definitely feast eye cinematics chief kiss incredible visual detail shot feel watching movie massive different kind atmosphere environment monster enemy creature region hope add monster enemy variety kinda greedy bet add thing season season polish pretty entertaining forget series connected mission level form storyline greeting
238960,Path of Exile,This game is one of the best ARPGs on the market. The only thing I don't like is that build making is like 1000 X less accessible than any other game because of how rich and complex PoE is. It has a very steep learning curve so you are in for a challenge (altho according to some experienced players you will feel your bad decisions only at a certain progression (act)). I feel like if I dont follow a build guide online I am doing something wrong (which is also probably the case). I haven't reached the end game once yet so take my review with a grain of salt.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"[h1]The more I reflect on this game, the more let down I feel. For all its hype, it’s painfully underwhelming.[/h1]

[quote]This review will NOT contain spoilers and is only my opinion. Played on GTX 1660Ti, 8GB RAM, i5 9th Gen.[/quote]

[b][u]A Note:[/u][/b] [Amendment post-completion]. [i]Initially I didn't finish this game, but on my third attempt I did finish the story and would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it, but I do still think the rest of the game is very disappointing considering what it was advertised to be. For those who liked it, I'm not attacking you or your beliefs about the game, I’m just sharing my opinion about the game too based on my experience with it.

The whole review has been edited to reflect my changed view of the game now I've finished it.[/i]

[h1]Positives:[/h1]
-	Beautiful graphics and lighting.
-	Sound effects are generally good.
-	When it works, dialogue flows exceptionally well.
-	A diverse, if slightly awkward to use, screenshot mode.
-	The story was quite strong with some very interesting characters.
-	An update amended the driving and now it's better than it was. Not perfect, but better.

[h1]Negatives:[/h1]
-	Story throws too much in, too soon, and it’s hard to keep up. 
-	Early game characters didn't interest me at all. It improved later.
-	Phone calls from NPCs keep coming over dialogue with characters. 
-	Graphical glitches are abundant. 
-	Audio glitches are abundant. 
-	The world has no sense of being lived in thanks to awful AI.
-	The HUD is ugly. 
-	Paid-for bonus content was needlessly hard to find. 
-	Can’t change key binds.
-	Screenshot mode is limited by a lack of a 'free camera' tool. For God's sake CDPR...

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
[quote]This is perhaps the best part of the game. On PC, Cyberpunk 2077 looks beautiful – and I’m not even running it on max. settings.[/quote]

[b]World:[/b]
The detail in the textures the world is made up of is incredible and I found the game a treat to look at, from the things like clutter to structures and landscapes. It’s not without faults but generally, I’ve never seen a better-looking vanilla game. In-game lighting is stunning, and night-city is a beautiful mix of darkness, filth, and neon lights. 

Characters generally look great, affected in a way that feels realistic by physics and sporting high-resolution textures that bring their emotion and features to life, from hair to the pores in their skin. 

However, already I’ve seen an abundance of textures popping in, vehicles that appear as low-resolution blurs, and distant scenery through fog showing horrid solid black shapes. 
The game also by default has film grain and chromatic aberration turned on, which look awful, I don’t know why they did this. 

[b]HUD:[/b] 
I appreciate the intention to make a Cyberpunk-themed HUD but I think this execution was horrible. Almost every aspect of it, from the icons over loot in the in-game world, to the looting, crafting, inventory menus, information is not obvious against the messy UI. Everything looks too busy and distracts you from the information you need.

[h1]Audio:[/h1]
[quote]Audio can be broken into three broad categories, I think, and works well to create atmosphere, but it’s not outstanding, and like the visuals, riddled with glitches.[/quote]

[b]Dialogue:[/b]
Dialogue is good. Speech between NPCs and you (V) play out well for the most part, without long awkward pauses some RPGs give. It feels like a fluid conversation, and I like this. Voice acting is generally strong, and I found times where characters were angry, sad, scared, etc. felt surprisingly more genuine and less acted than in other games.

Most of the prompts you choose to initiate your character’s responses (which are voiced) are good enough that you know what’s going to be said, so you don’t end up giving a reply that you didn’t mean. A lot of the dialogue is 'filler', though, and almost never significantly affects the story, which strips away any sense of it being an RPG at all.

One thing that is really annoying is that you get many calls off NPCs which play over dialogue you’re already in with an NPC right in front of you. This is stupid, and really needs fixing. 

[b]Ambient Sounds:[/b]
These are generally fine and help with immersion. Footsteps, chatter, and other realistic bustle is simulated well, but I noticed many glitches, especially when driving. Car engine sounds are not good, and many times when crashing, no sound would play to indicate it. 

[b]Combat:[/b] 
Guns sound great! I was pleased to find a game that finally has quite harsh, meaty sounding gunshots that add a nice sense of force and weight to the guns. This is completely undermined by the bullet-sponge enemies, sadly, but the sound is on point. Melee weapons aren’t so great but sound heavy and brutal enough to make landing a hit on an enemy feel satisfying.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
[quote]The story is mostly told through the occasional cutscene and vocal interactions with NPCs. It is very dialogue heavy but I don’t mind that, though I’m aware it’s not for everyone.[/quote]

You’re straight away thrown into a situation with a cast who you are then ripped away from, and then again with a new cast… and again... I wouldn’t mind if it felt organic and I had time to connect with the characters, so it felt purposeful, but I this wasn’t the case. Nobody was very deep, or likeable or unlikeable. They were clearly supposed to be, but it felt like the game just told me that rather than genuinely making me feel it. The first few hours felt painfully predictable and with characters so shallow and trivial, despite trying to grind on to see if things improved, I gave up. 

Amendment: For me, the second half of this game's story saved it. Later on, you meet some interesting characters that actually stay around long enough for you to care, and things start to feel more genuine and meaningful as a result. I still wasn't as moved by this game as plenty of others I've played, but it would be dishonest of me to say I hated the story. It's worth pushing through the first few hours to find its redeeming parts later on.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
[b]Driving:[/b]
They updated this and it's now serviceable, thank God. It's not great and cars still feel too light or cumbersome depending on type, but it's an improvement.

[b]Combat:[/b]
Enemies are not very interesting, the AI is stupid, and the enemies are way too bullet-spongey. I would much prefer more skilled/lethal enemies who, in turn, died in one or two hits off me.

[b]Quickhacks:[/b]
These are a nice idea. It doesn’t feel like it interrupts with the fighting too much and some grant useful features, like disabling cameras, distracting enemies, or using them to turn on each other. 

[b]Perspective:[/b]
I get that 1st is more immersive, but not allowing 3rd to me completely negated the point of character customisation as you can rarely see your character. Denying the option made this feel even less like an RPG and was another nail in the coffin for me.

[b]Character Customisation:[/b]
This was underwhelming. Customisation helps players invest more in their character, but the options in Cyberpunk 2077 are dire. You have the things like genital customisation, but you can’t alter things like your weight or your beginner outfit.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
I wish I hadn’t pre-ordered this. It fails to meet advertised standards. The world isn’t living and you don’t feel like you have any meaningful choices in the game. I was so excited to play this game that I could hardly sleep on release night, and I’m pretty disappointed. The game has few redeeming features beyond a fairly good storyline and, when they work, rather beautiful graphics. I expect we will get a few updates to iron out glitches, but I don’t know that they’ll remedy a lot more than that, and there's a lot more that's wrong with the game. Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 just doesn’t feel like it tries to do anything new, and in its recreation of old, is painfully average.","Very Positive84% of the 693,658 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

What I will say is that I've been playing FFXIV since the days of A Realm Reborn, before Heavensward, Stormblood, and Shadowbringers.

2408820,Luma Island,"Been playing this a lot the past few days and have been enjoying it a lot. It's a really cute and cozy game; I love the look of the models - they remind of PS1/PS2 graphics/model designs, so there's a bit of a nostalgic vibe there. 

It also reminds me of a game I enjoyed a lot back then MySims, mixed with other farming/sandbox games out there like Stardew Valley and heck even Minecraft. Though here, you can keep playing without having that ""pressure"" to go home and into bed or else you'll pass out in the middle of nowhere. I like that.

What I want though, maybe for future updates (or please direct me if ever I just overlooked it): I want to be able to hover over the recipes so that I can see the names of the ingredients needed for each crafting.

216150,MapleStory,"I first played MapleStory in December 2004. Back in those days, each town was teeming with life! It didn't really matter what you were doing - if you were buying potions, grinding monsters, completing quests, traveling around, or even just sitting still, odds were that at least a few people would cross paths with you. MapleStory did an excellent job at encouraging players to work together with fun and rewarding party quests. My favorite party quests, the monster carnival, pitted two teams of players against each other in a pseudo-PvP mode where you raced against the other party to kill as many monsters as you could before time ran out, and there were plenty of buffs you could get for your own team and debuffs you could cast on your opponent. Some of the greatest memories I have come from those duels. Each class was quite distinct from each other and while there were a few that were less balanced than others in terms of damage output and maneuverability, all were fun to play in their own right. Each server had a vibrant economy, with literally hundreds of players in the ""free-market"" at all hours of the day trying to buy and sell. The cash shop offered stores that you could leave open to sell items for you while you were offline. New content updates added new regions, monsters, and party quests that were always a joy to explore. Unfortunately, around 2010 a controversial update known as ""Big Bang"" was released, which re-organized the world map cutting out a lot of fan-favorite areas (R.I.P. Henesys Hunting Ground) and introduced a new system called Miracle Cubes. Up until this point, the only way to upgrade your gear was by using scrolls, a rare item dropped extremely rarely that would give you the chance to upgrade your gear. A 10% chance scroll would offer a large boost, whereas a 100% scroll would offer a small boost of maybe only a single stat point or two. With miracle cubes, which you have to spend real money on, you are able to re-roll up to three additional slots on your weapons stats. There's not much inherently wrong with this system, but the bonuses offered by these cubes cannot compare to what you could achieve before. Each slot can potentially give a bonus of +12% in a stat. Players that spent money on cubes were in another league than everyone else. This pretty much ruined the balance of the game and split the community down the middle. Not only that, but Nexon continued to disincentivize players from partying up. They implemented an EXP decrease if you were in a party with someone else and reduced the experience gain from party quests. New updates brought free, instant teleportation between continents (more or less) which pretty much meant that you wouldn't meet as many people as you were traveling from town to town. Solo-grinding became the fastest most efficient way to level up, so areas of the game that used to be brimming with life are now literal ghost-towns. MapleStory was once an excellent MMORPG, but now it is just a husk of it's former self. If you're able to find friends to play this game with, it might still be worth playing, but ask anyone, the glory days of this game are far, far, behind us.","Mixed63% of the 13,193 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"STORY:
The premise of the game is simple: kill enemies and complete missions, defend ""democracy"" by defending and ""liberating"" planets, through weapons and strategems that can be deployed, or found in the map.

Since this is done by ""helldiving"" out of spaceships that have interstellar capabilities, I wonder why not just nuke the hell out of planets altogether, but then again, there would be no game that way.

Rather than a proper campaign, the gist of the story is conveyed through lore that can be found throughout the game.

GAMEPLAY:
This is a team-based third game, where up to 4 players can team up together, either beforehand, or while mission are in progress, to complete missions that may last anywhere from a few minutes to 40+ in duration. Single player is possible, though since enemy presence does not scale up, and map currency and experienced is shared, is usually much better to play with others.

There is a level up system based on experienced earned on missions, used mainly for vanity titles and equipment unlocks, and different currencies obtained either by scavenging around the map or completing missions, that can be used to buy tons of different ingame weapons, armors, abiltiies, strategems, and ship upgrades.

Quite a variety of missions and difficulty levels are available, which will suit everyone from casuals to those looking for a very tough cookie to crack.

There is friendly fire damage that cannot be disabled. Some people may have an issue with this but I consider an essential part of gameplay. Makes matches more fun and thoughtful to play. Trolling in random parties does not seem to be a common occurrence, and the occasional intentional friendly fire between friends makes for good laugh.

GRAPHICS and SOUND
Graphics are superb and amazing to look at.

Love the music included. Sound effects are well executed and voice acting is great, and is available in multiple languages.

ISSUES:
Not a fan of the Warbond currency used for some of the ingame weaponry, armor and equipment. While they can be obtained for free, the process involves quite a lot of grinding that can simply be eliminated altogether by spending some extra cash, making this part of the game effectively pay to win. For now not a big issue as these equipments are not necessarily overpowered or better than other equipment.

Not a fan of the anti-cheat N-guard used either, being a kernel-level application, on a PvE game, and that barely works, on top of that.

A few bugs here and there, such as small enemy ""slaps"" that result in one being thrown out far away in the sky, or occasional spawns that result in one being deployed to an inescapable or unreachable place, such as under ground.

Dreamlight Valley is relaxing, scratches that ""checking things off a list"" and ""collection"" itch, in a nice world with fun recognizable characters. Works like a dream (pun intended) on the Steam Deck, and it's as if it was tailormade for it. Easy to jump in for 10-15 minutes and do something, but also easy to suddenly realize five hours have passed and you're somehow very hungry (even though you spent some of those five hours cooking ingame). The character customization is excellent, and it has decent enough decorating.

It is in early access though, and deserves that label for now since there are plenty of bugs - but none that makes the game harder to recommend, they're mostly small annoyances that I hope they get sorted.

2379780,Balatro,"Balatro is a highly original and neatly designed concept combining Poker and deckbuilding in a roguelike format. The aim is to play poker hands from your deck to ultimately defeat the blinds and move to the next round.

The twist with the gameplay is the ability to collect power-ups and purchase other elements along the way which can boost your score through multi's and combo's as you progress. Some rounds can also have negative aspects so you have to be quite strategic in what to play and when. 

This will definitely prove to be a very addictive and challenging game and it's really good to see a poker game emerge from the usual fantasy titles we see in this genre.

2300320,Farming Simulator 25,"I would maybe wait a few months for patches and updates before buying. As it stands I've ran into several bugs and AI issues. They don't make the game unplayable but it certainly gets frustrating. 

As an example: I had a contract to cut some trees with a chainsaw and it wasn't possible to complete it because the tree wasn't spawned in for some reason. I cut down every tree in the area in case it was just missing the paint. No credit was given so I reloaded and abandoned the contract.

I had another contract for plowing a field. I rented the equipment and plowed the entire field but I was somehow missing 4% credit for the contact. I manually went back over the entire field twice and didn't get any more credit. So just like the wood contract it got abandoned. But unlike the wood one I had to pay to rent the stuff. I had done other stuff on the side while the contract was going so reloading wasn't really feasible. 

If the two above instances aren't bugs and I'm simply missing something in terms of game mechanics that is also a problem. 

The AI helpers really aren't where I would hope they would be either.  There are several tasks they simply won't/can't do. And if you're not paying attention they can really mess stuff up. That said they are still very helpful. I just wish they were better.","Mostly Positive74% of the 7,878 user reviews for this game are positive.",maybe wait month patch update buying stand ran bug ai issue unplayable certainly get frustrating example contract cut tree chainsaw possible complete tree spawned cut tree missing paint no_credit given reloaded abandoned contract contract plowing field rented equipment plowed field somehow missing 4 credit contact manually field twice credit wood contract abandoned unlike wood pay rent stuff stuff side contract reloading feasible instance bug simply missing term mechanic problem ai helper hope task simply not_paying attention mess stuff helpful wish
553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"Wow, I just can't, I loved this game for about 3 months then it inexplicably started to decline in the most ridiculous ways. It was literally the most epic fun I think I ever had in a game with the Bros. The mechanics, the Physics, the Plethora of effective weapons, the over the top satire, this, game, WAS, amazing. It was a breath of fresh air man, co-op play that felt rewarding. I have had some of my best player interactions ever in this game, and made friends in its lobbies. However in the last couple months the changes that have been made have basically ruined the game play experience completely. Its not an issue of the difficulties changing all the time, you can play at what ever difficulty you want so ""get gud"" right?. Early on when they made constant changes to the spawn rates, npc behaviors, armor ratings of enemies, strategem cool downs, all that still felt good, and you could  still use almost any weapon you wanted based on your play style. Back then me and the bros all had different favorite weapons, and filled different rolls in the squad. Now the guns and strategems are all basically useless. The game has now turned into an odd mortar/turret ring toss game coupled or some weird running simulator I dont know. I do know there was balancing that the developers felt needed to be done, and that they have a vision for how they want players to interact with their game, but it is looking like the great game we loved was an accident that needed ""fixing"". whatever their vision is currently its just not fun to play. The Bros already uninstalled, and i am going to as well until I maybe read somewhere that things have changed for the better.","Mostly Positive74% of the 674,223 user reviews for this game are positive.",wow loved 3 month inexplicably started decline ridiculous way literally epic fun bros mechanic physic plethora effective weapon top satire amazing breath fresh air man mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal play rewarding best interaction friend lobby last couple month change basically ruined play completely not_an issue difficulty changing play difficulty gud early constant change the_emphasized player enemy enter world rate non controlled artificial behavior armor rating enemy strategem cool down good weapon wanted based play style bros different favorite weapon filled different roll squad gun strategems basically useless turned odd mortar turret ring toss coupled weird running simulator dont balancing developer needed vision player interact great loved accident needed fixing whatever vision currently not_fun play bros already uninstalled maybe read thing changed
1245620,ELDEN RING,"Do you know what's worst about this game, apart from the repetitive bosses and toxic players? The open world. And basically, Elden Ring can be your first, easiest or most difficult game from FromSoftware and it's up to you which solution you choose. It took me a while to understand that I don't have to run where the site of grace shows me and I don't have to fight every mob or small boss I meet on my way. There are so many elements that allow us to trivialize the game and bring it to a critical state where we can defeat the boss on the first try (and the game becomes easy at this point, maybe too easy), there are so many easily accessible items scattered around the map, just waiting for you to find and collect them. That's why the experiences of Elden Ring players differ so dramatically and it turns out later that someone completed the game with a weapon that wasn't fully upgraded, walked only on the main bosses and only on 6 Estuses, and I could explore, look for side bosses, upgrade my weapon to the maximum level and the number and power of Estuses and have no major problem completing the game and the experience is immediately uneven. This only shows that the game can be difficult, but it doesn't have to be. 
As I got more and more interested in the game, I easily noticed that part of the Elden Ring community is a kind of... special social group of sweaty little guys who have epileptic seizures when you say that you defeated the boss using summons or generally didn't do it the way they did, which means probably harder, with no hit and with a stick. People are able to insult you up to 3 generations back for using normal mechanics in the game, which are absolutely not forbidden and are optional. Gamer culture is pure rot and no matter how you play, people will always find a problem with something.
This game has quite a lot of lore and it will take us some time to understand all of it and it will allow us to understand how much we could have missed while playing the game, but it will also allow us to understand the stories of the characters we have to face in the fight. The way Elden Ring is told requires reading items, listening to all the dialogues with understanding and connecting the dots, and yet most players will end up on VaatiVidyj's channel looking for the meaning of the fight with a given boss. But in a nutshell, Elden Ring is really a big family problem.
However, I don't think Elden Ring would be a good Soulslike for someone who has not had anything to do with this genre of games before, because I think the open world can quite easily overwhelm and lose a new player and also make each subsequent Soulslike seem too easy or too difficult. It's all depends how you'll be playing this game.

2669320,EA SPORTS FC™ 25,"Sometimes I wonder about how stupid WE (you, reading this and I) are for paying for this game, year-in-year-out. This game is not only absolute dogsh*t, but the developers don't give a single f*ck about the players. 

First and foremost, I have been playing FIFA every single year since 2012 and this is by far the worst game ever created. Fortunately for me, I already knew it was going to be a big pile of sh*t after last years sh*tshow, so I was gifted this game. It's day one of this game and you cannot queue up with your friends and play ultimate team, or wait- I should say casino mode or Clubs. The only thing that could possible make the game fun (playing with your friends) doesn't work, from the get-go. Wait, I didn't even get started yet with the day 1 bugs, or features I should say. The controller you want to play with, oh yeah, throw that sh*t out of the windows because it doesn't connect to the game properly and your players start acting like Sleepy Joe once you switch to them. 

Above, I mentioned ""casino mode"". Lets talk about this. EA sports, as most of you reading this already know, is one of the most (if not the most) greedy companies on Earth. This game is literary a f*cking gambling game first, with gameplay the absolute last focus from the dev team. Don't believe me? Just look up how many countries in the world banned the ultimate team 'store' section. 

This year they changed the name of the mode from like 2015 called ""Volta"" to ""Rush"". That is it. Those are all of the changes. If it wasn't for my brother gifting me this game, there would be no f*cking way in hell I would pay for this game. I'd rather vote for Kamala Harris before I put a single penny in this game. 

I could keep going but frankly, i'm not going to waste more of my time writing a review for this pile of sh*t. 

Please, if this is the only sentence you read from this review of mine, DO NOT, under any circumstances pay for this game, not full price not even a dollar. It's dogwater. The managed to copy and paste the code from the previous year but somehow when they pasted it and renamed the 24 to 25 they completely f*cked it up (once again). 

I wanted to add something extra here for those of you that will take the time to read this. Seriously I want you to think about this- Who is really the stupid one here (EA or us?). I think its us, because we fall into this yearly trap of paying for this dogwater game, paying extra for their ultimate team casino opening packs and then complain about the game every single year. So we have to come together and stop paying for this sh*t. They are manipulating us, every. single. year. The community eats this sh*t up like they are going to change something and make the game better. But no. Every single year it gets worse and worse. I sit there sometimes and think to myself  ""How can they make this game worse? How? its impossible, its already absolute dogsh*t in every single way"" and no, they somehow top it off every single year and make something worse.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Cyberpunk 2077... There's a lot to unpack here, so this will be a lenghty review. The game that was gonna revolutionize gaming as a whole, offering an unique experience we'd never seen before, hand-crafted by the masterminds at CDPR... And then, when it released, it was a bug-filled mess, practically unplayable on last gen consoles, and practically destroyed CDPR's reputation overnight. Still, after more than half a year since it's release, and having finally finished it, I guess it's time to share my thoughts on it.

So, where do I start? The setting. Cyberpunk 2077, as its name implies is set not only in a cyberpunk world, but rather, THE Cyberpunk world, as in, the universe first explored by the table-top RPG that gave the cyberpunk genre its name. And I must say, I love the setting, and the design of Night City and the surrounding Badlands. As I played the game, I couldn't help but stop at every corner, just to admire the beauty of the city, with its glowing neon lights, its tall buildings, its mix of American and Japanese architecture... I was blown away by it all. Truly, despite its flaws (which I'll talk about), CDPR managed to craft a really beautiful environment to explore, though sadly, it gets dragged down by the issues the game has.

As for the story, I think this is another strong point of the game. You play as V, and at the start of the game, you pick a lifepath which determines your prologue. While I praise the story, I do consider that having the lifepaths limited to a single, relatively short prologue mission, was a huge mistake on CDPR's part, and they could've built them some more. Anyway, I digress; once you're done with the prologue, you start the story proper, with V living in Night City, being best friends with Jackie, and getting ready for the heist of a lifetime... Of course, things go wrong, and Johnny Silverhand's engram ends up in V's mind, trying to take over his body. I won't go into further detail, but I gotta say, it was a pretty engaging story, especially if you're like me, and do everything the game has to offer.

As a counterpoint to the previous paragraph, though, the story pacing has some issues. One of the main complaints I've read online was about how the main story was really short, and the ending, unsatisfying, and, in my opinion, those are valid points to an extent. If you focus on the missions the game marks as ""main story"", you'll actually miss out on some options by the end. Certain story-related side quests get lumped together with the rest of side jobs and gigs, and so, you might end up unaware of them.

As for gameplay elements, it's basically an FPS with RPG elements, with Attributes and Skill points, and also perk trees. These can obviously influence your playstyle; certain attributes can help you open new paths, while skills relate to the abilities you use in combat or out of it. To make a clearer example, the Strenght attribute might allow you to force open certain doors, meanwhile, the handguns skill determines how much damage you do with pistols. Still, skill levels are capped by their related attribute, so you might want to take that into consideration. Being an RPG (or at least sort of), there's also equipment, clothing items, weapons with different stats. There's a pretty large selection, and you can even craft newer weapons and mods to install them. Also, given the cyberpunk setting, cybernetic enhancements are a given, with some really interesting options, like invisible camo, or my personal favourite, the Mantis Blades.

I talked about the setting, but let's focus a bit more on design. The graphics are pretty great in this game, as I mentioned in the paragraph about the setting, the city looks beautiful, but again, the impact gets diminished when the game's shortcomings start popping up. While the streets are crowded with pedestrians and cars, if you pay attention, you'll soon notice their rather limited AI. Personally, this wasn't as much of an issue to me, as I usually consider NPCs as background dressing, and don't pay much attention to them, but I know it might break immersion for some. The sound design is very good as well, the many noises from the city make it sound alive, and the soundtrack is excellent.

Now, for the shortcomings, because this game has a lot of them, and I already mentioned a few things here and there. When it first released, it was plagued by bugs (and still is, to some extent); I actually stopped playing for several months before coming back to it recently. On PC, it wasn't as serious as on last gen consoles; in my case, I was lucky enough that most of the bugs I found where of the amusing kind, though there were many instances of pop-up issues (and there still are to this day). Bugs aside, the game was also a disappointment to many due to what feels like a severe reduction in scope; the game that was delivered seems almost like a shell of the one that was promised. Although I really enjoyed the story and gameplay, by the time I was finishing it, I could still feel that there was something missing, that this game could've turned out amazing, but simply ended up being good. The story could've been fleshed out a bit more, and there's several instances, both on the main quest as in the side jobs, in which it feels like they had set things up, only not to follow up on them.

Anyway, I think this review has gone on for too long. Personally, I had a great time with this game, and it's basically the main reason I got myself a decent PC last year, having gamed on laptops for the past decade. However, you should keep in mind it's a deeply flawed experience, and might never manage to live up to the expectation there were before release. Still, one can hope that CDPR can at least keep supporting the game with bug fixes and maybe some more content.","Very Positive84% of the 693,658 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"Almost 200 hours trying to make Astarion fall in love with me. Why am I still playing and trying to win this vampiric heart so much?

Jokes aside this one of my favorite games, ever, not just of the year. And for those who know how many games I've played since the MS-DOS platform, oh it says A LOT.

The narrative and the charisma of the characters makes you really want to fight for them, unless it's Wyll, sorry Wyll.

Without any spoilers I'd say that it's a fantastic narrative with a wide map, with several choices, outcomes and consequences. Damn, so many consequences. Save often (you will thank me in case you want to please a certain character or did a very very bad choice, or just got a very bad dice roll) and get ready for endless adventures (and some steamy romance, if you are up to it) with the most captivating characters (unless it's Wyll, did I mention already how Wyll's drama and backstory bored me to death?) and enough side quests and stories to keep you playing for as long as you feel like it.

 
This game is worth every cent and you will want to play again, believe me. 
Come join us facing the cult of the Absolute or risk a lifetime of regret.

236390,War Thunder,"This review is for the new player considering purchasing a premium vehicle way above your unlocked vehicle. Read what I wrote first so you aren't disappointed with what you spent your money on. 

(sidenote: If you're considering buying the premium Tornado, you can skip the reading and just not buy it, that one is beyond saving.) 

tl;dr: If you don't want to read this much text, you should find an unedited livestream of someone (preferably new) playing the vehicle you want to buy and see if this seems like fun to you.

GROUND REALISTIC:
The advertising won't tell you this but the average game of battle rating 10.0-11.0 (around the first Abrams and Leopard 2A4) lasts about 3-5 minutes before it becomes completely one sided. Generally, the lower the BR, the less of a problem this is. I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy either rolling the enemy team or getting rolled. Why is this, you might ask, when low tier matches last around 20 minutes? Because of you, a presumably new player. If you want to skip literal years of grind and go straight to the Abrams, you can and all it takes is 70€. Why is this a problem? Well, candidly, you don't know what you're doing, it might take you weeks or months to learn your new tank and even if you do, it takes much longer to develop any sort of game sense and to level up your tank crew to a competitive level (yet another time/money sink, who would've guessed?). They also rely completely on the community to teach new players how to play their game, the in-game tutorials are a complete joke. You also now have only one spawn. Now expand this to your entire team. Most matches devolve into 4 players on each team killing everyone else. I do not blame you for wanting to spend money instead of grinding with tanks you aren't interested in for literal years. I blame the developers for building their entire business model on it. And once you find this out for yourself and decide this isn't fun? They tap the ""no refunds"" sign and laugh all the way to the bank.

AIR REALISTIC:
Aircraft battles do not fare any better. You will buy a premium aircraft and get barely any hints as to what buttons you need to bind to control your radar, countermeasures and weaponry. This time, the 5 minute game is actually only 5 minutes long. Battles consist of 16v16 fights in the center of the tiny maps. In the first merge, there are so many missiles in the air that only a well caffeinated 14 year old is capable of keeping track of them, because every one of those 16 aircraft usually have 4-6 missiles. If you're playing a premium aircraft that you do not enjoy fighting other players in, you might want to bomb ground targets to progress and make money. This works, perhaps too well for your own good. Unfortunately, you are not making any difference in the way the game plays out. The game makes it seem as if you are helping your team by rewarding you. You aren't. Bombing bases makes no difference to the outcome of the game 9.9/10 times. Over the course of the game's history, base bombing alternated between winning games instantly and having no impact and right now it has settled firmly on the latter. Even if you do decide to grind to your desired plane through base bombing, what then? You will have learned nothing. Base bombing leaves you completely unprepared for facing enemy air targets. You might as well at least use your time to learn what you can in the plane you bought.

THE BALANCE:
The balance of this game is based on making the game barely playable, while maximising profits. Every update brings premium vehicles that have lower battle rating than they should so obviously that a blind man could see it. Why upset the balance in such a way? Well by the time everyone already bought their shiny new premium, it's battle rating gets increased incrementally over months and months and only after incessant complaints. This is somewhat reversed with vehicles that can be earned through play. Regular vehicles are released and then swiftly forgotten about for months, retaining their unbalanced battle rating, while also having incorrect, unfinished or missing features, to the point where you start questioning if anyone on the developer team has played their own game recently. This is especially obvious when you consider the constant rush to add new features instead of trying to resolve the issues already present. The new features in question being, for example: armed UAVs that even most dedicated anti-aircraft vehicles have issues dealing with free to anyone, (You killed someone in top tier? Enjoy a missile from something that's so far away that the game won't even render it!) another new feature that comes to mind is terrain deformation. Granted, this would be a nice feature to have, however nobody ever uses it. Why? Because what's the point? By the time you are done entrenching, you have been flanked and the only use for your trench is as your grave. 

This is only scratching the surface of the issues with this game that the developers have not and I firmly believe never will address. From map design that has never been Gaijin's strong suit and has been going downhill with them somehow making old maps worse and adding some of the biggest stinkers of them all (looking at you Pradesh), spawn costs of aircraft carrying ordnance in ground realistic battles being too low, leading to constant revenge bombing and exacerbating the already skewed balance of aircraft and tanks in the TANK gamemode, to sound issues in a game where hearing your enemy can mean the difference between a bad player and a good player. And I am by no means the only person who takes issue with all these.

CLOSING:
Gaijin entertainment does not care about your time, as evident by the insane time commitment required to reach the top ranks even with premium time and vehicles. They don't care about you having fun, either. All they care about is rinsing as much money from you as possible by maintaining the rotting corpse of the fun game this was at one point in the past. Perhaps there was some sort of passion from the two brothers who run this company in the old days of 2013. Maybe the dev team actually cares, but I find that harder and harder to believe. The Yudintsev brothers (Anton, the CEO and Kirill, the creative director) like to present themselves in interviews as some sort of mom and pop studio and use this to shield themselves from criticism and pretend they're barely scraping by, while the income generated by this game is kept secret. Money is the only language they speak and if you don't give it to them, they will cry and threaten the game will close. Don't listen. They don't need your 70€.

Do not support these developers like I did. Do not spend time in this game. It's not worth it and they don't deserve it. It's too late for me to spend 4000 hours better but it might not be too late for you. 

If you want tanks, go for Gunner, HEAT, PC! or Sprocket. For aircraft, consider DCS or something like Ace Combat or Project Wingman. 

Godspeed and good luck, it really sucks to like this game these days.","Mostly Positive72% of the 561,252 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[b] I have always loved games from Bethesda, but not all is sunshine and sparkles . [/b]

There is a lot to say about [i] The Elder Scrolls Online [/i], but I will try to keep it short: When I was a new player, the gameplay felt pretty straightforward and both quests and main quests was (and still is) both exciting and somewhat accessible, or so I thought until I started using addons with Minion which made it even better. After a while, maybe creating a home for your characters sounds cool as you have collected random lamps and plants which may drop from fiends and harvesting mushrooms, which is a whole other part of the game to be explored (and we all grind for crafting plans because of it, hehe].

There's a jungle of guilds out there and I had to do some hit and miss before I found the one right for me ([b] PS: those who claim to have a non-toxic community in the zone chat are the worst ones [/b]). I've made a lot of new friends and joined the discord community as well where we can ask for gear tips, plan dungeon runs and discuss irl politics. If you're one of those social types, you'll quickly find people like you who shares the same interest, whatever that might be. If you're not, some of the content in this game will be challenging, but do not fret: you can ask for people to group up temporary in the zone chat and join a queue for dungeon run (the queue system has been broken for quite some time as I write this review which kind of mirrors how players are [spoiler] disregarded by the developers, [/spoiler] but enough about that).

As all platforms with an online communication function, you'll also meet a lot of [u]weirdoes[/u], [u]trolls[/u] and people who have an [b]unhealthy[/b] interest in Argonian biology, but occationally you'll see players giving great stuff away for free to anyone who replies in the zone chat and we all love generous people, [b]a small shoutout to those who tries to make a community great for new and veteran players alike.[/b]

While that's being all well and good, there can be plenty of bumps in the road, some of which Bethesda is well known for: Bugs (computer generated non-insects), silent players being randomply kicked out for ""spamming"" (also a bug), a weak effort to make the game accessible for people with low vision (bot unable to handle languages and reads the chat out loud in anarchy mode + weird playstation-like interface), constant server crashes, lazy daily rewards (you get stuff a calendar for logging in), high effort gives lame awards (spoiler [spoiler] for example a memento which is money raining on your head when you have finished collecting a list of stolen items for Thieves Guild [/spoiler]) and an unforgiving drop rate for a long list of items (I hope I one day get my hands on [i]Shivering Cheese[/i]).

All in all, as expected, this game is far from perfect, but both in solitary and with friends you can have hours of fun and to this day I'm not even finished with the main quest 'cause I do random stuff with my guildies or get distracted by the chats.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"The moment you've experienced a game where every single dialogue is voiced, other games might just start to pale in comparison. Yes, even that inconspicuous NPC in the most remote corner of the game world is professionally voice acted. Each corner of this game world unfolds a new story, an adventure lurking at every turn. Just pick a direction and start running; lend your ears to the happenings around you and before you know it, you're caught up in some dramatic quest, helping others or overcoming some danger. Suddenly, it's 2:00 AM, and you're contemplating if you should dive into one last dungeon before getting some shut-eye for work the next day.

There's something for every type of player. Love to jump into a quick PvP? The battleground's got your back. Want to wage wars and sieges over vast terrains? Cyrodil is the place to be. Prefer a medium-scale mix of PvE/PvP gameplay style? Try out Imperial City. If PvE dungeons are your thing, there's a whole range from easy to super tough, including normal, veteran, and trial dungeons. For explorers, hundreds of places across dozens of maps are waiting to be discovered, complete with numerous world bosses, delves, and public dungeons. If you fancy a solo single-player experience, you can have it your way. Tired of the classic Warrior, Rogue, Mage classes? Feel free to wield a sword and shield while conjuring spells. Your proficiency grows with whatever weapon you choose to master. Played Skyrim and miss it for nostalgia's sake? You'll find Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and more. Whether you want to be a thief or a killer, it's all up to you.

Are there downsides? Sure, the company may appear a bit greedy with its loot boxes and the need to purchase new chapters with real money. However, all the other DLCs in the game can be indirectly purchased with gold. Once you've got the hang of the game, earning gold becomes child's play.

Moreover, the versatility of gameplay this title offers is truly astounding. Crafting enthusiasts can lose themselves in extensive crafting systems, designing weapons, armor, or even brewing potions. For the lore lovers, there are countless books, scrolls, and notes scattered throughout the game world, revealing rich backstories and hidden secrets. Social butterflies will appreciate the in-depth interaction systems, allowing forming alliances, trading, or just enjoying a chit-chat around the in-game taverns.

In a nutshell, this game doesn't just offer an RPG, it presents a living, breathing world that's waiting for you to leave your mark.","Very Positive83% of the 123,718 user reviews for this game are positive.",moment experienced single dialogue voiced game pale comparison yes inconspicuous non controlled artificial remote corner world professionally voice acted corner world unfolds adventure lurking turn pick direction running lend ear happening caught dramatic task objective given non helping others overcoming danger suddenly 2 00 contemplating dive last dungeon shut eye next s_emphasizedomething type love quick versus battleground wage war siege vast terrain cyrodil prefer medium scale mix versus environment versus style imperial versus environment dungeon range easy super tough including normal veteran trial dungeon explorer hundred place across dozen map waiting discovered complete numerous world boss delf public dungeon fancy solo single tired classic warrior rogue mage class wield sword shield conjuring spell proficiency grows whatever weapon choose master skyrim miss nostalgia s_emphasizedake dark brotherhood thief guild thief killer downside company appear bit greedy item reward dropped defeated enemy box purchase chapter real dlcs indirectly purchased gold hang earning gold child play versatility title offer truly astounding crafting enthusiast lose extensive crafting system designing weapon armor brewing potion lore lover countless book scroll note scattered throughout world revealing rich backstories hidden secret social butterfly appreciate depth interaction system allowing forming alliance trading enjoying chit chat tavern nutshell offer role present living breathing world waiting leave mark
1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"All it does now compared to on release is run better, basically. The game didn't magically become better because everyone came back from watching Edgerunners.

Games like these that are mediocre AND run like trash on release seem to have this effect on people where they can only remember one bad thing about a game, so when all the lagging and crashing gets fixed they think the game got better too.

You know how when you go into a restaurant bathroom there's a checklist on the wall for the sanitary condition of the facilities? This game is like ""fair"" down the line. So above poor (paper towels clogging the sink) and ""good"" (graffiti  scratched into the mirror and there's a sticky mess under the soap dispenser).

Main quest is okay. Cool set-pieces, introduces the subfactions (which suck), and interesting story bits. Big problem, though, is that the only thing motivating you to do anything is that you're going to die. That's the only urgent and time sensitive priority you have, and its undercut by the fact that your condition is tied to story progression. Story-wise you're given weeks to live in an increasingly deteriorating body, but mechanically you could go months running side-quests (not really because there arent that many). Mechanically nothing separates the experience you have running around in Watson in Act 1 and running around in the rest of the map in Act 2. The story is completely separate from the gameplay. Keanu can't take your body if you just say no and don't play the main quest. Occasional coughing isn't real adversity.

Subfactions are a joke. You do a handful of gigs for Rogue with no consequence except money, and a few things for the Aldecaldos. My bad, I shouldn't even have mentioned anything. It's not like there's really any faction reputation system or any mechanical interest to these particular groups besides what they do in the main quest. There isn't a faction system, reputation, you barely see any factions interact with each other outside of specific quests, no faction reward, nothing. Sure, you get different options at the ending, I think, but who cares. That doesn't come up for 95% of the time you're playing the game.

Combat is not noteworthy. I don't think its particularly interesting. I don't care about most of the perks in the tech tree. You can say its my fault for optimizing the fun out of my game, but why would I ever run any smart gun to do LESS damage when I can just pop heads with the overture from stealth? Or not even stealth? The takedown perks are situational in the worst sense. This isn't a good stealth game. 

Crafting is boring. Does anybody really find Numbers-Go-Up equipment juggling a compelling mechanic anymore? Ah yes, let me break down these 42 assault rifles that I have in my hot pants pocket so I can retrieve two hex screws and a sliver of plexiglass. One of them was a blue assault rifle? Two slivers of plexiglass for you! The red dots all look ugly and I swear a couple of them are misaligned, like I have to aim low to hit the head at range. Having 2-3 reload animations per gun is cool, but I can't help but think I would have preferred 2-3 times the number of guns in the game with 1 set of animations per.

HAVE YOUR DESCRIPTION TEXT WRITERS WORK WITH YOUR GAME DESIGNERS! Most of the guns in the game are written as if they're cheap trash, yet they're more or less interchangeable with the stuff written as ""premium."" Someone needs to make a call as to what the difference in guns is supposed to be, and then have that articulated in the descriptions and the ingame stats. Don't just design your guns to be ""whatever"" and then write them to be ""whatever"" separately. You paid someone to write this crap, and I'm paying to read it.

Cyberpunk was originally high lethality high intensity tabletop rpg, yadda yadda, making the video game version have really spongy enemies is completely different and worse, yadda yadda..... Whatever. It's borderlands with bullet time and skyrim stealth archer build memes. Again, its not noteworthy.

In a game with style, where's the dual wielding? In a game with interesting (ish) characters and good (ish) dialogue, where are the companions? In a game with cars, where is the vehicle combat?

Major note, OUTFITS WERE NOT A RELEASE FEATURE. WTF. It's a game about hyperstylized gangoons wearing flashy cloths. On my first playthrough I had to wear a baseball helmet, a tank top, and some bruce lee pants. Probably. Point is that it looked ugly and stupid. Also shop inventories are random so even if you know that a shirt with a specific color theoretically exists, you may not ever find it ingame.

Look, if you like it, its fine. Cool. Have fun. But it doesn't need to be good for you to like it. I probably have more to say about this game if I jogged my memory or started it up again, but I don't really care at this point. It's fine. It succeeded in neuron activation. 

This game mid. The Keanu money should have been spent on giving Jackie 100,000 more lines. 

There are little bits that are pretty ok. But the entire thing is put together wrong. It's like putting prime rib in a slow cooker. Or microwaving sashimi.

Additional:
Go back and watch that 30 minute ""vertical slice"" video. Not a vertical slice. Those missions had the most character interaction and most branching paths/consequences in the whole game. Never happened again in the whole game. And that bit with ""introducing Pacifica"" bit.

What I dislike: 
~Immensely grindy
~One hit kill on you, there’s no second chance with enemies
~There’s no tell on enemy attacks and it can get intensely frustrating
~No romance or friendship system

What I Love:
~The class system dramatically changes the way the game plays, I’m doing a brewer play right now and I haven’t even touched fishing or cooking because I either can’t or don’t need to. 
~No need to sleep 
~No seasons, I hate planning for my crops dying

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I feel like I can write at least a small review with 5 thousand hours in the game so here we go. 

Tldr: It's great, the best mmo in my opinion out there. Good music, dungeons, story and awesome community. Rocky start but starts to get better after the first expansion.

Alright so let's start with the base and go up. A Real Reborn, the base game you get is easily the longest and grueling at times. Quests that make you go fetch things from A to B, talk to this person etc. However, it still has some good points. 
    -The experience you get from doing the main story quests can keep you up to date for dungeon requirements. Some even give you gear so you don't need to throw your gil (In game currency) at the Market Board (player shop). 
   -Before the first dungeon you get the choice of having a tutorial on the basics of your current role (Tank, Healer or DPS.). Each training focuses on the general tasks your role does. The rewards you get are gear that lasts until lvl 20 and a ring that grants you XP until lvl 25 or lvl 30.
   -When you reach lvl 20-ish it starts to open up its world by having you travel around the continent. This is where you get some world building lore, the struggles of each nation, how the events prior to your arrival transpired and affected them along with some politics. 
   -It's beginner raids are new player friendly. Instead of having 8 people you have 4 which can be a good thing. 

There are other good points out there but I will let you decide on them. Now, with ARR done, let's give a look at what is to come. Spoiler free of course. 
   The first expansion, Heavensward, introduces new things to the fray like mechanics, locations and it starts the addition of flying in each zone with whatever mount you want! Aside from those it features an engaging soundtrack that changes with each phase making the fights more fun and epic. Worthy of the title you have been bestowed upon back in A Real Reborn. What it also brings are 3 new classes: Dark Knight, Astrologian and Machinist. All three are accessible once you start the Heavensward expansion but start at a lower level than its entry level. 
  -Dark Knight: A tank class that is seen edgy due to its use of ""inner darkness of your soul"" but a fun one and useful. 
  - Astrologian: You use the stars and tarot cards to heal and buff your allies. Another fun class, especially if you enjoy multitasking. 
  -Machinist: A ranged physical dps that uses guns and turrets. It's fairly simple to play as and can get powerful later on. 
Heavensward is seen as one of the best of the currently 3 expansions because of its story and I am inclined to agree. After finishing A Real Reborn, Heavensward will leave you very satisfied with how the game evolved. But it does not end there.

With Heavensward out of the way, Stormblood! Like before, it adds new mechanics and music along with two new areas, both having zones that you can enable flying in. With it comes 2 new classes this time, both DPS. 
  -Red Mage: Your fencer mage that uses both black and white magic to fight and support their allies. Heal and bring back your allies like a semi-healer in battles or focus on dealing damage while looking stylish! It's part of their persona. 
  -Samurai: Your sword wielding fighter from the Far East, which some of you might laugh at because of its name. Simple in gameplay but once you reach a higher level and learn its gimmicks you can see yourself dishing out large amounts of damage.
Stormblood is considered the good-ish one of the trio. I see it as an expansion that deviates a bit from the action of Heavensward and goes deeper in terms of other topics. 

And now, the latest expansion. Shadowbringers!
This expansion was one that left many players with their mouth agaped, sat at the edge of their seat and with their heart clenched. I shall leave the reasons to you! Minor advice: Buckle up. Things go to another level. As before, new zones with unlockable flying.
 Shadowbringers also brings to the fold 2 new classes: Gunbreaker and Dancer. A tank and a DPS. 
  -Gunbreaker: The small brother of Warrior that focuses on swift movements and big damage. It's skills are designed for fast gameplay, the player having 3 sets of combos: One for gathering ""Cartridges"" followed by a combo that uses a cartridge and another one that uses the 2nd combo. Confused? So was I but it comes around. A good description would be: Devil May Cry but tab target style. 
  -Dancer: It does what its name implies. With a combo that is half dependent on RNG, the dancer swoops in with its buff by performing steps with their Dance Partner, increasing both of their damage as the timer goes down. At later levels you can buff the party members around yourself, also increasing their damage. With their Dance Partner they can buff and heal each other and those around them. 


Now for another part of this review. You have noticed that I have mentioned repeatedly that you can fly, yes? Well that is because I have been saving words for this segment!
 
World Building! 

Each expansion gives the players new elements to the lore behind the universe of FFXIV. From the customs of each area and its people to civilizations long past to heroes of eld and gods once worshiped. The game introduces this through its story and many other quests. 

Questing! 

From Heanvensward and onward there is a trend that has been established with how the Main Quests work. It's pacing can be like this: First quest with the entry level is the introduction of the expansion followed by the next level being a dungeon you go in. The next quest can involve a solo instance where you fight along side NPC's in a revisited dungeon or a specially made area for it. And then another dungeon or trial. The cycle repeats like this to keep the player engaged and not go through another ARR slogfest.

Music!

The music is by far the best in my opinion. The composer, Masayoshi Soken, has a clear grasp on what to implement in this category so the player can enjoy doing the content. From slow motifs to full on pieces in which make you question yourself if you are in a battle of life or death or at an opera/concert. Many fall in love with the music in it and choose to do content because of it! Myself included. 

Community!
It has been said a lot of times that the community of FFXIV is really welcoming and well mannered. I stand to agree to that but I won't let it be sugarcoated that much. We have problems like many other MMO's and games that have you play with real people have. If I would be correct to assume, the reason behind this big point that has been brought so many times is because we choose to be kind because the developers are also kind. It's a paying forward sort of deal. At least that is how I see it.


And that is all I can think of. If you have read this far, thank you for your time! I hope this review will be at least helpful in getting an image on how the game is like and if you want to try it. Hope to see you lads and lasses in the game!

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"This game is like the result of say if Disney had secretly acquired EA and decided to remake the Dragon Age franchise in their own cartoonishly bland and childish image. That sums up this game in a nutshell.  

The old Bioware that made the original Dragon Age and Mass Effect Games is long dead. The original writers and developers are long gone. Bioware is Bioware in name only and a ghost of its former self. 

The writing in this game is dreadful. The dialogue is boring and doesn't give you any real options to bond with the main character who is called ""Rook"" which is really the developers calling you ""moron"" because they assume you are a childish moron that needs everything explained to you in a child like fashion in order to comprehend their story.  They even use the main companion characters to do a kindergarten like sit down story hour retelling to explain the already overly simplified story to you the ""moron"" or ""rook"" who is playing this game. 

The companion characters are mostly unlikable, annoying, cartoonish, and bland, just like the main story. And the game gives you no choice to respond as you see fit as the main character/protagonist, unlike previous Bioware games, where choices did matter and you typically had at least two options to respond where you could be the typical badass hero or if you so choose be the asshole bad guy. This game doesn't allow that. 

The overall character design is like a Disney Pixar cartoon, are mostly ugly and unatractive and doesn't fit the original Dragon Age franchise. They are a far cry from the mostly lovable characters of the original Dragon Age series, some of which do play brief cameo appearances in this game, but not enough to make you fall in love with them allover again. The characters in this game are barely tolerable at best and childishly annoying at worst. 

The world design is okay but not great and the levels are very much guided without any open world elements, unlike the previous Dragon Age game Inquisition where it felt more like an open world game, even when it wasn't one.  This game feels like its mostly on rails and restricts itself and only unlocks certain areas as you progress through the story and level up, placing forcefield barriers between you and the areas of the map that are blocked off until you get to the story part that allows you to progress there. So the game destroys even the illusion of freedom of choice, both in character dialogue choices as well as restricting your travel until the story permits it. 

About 10 hours into this game, the combat starts to feel repetitive. You have already encountered several bosses and the majority of bad guys you will fight in this game, and the game mechanics become a repetitive game of rock, paper scissors. Rinse and repeat. 

The only interesting character in this game is Solas, and he spends the majority of the game locked in a virtual cell. 

Is this a horrible game? No. 

it's mostly cartoonishly bland. But it isn't anywhere near the same calibur as the previous Bioware games of old. So don't expect that. Keep your expectations low and you should be happy with this game, that is if you are completely unfamiliar with previous Bioware games. And don't hold your hopes out for Mass Effect 5. It will most likely be a total disaster just like this game was for me.","Mostly Positive71% of the 24,035 user reviews for this game are positive.",result disney secretly acquired ea decided remake age franchise cartoonishly bland childish image sum nutshell old bioware original age mass effect game long dead original writer developer long bioware bioware name ghost former self writing dreadful dialogue boring real option bond called rook developer calling moron assume childish moron need explained child fashion order comprehend companion character kindergarten sit retelling explain already overly simplified moron rook companion character mostly unlikable annoying cartoonish bland give no_choice respond fit protagonist unlike bioware game choice matter typically option respond typical badass hero choose asshole bad allow design disney pixar cartoon mostly ugly unatractive fit original age franchise far cry mostly lovable character original age series play brief cameo appearance not_enough fall love allover character barely tolerable best childishly annoying worst world design okay not_great level guided open world element unlike age inquisition open world feel mostly rail restricts unlocks certain area progress placing forcefield barrier area blocked allows progress destroys illusion freedom choice dialogue choice restricting travel permit 10 hour combat start repetitive already encountered boss majority bad guy fight mechanic repetitive rock paper scissors rinse repeat interesting solas spends majority locked virtual cell horrible no_it mostly cartoonishly bland anywhere near calibur bioware game old expect expectation low happy completely unfamiliar bioware game hold hope mass effect 5 total disaster

1085660,Destiny 2,"I love this game and have been playing since launch (I also played D1), but this review isn't for or from me.

I have heard Destiny 2 described as: ""Destiny 2 is great for people who already play Destiny 2"".

I have had 3 people I know try to get into D2, with none of them having experience with D1 or Original D2, Curse of Osiris/Warmind.
They have all had the same experience, get in and play past the tutorial and then get very overwhelmed. Be somehow overwhelmed with all the activities but underwhelmed with the loot they receive. Finally finding a gun they like and having to immediately unequip it for something else as a new player high power level guns drop as every drop, but they’re all blue so they all feel like a wet noodle during any content that matters. A big gripe a lot of them had was the loot in general. The amount of times I got ""Oh man that's a cool gun, how do I get that"" or ""Oh damn your character looks SIYUCK! How can I get that armour"" and I have had to say things like ""Oh you can't anymore it was from a past season"" or ""Oh it was a past season weapon that you could focus but now it's a random world drop so you just have to hope you get lucky enough for it to drop randomly, and then be lucky enough for it to be a decent roll. rng on rng on rng baby!"" FOMO sucks and just shouldn’t be a thing.

“Why does everything cost so much” – A dude I know. I think he meant this both DLC $$$ wise (We’ll ignore that) but also in game at the time, legendary shards and upgrade materials are a ball-ache to get if you are a casual player. With everything costing more of them and now weapon crafting being changed to have them as a cost, it’s so hard to keep up as a new light.

They have also recently made the game harder (or in their words “more rewarding”) to play. Which is fine, I love to be challenged in games. But the not-so-much loot we were already getting stayed the same. So it took longer to get the same amount of loot. But wait then we got less loot. So now we are taking longer and fighting harder enemies to get less shitty loot than we were getting before, the vast majority of which we auto-dismantle anyway. The time investment to gear reward ratio feels so bad as things are right now.

I get that bugs happen in games, but it feels like a kick in the balls as a player when bugs that effect the player in a negative way are left to simmer (without communication) for multiple seasons while bugs that benefit the player (lookin at you rahool’s dismantling shop of mystery) have action/parts disabled within a few days. Just seems to show where the priorities are.

This is one of those games where the community is incredible, the lore is spicy (although lightfall campaign?? Not sure about that one chief.) but the game just seems to be the best there is in it’s field so it is stagnating. It happens with other games/game genres, there is no competition, so they aren’t forced to improve (Don’t get me wrong strand kinda slapped). I know there have been countless “Destiny Killers” but they all end up sucking and feeling dry, at least with Destiny we can feel dry in the comfort of the game we have been playing for 5 years, more if you include D1.

EDIT:

I am making an addition to this review and keeping it as negative, heck I would make it more negative if I could. Bungie has announced that the price of the season passes going forward is going up from 1000 silver to 1200 silver, call that what you will, inflation, greed, whatever. For me that part is what it is.. It’s only 200 silver.. right… right? The thing that gets me is that Bungie is doing the scummy mobile game microtransaction schtick of not having a silver bundle that gives you that amount. So, you need 1200 Silver right? Okay cool well for $14.95AUD you can get a bundle that gives you (as it’s worded in the store) “1000 +100 BONUS”. So you are 100 silver short of being able to buy the pass? So that means you have to purchase either the next bundle up (2000 + 300 BONUS Silver for $29.95AUD). Or you have to purchase the 1100 silver bundle and one of the bundle below that one (500 Silver for $7.55AUD) Totalling your silver purchases to 1600 Silver for $22.50AUD.

This also brings me to the topic that Destiny 2 is the only game I have played that has a battle pass that doesn’t give you some of the “themed premium currency” back in the pass. COD gives you COD points back, Siege gives you credits back, Fortnite does it. You are able to purchase one battlepass, complete it and save your credits for the next one. Not in Desty 2, spend more money next season you hobo’s!

So you are spending money on the big DLC’s (Lightfall), the season passes (which now cost more), the dungeons (that are now separate, so I hope you purchased the dungeon pass or the deluxe edition). You could have purchased the Lightfall: Big Honky Big Boi Deluxe Edition that comes with the “years worth of content”, but if you are one of the many people who isn’t confident in the technical state of the game, can’t play basic strikes without it being an error code simulator, or just don’t feel confident shelling out that much money for 3 seasons of what is mystery content at this point. (Mystery content that is 100% going to be filler stuff until the next big story expansion). I don't blame you for not buying the Deluxe edition, or for not upgrading to it. I'm honestly lost rambling at this point so don't even know where to go from here.. I guess I'll reupdate this review the next time there's a development, hopefully one day I'll be able to make it a positive review.

EDIT 2:

Just a quick update to note that the latest season has been released today (May 24, 2023), resulting in a the usual big season store refresh. However, it's worth noting that this time around, there is no armour available for purchase with bright dust (the earnable in-game currency) as there usually is. Instead, this time items are only available for silver. But wait, there's more! They have introduced three new eververse bundles containing exotic weapon ornaments that come bundled with silver-exclusive shaders who knows if/when these shaders will be available without opening your wallet. There used to be such an emphasis on the fact you could do it both ways, you could earn cool looking gear/shaders in game or you could buy others with silver. The community would tell you it wasn't a big deal and you didn't have to buy it if you didn't want to, which was fair. Jump to now where.... wait..  where'd all the armour that's obtainable in-game go?

I would like to bring up the somewhat random point that SPARE RATIONS IS BACK! So your old sunset gun is now back with more rolls that you have to grind for again. Really not sure where I stand on the whole reusing weapon models thing, on one hand I get it but on the other hand it seems lazy? This season we have normal spare rations and also spooky taken ghost spare rations, also seems like a nostalgia plug, imagine all the youtube titles ""WOW SPARE RATIONS IS BACK!"" ""SPARE RATIONS PVP KING AGAIN"" etc, etc. It is immensely frustrating that they have endless creativity for Sparrows, Ghosts, Ships, and exotic ornaments, but the actual gear is mostly reissues and reskins??

The reusing gun models argument aside they really have an issue with having weapons in promotional artwork/mission launch screens that just don't exist in game?? I'm also confused because they cancelled sunsetting and are now bringing back sunset weapons with different rolls? So was it really a space issue? I get they're shuffling seasonal stuff out but at this point it just seems like a cop-out

I'm not sure if they are just trying to milk the IP for all it's worth because the final shape is coming up or because they need to show papa Sony how much money they're making. It appears that even though it was easy to blame Activision there is an increasing emphasis on monetization regardless of Bungie splitting from Activision in 2019.","Very Positive80% of the 615,480 user reviews for this game are positive.",love launch d1 heard described great already play 3 d2 d1 or_emphasizediginal d2 curse osiris warmind play past tutorial overwhelmed somehow overwhelmed activity underwhelmed item reward dropped defeated enemy receive finally finding gun immediately unequip else high power gun drop drop blue wet noodle matter big gripe item reward dropped defeated enemy general time oh man cool gun oh damn look siyuck armour thing oh anymore past season oh past season weapon focus random world drop hope lucky drop randomly lucky decent roll rng rng rng fomo suck cost dude meant downloadable additional released initial launch wise ignore legendary shard upgrade material ball ache casual costing weapon crafting changed cost s_emphasizedo hard light recently harder word rewarding play fine love challenged game not_so item reward dropped defeated enemy we_emphasizedre already stayed took longer item reward dropped defeated enemy wait item reward dropped defeated enemy taking longer fighting harder enemy shitty item reward dropped defeated enemy we_emphasizedre vast majority auto dismantle anyway investment gear reward ratio feel bad thing bug happen game feel kick ball bug effect negative left simmer communication multiple season bug benefit lookin rahool dismantling shop mystery action part disabled day priority game community incredible lore spicy lightfall series connected mission level form storyline not_sure chief best field stagnating happens game genre no_competition forced improve wrong strand kinda slapped countless killer sucking feeling dry dry comfort 5 year include d1 addition keeping negative heck negative bungie announced price season pass forward 1000 silver 1200 silver call inflation greed whatever 200 silver right_emphasized get bungie scummy mobile microtransaction schtick not_having silver bundle give 1200 silver okay cool 14 95aud bundle give worded 1000 100 bonus 100 silver short able pas mean purchase next bundle 2000 300 bonus silver 29 95aud purchase 1100 silver bundle bundle 500 silver 7 55aud totalling silver purchase 1600 silver 22 50aud brings topic battle pas the_emphasizedmed premium currency pas cod give cod point siege give credit fortnite able purchase battlepass complete save credit next not_in desty spend next season hobo s_emphasizedo spending big downloadable additional released initial launch lightfall season pass cost dungeon separate hope purchased dungeon pas deluxe edition purchased lightfall big honky big boi deluxe edition come year worth confident technical state play basic strike error code simulator confident shelling 3 season mystery mystery 100 filler stuff next big major addition add feature mechanic blame not_buying deluxe edition not_upgrading honestly lost rambling guess reupdate next development hopefully able positive quick note latest season released today 24 2023 resulting usual big season refresh worth noting no_armour available purchase bright dust earnable currency usually item available silver wait introduced three eververse bundle containing exotic weapon ornament bundled silver exclusive shaders know shaders available opening wallet emphasis way earn cool gear shaders others silver community big deal fair wait armour obtainable bring somewhat random spare ration old sunset gun roll grind not_sure stand reusing weapon model on_emphasizede hand hand lazy season normal spare ration spooky taken ghost spare ration nostalgia plug imagine youtube title wow spare ration spare ration versus king etc_emphasized immensely frustrating endless creativity sparrow ghost ship exotic ornament actual gear mostly reissue reskins reusing gun model argument aside issue weapon promotional artwork launch screen exist confused cancelled sunsetting bringing sunset weapon different roll space issue shuffling seasonal stuff cop not_sure trying milk ip worth final shape papa sony appears easy blame activision increasing emphasis monetization bungie splitting activision 2019

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"The singleplayer is great, funny, interesting, relatively balanced, has plenty of biting satire, details, etc. etc...

But anyone who has yet to buy this game ought to understand: singleplayer isn't the Rockstar's focus. It's GTA Online, which is an absolute dumpster fire of an experience. It's unbalanced, annoying, and often designed to be irritating in hopes you'll pay for the privilege of the game becoming fun, instead of just being a good experience on its own. All the content they've made for over five years is for multiplayer -- including the vehicles that WOULD work just fine in singleplayer if you put them there; they went out of their way to add a kill switch that removes them from the game if you dare try them out. Thankfully on PC that's laughably easy to mod around, but know that they put in the effort to withhold that from you.

One in five times, game softlocks loading into GTA Online(which takes forever, even with an SSD). It's always fun wasting more than five minutes on loading that will never end... It's much harder to catch on to when you expect such long load times in the first place.

Get on, and immediately get bombarded with job notifications and in-game telemarketers and e-mails. The job notifications you can at least silence(every time you launch the game). E-mails and telemarketers will only give you peace if you buy whatever it is they're selling, and if you're starting from scratch, that's an  investment of several-hundred IRL hours or dollars to get your hands on one of every(baseline, un-upgraded) facility, just to make the obnoxious, perpetually-outstretched hand begging for microtransaction money to go away... Until the next DLC comes out and there's something else to sell.

Buy one of the businesses that you're constantly nagged about, and you'll have the pleasure of keeping them supplied and safe in order to aggregate supplies for you to sell for profit. This could actually be nice -- missions in freemode to steal supplies. Firefights, car chases, the works. Sounds like Grand Theft Auto! Well, it *would* be nice, if every business didn't have the MO of literally painting a red target on you for everyone in the server and saying, 'Hey! Kill this person and get a negligible amount of cash and RP!' Almost every freemode business endeavor that gives a worthwhile amount of money is made as tedious as possible. Any jerk using something faster than a turtle and stronger than a cap gun can rush over -- while you're driving a literal FedEx delivery truck up a mountain -- immediately kill you, and earn for themselves about a tenth of the value of the stock you're carrying (which took you two hours to accrue). The hope is you'll realize how unfun that ""game"" is, and pay MORE money to make the game better for yourself instead of taking your money elsewhere (which lots of people are... okay with doing these days?).

Ah, and there's of course the hackers, which are especially bad on the PC version of GTA Online. You'll find those in every session with four or more people -- no exaggeration. They'll get their kicks blowing you up on the spot over and over again, attacking you in while they're in godmode, teleporting into your vehicle and controlling it(or just halting it in place permanently), softlocking your game, kicking you from sessions, force-crashing your game, among other things. I had a real charmer the other day spamming hard-R n-words in the chat, and when I tried to report him, I was immediately hit with a network error and booted into singleplayer. They can literally detect your reports, block them, and boot you from the game -- automatically, on the spot. Lots of these exploits have been in the game since 2013, and hackers are only banned in non-negligible numbers of when the game receives a major update... Once every few months. Any given time more than one or two weeks after an update, it'll be infested once again.

Once you properly get IN a lobby, hang up on all the telemarketers, and hackers are bothering someone else for the time being... you'll likely just get a non-hacker using absurdly overpowered equipment come to harass you, instead. Anyone who doesn't already have the money and tools from playing the game a long time will get absolutely demolished by people looking to attack them, with their only recourse being Passive Mode(AKA agree to not be able to do 85% of what you normally could until leaving Passive). Incessantly harassing defenseless low-level players is a common pastime for people with overpowered equipment, a familiar concept for anyone who's played a game with moderation this poor; it's an excellent environment for players who enjoy being toxic. Around once a year, Rockstar will add some expensive gadget that makes fending off attackers miserable or impossible unless you also have the expensive, overpowered gadget; the Hydra, the Insurgent, the Oppressor, Explosive Snipers, the Deluxo, the Oppressor Mk II, the bloody Orbital Cannon. Oh, yeah -- that's another thing. People with enough money and the right facility can literally just nuke you from orbit and insta-kill you nearly anywhere on the map. No warning, no counter, you just better just memorize the location of every facility people MIGHT do that from and hide underground if anyone is in one.

TL;DR
I could write a book on all the reasons new players should take their money elsewhere. The game hasn't been balanced for seven years. If you don't already have the foothold of being level 120 with $10m in the bank, it'll cost you a LOT of time or real-life money to get to the part where the game can maybe be fun.","Very Positive87% of the 1,741,767 user reviews for this game are positive.",mode alone interaction player great funny interesting relatively balanced plenty biting satire detail etc_emphasized ought understand mode alone interaction player t_emphasizedhe rockstar focus gta online absolute dumpster fire unbalanced annoying designed irritating hope pay privilege fun good five year mode multiple player interact compete real including vehicle fine mode alone interaction player add kill switch remove dare thankfully pc laughably easy modification alteration player fan effort withhold five time softlocks loading gta online take forever ssd fun wasting five minute loading never_end harder catch expect long load time immediately bombarded notification telemarketers e mail notification silence launch e mail telemarketers peace whatever selling starting scratch investment hundred irl hour dollar hand on_emphasizede baseline un upgraded facility obnoxious perpetually outstretched hand begging microtransaction next downloadable additional released initial launch come s_emphasizedomething else business constantly nagged pleasure keeping supplied safe order aggregate supply profit nice mission freemode steal supply firefights car chase work sound nice business mo literally painting red target computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player saying hey kill negligible cash rp freemode business endeavor give worthwhile tedious possible jerk faster turtle stronger cap gun rush driving literal fedex delivery truck mountain immediately kill earn tenth value stock carrying took hour accrue hope realize unfun pay taking elsewhere lot okay day ah course hacker especially bad pc version gta online session four no_exaggeration kick blowing spot attacking godmode teleporting vehicle controlling halting permanently softlocking kicking session force crashing thing real charmer spamming hard r n word chat tried report immediately network error booted mode alone interaction player literally detect report block boot automatically spot lot exploit 2013 hacker banned non negligible number receives major month given week infested properly lobby hang telemarketers hacker bothering someone else non us unauthorized illegal method gain advantage absurdly overpowered equipment harass already tool long demolished attack recourse passive mode aka agree not_be able 85 normally leaving passive incessantly harassing defenseless low player common pastime overpowered equipment familiar concept moderation poor excellent environment player enjoy behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner rockstar add expensive gadget make fending attacker miserable impossible unless expensive overpowered gadget hydra insurgent oppressor explosive sniper deluxo oppressor mk ii bloody orbital cannon oh yeah facility literally nuke orbit insta kill nearly anywhere no_warning no_counter memorize location facility hide underground tl dr write book reason player elsewhere balanced seven year already foothold 120 10m bank cost real life maybe fun
1063730,New World: Aeternum,"A good game with great potential.

Pros:
-Visually jaw dropping, this games looks amazing absolutely everywhere you go, immersion is great
-whoever did the sound effects for this game is blind, because there attention to detail when it comes to sound effects in all aspects is outstanding
-weapon/class design is fun a initiative, I love that you can really be creative with how you want to play ( this gets better with every patch as they work on perks and weapon design)
-WPVP is amazing(Compared to other games) PVP in general needs work but its still good
-Crafting and gathering is the best compared to other MMOs

Cons:

-The levelling experience and end game is a grind, which for me (personally) is a bit lame
-Again maybe its just me but most people i have come across are rude and unhelpful(not really NWs Fault)
-lots of little QOL changes that bug me, hard to mention them all so ill list a few:
 + ability to switch of pvp if i get invited to a dungeon group (or just let me be in a group with some if i have pvp on ), if im out in the world with pvp on i cant join party's without heading back to town first and it kinda sucks
 + For people under 60 double to speed increase for running on paths, i get you don't want to add mounts but you have a habit of spreading quest objectives like dropped leggos on a floor, this made the levelling grind even worse as it took ages to run everywhere
 + for the love of god add controller support


To be Honest, play this game!

The devs are clearly working hard to make it a better game and i think most reviews are a little negative (like putting 1000+ hours in a game and ""not recommending it"" lol

I played through to 2K20, and each game was fun and enjoyable. However, after trying 2K25 this year, I've noticed some major issues. I live in Hong Kong, and the online mode has over 1 second of delay, making it unplayable. Also, the cost of VC has skyrocketed—it now takes around 400,000 VC to fully upgrade a player, compared to 200,000–250,000 in previous games. On top of that, cosmetics are way more expensive—like 10,000 VC for a single piece of clothing.

Another big issue is how long it takes to upgrade badges. As a casual player, it takes me about a month just to max out the badges for one player, which is frustrating. It feels like 2K is getting more grindy and expensive with every release.

739630,Phasmophobia,"[b]I'm not so good at writting reviews and I rarely post reviews from games that I play. So I'll make this as short and easy as I can ¯\_(ツ)_/¯[/b]

Pros:
- The sound design is really really good, the instant change in the atmosphere right as you walk into the house/building is really terrifying.
- The tools that is in the game right now makes the investigation even more fun.
- There are no sudden jumpscares in the game which is surprisingly a much better experience. You instead experience footsteps, things dropping on the floor and voices that can be heard from behind. 

Cons: 
- Perhaps add some more ambient sounds. For example some wind in certain areas? 
- Add some more investigation tools. For example a laser grid projector?  
- Make some more changes to the voice recognition and some bug fixes.
- More maps. :)
- I noticed in both farmhouse and the streethouses that there are alot of empty drawers, 
  maybe it would be neat to sometimes have items spawn in them that can help the players? 
  For example a glowstick, lighter, candle or a something else? (This might make players 
  more interested and more fun for them to search around these sort of areas.)

Otherwise then this, then I must say that this game is fantastic. It is scary AF and is alot of fun, if you are looking for a scary CO-OP game with friends or alone. then this is the holy grail for those types of games!

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"I used to think ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" and ""Tears of the Kingdom"" were the ultimate in-game freedom, where the world felt alive even when you weren't around. That was until I played ""Baldur's Gate 3."" This game redefines what freedom in a game really means.

I love how Larian Studios put so much heart into this game. They even added an NPC based on a fan's story from Twitter. The fan thanked them for bringing a D&D set that he played with his dad when he was a kid, and they made an NPC that looks just like his dad. It's so touching and shows how much they care about their players.

They also fix bugs really quickly, sometimes within hours or days, which is awesome.

The only downside for me is the same freedom I love. Sometimes it's hard to decide what to say or do next because there are so many choices. It's a bit overwhelming at times.

I haven't tried the co-op mode with friends yet, so I can't say much about that part.

2933620,Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6,"Zombies is great. Liberty Falls and Terminus are good maps to start off the story with, although they are both significantly harder than maps from Black Ops Cold War, which I find somewhat disappointing; but I think OG zombies players will enjoy them.

I can't say much about Multiplayer since I've only played a few matches so far, but it's exactly  what you'd expect from Black Ops. Fast-paced, longer TTK, arcade-style gameplay. Every match feels like a scene from an action movie.

EDIT: I spent a day playing multiplayer and all I want to say about it is this; if you're a casual player looking for a fun experience in PVP, this is not the game for you. As expected from Call of Duty, many players are sweating their balls off trying to get to the top of the leaderboard pretty much every match, and people who aren't are usually just sitting in a corner waiting for you to pass by. The weapon balancing is horrendous, if you're not using weapons like the AK74, XM4, or C9, you'll probably get your butt kicked in every gunfight. Although, I usually just play zombies, so it's probably just a skill issue. The maps are also pretty bad, but I'd say maps like Babylon and Derelict are actually some of the most fun maps I've played on in a long time.

Weapon leveling is painfully slow. I've played with the AMES 85 in zombies for atleast 3 hours total at this point, and it's only up to level 18. In pretty much every other CoD over the past few years, it'd be like level 30. The camo grind has also had a huge downgrade, with players now having to unlock a series of 9 extremely boring military skins just to access the challenges for the skins that are actually good.

SPOILERS for the campaign, now. Some people are saying it's one of the best we've had in years, but I disagree with this. It's fun at first, the characters are great (especially my boy Felix, he's awesome) but towards the end it becomes pretty stale. One mission in particular was really stupid. You play as Case (obviously) and you breathe in some gas in a medicinal facility that makes you trip absolute balls, and the entire mission is literally just a 30 minute fetch quest for some keycards... with zombies? And a grappling hook? Bo6 basically just turns into Dying Light for an entire mission. It's extremely monotonous. The game also experiments with open combat missions, but they don't take up the whole campaign and they're done with much more care. 

Every mission is unique in it's own way. At one point, you're driving around the desert looking for Scud Missiles to blow up, then you're undercover at a casino, and then you're inside of Harrow's mind trying to repair the mirror in her childhood bedroom. It's weeeiiirrrddd.

Also, don't let the trailers fool you, Saddam Hussein is NOT an antagonist of the story. He's simply mentioned a few times and you blow up one of his palaces.","Mixed57% of the 7,086 user reviews for this game are positive.",zombie great liberty fall terminus good map significantly harder map cold war somewhat disappointing og zombie player enjoy mode multiple player interact compete real match far exactly expect fast paced longer ttk arcade style feel scene action movie spent mode multiple player interact compete real casual fun versus not_the expected duty player sweating ball trying top leaderboard pretty usually sitting corner waiting pas weapon balancing horrendous not_using weapon ak74 xm4 c9 probably butt kicked gunfight usually play zombie probably skill issue map pretty bad map babylon derelict fun map long weapon leveling painfully slow ames 85 zombie atleast 3 hour total 18 pretty cod past year 30 camo grind huge downgrade player unlock series 9 extremely boring military skin access challenge skin good spoiler series connected mission level form storyline saying best year disagree fun character great especially boy felix awesome towards pretty stale particular stupid play obviously breathe gas medicinal facility make trip absolute ball literally 30 minute fetch task objective given non keycard zombie grappling hook bo6 basically turn dying light extremely monotonous experiment open combat mission t_emphasizedake series connected mission level form storyline care unique driving desert scud missile blow undercover casino inside harrow mind trying repair mirror childhood bedroom weeeiiirrrddd trailer fool saddam hussein not_an antagonist s_emphasizedimply mentioned time blow palace
1085660,Destiny 2,"--This Review is for Pre-Witch Queen DLC--

Don't be fooled by my game time in Steam, I've been playing D2 since its release in Bnet. I have 1 month play time in Leviathan Raid only.

This game is actually very good. Gameplay feels nice, guns, and abilities are feeling good to use. Story and lore is pretty well thought. If you get this game I promise you you'll enjoy it as long as you'll do every single thing in the game.

And that's where the problem starts: Content. If you want to min-max you'll need to play this game everyday. You will need to play unfavored content for loot. You don't like PvP? Well too bad, you have to do PvP weekly quests for powerful engram. You'll feel burned out soon enough if you finish every content in the game.

Events are a joke to be fair. They look so good yes, the rewards can be decent. However every event is basicly the same: Bounty grind. You grind bounties in event arena. Again and again. Event after event.

Also this is the only game that deletes major content by saying ""vaulting"". Major story content like Red War, Curse of Osiris, Warmind and now Forsaken is gone. Destinations (Maps) related to these gone too. Chances are newer content will be gone too. Old raids are gone, old weapons and armors are gone in the name of ""sunsetting"" -a way that failed miserably to stop power creep. Then those old weapons are brought back as new grindable content.

In addition to these, Destiny 2 is NOT an MMORPG. The most players you see will be in Tower -Main HUB area. Other than that the most crowded you'll get is in 6v6 Iron Banner PvP Event and Raids (6 people). Destiny 2 is a looter shooter. So don't be fooled by its MMORPG tag. 

As a conclusion: You'll love this game, get addicted to it. Consume every single content out there. And then you'll hate the management thus hate the game. However because there are no other game out there like Destiny 2, you'll be stuck with it.","Very Positive80% of the 615,480 user reviews for this game are positive.",pre witch queen downloadable additional released initial launch fooled d2 release bnet 1 play leviathan large group player tackling difficult challenge good feel nice gun ability feeling good lore pretty thought promise you_emphasized enjoy long single problem start min max play everyday play unfavored item reward dropped defeated enemy versus bad versus weekly quest powerful engram burned soon finish event joke fair good yes reward decent event basicly bounty grind grind bounty event arena event event deletes major saying vaulting major red war curse osiris warmind forsaken destination map related chance newer old raid old weapon armor name sunsetting failed miserably power creep old weapon brought grindable addition not_an massively multiplayer online role player tower hub crowded 6v6 iron banner versus event raid 6 looter shooter fooled massively multiplayer online role tag conclusion love addicted consume single hate management hate no_other stuck
2379780,Balatro,"Balatro is a great little rogue-like poker-like game that is surprisingly addictive. I did not expect to like this game as much as I do, and can't wait to see what the devs do with it next. If you like simple and snappy gameplay, are looking for something new to pick up for your steamdeck, or wish poker was more interesting thanks to magical jokers, then this is the game for you. The only thing I wish it had was a stronger sense of permanent progression. Outside of gathering a stronger sense of understanding and overall strategy, your fiftieth run feels pretty similar to your first run. The different decks can offer some interesting twists, but I'm still missing the sense of gradual progression and accumulation of abilities that are present in my favorite rogue-likes. Even with that, I still highly recommend picking this up.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 47,019 user reviews for this game are positive.",great rogue poker addictive not_expect wait next simple snappy pick steamdeck wish poker interesting thanks magical joker wish stronger sense permanent progression gathering stronger sense understanding strategy fiftieth feel pretty similar different deck offer interesting twist missing sense gradual progression accumulation ability present favorite rogue like highly recommend picking

2344520,Diablo® IV,"Diablo 4, a game I once thought would redefine my gaming experience, ended up being a letdown. The initial excitement was palpable—giant demon bosses, open-world elements, stunning graphics—it was all there for what was supposed to be Diablo 4's grand debut. The hype was real; everyone was expecting this to be ""THEIR GAME.""

However, perhaps it's just my tastes evolving over time, but I've come to realize that Action RPGs (ARPGs) may no longer be my cup of tea. The grind, once thrilling and enjoyable, now feels tedious and monotonous. Running the same dungeons repeatedly, at varying difficulties or with different affixes, just to eke out a small percentage boost on gear I've already obtained? It lost its appeal quickly. The repetitive nature became a chore rather than an adventure.

The disappointment extended to the season pass content. After shelling out $69.99+tax for the base game, it was disheartening to see a ""season pass"" on top of that. The content of the pass itself was underwhelming—mostly weak transmog items and horse skins. It left a sour taste in my mouth, making me question why we're paying full price for a game only to be asked for more money for additional content.

What puzzled me even more was that Diablo 4 launched with less content than its predecessor, Diablo 3. Shouldn't a sequel offer at least as much content and more? Sadly, that wasn't the case here.

Perhaps isometric games no longer resonate with me, or perhaps Blizzard missed the mark with this title.

Pros:

Fantastic art and graphics
Enjoyable story mode
Aesthetic of the world and gear is top-notch
Character customization options are diverse
Cons:

Repetitive grind feels like a chore
Season pass content is lackluster
Launches with less content than its predecessor
Gameplay fails to live up to the game's superficial appeal
Despite the positives in the game's appearance and initial allure, these aspects fail to carry into the actual gameplay experience. I made the mistake of purchasing Diablo 4 twice, hoping for a change, once on Battle.net and then on Steam. Unfortunately, it disappointed me both times.

I doubt I'll ever return to this game.

230410,Warframe,"[h1]One of the best free to play games available on Steam.[/h1]

My initial impression of Warframe was that someone had made a huge mistake, and I'd received a rather expensive game for free. As it turns out, Warframe IS free. Which is incredible considering the polished graphics, and quality as it's presented.

Don't be fooled; Warframe is definitely a time sink. Levelling up a Warframe to use better weapons, to then level them further and unlock better mods for weapons - this cycle continues. There is a serious lack of content aside from the same set of missions. 'Smash 'em up carnage and mindless fun' is a great way to describe the game.



- A huge pull, Warframes, weapons, and ships are [i]highly[/i] customisable, and the sheer number of each available is insane. While there are real cash transactions, almost everything in the game can be crafted with some effort on your part, barring cosmetic skins/items. I do feel a little miffed that most colour palletes are also locked behind this paywall. I'm not PSYCHED to be a Red Power Ranger, but guess I will be one unless this changes.


- Saying this, the atmosphere and graphics are excellent. It plays and looks fantastic on my GTX1070, with the camera at a third person view, and OTS zooms for scoped or long-range weapons.

- Combat feels seamless in singleplayer, I have had no problems except for my own inadequacy with a gun (which is slowly improving.) With multiplayer, I have noticed a significant amount of movement lag.

- If you're used to being a long-term clicker, like me, your fingers are probably going to ache after CTRL+ SPACE/SHIFT jumping combos (but you do look hella cool.)

[h1]A word to the nervy.[/h1]

There is a LOT of focus on co-op play, and if you suffer from anxiety as I do, I would suggest playing with friends only or changing settings for solo missions. Unfortunately, my experience of the public community is that it is quite a toxic one. Others may not feel this is the case, but for the majority of the time I've played and spent in public groups, there is a ton of verbal abuse over voice chat/nasty trolls, and as a new player it is -hugely- off-putting.  I have learned of the mute option since, but it feels that the longer a game is released, especially of the MMO variety, and the larger player base it gains, the worse the community gets. [Cue group rushed playthroughs, abuse, stress, panic attacks and not wanting to play again for extended periods of time on my part.]

I await the day a majority friendly community lasts in any MMO, but I may as well live in hope of Half-Life 3.



[h1]To be honest, there are paid games (rather expensive ones) that are put to shame by Warframe.
So very well done Digital Extremes. You have set a standard for gaming, and it's very high.[/h1]


*As to the new Plains of Eidolon update; oh man, THE GRIND IS REAL. It feels as though the developers tried to create a rolling, open world landscape for players to explore and complete missions at their leisure, but the missions are really just repetitive bounties that you have to run all the way back and extract to the main hub to complete. That doesn't fit well with an open world setting.
Repeatable quests and bounties which are required for reputation gain [b]lock your time.[/b] Feeling forced to grind them for rewards and necessary mats after a relatively 'do whatever you feel kind of vibe,' is odd. It would work well as an increment to a large update, but as the update itself, it feels rather shallow.*","Very Positive87% of the 598,811 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

From small interactions that pay homage to the source material to the bombastic brawls that play as though you are in the fast paced action, Sparking Zero stands as the pinnacle on how to adapting a franchise into a game format as well as holding its own in terms of uniqueness in the fighting game scene. 

There are some flaws but nothing that can't be ironed out through minor bug fixes and slight tweaks to patch characters that are absurdly low for their DP cost.

Are you gonna stop expanding your factory and influence? Nah. You double the production capacity, you fuck up the lake with pollution that was clear as the sky when you arrived the planet.

2139460,Once Human,"This game in genuinely my biggest disappointment of 2024. It started off as one of my favorites, the new player experience was great and my first time playing through the original scenario was amazing, it brought all of my friends together and we built houses on the same island and had a great time, the build system was fun and creative, boss fights were fun, silos (dungeons) were really cool. I had so much fun going on loot runs for furniture schematics and prints for my walls/floors/ceilings. It was great.

Then comes server reset. Everything you collected is lost to a soulless 'eternaland' that barely has a reason to exist, you're forced to restart from level 1 with only a very limited pool of resource to bring over items from your stockpile in eternaland, this amounts to maybe one weapon, some of your deviations (pokemon-esque homies that support your base and fight with you), a drill and a chainsaw. Basically nothing, and the slog of re-leveling through the same scenario is just sorta sad and boring. 

Then, the lootcrates. This game is very glitchy and feels unfinished in many ways, and the fact that new lootcrates drop at an astounding rate compared to few and far between content patches or bug fixes, is kinda gross. That said, the lootcrates also feel really aggressive, unfriendly, and unrewarding vs how much money they expect you to pay for them, and obviously they lock all the best cosmetics behind them including some really crazy fun housing and furniture items, if you like base building this really sucks. It feels very exploitative of the dedicated playerbase. Ill make a comparison, I've spent an unreasonable amount of money for cosmetics in games like sea of thieves or STO, SWTOR, etc, and never regretted it for a moment (ish). If these items were not locked behind a really nasty gambling system and just straight purchase options, I probably wouldn't have had as much an issue, but as it stands its really uncool. Seriously the lootcrate gambling makes hoyoverse games look benevolent.

Then I thought, well, I'll try it again when the new winter scenario launches. Hated it. The map is really pretty and well designed, but it is empty and lifeless with very little actual content, its a bug ridden mess at a level that makes this nearly or entirely unplayable at times, and its just not fun. The heat/freeze mechanics are kinda bland and more annoying that anything else. 

So yea, I can't really recommend the game based on the overall experience I had. It's free, so it could be fun for a jump in and clear through the Manibus scenario once, but that's really it. PVP scenarios are even more awful that the PVE. It's really sad, I had high hopes for this game and did truly make some great memories with friends before we all just gave up on it, but I don't see it getting any better without some serious, serious work. Wasted potential at it finest. Maybe I'll check it out again in a year or two.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents -  but the state of the game is beyond awful:

1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.

2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.

3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.

4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.

5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating.
On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.

6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.

7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.

Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.

I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. 
I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

I want to hear other peoples experience on this game and their recommendations on what could be better.
Stay kind and happy holidays!

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Cyberpunk 2077 is an absolutely stunning game that immerses you in a rich and vibrant open world set in a dystopian future. From the moment you step into the game, you're transported into a world that is equal parts beautiful and terrifying at the same time its kinda reminded me of blade-runner 2049 of how the world is kinda f♥uckd up in the future

One of the standout features of Cyberpunk 2077 is its attention to detail. From the intricate character designs to the sprawling cityscapes, everything in this game feels meticulously crafted and thought out. The level of immersion is truly unparalleled, and it's easy to get lost in the world for hours on end.

But it's not just the visuals that make Cyberpunk 2077 such a great game. The story is engaging and well-written, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. The voice acting is also top-notch, with a talented cast bringing the characters to life in a way that feels authentic and believable.

The gameplay is also incredibly fun, with a variety of combat options and character customization that make each playthrough feel unique. Whether you prefer to go in guns blazing or take a stealthier approach, there are plenty of ways to tackle each mission.

Finally, I'm a little disappointed about Adam Smasher strengths but i guess this is how the story told Cyberpunk 2077 is an incredible game that is definitely worth your time. With its stunning visuals, engaging story, and fun gameplay, it's a must-play for any fan of open-world games or science fiction.","Very Positive84% of the 693,658 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

Performance aside, this is very much a follow-up to SoC and CoP and I couldn't be happier with that.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"Since going free to play, the Sims 4 is a semi decent free game. As someone who bought the game and paid for multiple DLCS, ill let you know that this game is the most stripped down and bare Sims to date. I've even played sim city with its horrible origin integration of always having to be online, and can honestly say that I had a more enjoyable experience. (Sims 4 requires Origin also, mad wack)

The game honestly lacks any real soul from the earlier titles and the only thing it has a edge over the others is it's graphics, and with Sims 5 recently being announced i can only imagine that it will be the same engine as this one with just more ""interesting DLCS"" at 20$ a piece. If you want a life sim, get Sims 3 and all of those DLC's. Atleast then you'll have a game with a community that has been trouble shooting Ea's abysmal coding for over a decade. Any mod you could imagine or bug you could encounter has either a fix or work around. Even the slow loading time in Create-a-Sim have been thoroughly optimised to load in under 5 seconds with minimal lag, even on my shit-box of a computer.

Patch 1.5 has been the least buggy that I've ever played the game. There's more content, and more features.

You should never forget that CDPR sold us a buggy, broken game. That features are still incredibly shallow and nothing of what we were initially promised. 

But that aside, Cyberpunk 2077 is still a story, and a world, worth experiencing. I'd get it on sale(it seems to be on sale for a pretty deep discount very often) and not pay full price, but it is still worth getting.

2139460,Once Human,"The good: The game is amazing, especially for one so fresh from early access. There are loads of things to with high, med, and low intensity so you can do something to progress no matter what kind of content you're looking for. The story is great and very compelling. Every single bug or issue I've had with the game has been  such a minor thing that it honestly doesn't take away from the game for me at all and the support team is VERY good at responding. Sometimes they use cookie cutter responses but I see no issue with that either because its generally just for things like when they're acknowledging your ticket. 

The bad: I've experienced multiple bugs but given how small they were I'm honestly not even bothered. None of them prevented me from doing any content in any way. It was small things like, for example, sometimes resources don't stack properly. I had 2 stacks of gravel that should have stacked together but they would not so the result of the bug was losing a single storage space for a short time. 



Overall: This is easily one of my favorite games that has come out in a very, very long time and would love to see it become more popular.","Mostly Positive71% of the 104,699 user reviews for this game are positive.",good amazing especially fresh player purchase play official release load thing high med low intensity progress no_matter kind great compelling single bug issue minor honestly t_emphasizedake support good responding cookie cutter response no_issue generally thing acknowledging ticket bad experienced multiple bug given small honestly not_even bothered prevented small thing example resource stack properly 2 stack gravel stacked not_so result bug losing single storage space short easily favorite game very_emphasized long love popular

1643320,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"Metro's Bigger Brother...
This game is just an absolute must, the visual affects are astounding, the audio is so immersive it had me question that was there a dog near me inside howling and had me actually look around me. This is something that I have been on the edge of my seat for the past 3 years waiting to play and looking at the time of release date and the actual time when the day came as well. May all who worked tirelessly on this game who never got to see it be at peace knowing that they're legacy will carry on in this game that was released and in very good hands at the developers who have finished their work with pride. If you loved all of the Metro games and wanted something more than a linear game play this is something right up your alley. The looting is almost as similar to Escape From Tarkov where you have assigned block slots and you have to fit it in your inventory just like during a raid or in your hide out stash. A lot of the gun and player movement reminds me of it as well the only thing that gets me is that every Russian scenery game scientists almost always have the same accent.

In my opinion, this game is just an absolute unit. With a few bugs that seem to be upsetting but not game breaking at the least. The HUD at the bottom of the screen seems to dissapear and all that appears is the escape button and the only way to make it go away and have your health and stamina bar appear is to open the map and close it and it comes back for a time, the subtitles after a conversation in the game will stay visible until next conversation with someone or if you open the map again. The buttons indications to initiate a conversation with someone in the game does not appear at times and hopefully the person playing it has been long enough to know what to press to talk to them or initiate a trade with all of these minute bugs I still recommend this game at full price. Helping them out with what they had to do by picking up and moving several times because of the hard ships they had to endure during the times and still do. However, if 60 buck is too much give it a year the price will go down and it will go on sale. But as this stands this is something I am so glad that I did pre-order and this has passed my expectations of what Stalker is to me.

BUGS/ ISSUES: As of right now (Categorized for Developers to pinpoint)

-Mouse Curser have been at times not locking to the game screen, annoying in the events of having multiple monitors
-Game has low frame rates when entering base camps (camps that have merchants and the local trading)
-Enemies spawning in game repeatedly/ continuously in the same area, as if almost a multiplayer gaming lobby like TDM.

2408820,Luma Island,"Playing this coop with my spouse has been fantastic. It seems to have just the right amount of grind and puzzle aspects that keeps us coming back. We've both picked up two different professions to start with and bouncing between crafting through those and then hitting the mines to upgrade our tools has been a lot of fun. They chose Brewer and Jeweler, and I'm a Fisher and Blacksmith. We've progressed into the third biome and the maps have been incredibly satisfying to explore. While some of the activities are a bit formulaic it seems that each location has something a little different added to discover.  
The full 3d camera enables a density in level design that makes exploring fun and the areas repopulate with resources aggressively so you're constantly getting a stream of materials to work with. The decision to make the personal inventory infinite removes the hoarder anxiety from popping each and every loot pinata that spawns as you stripmine a level.

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"""This game is ""fun"" only in the sense that you're playing Magic the Gathering. In every other way, Arena is a pile of flaming ♥♥♥♥ that's tolerable at best and downright unplayable at worst, and is a perfect testament to the greed of the repulsive ghouls at Wizards of the Coast. This game has one of the most abusive PTW systems I've ever come across. Mythic rarity cards which are so often part of the meta-game (or any card really) can now be unlocked by simply putting in the 3 numbers on the back of your moms credit card, leaving free-to-play or casual players locked in an endless slog of grinding for scraps.

Making your own decks with the cards you have is barely an option, since the obese grease stains who play this game religiously are willing to shell out their entire net worth to make the exact same meta deck that everyone else is using. You can genuinely go into the ranked queue and play for 12 hours and only see the same 3-4 decks with no variation whatsoever.""

Additionally they implemented some kind of system, that makes them sure if your win ratio comes close to 52% you will be ""blessed"" with perfect meta matchup where your opponent have easiest game of their life, and you pull 8 land (mana) cards in first 12 topdecks, after picking hand with 3-4 mana already. And you will be have this games until your WR go back to 50%.

238960,Path of Exile,"I cant recommend this game to new players even if i have more than 1000 hours into it, and i will explain why.

Creating a new character in this game without a written guide is impossible for a new player, and there is not prefixed characters to choose from either. The gap between a correct made character and a wrong one is huge. A new player will certainly end up with a wrong made character, which means it wont be possible for him to reach to the end game.

Gearing is another problem in the game. Gear is directly linked with skills that you need to play. For example if you are a mage and cast fireballs, you need to attach the fireball skill on a piece of your gear, your helmet for example, and spend currency to do so, most of the times a lot of currency. That discourages the player from changing gear in the game, because they have to spend their play time and currency to attach the fireball on their helmet, every time they change it..
So if you are looking for an arpg that you kill minions, loot gear and frequently update your gear, PoE is not for you.

Talking about loots, most of the loots are useless, and by most i mean 99,99% of the loots are useless. Actually they are so useless that you NEED to install a third party loot filter so that you wont see these loots anymore. 
Yeap, there is no in game loot filter, or any server based loot filtering. They just drop hundreds of useless loots on the floor for no reason. Actually the only reason for so many loots on the floor is to slow down our PC, because why not.

And speaking of performance you ll need a very good PC and a very good internet connection to play this game. As it seems the developers do not believe in ""simple is better"", they just throw things in the game ignoring the performance cost and the game becomes unplayable in mid end PCs. The graphic performance for example, you ll need a graphic card that can handle a screen with most of the times more than 100 minions dying at the same time from a single right mouse click..

Talking about gameplay. If you finally have the correct character, with correct passive tree, correct gear, correct gem links on your gear, the gameplay is something like this: Run with left click---> Right click all screen die --> keep left clicking to run to next screen. 

P.S There is no reason to group up with other people in this game. So if you are a group of friends and want to play something muliplayer to have fun, this is not the game for you. The only reason to group up with others is to have the better +50% loots per player in group, which is a horrible reason to group up anyway.

PS 2. Did i mention that the game is not free? The game is literally unplayable without currency stash tab, map stash tab, and premium stash tab to sell items. All these cost 20-30 euros, depends if they are on sale.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"[h1] You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards ""casuals"", nor ""the OGs"" of the COD community [/h1]

Before I get into the title and explain why you shouldn't bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it's kind, I'm going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don't.

[u] What I like [/u]
I) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn't on the AK, when converting it to 5.45.
II) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn't worth it since it didn't make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should've done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy's spawn, not punished for it.

[u] What I dislike [/u]
I) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later.
•Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing.
•Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the ""immersion"" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly.
•The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It's like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a ""brand new game"".
•Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect.
•The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter's shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of ""realism"" to normies who think they've become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive.
•Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll.
II) You might be thinking ""Woah, that's a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn't have messed up worse this time?"". If that's what's on your mind, you'd be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves.
•The UI is some of the worse I've ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn't work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it'd be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is?
•There is this new ""ledge hang"" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It's also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you.
•On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn't like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max [b] every weapon level for every gun to unlock all the attachments for a single gun. [/b] MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it's not even remotely the case.

[h1] So, going back to the title I chose, who is this game targeted towards? [/h1]

[u] Is it targeted towards the ""OGs""? [/u] 
Of course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The ""OGs"" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the ""red dots"" on the minimap and the perk ""dead silence"", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.

[u] So, is MWII2022 targeted towards ""casuals""? [/u] 
Again, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don't have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new ""receiver"" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.

[u] So what is it? Who are they catering to? [/u]
[b] This is just my take, but to me, it's quite obvious. They are catering to whales. A small minority of neglected children and adult toddlers with too much spare time and money on their hands, who's entire life revolves around watching pixels on a screen change colors. This is the purpose of all these recent AAA business practices (grindy battle passes and challenges, ""cosmetic microtransactions"", hidden matchmaking algorithms etc.), to turn you into a loser who wastes their time helping the publisher brag about ""player retention"" to their investors, and their money buying grossly overpriced digital outfits and camos just to feel something new, because the gameplay itself is not enough to give you any kind of fulfillment. DO NOT GIVE IN, and if you have kids, don't let them play modern online AAA games, because they are designed to get gullible people (which every child is) hooked and detached from reality. Don't waste your life on games that take your time for granted. Do you want to achieve something noteworthy in your life, or do you want to throw it all away for some greedy billionaire? It's your choice, but believe me, there isn't time for both. [/b]

 Thank you for reading my review. I don't do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.","Mixed58% of the 653,780 user reviews for this game are positive.",mislead not_targeted neither_towards casuals nor_the ogs cod community title explain bother wasting mwii2022 aaa game kind specific thing select variant weapon platform taking attachment slot mw19 ak74u became utterly obsolete galil ace introduced nearly identical fire rate 74u superior range extra attachment slot ak converting 5 45 ii nice qol choice select wan na killstreaks scorestreaks cod game gave choice perk convert killstreaks scorestreaks typically worth difference difficult streak depending mode player choose whichever system long ago imo player rewarded objective waiting strategic location ambush defeat player enemy choke near enemy player enemy enter world not_punished dislike pretty issue present mw19 including bug present mwii2022 3 year final killcams software programming error cause unexpected behavior stopping abruptly player screen disappearing object pop 5 metre front breaking immersion infinity ward keep bragging constantly riot shield invincibility bug somehow returned third 4 year copy paste 1 0 version hud bit brand flashbangs completely broken blinded 5 second battle hardened perk reduces reducing effect visual kick weapon greatly exaggerated compared real life gun bobbed forth shooter s_emphasizedhoulder dislocated shot guess wan na false sense realism normies gun expert watching gun video youtube worst offender m16 bob sway firing inaccurate m4 completely counter intuitive accurate attachment stats introduced black ops cold war present vanguard removed whatever make choosing dozen attachment category dice roll ii woah bug single digit iq design choice surely messed worse mind wrong oh boy outdo ui worse videogame ui element overlap frequent example challenge lobby screen overlapping navigating weapon progression menu buggy k infinity ward thought good idea shove message boot press escape disconnected search scroll mouse wheel huh ape design menu noone realize confusing ledge hang mechanic allows hang ledge climbing not_a bad idea paper cannot_be disabled causing frequently trigger accidentally taking primary weapon interrupting gunfight killed buggy mechanic climb ledge quickly operator kind seizure remains ledge press space hurting pace increasing likelihood killed screwing paper addition receiver separately 5 attachment slot good idea activision good idea issue implementation attachment shared weapon platform platform good paper player max weapon gun unlock attachment single gun mw19 cold war vanguard already incredibly grindy matter worse previously casual hand wanted gun exclusively order unlock best attachment single gun spend 100 hour leveling gun infinity ward catering casuals seeing complain not_even remotely title chose targeted towards targeted towards ogs course not_the hidden algorithm mw19 force lobby finish eliminating social aspect online gaming punish particular ogs despise algorithm reason cod pro veteran abandoned franchise alltogether removed legacy mechanic red dot minimap perk dead silence discouraged waiting strategic location ambush defeat player enemy playstyle cod community notoriously dislike mwii2022 targeted towards casuals casual player log hour returning turn brain grind upwards 1000 weapon level 100 hour complete receiver forced compete sweaty environment sbmm lobby catering obvious catering whale small minority neglected child adult toddler spare hand life revolves watching pixel screen color purpose recent aaa business practice grindy battle pass challenge cosmetic microtransactions hidden matchmaking algorithm turn loser waste helping publisher brag retention investor buying grossly overpriced digital outfit camo not_enough kind fulfillment not_give kid play modern online aaa game designed gullible child hooked detached reality waste life game granted achieve noteworthy life throw greedy billionaire choice believe t_emphasizedime reading review cod gaming franchise grew butchered name greed developer redeem cheap gimmick painful infuriating hope simpler videogames unknowingly pleasant memory indie developer count

There's core mechanics- the paper abilities- that are useable by every character, which make for a fun twist on a shooter already. And on top of that, there are unique abilities and ultimates for each character. It's a fun game, and it's refreshing to see something somewhat unique in a shooter.

I should acknowledge, of course, that it also blatantly rips off maps from both Overwatch and Counter Strike. Yeah, there's a bomb diffusal mode, and a payload mode. They're fun though.

1401590,Disney Dreamlight Valley,"Look, I had high hopes for this game. I enjoyed myself for some time at first. I was able to see the potential, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. Right now, it is in early access and a lot of people online have held up the early access status as some sort of shield that somehow makes this game immune to all criticism. 
Well, it might explain the many many bugs. That's the point of early access. There will be bugs. I understand.
BUT it absolutely does not make DDV a good game. There are issues, that will continue after the early acces period is over. And they will become apparent the longer you play the game.

PRO:
- It looks pretty? That one is down to personal taste. But they did manage to translate 2D characters into a 3D game without them looking weird, so I think they did great on that front.
- There is no storage limit of items (there is a limit to placed items, but not the storage).
- The main story can be played without spending more money
- Touch of magic tool let's you customize some clothes and furniture. This can be fun.

CON:
The game feels like a mobile game.
Some people might like mobile games. I like some of them, too. But just think of all the things that might bother you with mobile games and know that all of this will be present in DDV. All of it. 

This includes, but needs to be mentioned specifically: the horrific prices of the premium shop, with micro transactions that are beyond a rip off. Two backpacks, that your character can wear for 1500 Moonstones. (For context: the 1200 Moonstones bundle costs 4,99$ and you would still need 300 Moonstones more. For two backpacks.)

Want to have a kitchen that is inspired by Frozen? That is actually divided into three seperate bundles in the premium shop. All together it costs 3450 moonstones and it doesn't even include a sink or fridge. I imagine that will be in a future bundle. 

But even worse: Recently they introduced quests for Wall-E that you can pay for with moonstones. It costs 4000 Moonstones. The closest moonstone bundle to buy this is 5500 moonstones for 20$ so that makes this, what... around 15$ for a hollow feeling fetch quest, and some clothes (a dress/suit, a hat with feathers, a trashcan lid for your head - yes, really- and a shoe as decor.)?
15 Dollars. Let that sink in. At what point does it stop being a micro transaction and becomes a macro transaction?

The storylines are usually piecemeal. You get a sentence or two from an NPC, then you have to grind or do a fetch quest to get the next piece. Sometimes the game will force you to play at specific hours of the day and since the game is linked to real time, there is no way of circumventing this. Only able to play in the evening? Well too bad, you won't be able to progress the quest.

After you finished the main and character quests, the game is basically dead. You can grind for more materials if you want. Or you could try to decorate. But the way to get new furniture is luck based and you probably won't get enough for decorating to be fun. This might change after early access, but for now... most people stop playing shortly after an update cause there is nothing to do. 

There is more I could say. But this might give you an idea of what it is like. 
Please do yourself a favour and don't buy it in early access. Wait for it to be free to play later this year or maybe just skip it entirely and safe yourself a ton of money and a headache.","Very Positive91% of the 16,111 user reviews for this game are positive.",high hope enjoyed able potential cannot_in good conscience recommend player purchase play official release online held player purchase play official release status sort shield somehow make immune criticism explain many_emphasized bug player purchase play official release bug understand not_make ddv good issue continue early acces period apparent longer play highly skilled experienced look pretty personal taste manage translate 2d character 3d weird great front no_storage limit item limit placed item not_the storage spending touch magic tool customize clothes furniture fun con feel mobile mobile game thing bother mobile game present ddv includes need mentioned horrific price premium shop micro transaction rip backpack wear 1500 moonstone context 1200 moonstone bundle cost 4 99 300 moonstone backpack kitchen inspired frozen divided three seperate bundle premium shop cost 3450 moonstone include sink fridge i_emphasizedmagine future bundle worse recently introduced quest wall e pay moonstone cost 4000 moonstone closest moonstone bundle 5500 moonstone 20 make 15 hollow feeling fetch task objective given non clothes dress suit hat feather trashcan lid yes shoe decor 15 dollar sink micro transaction macro transaction storyline usually piecemeal sentence non controlled artificial grind fetch task objective given non next piece force play specific hour linked real no_way circumventing able play evening bad able progress task objective given non finished quest basically dead grind material decorate furniture luck based probably decorating fun player purchase play official release shortly cause idea please favour player purchase play official release wait play maybe skip entirely safe ton headache
1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"What's this?

Out of nowhere. This game was called a failure, a catastrophe but I see now it's because it was ultimately unfinished. I remember the backlash it got back in 2020 and after having played it for the first time over the last few months all I have to say is this is truly something amazing.

Decades of lore and stories? An Anime? There is something so immersive and charming about this universe. The story not only challenges your idea of why you fight to survive, but what a soul is. It challenges ideas of what it means to be you, wrapped in a mystical shell that there is more than what you can see alone. Mysteries.. the game is full of them, Dark Web A.I's who are fully sentient that want to break into our world who are painted as evil but we see examples of that not being true between Delamain and Alt. Legends of old heroes who are recounted only in stories such as Bartmoss and Morghan Blackhand. Conspiracy and corruption, shadow control, concepts of fate and destiny all confront you to draw your own answers. 

When I completed Cyberpunk 2077 for the first time I was left wondering if I had really done the right thing. If my path was the best way? Can a best scenario even really exist? 

The only thing I can really say is the same thing I can say for my own life.

1203620,Enshrouded,"I don't know if this game is worth it. It feels like a cool house building sim with a pointlessly difficult ""Soulslike"" game built around it. There's so many game mechanics based around timers, half of them rushing you and the other half making you wait. There's too much tedium, too little reward for risk taking, and an unfocused progression path confusing you with unclear choices. What even is the point of craftable weapons when, by the time you can afford to craft them, you will already have had to find much better weapons anyway?

I am also getting tired of tree-punchers and this one is the tree-punchiest yet. You'll chop down a forest to make one house, farm a field of plants one-by-one by hand and drain every well you can find dry just to make a few potions, dig out an entire mine to make enough arrows for a single encounter, etc. There's very few quality-of-life features to balance this out.

To top it off, the camera and the combat system are janky. Your view will swing around 360 degrees in a split-second in the middle of fighting, and then you'll drop your block despite having the button firmly held down. No matter what class you want to be, you will need to fall back on melee when you get swarmed, but switching between your weapons is clunky. And yet you can't just be straight melee either because it doesn't do enough damage on its own. Then there's the nerfing of powerful items without buffing the weak ones, so the grind seems to be intentional.

The game may be Early Access, and it is largely free of serious issues, but it also feels soulless.","Very Positive85% of the 53,278 user reviews for this game are positive.",worth it_emphasized feel cool house building sim pointlessly difficult soulslike built s_emphasizedo mechanic based timer half rushing half wait tedium reward risk taking unfocused progression path confusing unclear choice craftable weapon afford craft already weapon anyway tired tree puncher tree punchiest chop forest house farm field plant hand drain dry potion dig mine arrow single encounter quality life feature balance to_emphasizedp camera combat janky view swing 360 degree split middle fighting drop block despite button firmly held no_matter class fall melee swarmed switching weapon clunky straight melee damage nerfing powerful item buffing weak one grind intentional player purchase play official release largely serious issue feel soulless
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"The CEO of Take 2, GTA's publisher talking about how he will force microtransactions into every single one of their games, they want more the $60+ that we all pay for the game but hundreds over the course of your play time regardless of the game.  
 Educate yourself, read how bad these people are know your enemy as a gamer, as a consumer, is: https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/309190/TakeTwo_plans_to_only_release_games_with_recurrent_consumer_spending_hooks.php
Single player, still good, as with most if not all GTA titles thus far, playing 3 different characters is both at times tiring and fun.  One of the 3 is the least interesting, that being Franklin, his character was the least fleshed out yet was made out to be the glue to the group.  The gameplay is mostly better and for it's time it looked great though now visually not as impressive, there are however still instances where the world lives and you just sit back and watch.  

By now you already know what the story is about, you do heists, which compared to PD2, are quite well done and make you feel like you're actually getting something out of it after you've planned for several set-up missions.  Your characters level up their traits so the now bog standard RPG elements are built into the game, for better or for worse which means at times a lot of grinding in order to get better which again is forced and boring in any game.  All in all the story is worth it so long as you find the game on sale, NEVER pay full price for this title as it is simply not worth $60 for a 4 year old game, period.

Now the online aspect of GTA5, where to start.... well it WAS a fair sandbox where you could enjoy getting killed by random a-holes in the server but now you can get that same feeling while you're flying, riding in a tank, anywhere you go you will be harried by other players in Freeroam.  It was a horrible design choice and I will never understand what they ultimately thought would happen.  That's just the crappy overworld, joining matches is a chore if you can even find anything then have fun with the infinite number of game modes that Rockstar keeps shoving out of the door to keep people playing because you'll never find a game mode beyond it's initial introduction.  By the way that’s if you aren’t killed by the countless modders that have been a problem since day 1 of the PC release but does Rockstar do anything?  No they go after the victims rather then the offenders.  

On the subject of stability or how good of a port GTA5 is over all, it is pretty good but it also isn't, the load times are insane, even having the game on an SSD it can take at times an unlimited amount of time to load/connect to an offline lobby.  While the game runs fairly well Rockstar clearly did not make sure that stability and reliability was mirrored during loading and connecting to a lobby.  Sorry but a 4 year old game if it's well optimized should not take 5+ minutes to load on an SSD or any hard drive for that matter, period.  

How they treat their paying customers and loyal player base is also shameful, their support staff, if you can call them that, do nothing but read from prefabricated responses and treats you like you caused the issue to happen.  They constantly suggest over the top things to fix completely separate issues, like uninstall our 50+ gigabyte game and reinstall it in order to fix a connection problem.  Not to mention the countless false positives for account bans and account wipes, which means that even a straight as an arrow player can and will get banned or have all of their cash wiped entirely from their character just because their “state of the art trusted anti-cheat” system flagged your account.  They constantly blame the victim rather then the cause and their support staff are instructed not to speak to anyone regarding bans or said money wipes.  They have constantly denied any and all wrong doing on every account even when given mountains of evidence they are staunch in their “belief” that you are the problem and not their system.

Making money, which is the only way to really get anywhere in the game, because it's not like I want to play the game that I bought, no I want to literally work for hours at a time grinding missions, heists, game modes, etc.  Just to get anywhere in the game.  If you don't grind for cash or pay for in game money you will suffer, the poor are indeed the lesser class in GTA Online with no real way to gain serious money if they can't find the means or the tools.  You can't get the tools if you don’t have the money and if you don’t have the tools you can't make the money.  It's a horrible circle and it does not make a fun game to just enjoy, because you can't because it's work, you're quite literally working within the game universe.  If you own a business,  you're doing work, if you're trying to make money via heists (which is no longer the best way to make money these days, anymore anyway) you work and grind for DAYS on end.  With the amount of time that I spent working in GTA Online, comparing their own pricing for Shark Cards I would have spent thousands of dollars to give you some perspective and I still don't own everything, not even close.  Everything in Online is now priced so that it all but forces you to buy Shark Cards which Rockstar's fee to pay microtransactions.  The best part about them now is that they are totally worthless, with each update that Rockstar releases the items get more and more expensive to the point where even the $100 Shark Card for $8 million, won't even buy you a car or two, where as before when the game was first out you'd be hard pressed to spend all $8 million.  It is done on purpose and now that Take 2's CEO has consistently come out to the public and investor meetings and stated that he treats customers by how they spend on his games.  That should tell you what kind of horrible person and horrible company Take 2 and Rockstar have turned into. 

Their CEO is on record comparing paying human customers to minnows, dolphins and whales, these dehumanizing categories put gamers into their spending habits, if you spend very little and simply grind for days on end for your cash well you’re a minnow, if you buy money constantly then you’re a whale.  These are the people running Take 2 and Rockstar, these are the people saying making games is too expensive, the “people” who compare human beings to aquatic creatures based on their spending habits.

Do yourself and your fellow gamers some respect and avoid this title, educate yourself on how badly Take 2 and Rockstar have been treating their own paying customers for the past 4 years and realize that it will NEVER go back to the way it was.  Take 2 and Rockstar will never be the same again, and when this microtransaction bubble bursts, because it will, Take 2 and Rockstar will be gone because they've now made sure that if their ideas fail their companies fail.  It's better to please your investors then your actual customers, the ones who make  your fame possible.

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"I'd give the game a ""mixed"" review if I could, but since I cannot, it's a thumbs down from me.

The game is still pretty mediocre.

The Skills:

Skills feel pretty shallow, not a whole lot of variety in what you can gather, and crafting skills require mountains of lower tier gather-able items just to level. This winds up causing competition for low level resources, making it harder for newer players to level since often times there's maxed players with much better tools swiping them all up. The crafting skills aren't really profitable unless you're level 200 and have semi decent luck landing a god tier roll on a meta item.

The Economy:

The pure player based economy is a bit of a disaster (aside from the duping bugs that basically ruined it). Due to crafting needing the lowest level materials in the tens of thousands the easiest ways to make money is harvesting low tier materials and selling them on the Trading Post to other players. This leads to the rarer gathering items being sometimes cheaper than some of the easiest to obtain items in the game. There are no NPC traders other than the faction traders, and you cannot sell anything to them. This means anytime the developers disable the TP due to a bug, there's no way to buy, or sell items since even trading between players is disabled.

The Combat/PvP:

The combat is fun, but gets a bit bland, only having three abilities you can use at one time per weapon, making a max of 6 skills you can use if you have two weapons equiped (you still need to swap between weapons to use the other 3). The open world PvP is almost nonexistent since 90% of players don't have it toggled (I don't blame them). The PvP game modes feel like a bland attempt to add the ""PvP focus"" back into the game, unfortunately gear matters a lot in these modes, and you'll often find yourself losing one on one's to a better geared player, or what often happens is getting mobbed in a large battle with other teammates.

The movement:

The latest area, Brimstone Sands, is a pretty cool zone at first and it's the largest zone in the whole game currently. But, by this point you'll know that bigger doesn't mean better. There are NO MOUNTS in the game, nor anyway to increase your movement speed other than by minor ability buffs that last mere seconds, or sticking to the roads in the game. The roads give you a 15% movement speed increase, however, the roads are often winding and it's still faster to just run in a straight line to your objective. Certain abilities give a 10% increase to your movement speed and can let you close gaps on enemies or allow you to escape (like in PvP), but do not stack with the road buff, and that's about the limits of it.

The Questing:

The questing in this game feels like an afterthought, the generic 3-4 quest types are still plaguing the game. Go to X area and do one of the following: kill X number of enemies, loot X number of boxes, touch X item, run a marathon and talk to X person. The lack of mounts, or ways to increase your movement speed exacerbates the boring questing further since a lot of quests, especially later game ones, have a LOT of running.

TLDR;

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"A breath of fresh air in the MMO scene, or rather, a reminder of what it was that made MMOs popular in the first place.
What makes FFXIV:ARR so good, is not what it does have, but rather what it doesn't.

Gimmicks.

Ever since World of Warcraft became such a large player in the MMORPG scene, competitors have risen which attempt to dethrone it with new and ""exciting"" mechanics, but in doing so forget what an MMO even is.

FFXIV:ARR learns from the mistakes of others and sticks to the known strengths of the genre. The holy trinity of Tank/DPS/Healer, Strong and challenging end-game content, deep storyline and world lore, an abundance of content to sink your time into along with major content patches every 2 and a half months.
It should be noted, that major content patches in FFXIV:ARR usually contain the same amount of content an expansion for WoW would contain at launch.

Yes, the game has a subscription model, but given the spetacular failures of numerous F2P and Cash Shop MMOs that have popped up over the years, combined with how this money is funneled into frequent and high quality updates to the game, is this really a bad thing? Honestly, it's well worth the money.

However FFXIV:ARR doesn't just stick to old core values, it does so while breating new life into them that don't undermine their integrity. The holy trinity of MMOs is refered to as holy for a reason, to mess with it is to dance with certain doom. FFXIV:ARR conquers this perplexing problem regarding the need for re-interpretation without becoming gimmicky by altering the way experience works in the game.
In traditional MMOs, you make a character, you select your class and you start getting experience points. As you gain experience, your character levels up thus expanding your capabilities with your selected class, until you hit max level then you move to end-game content.
XIV:ARR does away with character experience, instead replacing it with class experience. You have an active class, determined by the weapon you are wielding and any experience gained will go into the experience pool for your active class. You don't level your charcter, you level your class. For example, I'm currently a level 50 conjurer, specialising in the advanced healing class ""White Mage"" and I am also at the same time a level 18 Thauterage, the predecessor to the DPS class ""Black Mage"".
This doesn't make me some weird DPS/Healer hybrid, I can only be one at any one time. If I have a WHM weapon equipped, I'm a WHM and I have access to all the abilities of a WHM of my level and can equip gear for my class. I do not however have access to abilities for classes I have also leveled (except certain cross-class abilities which are sort of how this game does talents) nor can I equip gear meant for a Black mage while I have my white mage active. At the same time, when I switch to my black mage, it is as if I am a fresh character still leveling and only at level 18, the fact I have a class at max level does not affect my game play at all.

This is great since it allows for alts without having to give up your character, your identity, your friends, your guild etc, you have it all in one place, without ever undermining the holy trinity.

FFXIV:ARR shows that it's possible to approach MMORPGs with a ""Don't fix what isn't broken"" philosophy without simply remaking yet another WoW.

On a final note? I pre-ordered the imperial edition for The Elder Scrolls Online, that set me back $75 USD, I did that before I started playing this and you know what? I've decided to just swallow that purchase and play this instead.
It's THAT good.

Saying all that however, the game is certainly not without it's faults.
FFXIV:ARR is a remake of the 2010 game FFXIV, which frankly? Was absolutely terrible.
The original game suffered from poor UI, poor world design, a dull and slow (Even by MMO standards) storyline and terrible optimisation leading to significant technical issues.
There is only so much you can do with this and this shows when we look at the current game world.
The current world is made up mainly of what was the original open game world which has had the massive bloat cut from it, the areas worth keeping turned into zones which are seperated by zone transitions.
These aren't instanced, which is good, but still it does break immersion a bit.
Thankfully, this isn't likely to be an endearing issue as developers have acknowledged the size of the world which though acceptable, could use a bit more to it and have said that we will be seeing significant increases to the world's size in major expansions (the first of which is expected in the second or third quarter of 2014).

There are also some key class types which are noticably absent from the game, for example the stealthy ambusher, (thief, rogue, ninja etc), however once again the developers have acknowledged this issue and said plans are in place to bring in new classes in future patches and expansions.

Typically, I would count this as a major negative when forming my opinion on a game but I have been very impressed with how reliable Square-Enix are for following through on promises and fixing or introducing things where needed.
So I'm willing to take their ""We are aware of this and we have plans in motion to meet these requests"" in good faith, something I am VERY hesitant to extend to many if not most game developers these days.

Overall?
FFXIV:ARR is the equivilent of a miracle in gaming. Not only rescuing a title otherwise doomed to ridicule, but improving it to such an extent that it deserves a place in the genre's historybooks on account of it's merits.
It has it's issues sure, but nothing that comes close to being considered a major con against it's abundance of pros.

I highly recommend buying this game, or at the very least, putting it onto a watch list and keeping a very close eye on it over the next few months to see just how well it is cared for for yourself.

I'll give this an 8/10 :V

2344520,Diablo® IV,"In one word: Boring.

I've really struggled to find the returned excitement to continue playing like I have with literally every other Diablo game. It just lacks so many of the addictive elements that made past entries work - namely, the multiplayer experience is garbage and has completely lost any sense of what one would consider to be an ""in-game, online community"". It's just not there. Sure, you've got your friends list and the chance enounter with randoms crossing your path - but gone are the glory days of doing runs with ""rooms"" of other players. 

No doubt, it's the most beautiful game of the genre, and it no doubt has better accessibility options than any other as well - but does that make it a satisfying or fulfilling game? It sure isn't enough. When so much of the game is a grind, you have to ask yourself - for what ends? If I'm not enjoying the journey to the end-game nor the end-game itself - why keep playing? So - I stopped. I've looked at its installed, ready-to-play status on my Steam library but I yawn in consideration of playing it any further as I continue to routinely pass it up for other, better games from this year.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"One of the best FPS game I've ever played.
This is my first review so I'm sorry for the mistake.
Let's review some basic things:

[b]Gameplay[/b]
This game is different from other FPS games, it's unique in it's own way. Do you ever played a game where you can blow literally a house down? I don't think so.

[b]Guns[/b]
Ubisoft really put a thing about guns, Every single gun have it own unique stats and thus affecting your play style. For example, Mira's Vector submachine gun have [i]SANIC SPEED[/i] rate of fire and [i]HOLY SH!T[/i] recoil while Pulse's Ump45 have a more stable recoil and a slower RoF and greater damage. And putting a barrel attachment affects the guns (Silencer decreases the damage, etc.).

[b]Operators[/b]
Every single Operators are individually unique. They affect your play style (obviously duh) and they have their own skills and stats (More armor, More Speed or balanced). But I'll put more attention on the skills, the skills will determine whether your operators is to roam or not to roam (for defenders operators) and go alone and rush or stick with your teammates and help them (for attackers operators). For example...

[table]

[tr]
 [th]Defender[/th]
 [th]Kapkan[/th]
 [th]Defend at site[/th]
 [th]Laser Explosive Traps[/th]
 [th]Kapkan skill is not very suitable for roaming as he must lay the traps at the doors and windows, and this works best in the room where the objective is located to prevent the attackers from going in.[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
[th]Defender[/th]
[th]Caveira[/th]
[th]Roamer[/th]
[th]Silent Step and Interrogation[/th]
[th]Caveira is one of those roamers, she needs to roam around the map and search for isolated enemy and down them so that you can interrogate the enemy and reveal the rest of the enemy team position and operators for 10 secs.[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
[th]Attacker[/th]
[th]Thermite[/th]
[th]Grouper[/th]
[th]Thermite Breaching Charge[/th]
[th]His skill is a Thermite Breaching Charge that can destroy reinforced walls, he needs to be with his teammates so that he can help to breach a reinforced wall to the objective or make another flank route.[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
[th]Attacker[/th]

I'm only a couple of hours into Outlaws and I am Star Wars fan but I don't believe that I'm a biased fan. I gave Jedi Survivor 2 a negative review due to the extremely bad performance and eventually refunded it as I was so disappointed after months of updates that the game was still fundamentally broken. 
This game is not JS2. 

My first two hours with it have been an absolute pleasure. I could sit and watch what's going on in the backgrounds for hours, droids and different species just wondering around, I love the immersiveness of it all and the gameplay and story have been top notch so far. Combat is fun, controls feel tight and the difficulty feels fair. There have been a few moments where as a Star Wars fan I've just sat back in awe of this game already.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"Can't recommend a game where the developers are completely with the community and completely out of touch with their stupid responses. With the latest update in Season 22, Respawn and EA have doubled the prices for their season Battlepass while effectively removing your ability to earn it for free by grinding enough Apex Coins. With new seasons you are forced to pay real money with no other option other than shelling up extra money. It's infuriating to see them nickel and dime the player base while refusing to address the many issues the game currently has. Instead of raising the price for the battle pass by a reasonable amount instead of one battle pass now they've added two of them by splitting it into two tiers. $10 for their ""Premium BP and additional $20 for the premium+"". 

I get it, it's a free-to-play game and it needs to make a healthy return on investment every quarter but c'mon guys there's a limit for greed. And what truly pisses me off is the fact they word it in a way that they are doing us a favor. Does Respawn think we are stupid? It’s clear that their player base is declining and now they're doing as much they can to squeeze the lemon dry. I can't see the game thriving anymore with the recent changes.... unless if they fix matchmaking, solve the cheater problem, 20 tick crappy servers, removing duos, etc. Game was already at an all-time low and they added this which is the nail in the coffin for most people.

UPDATE: As of July 26, 2024 EA & Respawn decided to update the game's battle pass system in respond to backlash after 70,000+ negative reviews on Steam. The ability to earn Battle Pass inexchange of Apex Coins (950 AC to be precise) has finally restored back in! However now there's a catch, there are yet again three tiers of Battle Passes - Premium, Ultimate and Ultimate+. Premium costs 950AC and can actually be earned for free if you have enough Apex coins... but then there's Ultimate and Ultimate+ for $10 and $20 respectively and no CANNOT earn these by simply playing the game alone. You will have to pay real money if you want those money anymore. It costs $20 without giving you an option to spend 2800 Apex Coins like they did previously.","Mixed67% of the 964,080 user reviews for this game are positive.",recommend developer completely community completely touch stupid response latest season 22 act enemy reappearing world defeated ea doubled price season battlepass effectively removing earn repeatedly performing action gain resource coin season forced pay real no_other shelling extra infuriating nickel dime base refusing address issue currently raising price battle pas reasonable battle pas splitting tier 10 premium bp additional 20 premium it_emphasized play need healthy investment quarter c mon guy limit greed truly piss word favor act enemy reappearing world defeated stupid clear base declining squeeze lemon dry thriving anymore recent change unless fix matchmaking solve cheater problem 20 tick crappy server removing duo already low nail coffin july 26 2024 ea act enemy reappearing world defeated decided battle pas respond backlash 70 000 negative review earn battle pas inexchange coin 950 ac precise finally restored catch three tier battle pass premium ultimate ultimate premium cost 950ac earned coin ultimate ultimate 10 20 no_cannot earn simply alone pay real anymore cost 20 giving spend 2800 coin previously

381210,Dead by Daylight,"This is simultaneously the most fun, and most infuriating game I've played in a long time.

It's an asymmetrical game where one player is a powerful killer, hunting down 4 elusive survivors before they can start generators and leave the trial.

For an asymmetrical game, it's in a state where it's surprisingly balanced between the two sides. Either side has a few things that infuriate the other and certain killers are notoriously overpowered, or underpowered. Freddy Kreuger mains, for instance, must hate themselves to play that, and Nurse mains must just hate playing the game fairly.

New content is regular, 1 killer, 1 survivor, 3 perks for each side, and a map are released every 3 months or so, mid chapter balance patches occur, and cosmetics are regularly added. Recent content additions have, however, cut back on content. A new map hasn't been added with the last 2 additions, each of which only contained 1 character. They have also dropped the term ""paragraph"" which used to refer to 1 character being added and now refer to all DLC as ""chapters,"" meaning their roadmap now suddenly promises a lot less future content. They are also reworking an old tileset to have ""5 different configurations"" changing the layout but using the same buildings, meaning much less variation than original tilesets that have 5 completely unique maps built on them. 

Recent killer additions have been mediocre at best. The Legion (Dec 2018) was released and completely changed the chase dynamics for the killer, which was blatantly broken and had very little counterplay. They were soon nerfed into a state where they barely feel like they have a power any more. Since then, the Plague (Mar 2019) and the Ghost Face (June 2019) have powers that are overwhelmingly controlled by the survivor players more than the killer, making them incredibly frustrating and unrewarding to play. Due to their mistakes with Legion they seem scared to release killers that actually feel decent in the meta. Only one ""strong"" killer has been added in the last 2 years.

There are downsides however. While balance patches come regularly, they won't do anything incremental. Freddy is ridiculously weak, but they refuse to give him small quality of life changes that they have said he needs until they are ready to release a full rework of him. Meaning rather than sitting at a 'meh' stage, he sits in boring, weak and generally unfun. His upcoming rework has finally been announced in (some) detail, which, going off the most recent version we've heard, leaves a lot to be desired.

Pay to pay to keep paying. Buying the game will net you around one third of the cast. Many are also available through grinding, however licensed killers and survivors require further payment. Their perks are also locked to you, unless they are picked on the ""random"" weekly shrine. (The good ones rarely are.) On top of this, despite in game currency being used for cosmetics, anything they think looks good or will be popular is locked behind payment only. It's a dick move when you may have already spent upwards of $80 just to unlock characters.

Awesome, and incredibly angry, community, as you'd expect from a game like this.

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"Cheater's Haven

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆

Call Of Duty showcases its potential as a thrilling and competitive experience, offering a range of ranks for players to aspire to. However, this potential quickly crumbles as you approach the upper echelons of the game's ranking system, namely Diamond and Crimson ranks. It's at this point that the curtain is drawn back, revealing an alarming and disheartening reality: cheating runs rampant, and it's here to stay.

The game's anti-cheat system, touted as a guardian against dishonest players, falls laughably short of its promise. It's as though the developers handed cheaters the keys to the kingdom, with little to no repercussions for their actions. The result? An utterly demoralizing experience where the line between legitimate and illegitimate players blurs into oblivion.

As you climb the ranks, you'll soon realize that every other game pits you against cheaters who flaunt their unfair advantages with reckless abandon. The sense of accomplishment one should feel when achieving a high rank is overshadowed by the sheer frustration of encountering cheaters at every turn.

What's more disheartening is the revelation that even some of the game's top 250 players and content creators are tainted by the stain of cheating. This not only erodes the integrity of the competitive scene but also undermines the trust that players place in the community's leaders.

One might hope that the developers would take swift and decisive action to address this crisis. Alas, hope is in short supply here. The only tangible effort they seem to have made is the implementation of a ""shadow ban"" system. However, calling this system broken would be a gross understatement. It's a convoluted, haphazard attempt at reining in cheaters, and its results are often arbitrary and infuriating.

In the end, Call Of Duty is a cautionary tale of a promising game's descent into chaos, with cheaters running amok and an impotent anti-cheat system doing little to deter them. The experience is marred by a ceaseless barrage of unfair encounters, ultimately driving players away in droves.

Avoid this title like the plague unless you have an inexplicable fondness for the torment of perpetual cheaters, shattered dreams, and broken promises. In a world filled with gaming options, Call Of Duty stands as a testament to how neglecting a cheating problem can turn a once-thriving community into a wasteland of frustration and despair.","Mostly Negative32% of the 39,711 user reviews for this game are positive.",cheater rating duty showcase potential thrilling competitive offering range rank player aspire potential quickly crumbles approach upper echelon ranking namely diamond crimson rank curtain drawn revealing alarming disheartening reality cheating run rampant stay anti cheat touted guardian dishonest player fall laughably short promise developer handed cheater key kingdom no_repercussions action result utterly demoralizing line legitimate illegitimate player blur oblivion climb rank soon realize pit cheater flaunt unfair advantage reckless abandon sense accomplishment achieving high rank overshadowed sheer frustration encountering cheater turn disheartening revelation top 250 player creator tainted stain cheating not_only erodes integrity competitive scene undermines trust player community leader hope developer swift decisive action address crisis ala hope short supply tangible effort implementation shadow ban calling broken gross understatement convoluted haphazard attempt reining cheater result arbitrary infuriating duty cautionary tale promising descent chaos cheater running amok impotent anti cheat deter marred ceaseless barrage unfair encounter driving player drove avoid title plague unless inexplicable fondness torment perpetual cheater shattered dream broken promise world filled gaming option duty stand testament neglecting cheating problem turn thriving community wasteland frustration despair
238960,Path of Exile,"Path of Exile is probably the best ARPG game i've played in the past years.
The game is pretty easy to learn but hard to master. 

You basically have a guide for every mechanic on Youtube or on the Path of Exile Official Forum, which is a big plus in my opinion.
You probably need a few hundred hours playtime to completely understand what you are doing but this is not a negative point for me.

[b]PLEASE DONT BE AFRAID OF THE SKILL TREE ONCE U OPEN IT FOR THE FIRST TIME!!![/b]
- The skill tree seems really complicated but its actually pretty easy to understand

[b]Is the game pay to win?[/b] Well i dont think it is but you need like 20-30$ to get the Stashtabs which will help you a lot!

If you have any further questions about the game, you can add me in Steam after you commented on my profile. We can discuss certain things for sure.

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"Warzone 3 has managed to be such a disappointing gaming experience that I wish I had never played it in the first place. The game is riddled with bugs, starting right from the loadout selection, where it feels more like a lottery than a strategic choice. Many times, my efforts to gain an advantage over opponents were in vain, as I wouldn't receive the chosen loadout in-game.

Graphical issues abound in Warzone 3. Textures are often confusing and distorted, creating an unpleasant and frustrating gaming experience. If you don't feel like you're playing on an old and outdated computer, consider yourself lucky. Additionally, colors and effects are excessively exaggerated, giving the impression of being in a digital carnival rather than a serious battle.

Performance issues extend even to external matches, where the game's flaws become apparent garbage. Of course, in a competitive gaming environment, we would expect the smoothest and most balanced experience possible, but Warzone 3 falls far short of these expectations. Lag and connection issues make every match a struggle not only against opponents but also against the game itself.

In conclusion, Warzone 3 is a total letdown. With a plethora of bugs, graphical issues, and subpar performance, this game brings nothing new or revolutionary to the world of video games. Instead, it offers only frustration and regret for the time and money spent. I do not recommend it even to the genre's biggest fans, as there are many other options on the market that provide a much more enjoyable and satisfying experience.","Mostly Negative32% of the 39,711 user reviews for this game are positive.",warzone 3 managed disappointing gaming wish never_played riddled bug starting loadout selection feel lottery strategic choice time effort gain advantage opponent vain receive chosen loadout graphical issue abound warzone 3 texture confusing distorted creating unpleasant frustrating gaming old outdated computer consider lucky color effect excessively exaggerated giving impression digital carnival rather serious battle performance issue extend external match flaw apparent garbage course competitive gaming environment expect smoothest balanced possible warzone 3 fall far short expectation delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection connection issue struggle not_only opponent conclusion warzone 3 total letdown plethora bug graphical issue subpar performance brings revolutionary world video game offer frustration regret spent not_recommend genre biggest fan option market provide enjoyable satisfying
1245620,ELDEN RING,"I had enormous expectations having put a thousand hours into Dark Souls 3 alone. Sadly, ER is tainted by design decisions not fully thought through, and a refusal to question the ideals of a framework first established with Demon’s Souls in 2009, and I ended it wishing I hadn't played it at all (more on this later) - or that Steam would finally add a neutral rating.

For context, excluding a discarded run and multiplayer, my completionist and almost entirely guide-free solo run lasted around 150 hours, beating every boss barring Malenia without summons.

Let’s open positively: Elden Ring inherits DS3’s DNA, particularly combat: The same crunchy brawls, responsive controls and top-tier animations that characterised DS3, aided by expanded enemy, weapon, and ability variety with magic being more diverse than ever.

From’s signature storytelling returns, requiring piecing together environmental details, item descriptions and other vague information to decipher the full picture, avoiding interminable cutscenes or overbearing HUD notifications.

The Lands Between is geographically impressive. It fuses aesthetically and mechanically diverse biomes into vertiginously stacked layers, threading interesting discoveries through challenging navigation, aided by a time of day and weather system that adds subtle gameplay changes.

So why the thumbs down?

DS3 is great because it’s meaningful. It’s an incredible fantasy brawler, but shines with its premise of a cursed world having its blighted existence artificially prolonged by an age of fire unnaturally lengthened by Gwyn and his tragic legacy’s followers. The Ringed City DLC literally warped and smashed the series together until only ash remained at the end of the world and time itself in a manifestation of cosmic decay from a realm prohibited from moving on. Its creatively defiant metacommentary rejected a pop culture engorged on commercialised nostalgia and humanity’s obsession with the past impeding a new, better world being built, using From’s own ludography to show stagnation blocking progress. It had to innovate to avoid hypocrisy, so it repurposed old combat mechanics and weaponry into new rhythms, and tonally shifted from quiet hope in the face of graceful sadness to crushing desperation - not to fix its cursed world, but to euthanise it and start anew instead - while retaining the series’ unrelenting melancholy and heart of gold.

ER ignores that. It retroactively invalidates DS3’s message of moving on from an unsustainably tired world by repurposing years of content, and when it [i]does[/i] deviate, it does so uncharacteristically clumsily for From. This is why I wish I hadn’t played it: DS3 made me laugh, cry, and stuck in my mind for years, and was ultimately about something bigger than itself - and powerfully resonated for it. ER contradicts DS3’s critique of wheel-spinning by indulging repackaged nostalgia in the same way Disney’s maligned Star Wars trilogy has left people feeling worse towards the franchise than if no new films had been made at all.

The story is shockingly conservative, with almost identical plot points, settings, characters, and themes to From’s back catalogue. We again have well-intended rulers cursing the world in an attempt to save it, religious fundamentalists, spurned vengeful offspring, agents of chaos, and a tarnished (now literally!) player enforcing a new world order. The biggest change is a bloated chain of divine command, expanding DS' demigods with [spoiler]Empyrians, Fingers, the Elden Beast, aliens, and cosmic gods[/spoiler], but it brings few new ideas. This is the reanimated corpse of a concluded story that meta-commented on such narrative necromancy, and is immensely disappointing for it. Worse, what little new exists is often explicit and definitive, trading the intriguing mystery of DS’s nebulous motivations and history that still produce seismic theories a decade later, for a story nearly entirely resolvable in a single playthrough.

There [i]is[/i] a tonal shift from quiet tragedy to bellicose grandeur of divine infighting exploding into total warfare - but if anything interferes with deep emotional investment, it’s unlikeable middle managers arguing over who deserves the office promotion. Conflict between irredeemable villains is a far cry from the turbulent power of DS’s Greek tragedy, particularly in a setting largely morally binary and with a less charismatic cast. Standouts like Rya or Blaidd don't impact like Solaire’s devastating misfortune or Siegward’s surprising nobility. Characters were the emotional core of DS, but are neutered here by worn tropes and the meandering pacing inherent to open worlds.

Gameplay is also a missed opportunity. DS3’s combat is great, but Sekiro’s is easily the best ever in a game of its type - yet we’re back to DS3’s unbalanced weapon classes and abilities, inconsistent magic, and same old movesets, lacking Sekiro’s thrilling posture and counters mechanics. Dual wielding, ashes of war and guard counters are small improvements rather than an overhaul that had six years to materialise, and the camera is as bad as ever. Content suffers from repetition too: Dungeons keep cropping, with the same music, bosses and presentation, occupying a huge chunk of a completionist’s playthrough, and the non-dungeon biomes feel interminable as you’re incentivised to be extremely thorough in these needlessly enormous areas in search of equipment, lore, and quests.

Quests are as obtuse as everyone’s saying, borderline impossible to complete without guides, a From staple magnified by the overwhelmingly gigantic map diluting quality even further. ER’s first areas are exciting, but fifty hours in become tedious, particularly with the second half’s environments primarily being single-level plains with occasional repeated giant assets.

The initially impressive scope grows tiresome in its enormity, and leads to a game that’s harder to balance and populate with unique content, particularly evident in the later difficulty spikes and clearly unfinished areas and encounters, including final bosses that pale in comparison to the thematic or mechanical significance of DS3’s Soul of Cinder and Slave Knight Gael. Bosses are just bad across the board: Most movesets chain four or five attacks together leave you waiting for an opening far longer than actually fighting, and many require specific builds to overcome damage sponges, homogenising combat into a [i]wait - wait - wait - wait - single attack - wait[/i] loop. ~150 bosses is too many for From to make each interesting, fair, memorable, or downright enjoyable.

ER’s multiplayer is also From’s worst since DS1. Hits can sometimes take over ten seconds to register and disconnects prevail. Reduced summon counts neuters fight clubs, invasions are overly unbalanced and spawns are terrible, and with covenants gone, so too are the emergent player dynamics and roleplay.

Finally, ER’s presentation is mixed. Its style is outstanding: Characters are strikingly creative and full of personality, environments are dense with detail, and sound effects are as satisfying as ever, though the music rarely reaches DS3’s heights and is often repeated. But From’s ambition far outpaced their technical capacity: ER is graphically antiquated, but the elephant in the room is [b]the worst shader compilation stutter in years, paired with disappointing framerates, considerable crashing, and cheating aplenty. The stutter single-handedly ruined the first third of my playthrough, dissipating after about 70 hours but never fully resolving, and is bad enough to alone make this review a thumbs down[/b].

ER wavers between being a retread of old ideas and a failed attempt at new ones. It's such a missed opportunity. If all you want is killing enemies in brutal combat, it’s great - the DS template alone earns ER inherited praise - but if you’re after an emotionally and philosophically challenging story, pick up DS instead.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"Elden Ring is hard ? bosses are dying simply by smelling my breaths, and ho you gotta believe me, it smells so bad their internal organs get rotten to death. i mean, i'm happy from the victory but it's kinda an insult, like if they're saying i rather die than be near you or something.

aside from the half joke above ( rotten breath is op, be sure to grab it )
the game feels like skyrim, fewer npcs but more dungeons and more spells and weapon variety. if you liked dark souls or skyrim, or anything similar, you will enjoy this.

if you want to get better at it, you need to know your weapons and spells, ashes and summons, consumables, wondrous  physic and so on. don't rely on basic knowledge as you will regret later on, the game throws a lot of mechanics at you and expects you to use them all.

easier than dark souls, better than dark souls, and the netcode is way better than dark souls.
harder for invaders, as solo online players don't get invaded unless they use a specific reusable item designed for summoning invaders, hunt me babe <3 , co-op sessions are always open for invades, which makes invades mostly a 2v1 or even worse, 3v1. they deserve it if you ask me.

almost no bugs, those that happened for me were enemy spawn bugs and i'm grateful XD
optimization is not great, but the port itself is a well done PC port, all graphical and control binding and so on.

Elden Ring is not that hard like everyone's saying, respec is pretty easy, open after completing 1/4 of the game, and character re-customization is open and free anytime you want. sadly there's no transmog, you either wear a big armor or weak, beautiful light dresses.

it has a lot of copy paste bosses/mini-bosses but since you need at least 200h to complete every dungeon and open area boss and puzzles/locations in-between, it's fine imo


i recommend this game to the point i think $60 is a steal for it. remember those old games that had 3x more content than modern games ? Elden Ring is like that.

every moment of the game was blast for me, even the moments i got blasted to death,
they're technically blast moments, right ?

1085660,Destiny 2,"TL:DR - Satisfying guns, good campaigns and TONS of content make for a very good FPS-RPG game!

Destiny 2 has some of the best FPS gunplay on the market today, especially if you enjoy playing with friends. If that's all you care about then you might want to give the game a try. D2 has just recently begun transitioning to a more RPG-focused style of play so some things such as mods, perks and skill trees aren't fully fleshed out yet. That said you probably won't notice this unless you're in the end-game trying to min-max your build.

The early game can be a little challenging for new players because of all the various systems at play. Think of it as an easier Warframe or Path of Exile. There are plenty of resources to find out more about the game however, particularly on Reddit. /r/ShardItKeepIt for deciding which weapons to keep or discard. /r/CruciblePlaybook for PvP tips. /r/DestinyTheGame as the official unofficial subreddit for the game, and /r/Destiny2 for the memes. You can also look to /r/Fireteams or the Destiny mobile app to find people to play with.

In terms of free content, the first three campaigns are unlocked - [i] The Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind. [/i] You also have access to all strikes (replayable mini-missions), PvP and PvEvP maps and modes, and all 9 planets/destinations. Additionally there are three raids available - [i] Leviathan, Spire of Stars, and Eater of Worlds. [/i] These are challenging but fun 6-man activities that require a lot of coordination and skill to beat. There's a lot more F2P activities as well that you will find once you start playing. They may not have all been amazing at launch, but after 1-2 years of updates and tuning they've never been more enjoyable.

[i] Forsaken [/i] is the first paid DLC. Purchase of it comes with the raids [i] Last Wish, Scourge of the Past, and Crown of Sorrow, [/i] as well as several exotic weapons. Even if you don't or won't raid, it's worth it for the story alone. It's a sci-fi western tale of revenge for a dear friend, and is Destiny's highest narrative moment. 

[i] Shadowkeep [/i] is the second and newest paid DLC. While not as impressive as [i] Forsaken [/i] story-wise, there's still a lot of content to do especially considering how it's bundled with the current Season Pass. This is the story of how another ancient threat is discovered under the Moon. Sounds underwhelming yes, but saying anymore would require spoilers. The current Season focuses on an army of machines controlled by sentient milk that invades the solar system. Absolutely worth it. There's also a raid included here, [i] Garden of Salvation, [/i] as well as an upcoming dungeon.

All in all, there's an overwhelming amount of content here if you're a new player. It may be daunting, but play through the (optional but highly recommended) campaigns and you'll soon find yourself at home with the game.

230410,Warframe,"I'm bored of this game. I can barely play it. A lot of the new content is more of the same. This is a common theme between veterans, as you can see from several negative reviews from people with 1k+ hours into the game.

HOWEVER...

If someone played a game for this many hours and stopped because of the lack of content, it's not due to the game being unfun. The average player will find the game quite entertaining for the most part. There's just too high of an expectation of being able to play a game 10 hours a day and not get burnt out.

It's an amazing game. By the time you are bored, you'll have spent more time in this game than you'd ever have on several ""AAA"" titles combined. And it's free. The monetization is absolutely fair (and extremely cheap). Seriously, if you get a 75% discount on one of the Daily Rewards (not an uncommon reward), any plat purchased will net so much value and for a long period of time.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"Another reviewer summarized it best by saying they don't feel immersed by the game. Rook, the story, the companions, all make it so hard to be pulled into the world. It's mainly the writing is bad. I'm 6 hours in with regards to content for reference, but really would not recommend this game.

Rook is just an empty character and kept empty by unimpactful dialogue choices at every turn so you just feel like you're trying to be everyone's pal. Your dialogue options are usually ""Agree Cheerfully"", ""Crack a Joke"", and ""Agree Sternly"". I'm incapable of hurting NPC's feelings, so I stayed away from the stern options at first thinking that was the asshole option, but it's already become my default because it's normal by comparison.

The nobody stumbling into heroics trope is fine, that's how the whole series kicks off stories, but this time you didn't even stumble into it. Varric just hired you sometime before the game and now you're in charge. Paper thin backstory is given for why Varric had even heard of you. You've been friends for a while now, don't you know? Even past that, compared to every other MC in the series, why does Rook even care?

The very front of the story is good, ramping up quickly, but then turns straight into railroaded companion collecting once you get past the marketing/demo/early access content prologue. You just hop around the world to get the next one right after the last. And I mean right after, there are actually cutscenes that teleport you back to the hub right as you resolve a mission/quest for and get your new friend. It's pretty jarring.

Not one of these companions so much as blinks when you ask them to join up with a stranger to Save The World. Not even some coincidental ""wow my fate is bound to yours, guess I have to"", they just nod their head and pledge their life to you freely. This is where it really feels like a Disney or Marvel universe story, everyone is just so damn heroic and selfless. The stakes are the world but everyone is cracking jokes and risking their lives like they're invincible, so there are no stakes.

And the companions themselves. Beyond the whole levity problem above, they are fine in isolation. There are good concepts and archetypes here, but as a party/team nothing comes together. There is zero interpersonal conflict: no dilemmas, no differences of opinion, no conflicting motivations. At one point, I decided to leave a man behind to die and there wasn't a word of discussion between my companions, just an X approves and Y disapproves notification to mark his passing. Everyone is just superficially supportive of everyone else at all times, and it feels so.. bland.

Everything else is fine. Just fine. But that's not enough when it can't tell a story.","Mostly Positive71% of the 24,035 user reviews for this game are positive.",reviewer summarized best saying immersed rook companion hard pulled world mainly writing bad 6 hour regard reference not_recommend rook empty empty unimpactful dialogue choice turn trying pal dialogue option usually agree cheerfully crack joke agree sternly incapable hurting non controlled artificial feeling stayed stern option asshole already default normal comparison stumbling heroic trope fine series kick story stumble varric hired charge paper thin backstory given varric heard you_emphasized friend past compared mc series rook care front good ramping quickly turn straight railroaded companion collecting past marketing demo player purchase play official release prologue hop world next last cutscenes teleport hub resolve task objective given non friend pretty jarring not_one companion blink ask join stranger save world not_even coincidental wow fate bound guess nod pledge life freely feel disney marvel universe damn heroic selfless stake world cracking joke risking life invincible no_stakes companion levity problem fine isolation good concept archetype party come zero interpersonal conflict no_dilemmas no_differences no_conflicting motivation decided leave man die word discussion companion x approves disapproves notification mark passing superficially supportive else time feel bland else fine fine not_enough t_emphasizedell

COMPLETELY 

- FREE-TO-PLAY, &
- ZERO PAY-TO-WIN

----------------------------------------------------

To elaborate, 

- It is a free-to-play game as you know, if you don't want to spend cash purchasing pets which automatically loot for you for 5 bucks, you can always get a pet drop from bosses. The pet is pretty much considered the only function-based cash purchase potentially necessary. Most of not all other cash purchases are cosmetics. 
- Game progress in terms of damage output and gears have ABSOLUTELY ZERO corelation with cash purchase, you cannot buy damage with cash, and player-trade function is removed from the server to reinforce the idea that using in-game currency trade to buy progress is not allowed. You have to grind all the way to top by yourself. For most items other than equipments, you can transfer within account through storage. Btw you can't drop something for others to pick up to cheat the no-trade rules, others won't see it shown up. 
    -- In this sense, it is basically a single-player game with party and guild that kinda player interactions and cooperation. 
    -- Of course there are cons with related to no-trading, that even if you got some gear really rare and expensive and you won't be able to sell it for cash or in-game currency, you can't even give it to your other characters in the same account. 
- With the two stated major feature, everyone is on the same playing field, the strength of any one in game solely depends on or shows how much efforts and time one puts into grinding, and also some RNG. 

----------------------------------------------------

CONS about the game: 

- Bad server, frequent crashes on some players
- Unscheduled Maintenance (Double Maintenance Time!) 
- Bad GM attitudes towards players (except a few who really cares and those few are really awesome people!)
- Botters & cheaters do exist, and in large amounts in certain popular maps. GMs doesn't seem to handle any reports no matter how many times u report them.
- Some bugs, more often are related to events, usually not unplayable, but takes time for their coding team to notice
- Maybe somemore other cons but can't think of any right now...

1643320,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"Stalker 2's Missed Opportunities: A Critical Look at Visual Clarity, Accessibility, and A-Life

The long-awaited release of Stalker 2, powered by Unreal Engine 5, has sparked excitement across the gaming community. However, for all its technical advancements and graphical ambitions, the game falls short in critical areas that are integral to the Stalker experience. From its over-reliance on upscalers to issues with accessibility and the apparent absence of a fully-functional ""A-Life"" system, Stalker 2 feels like a visually stunning, but thematically disjointed, entry in the series.

1. Over-Reliance on Upscalers: A Threat to Visual Clarity

While upscaling technologies like DLSS and FSR have become popular tools for maintaining performance in graphically demanding games, Stalker 2 relies on them to the detriment of visual clarity. Beyond 20 meters, environments lack the sharpness and fidelity that fans of the series expect. The dense, immersive world of the Zone—once alive with intricate details and subtle cues—is now smoothed over by aggressive upscaling artifacts, making distant objects appear muddy or poorly defined.

For a game that thrives on exploration and environmental storytelling, this is a significant misstep. Players rely on visual detail to navigate the Zone and identify threats, and the current implementation hinders their ability to fully engage with the game world.

2. Motion Blur and Anti-Aliasing: A Barrier to Accessibility

The anti-aliasing techniques employed in Stalker 2 introduce pervasive motion blur, especially during fast-paced sequences or even simple camera movements. While AA is essential for reducing jagged edges, its implementation here creates a visual effect that can be headache-inducing and disorienting for many players. For a game that demands quick reflexes and spatial awareness, this is more than a minor inconvenience—it becomes an accessibility issue.

Developers should prioritize options that allow players to adjust or disable such effects, ensuring a wider audience can enjoy the game without discomfort. The lack of these features at launch is a glaring oversight.

3. The Absence of Functional A-Life: A Core Element Missing

One of the hallmarks of the Stalker series is its ""A-Life"" system, a groundbreaking AI simulation that brings the Zone to life. A-Life populates the world with dynamic, unscripted encounters, creating a sense of unpredictability and realism that few games can replicate. In Stalker 2, however, this system appears to be severely compromised—or missing altogether.

This becomes particularly evident when players reload quicksaves. Hotspots generate entirely new encounters with each reload, revealing a system that relies on static spawning rather than a persistent simulation. This not only breaks immersion but also undermines the very essence of what makes Stalker unique. A-Life isn’t just a feature; it’s the soul of the series. Its absence feels like a betrayal to long-time fans who expected the next evolution of this iconic mechanic.

4. A Call for Better Optimization and Design Choices

While technical challenges are understandable in modern game development, the issues present in Stalker 2 are indicative of misplaced priorities. Instead of relying so heavily on upscalers, developers should focus on optimizing native rendering for clearer visuals. Accessibility features such as customizable motion blur and AA settings should be non-negotiable in a game with such a vast and diverse audience. Most importantly, A-Life must return in its full glory to preserve the authenticity of the Stalker experience.

Conclusion

Stalker 2 is an ambitious title, but ambition alone cannot compensate for shortcomings in execution. By addressing these issues—enhancing visual clarity, improving accessibility, and reinstating a functional A-Life system—developers can transform Stalker 2 into the masterpiece it has the potential to be. Fans of the series deserve no less. The Zone is waiting; let’s hope the developers are listening.","Mostly Positive79% of the 25,476 user reviews for this game are positive.",stalker 2 missed opportunity critical visual clarity accessibility life long awaited release stalker 2 powered unreal engine 5 sparked excitement across gaming community technical advancement graphical ambition fall short critical area integral stalker reliance upscalers issue accessibility apparent absence functional life stalker 2 feel visually stunning thematically disjointed entry series 1 reliance upscalers threat visual clarity upscaling technology dl fsr popular tool maintaining performance graphically demanding game stalker 2 relies detriment visual clarity 20 meter environment lack sharpness fidelity fan series expect dense immersive world zone alive intricate detail subtle cue smoothed aggressive upscaling artifact distant object appear muddy poorly defined thrives exploration environmental storytelling significant misstep player rely visual detail navigate zone identify threat implementation hinders engage world 2 motion blur anti aliasing barrier accessibility anti aliasing technique employed stalker 2 introduce pervasive motion blur especially fast paced sequence simple camera movement aa essential reducing jagged edge implementation creates visual effect headache inducing disorienting player demand quick reflex spatial awareness minor inconvenience accessibility issue developer prioritize option allow player adjust disable effect ensuring wider audience enjoy discomfort lack feature launch glaring oversight 3 absence functional life core element missing hallmark stalker series life groundbreaking ai brings zone life life populates world dynamic unscripted encounter creating sense unpredictability realism game replicate stalker 2 appears severely compromised missing evident player reload quicksaves hotspot generate entirely encounter reload revealing relies static spawning rather persistent not_only break immersion undermines essence make stalker unique life soul series absence feel betrayal long fan expected next evolution iconic mechanic 4 call optimization design choice technical challenge understandable modern development issue present stalker 2 indicative misplaced priority relying heavily upscalers developer focus optimizing native rendering clearer visuals accessibility feature customizable motion blur aa setting non negotiable vast diverse audience importantly life glory preserve authenticity stalker conclusion stalker 2 ambitious title ambition alone cannot_compensate shortcoming execution addressing issue enhancing visual clarity improving accessibility reinstating functional life developer transform stalker 2 masterpiece potential fan series deserve no_less zone waiting hope developer listening
2183900,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","[h2]TL;DR review:[/h2]
This game is a solid action-shooter romp with fast-paced, exciting combat, an incredibly cinematic campaign, and a surprisingly deep customization and progression system to be found in its co-op and PvP game modes. It is well worth your money and if you're still on the fence, you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't pick this entry up when it goes on sale.
[hr][/hr]
[i]Space Marine 2[/i] is one of those rare cases where a game is made as an unabashed love letter to its predecessor, and in a surprise twist, it does more than match the original -- it surpasses it in almost every way.

This is particularly impressive if you consider that SM2 is the sequel to a cult classic title that was largely slept on when it was originally released. The original [i]Space Marine[/i] had all the makings of an outstanding game, but for as phenomenal as its gameplay was and as glowing as its reviews tended to be, it unfortunately neither sold well nor gained enough traction to popularize it after its release. It's also one of my favorite games of all time.

[i]Space Marine 2[/i] takes everything that made the original stand out and amplifies the oomph by a factor of wowza -- which is to say, it's a damned fine game, developed by a studio that not only understood their assignment -- to make a game worthy of being called a sequel -- they utterly aced all expectations. Without further ado, let's jump into what makes this game so good!

[h3]Highlights[/h3]
+ [b]The campaign[/b] is not one of your dinky four hour Call of Duty campaigns with a plot as deep as the shallow end of a pool and the characterization of a pack of wild chimps -- it's a fully-featured, action-packed and highly-cinematic 10+ hour experience. I would almost compare the overall scope, scale and feel of the campaign as one very long Hollywood action movie. But like... you know, an actually good one.
+ [b]Operations,[/b] SM2's 3-player cooperative PvE mode, expands upon the campaign story by introducing you to three out of a total of six fully-customizable classes in a slew of six exciting co-op missions with randomized spawns and emergent gameplay events (which only increase in number and variety as you scale the game's difficulty levels ever-higher). No two Ops missions play the same, as each one is a full-range map with unique objectives, the occasional MMO raid boss-worthy fight to spice things up, and LITERALLY hundreds (if not thousands) of xenos and heretics standing between you and glory.
+ I haven't had a chance to try out [b]Eternal War,[/b] SM2's PvP mode, but my understanding is that it is stacked to similar degrees in terms of replayability when compared against its coop mode.
+ [b]Armor customization[/b] is deep and robust, allowing you to use any of the numerous provided Astartes chapters as a base (or, for the creative hands among us, recreate one of your favorites from beyond the breadth of the game's choices or even put together something homebrew). Each class has its own unique armor that can be customized to the umpteenth degree, ranging from swapping out one or both pauldrons, gauntlets, greaves and more or swapping in a different pattern for each individual armor piece, all of which can be painted just like the war games (and for the tabletoppers among us that just gasped in fright, don't worry -- you [i]don't[/i] have to wait for the primer or paint to dry).
+ [b]The progression[/b] is, to be frank, so much deeper than I could have expected going in. Each class comes with a full 25-point perk tree, they all have their own selection of weapons that can be upgraded to perform better or even take on entirely different playstyles (for ranged weapons) or brand new combos and special attacks (for melee weapons), and ALL weapons have two perk trees, some with multiple choice picks to further assist the player in making their loadout truly feel uniquely them.
+ [b]The combat.[/b] THE COMBAT. If you thought the original had fluid, frenetic combat -- and you SHOULD -- then SM2 is going to throw you through a loop. The good thing is that loop is violent, chaotic, a ton of fun, and greatly expanded upon compared to its predecessor; gone are the days of simply bashing, stomping and smacking your enemies into paste, as the game's melee combat has been completely reworked from ye olde button-smashing to a fully-developed system with blocking, dodging, and attack combos with light, heavy and special attacks. Melee combat at its roots is simple enough to be engaging and serviceable without alienating casual fans, while it is still deep and complex to reward highly-skilled and/or highly-dedicated players through the additions of of perfect dodges and perfect parries.
+ [b]The core gameplay loop[/b] is engaging, as you proceed to tear through veritable roves of lesser enemies while brutally destroying more dangerous fare with visceral melee executions and gun strikes. Combat feels cinematic, it feels responsive, and you can really feel the sheer power and impact of each step, maneuver and strike from your futuristic super soldier of choice. And just as excitingly, the way the game centers around single-handedly demolishing hordes of foes in the high dozens makes any ground you gain feel hard-earned rather than easily-given.
+ The game fully immerses you in the iconic [b]aesthetic and vibe[/b] of the grim dark 40th century. I think one thing that even the game's harshest critics can agree on is that, from SM2's gothic-industrial soundtrack, to its crunchy, punchy and visceral visual and sound effects, and large, sweeping, absurdly-detailed grandiose set designs really come together to make you feel like one of the series' titular Space Marines dropped into the middle of all-out war.

[h3]Flaws and fixables[/h3]
[i](As a quick disclaimer, the following section is just my personal opinion and by no means the definitive way the game should play. These are just my own gripes.)[/i]
- [b]Control and target priority[/b] feel somewhat wonky and could use some attention, including outright absurd behavior when it comes to threat priority. This has resulted in mishaps such as grappling into entirely the wrong enemy (""no, no, I totally meant to dropkick that random traitor guard behind the Rubric marine, I swear""), or accidentally locking myself into a particular animation that I cannot cancel in times where I find myself seriously needing to dodge or parry.
- [b]Item pickup visibility[/b] isn't distinct or obvious enough, especially from a distance. Sometimes I'll book it straight past gear and consumables that I didn't manage to spot in the chaos of combat.
- [b]An entire melee weapon archetype,[/b] known as 'Blocking', is functionally useless compared to its two alternatives -- Balanced and Fencing. From my understanding the devs are aware of and in agreement with the belief that Blocking weapons need some serious love before they can contend with its cooler, better siblings.

[h3]Other good-to-know information[/h3]
*The [b]season pass[/b] looks to be chock full of worthwhile goodies that should breathe new life into the game and enhance its staying power.
*There are [b]weapon and armor unlocks.[/b] Weapon unlocks are entirely achieved through gameplay and cannot be acquired through MTX. Armor unlocks are entirely cosmetic, the vast majority of them are earned through gameplay as well, and they do not affect or alter gameplay in any capacity.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"I've spent about 300 hours on ps4 and roughly half of that on steam.  Typically each season I have been high tier survivor and mid to high killer.  I can't recomend this game to anyone.  There's obviously a love hate to the game but this final straw is this emblem system.  The community is unbearably toxic, the devs consistantly take the game in the wrong direction, people ruin your game, be it selfish/clueless teammates or cheap killers.  Watching the dev stream shows how out of touch they are, as there are serious issues with mechanics and balance and they ignore them constantly.  Insidous killers hiding in the basement, face camping and OP killers ruin it for survivors.  Trolling survivors who run 1 perk because they think they're great and consistant pallet looping and purple flashlights ruin it for average killers.  Honestly this game was much better shortly after launch than it is now.  High tier players are intentionally de ranking just to find games because it's impossible for casual players to rank up now.  These devs are clueless and the community just adds insult to injury.  The frustration just isn't worth the time.  Que the ""Thinks this is funny"" nerds

EDIT: They've updated the emblem system, much more balanced and easier to rank up.

EDIT 2: it's 2k19 and this game somehow got worse.  The new killer is actually broken. The perk reworking has made the game less enjoyable for both survivor and killer. The community is just as brain dead as ever.  I just had a game with a teammate from Germany and also one from Mexico in the same lobby.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"I have played all of the Dragon Age games and their DLC/Expansion's. I went into this game wanting to like it despite the controversy, however, I cannot bring myself to like it and the game just constantly makes me want to play DA:2 which is arguably the worst of the bunch. 

1. You've heard it before but the story writing is atrocious. Sometimes you are just thrust into ordeals that deal with your companions and given little detail while still being expected to care about the plot/companion.

2. Companions are the weakest they have been since DA:2. I can't find a single companion that isn't filled with bad dialogue and lackluster questlines.

3. Handholding is a large offender. I feel constantly bereted by the game pointing out the extremely obvious glowing item that is clearly the objective. Its worse than pawns in Dragons Dogma saying ""HARPIES ARISEN"" when there are 5 of them in your face.

4. The combat is okay at best but does wear on rather quickly.

5. Immersion is non-existent. I get onto Star Wars for the same thing but this game bumps it up a few notches. At no point in time should a game be used to push an agenda and by no means should a game openly say things like ""Non-Binary"" ""They/Them"" and then openly give itself over to punishment for using what many would consider appropriate terms. This is a fantasy game and when you use terms like this, it completely rips the immersion from under the audience thats actually paying and playing your game EA/Bioware.

6. I'm all for reinventing the wheel but I'm begging you: Don't use that shade of purple ever again and please fix your weird facial animation issues that have existed since Mass Effect: Andromeda.

236390,War Thunder,"Game was really fun years ago before they started messing with the economy. You used to actually be able to unlock things without suffering too much. Now, several years after adding ground vehicles (which I thought would replace World of Tanks for me), the economy is so awful, with you making pitiful amounts of exp and credits and many of the vehicles have been gimped with awful initial components with high research prices to criminally incentivize you to just buy your way past many of them (really FPE and basic repair kits don't come with tanks and cost a 3rd of the tanks value in exp?), combined with broken balancing just makes this not a fun game for me. Unfortunately its the only game I know of that currently offers the realistic experience that it does, but I still can't recommend it because of the tactics the company uses and how they treat the community.

***Update***
It's been several years since I wrote this initial review. In most cases I would say the economy is still trash, and the general behavior of the company is to make new premium vehicles and new nation trees overpowered immediately after release and to nerf them over time to balance things out. I wrote the review when I was still a poor college student, and now I have adult money. I've started playing again with premium account. Still I find once you get to late war tanks the fun seems to go away and the balancing comes into question.","Mostly Positive72% of the 561,252 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

At least, not as it is right now.

The game is, uh... steadily declining. I know they're trying to fix it, but improvements ship really slowly, so its hard to say if its actually going to make it as long they hope it will.
The game is not good to new players at all. The onboarding ""campaign"" is quite bad, and likely won't see improvements in quite some time, like everything else.
The game is also not good to active players either, really. Continuous powercreep, nonsensically awful additions and changes, and a core gameplay loop that hasn't seen any real improvement in ages.

The story is good though, and the gunplay is nice. It's been enough to keep me around for, uh, two-ish years now. Not really gonna keep me much longer though.

230410,Warframe,"On the cusp of having 1,300 hours into this game that I have played since 2014, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone looking for long-term playing. I just recently uninstalled and quit playing. Again. For the third time.

This game is an absolute grind-fest. It was fun the first few hundred hours or so but at a certain point, it stopped being fun and started to become incredibly tedious. Mats and blueprints, mats and blueprints, don't forget the random alerts (dead) and definitely do your dailies. Every game became a mad dash as you and your teammates rush to finish the objective, find the few worthy material drops, and run frantically to the exit (RIP Ember's WoF).

All of my favorite gear and weapons have been buffed and nerfed to hell over the years, yet I can manage to dole out tens of thousands of damage per second because of multiple formas and crazy riven mod builds. I just think it's another inconsistent and roundabout way to force players to grind even more for what they want to achieve.

Most of the updates now a days add these crazy hurdles in the form of materials needed. At first it was the Dojo. Man, the time I spent gathering mats and building trivial stupid things like drums and plants. And now archwings, K drives, warframes and weapons; crafting these things all required the same thing: Every single hour of your life that you can afford to give, maybe even more. If I could buy my time back I gladly would, but I can't. I can only buy Plat.


There are a multitude of issues I have with this game, but every time I think  about Warframe I get so mad at myself for wasting so much time with it, I can't clearly think about the problems that I truly have with it. It runs deeper than me not liking the grind; it's very problematic and the main fanbase seems to be completely okay with that, but I just think that the game has run it's course. The past few updates have admittedly enticed me into coming back to play them, but shortly, the initial optimism is quickly snubbed as I begin to get that familiar feeling: I've been here before, I've done this grind before. It's the same grind for a different reason, just some new ""rare"" materials for a shiny new item. And as always, the end result is anticlimactic. Cool archwing collection you got there, its a shame archwing missions kinda suck. Oh hey cool, a giant space frigate. Oh wait I have to build it all by myself? What's the point of building this in the Dojo?

I... just honestly don't know what else to say. I'm constantly at a loss for words whenever I try describe how I feel about this game. I wanted to be the ideal fan, I wanted to support DE every step of the way but I can't anymore. Every single person I have played this game with has left me in the dust and moved onto bigger and better things, and here I am typing my solemn farewell.

So goodbye DE, farewell my dearest Loki.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"I've been playing this game since its beta in 2016, accumulating over 10,000 hours on my personal account. I even worked at BHVR on the game, and in the past, I would have wholeheartedly recommended it. However, I can't do that anymore given the game's current state and direction.

It's disheartening to see the game's decline because of what I believe to be a lack of vision and self-interest from those in charge. It appears they're more focused on short-term partnerships to boost quarterly stats than addressing the game's core issues. The player base fluctuates, but it often feels like the game is on the brink of becoming irrelevant.

One troubling aspect is how BHVR handles internal matters. I was wrongfully terminated, and not only did they ban my developer account (which was expected), they also banned my personal account. This felt petty and unjust, especially after dedicating six years to both playing the game and trying to improve it during my time at BHVR.

The company's decision-making is perplexing, especially when it comes to security. There's a known vulnerability in the game that has exposed players to DDoS attacks, doxing, and swatting for over two years, yet BHVR hasn't addressed it. Even when I was employed there, I raised this concern, but it remained unresolved as of 2023.

This situation has made me question BHVR's commitment to the community's safety and well-being. It's clear they prioritize profit over player security. It's surprising that platforms like Steam continue to support the game despite these glaring issues.

Regarding cheaters, it's a sensitive topic. The company seems to tolerate them more than they should, as some employees view them as paying customers who deserve respect, according to a leadership member's direct quote.

In conclusion, my personal experience and observations have left me disillusioned with BHVR's management and the state of the game. It's a far cry from what it used to be, and I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone at this point.","Very Positive80% of the 546,855 user reviews for this game are positive.",pre release version available testing 2016 accumulating 10 000 hour personal worked bhvr past wholeheartedly recommended anymore given state direction disheartening decline believe lack vision self interest charge appears focused short term partnership boost quarterly stats addressing core issue base fluctuates feel brink irrelevant troubling aspect bhvr handle internal matter wrongfully terminated not_only ban developer expected banned personal petty unjust especially dedicating six year trying improve bhvr company decision perplexing especially come security known vulnerability exposed player ddos attack doxing swatting year bhvr addressed employed raised concern remained unresolved 2023 situation question bhvr commitment community s_emphasizedafety clear prioritize profit security s_emphasizedurprising platform continue support despite glaring issue regarding cheater sensitive topic company to_emphasizedlerate employee view paying customer deserve respect according leadership member direct quote conclusion personal observation left disillusioned bhvr management state far cry good conscience recommend
1063730,New World: Aeternum,"This game is on life support since at least Season 3.
I played on server Aaru and created a rule for myself to only block farmbots. After 3 months my blocked list is 103 accounts big.

Played this game for nearly 4 months straight. No bots were banned. Learned about people that do RealMoneyTrade in this game (so I got my answer as to why there are so many bots around).

Beware before buying this game. It has no real endgame. Some people will claim ""pvp is endgame"" which would completely invalidate the need of trade skills & dungeons.

The ""endgame"" in New World contains two things
- Mutated Dungeons
- Elite Chest Runs

Most of the ""Best In Slot"" gear is craftable or timegated bought items (you can upgrade named items with 3 chromatic seals that you can buy for in-game currency - 1 per day). You rarely get BiS gear out of dungeons, pvp or Elite Chest runs

If you plan to craft your own items buckle up for a senseless grind against bots because all ressources are globally shared.
And bots is not the problem, there are even people that afk-autoscript farm certain ressources for days

the final point that got me to quit this game is that in the 4 months i was playing the only thing they added to the game was 1 dungeon and one season quest which they will now recycle as content for the next season.
They remodel the Season Quest, make it more difficult and add 10 players only. that it. the drops from that boss are meh at best. 

If you rly want to have a lot of fun in the game you need to spend a lot of time in it bcus crafting endgame items is timegated aswell (daily cooldowns) or you can buy endgame materials from the auction house that is fubar bcus of botting. 
Nearly all materials that are not included in the DLC are worth nothing and endgame materials have inflated prices which gets people to RMT...

Beware

1245620,ELDEN RING,"It will seem unfair, almost rude and insulting to play, at first. Every step of the way Elden Ring challenges what you think you know about action games, and video games in general. You're plopped into a world with little to no map markers. Zero quest log. Dialogue is spoken once to you by npcs, better remember what they say! And the world is completely open. It takes modern open world concepts that have been overused and some how makes them feel fresh. The reward of continuing on despite your many failures, is what makes Elden Ring so unique and enjoyable to play. 

Nobody in their right mind would release a game like this in 2022. But here we are. Elden Ring feels like it's from a different time period in gaming. Like it came straight out of the 1990's early 2k's but with the graphics and precision you would expect from a title in 2022. Without all the bloat and nonsense. Elden Ring doesn't waste your time when you play it. 

It's just a masterpiece. It's like the game we have all been waiting for. If you have been playing games since you can remember and loved Ocarina of Time, the Elder Scrolls and multiplayer games like Halo. There is something you will love in this game.

1401590,Disney Dreamlight Valley,"Its fun for what it is. Its 100% a grindy  game however. After unlocking all the areas of the game, I always end up doing the same things when I load up the game. I start by going through all the areas and harvesting/replanting the crops I grow. As ive learned that the best way to make money. Then I loop around all the areas again to collect the misc. things such as flowers, gems, resources, ect. I would say the price of the game itself is a little disappointing as the game-play became stale and repetitive for me after some time. My biggest complaint would have to be 2 things. 1: The shop where you gets clothes/ furniture. I don't know if im cursed or what, but I am constantly getting boring clothes, or furniture. Also repeats quite often. I am not sure why they put the most basic things in the shop constantly but it is so disappointing, especially since there are few ways to get these items. 2: The micro transactions. For a game that costs quite a bit already, i'm disappointed in what they want you to pay more money for inside the game. I mean, cosmetic things are fine I guess, but as of now there are 2 story/character related packs that cost i think between  $20-$30. ON TOP of what you already pay for the base game itself. As far as i've heard as well, future Disney characters will be locked behind a paywall. Disney being greedy as usual I suppose. If you like animal crossing and need something to fill that void, id say this game is a good filler, but it does get old fast, and the micro transactions are a huge disappointment to me. I don't feel like I can recommend the game solely for that reason, but feel free to watch videos online and decide for yourself if its worth the investment.

UPDATE: I downloaded their latest update and began grinding again because I was so excited for the multiplayer update. I thought it would be so fun to run around and harvest or do quests with my friends to keep my interest in the game. I was sorely disappointed. Once you get into the game with your friend, you are extremely limited. You cannot use any of your tools. You cannot harvest anything and the only things you can pick up are things you drop, or things that are lying on the ground like sticks, rocks, or flowers. You can only enter your house and the store, no other buildings. Once you've given your friend a tour and shown them your shop and house, there really is nothing else you can do with each other. I hate that I was so excited for the update, only to be let down so hard. ALSO my friends and I tried playing together again today,  I could connect with one of my friends perfectly fine. My other friend however, couldn't join anyone at all. And nobody could join her. We tried looking up the issue online and it seems like a lot of people are having this issue. I'm really angry at this game now and I wish they would put some effort into making things work instead of pushing out expensive dlc.","Very Positive91% of the 16,111 user reviews for this game are positive.",fun 100 grindy unlocking area thing load area harvesting replanting crop ive learned best loop area collect misc thing flower gem resource ect price disappointing play became stale repetitive biggest complaint 2 thing 1 shop get clothes furniture im cursed constantly boring clothes furniture repeat not_sure basic thing shop constantly disappointing especially way item 2 micro transaction cost bit already disappointed pay inside cosmetic thing fine guess 2 related pack cost 20 30 top already pay base far heard future character locked paywall greedy usual suppose animal crossing fill void id good filler old fast micro transaction huge disappointment recommend solely watch video online decide worth investment downloaded latest began repeatedly performing action gain resource excited mode multiple player interact compete real thought fun harvest quest friend interest sorely disappointed friend extremely limited cannot_use tool cannot_harvest thing pick thing drop thing lying ground stick rock flower enter house no_other building given friend tour shown shop house else hate excited hard friend tried today connect friend perfectly fine friend join join tried issue online issue angry wish effort thing pushing expensive downloadable additional released initial launch

1203620,Enshrouded,"In the current state my review is a negative, not that it's not worth keeping an eye on though. It's just a bit rough and probably needs a good years worth of work to give it the depth it needs to be worthwhile. 

I could give a pro/con reason why this game is good or bad but it doesn't really describe the problem for me. I am giving it a negative because of how it feels. You know how you start up a new survival game, you get a grasp of the basics and then you have a relatively clear plan on what to do, where to go, what the goal is, e.g. Sons of the Forest you know you are there to survive, but you are also trying to locate Victoria and her family. And the story and exploration is wrapped up really well together so each outting has a feeling of - I guess achievement and progression.

Enshrouded has the potential for this but isn't actually achieving it, and I am not sure why, you go get your companion crafters and you can expand on that, sort of, there isn't ALOT of crafting variation. Maybe the problem is because all the wells are basically the same design wise, maybe it's because the shroud doesn't actually disappear when you cleanse the area, maybe it's the lack of mob variety. I am in the desert region currently and I can count on my hands how many enemy types there are globally in the game. There is a real lack of life and ambience in the game. 

The game has this push to find a solution to the shroud without actually solving the problem, no areas are cleansed, no new un-shrouded area to utilise for building or exploring. The veil doesn't lift and new life doesn't take root. When you clear a township, there isn't any kind of prompt to rebuild it and populate it with NPC's to trade with etc, there is no feeling of changing the world, when the lore says pretty much that you are magically forged to do that exact thing. 

As for combat, and classes/abilities. Pretty mediocre, just get the water aura, the damage aura, and hug enemies butts and you win. The skill points being tied to things like shroud stalks is a hindrance especially for multiplayer, they would be better off removing the level system entirely, and going The Secret World ability pathway, where you gain exp, gain a skill point, no physical level needed. 

Needs more dungeons and dungeons need variation, needs more enemy types, needs weather, needs water in the game like literally any water. The game needs a feeling of world progression. 

Oh and last one is map UI needs some serious love, give us a checkmark system so we actually know where we have been, amongst other things.

My hours on Steam do not reflect the hours of my life I've given to this game. Every single time, as of a few months ago, that I want to boot up this game I stop myself. I know I will be enjoying myself and run into something game breaking.

Look, I have been playing The Sims religiously since Sims 1, buying all the expansions. Been playing this series religiously since I was a teenager well into adulthood. Sims 1. Sims 2. Sims 3. And all the little expansions. While the games could always get buggy and weird I had faith that the developers would work it out. The Sims 4 is unplayable for me at times. In fact, back in November of last year (2021) it became COMPLETELY unplayable, with Sims freezing and doing nothing. This happens too often. TOO OFTEN!!! I can't enjoy this game anymore!!!!

252490,Rust,"Recently I have decided to quit Rust following their recent update. I have spent nearly 12,000 hours on Rust since late 2015-2016. The game changed to quickly and doesn't feel like the game I grew up playing. Everything was changed to cater newer players; which included changing in-game recoil to be insanely simple and to be more RNG based. People spent thousands of hours and years of their life playing this amazing game just to have the great Rust feel ripped out from underneath them in one push of a button. 

Don't get me wrong I still recommend Rust because of its amazing community, its been awesome seeing it grow and all the things people have done to raise money for charities and to make people aware. I wish luck to any new players that want to enjoy Rust like I have the last few years. It will be easier for newer people to enjoy because the pvp aspect is so simple now. Rust is going to keep growing but mainly without its OG player base.

The devs care insanely about their game and the monthly updates for the last couple of years show that. Rust will continue to grow and maybe become one of the most played steam games these next few months.

I hope everyone can make some great memories like I have playing and I wish them luck to the intense rush inducing world of Rust.

2139460,Once Human,"UPDATE 8/16/24: The new loot crate pretty much undoes everything good I say below about how the IAPs are not predatory. The new system is incredibly badly translated at least, and intentionally misleading at worst. To get all of the top rewards you would need to hit .05% 5 times or spend $435 dollars. That is the actual number, not an exaggeration. Yes it is just cosmetic and yes you don't have to do it... but this is pretty much exactly what I didn't what to see in the game. I shouldn't be surprised because its not new in other regions but still.

TLDR: A Free to Play Online Third Person Crafting/Survival Looter/Shooter that actually isn't Pay to Win, doesn't constantly pressure you to buy things like speed ups or unlocks, has PvE and PvP servers, and doesn't even have a cash GATCHA option? Yes, Please and Thank you. 

Once Human (OH) is a great example of how Devs could choose to do IAP, and GATCHA without seeming like a predatory cash-monger that really only is hunting for whales. Slightly more detail: IAP (including the battle pass) is cosmetic only. The GATCHA machine, which is one of several ways you can get new equipment (blueprints) or power up your existing gear (blueprint fragments), can only be used with currency earned by playing the game.

OH is an interesting mix of The Division, Any survival game with resource nodes, and The Secret World. It's got a lot of gathering, exploring, looting, shooting, and crafting. Speaking of crafting, you'll be making everything from food, gear and ammo to houses. vehicles and gun turrets. OH has a sort of a modern / Lovecraftian ruined earth mysterious setting that works reasonably well and overall the game is more then the sum of its parts. 

There's gotta be a catch right? Well, yeah, kinda....two things. 

First: 
The game is far from perfect. The gun play, the setting, the base building and overall game play loop are very good, its fun and there's a lot of quick and fast rewards for everything. On the con side of things... the VO is spotty, some of the writing misses the mark entirely, the overall story line (for season 1 at least) is a bit weak and there can be performance issues on certain PCs which is made often much worse in groups of players doing a large event. However my only one real gripe is that the puzzles are just not good, one thing that Secret World did right is that it had real adventure game style puzzles in an MMORPG that actually fit the setting super well AND worked well AND were fun! By comparison, the puzzles in OH are, with a tiny few exceptions, not really puzzles and not really any good. They are rewarding in the sense that you get a good reward for completing them but not in the sense that you feel like you solved something.

Second: 
There are planned seasonal wipes every six weeks.  There's a lot of info out there but I'm going to try to summarize very quickly (and probably do a really bad job).  At the start of a new season you go back to level 1, and start fresh EXCEPT you retain blueprints, fragments, found formulas (furniture crafting) unlocked weapon accessories and pretty much all event or seasonal currencies... I personally think this doesn't sound so bad as the things you are losing are actually very easy to get back very quickly and the things you are keeping are exactly what actually matter. That said, until we see it (season reset) actually happen we kinda don't know, it could be horrible, but it could actually be okay or even good. It might be worth it if each season is actually distinct and there's new and interesting things to do, shoot, loot, craft and win from the GATCHA.

Final note: 
Overall I've had a lot of fun with the game so far and I've enjoyed leveling up (my favorite part of any game) and watching my character get strong and stronger, kill some elder god level things and build a pretty awesome base.  You'd think I'd be sad to lose all that at the end of the season (still a ways off), and sure being max level and min-maxing your build is fun but its the GETTING THERE that I like and I think it might be fun to do it all over again, maybe as a completely different build with a completely different looking base. 

Disclaimer: I have spent 9.99 on the battle pass because I really liked some of the cosmetics in this specific pass but I honestly think if I look at the next one and don't see several things I like I'd be just fine not getting the next pass.

P.S.

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"The game is fun at its core, there is no doubt about that. The issues become apparent once you reach level 60 and start the grind for high-end gear. With the recent patch, both professions and the number of drops from end-game content were nerfed, making the already annoying grind absolutely unbearable. This game managed to create the most annoying progression system (high watermark system) I have encountered in an MMO so far and then made it even worse. 

For now, I can not recommend this game to anyone. Starting now puts you at a huge disadvantage to everyone else since the changes only affect players that did not grind out their professions and watermarks yet. This doesn't even take into account that a lot of stuff is still broken, wars are once again in an unplayable state and a lot of servers are slowly dying, ruining any kind of immersion. It feels like the developers noticed that they didn't have enough content yet and decided that the best way to handle this would be to stretch out the content that they have for as long as possible. It is not fun and it feels like working a job instead of playing a game.

If you are thinking about giving this game a try: Wait a few months and this game might become decent enough, but it might aswell just die before it can make it to that point. Amazon Game Studios has created a relatively solid game, but the game is managed poorly and I am afraid that all of the issues and bad decisions are just too much for most players. If the next monthly patch doesn't turn things around, it is likely too late for most of the player base. I know a lot of people who have quit the game already, a lot more will follow soon.

Edit: The recent handling of a lot of issues is quite annoying. Maintenance happened, which caused more issues, resulting in the EU servers being down for hours. Yes, this can happen to any developer, but the track record here is extremly bad so far.

1643320,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"Long story short: game is interesting, hard, unique, addicting and GORGEOUS

Gunplay feels amazing, controls are snappy and UI is both recognisable from previous games and updated at the same time. Story so far (as for 10 hrs in), is really interesting.

My issues with it:
1. Weird open world enemy spawns - sometimes you will kill same enemies over and over again. My suggestion is to just avoid unnecessary fights while you travel. Seems reasonable, but I'm sure devs will fix that
2. In some cases weird level design. For instance, sometimes I can't jump over a small fence, or I can see a corpse that I can loot, but it is in a place where you need to jump, but you don't have such option
3. VA is kind of corny (at least in ukrainian)
4. Minor bugs with graphic artifacts, NPC wobblyness and physics glitches
5. Sometimes objects are placed in hard-to-loot places. Like a box, that you need to destroy in order to take some bandages, but rubbles from the box does not allow you to loot it easily

Worth mentioning - I've heard, that some players have issues with optimisation. Fair, but I don't have such issues as I have kind of overkill PC for this game.

Overall, these issues are not at the foundation of the game and generally fixable (hopefully will be fixed in first patches). Frankly other big titles launches like Cyberpunk were such a trainwreck, that STALKER 2 feels like a completely polished game.

I recommend buying and trying this game: experiencing places like poppy field and encounters like bloodsucker ambushes. Game offers a great immersion, which is worth trying.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"You already know the game's great, so here's a downvote for the clumsy, unwieldy, positively archaic launcher, registration and Mogstation. Learn to 21st Century, Squeenix.

Update 6/2024: I have made several attempts to return to the game and all of them have ended with my putting in a couple of hours tops (the extra hours since the first review are almost all reinstalling the bloody thing). The problem I have with FFXIV right now is that, while it's a good game and I'd really like to see all the content the expansions offer, I find the experience mind-numbingly boring. The reason is rather simple: the overleveling. I understand why Square decided to allow players to overlevel and be able to reach the expansion content by just doing the main quest of ARR, but it makes the base game superfluous.

All the little side-quests that add so much to the world-building end up being a detriment to your experience, unless you balance different classes. At the time of writing this, I have a new toon at level 28, whereas the main quest mobs are at level 12-15. I still haven't even done the mount quest, which originally unlocked around lvl 20. I don't even have to dodge around enemies in the overworld, I just hit ""W"" until I find the quest marker.

This is boring, it's brainless. Please, oh please, add some sort of option to scale down either the XP gain or at least synch to lower levels during questlines. This might be a ""me"" thing, but the way the leveling works right now leaves a very sour taste in my mouth and, at this stage, I simply do not find the game engaging.","Very Positive87% of the 71,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",already great downvote clumsy unwieldy positively archaic launcher registration mogstation learn 21st century squeenix 6 2024 attempt ended putting couple hour top extra hour reinstalling bloody problem ffxiv good expansion offer mind numbingly boring rather simple overleveling understand square decided allow player overlevel able reach major addition add feature mechanic task objective given non arr make base superfluous side quest add world building detriment unless balance different class writing toon 28 whereas task objective given non mob 12 15 mount task objective given non originally unlocked lvl 20 dodge enemy overworld w task objective given non marker boring brainless please oh please add sort scale xp gain synch lower level questlines leveling work leaf sour taste mouth stage simply not_find engaging
1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"Edit: I turned on easy mode and cleared the game. Finished all companion quests and got what I'd consider the ""best"" ending possible. My takeaway is that this is a game written for nobody. This is a reboot billed as a sequel: It REQUIRES knowledge of the series for it's plot to have any emotional impact - yet constantly goes out of it's way to show it's contempt for the lore and previous entries. How could this please anyone? Dragon Age was my first exposure to the Fantasy genre, I care deeply for these stories - and at this point I just hope they don't parade it's corpse around again.

To clarify, I'm not some oldhead DAO purist or a grifter. Origins, 2, and Inquisition all have their respective major faults - but I could always look past them, when the world and story was crafted with such love and care. Veilguard in comparison is soulless drivel, lacking in any nuance. It's unwilling to present any real emotional or intellectual conflict to the player - in a setting that, in many ways, is defined by it's ability to evoke these feelings. 


I got past the simplification of combat.
I got past the cartoon Darkspawn.

But the writing is an insult to anyone that has had any investment in Dragon Age as a series. 

The phrase “marvel tier writing” is overused, but it does apply here. It’s not that quippy dialogue is inherently bad. It’s that everything they’ve presented, be it dialogue, lore exposition, all of it - is HEAVILY sanitized. In far too many instances, the writing is amateurishly immersion breaking. It feels like HR is present in the background of every interaction. This isn't targeting inclusivity. Dragon Age has always been vocally inclusive and I love it for that - but Veilguard is so hamfisted it proves itself the most regressive of all 4 entries. 

Each returning character feels like a half-baked cardboard cutout, a caricature. Why even bring Morrigan or Dorian back if you’re going to strip them of everything that connected us as players to their stories. These moments that should be amazing - seeing these characters again after 10 years, don’t just fall flat - they feel like an insult to the characters themselves.

A lot of blame is deservedly placed on corporate level decisions, but when your writing staff is so fundamentally out of touch with the setting - there was no hope in the first place.

DA2 did it in the same 3 caves with a box of scraps (and like 1/15th of the dev time)

427520,Factorio,"The most played game in my Steam library by far and for good reason. I have never felt that the game has become stale as there are limitless possibilities in the base game alone and a sea of mods for even more. Having dabbled with modding myself, I found that the game is incredibly easy to make mods for even for someone who has never made one before (like me), and these mods are conveniently accessible from inside the game.
The game is also very focused on QoL and accessability with well-timed tips popping up and lots of convenience features.

Important to note that the game is [b]still[/b] in development more than 10 years after the original Indiegogo campaign and the 2.0 update set to release near the end of October is promising even more fixes for minor inconveniences. All this lets the game be as immersive as possible since your flow never gets interrupted by clunky controls or mechanics.

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"The best of Persona and Shin Megami Tensei in one. Three levels of reviews for you:

NEW TO THE SERIES
A picaresque story about the difficulties of diversity, unity, and hope. The franchise has long been known for breaching difficult topics, and Metaphor is no exception. Four party members manage magical powers in turn-based combat that rewards exploiting enemy weaknesses. This game is more difficult than Persona, but not quite as difficult as their notorious Shin Megami Tensei games. Unlike other JRPGS, combat isn't the only mechanic. Metaphor has a day/night time management cycle that can test your executive function. Being sociable will make a difference as it directly affects what powers you have access to, so planning friends is important.

“I’VE ONLY PLAYED PERSONA”
Imagine Persona with more tactical combat, an entire party that can switch Personas, and a dark fantasy setting. The bosses are closest to Persona 5s, but are more ""what to hit in what order"" challenging than ""hit like a truck"" challenging.
The game is more mature than Persona, with both more adult party members and tone. I don’t mean “adult” in the same way as Rise’s dungeon. I mean they’re a little more subtle (I said a little), and more nuanced in ideas. There's also no Teddy/Morgana's bad pickup lines, which is a VAST improvement.
Finally, this game has much better pacing. Both to start, with a truncated beginning, but also to play. There is always a lot going on, but unlike the older games (Persona 3, 4) there aren't as many lulls where the plot is going through the motion without advancement. The game also prevents you from frontloading your combat and spending weeks increasing stats or socializing by giving you short bursts of down time and lots of smaller dungeons to complete.

LONG-TIME SMT/PERSONA FAN
Imagine Persona with the press-turn system and the same undertones as SMT4 and 4A. I won't say Persona isn't serious, but SMT has much less dialogue and humor overall. Metaphor is closer to the Persona spectrum (everyone talks all the time) but has fewer pun/joking interactions to break things up. It will still have funny scenes, don't get me wrong, but they didn't insert a major comic relief as your guide and that makes all the difference. Best party navigator so far in that she both might care about you at all AND isn't hitting on your party members.

There are much less, but still some ""fish out of water"" scenes. Overall, they're more cultural nuances or character quirks rather than straight up being unfamiliar with the environment. Even the usual Gale/Aigis/Logical questioner is toned down dramatically. But the biggest social difference is in how they wrote the main character. He is still, effectively, a silent protagonist there to give the player a semblance of agency. But the way your party members respond to him feels far more natural. From checking in on him after a hard day to a laugh or surprise, you feel as if you’re interacting with people and not just answering a test.

There are lots of smaller dungeons to level and do side quests in. The map scope isn't something they've tackled before, and I welcome their linearity because half of these games is knowing where the heck you're going (I'm looking at you, PS2 and 3DS era SMT games that are almost impossible to navigate.) I wouldn’t say Metaphor is a dungeon crawler like their earlier games. I can feel Etrian Odyssey’s influence in the short, square exploration dungeons. And it is welcome. Little enemy surprises, from tougher dudes that can burry underground or swoop down from above, hint at some of the challenges I’ve faced in Strange Journey or Nocturne. I can’t say if they reach far enough into that toolbox to pull out teleporters, poison areas, or other dungeon puzzle BS, but I wouldn’t mind and it wouldn’t feel out of place. I have a feeling they left those challenges behind in favor of less begrudged features, though.

I don't believe Studio Zero broke the mold so much as refined it, here. The pre-combat smacking around feels like a natural evolution of their budget and SMT's Esoma abilities without recasting it every moon. Your party's flexibility prevents Persona's MC carrying everyone to victory with endless ""One Mores"" into an ""All Out Attack."" Having set party members instead of feeder fish demons makes it a crew to invest in. But Metaphor also keeps the ""I just need this ability"" grind focus in the job system with skill inheritance/borrowing. I always enjoy whatever they try in a nonmainline game, and I think Metaphor is an excellent iteration; truly growing beyond Persona or SMT in many welcome ways.","Very Positive91% of the 10,386 user reviews for this game are positive.",best persona shin megami tensei three level review series picaresque difficulty diversity unity hope franchise long known breaching difficult topic metaphor no_exception four party member manage magical power turn based combat reward exploiting enemy weakness difficult persona not_quite difficult notorious shin megami tensei game unlike jrpgs combat t_emphasizedhe mechanic metaphor night management cycle test executive function sociable difference directly affect power access planning friend important persona imagine persona tactical combat party switch persona dark fantasy setting boss closest persona 5 order challenging truck challenging mature persona adult party member tone adult rise dungeon subtle nuanced idea no_teddy morgana bad pickup line vast improvement finally pacing truncated beginning play unlike older game persona 3 4 lull plot motion advancement prevents frontloading combat spending week increasing stats socializing giving short burst lot smaller dungeon complete long smt persona fan imagine persona press turn undertone smt4 4a persona serious smt dialogue humor metaphor closer persona spectrum talk fewer pun joking interaction break thing funny scene wrong insert major comic relief guide make difference best party navigator far care hitting party member fish water scene cultural nuance quirk rather straight unfamiliar environment usual gale aigis logical questioner toned dramatically biggest social difference wrote effectively silent protagonist semblance agency party member respond feel far natural checking hard laugh surprise interacting not_just answering test lot smaller dungeon side quest scope tackled welcome linearity half game knowing heck ps2 3d era smt game impossible navigate metaphor dungeon crawler earlier game etrian odyssey influence short square exploration dungeon welcome enemy surprise tougher dude burry underground swoop hint challenge faced strange journey nocturne reach far toolbox pull teleporters poison area dungeon puzzle b mind feeling left challenge favor begrudged feature believe studio zero broke mold refined pre combat smacking feel natural evolution budget smt esoma ability recasting moon party flexibility prevents persona mc carrying victory endless more attack set party member feeder fish demon make crew invest metaphor keep grind focus skill inheritance borrowing enjoy whatever nonmainline metaphor excellent iteration truly growing persona smt welcome way

2669320,EA SPORTS FC™ 25,"Current state review with a solution to the infinite loading screen bug/fc25 screen bug (scroll2bottom):

Good and bad, 

Good first: Gameplay overall feels very smooth. They also replaced Volta with 5v5 club football on a bit smaller pitch/field which is very fun or the old 11v11 casual game with ur club avatar and  improved ai. The new 5v5 mode plays like the normal fc gameplay and not different as in previous games (fifa street like).

Improved in-Game ui, tactics, club ingame communication messages.

Cons: loading screen bug, too many afk player or bots in clubs, No Ankle Sox, No graphic improvements.

Loading Screen Bug: For a 90€ pre-order,for me to be stuck in loading screen for about 1h trying 250 ways to start up the game without getting stuck in the loading screen, it’s a pretty massive scam. 
Bug still persists to this day :)

But I think I found a working solution:
- go to „run“ in the startmenu -> type into run: %appdata% -> local -> EA SPORTS FC25   

Delete inside that folder:

- fcsetup (whole subfolder or just it’s content [fcsetup_default]
- fcsetup.ini 

You need to use „run“ because the appdata folder should be hidden.

Then start up the game, running the fc25.exe inside your steamapps/common folder as an admin (RMB-> run as administrator).

Either they interfere with each other or one of these 2 files has some bug. 

For me deleting these, let’s me start up the game

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"New World is a game with infinite potential, but is handled by lazy and incompetent management. Mired by issues since it's launch, it was never able to recover. For reasons beyond all understanding, Amazon thought it wise to push out numerous ""bugfix"" patches without ever creating a Public Test server. Sure, they eventually did make one, but it was far too late.

PvP was destroyed by bugs and exploits, and thanks to the mass-exodus of frustrated PvPers, the warring faction game design fell apart completely. Numerous servers are now completely owned by a single faction without any hope of upheaval. People in the other factions face exorbitant taxes, price markups and fast-travel costs, and cannot join the dominating factions. This causes even more to leave.

The crafters had their crafting gear completely removed from the game with the hope of re-adding it in future, for no real reason. Crafters log in naked and are pitifully compensated for their loss. The watermarking/prestige endgame system also nukes crafters from orbit, where crafting endgame gear scales it down to their level. Which means crafters that spend more time crafting and less time doing the pitiful PvE endgame content will find their goods diminish heavily in value. Crafters begin their own mass-exodus from the game.

All the while, numerous currency duplication glitches plague the game. And thanks to the lack of a Test Server, one of the fixes for a money duping glitch RESULTED in another, separate duping glitch. At this point, the economy was completely obliterated. Most of the still-dedicated players were now sitting atop hoards of gold numbering in the millions, if not billions. Anything they wanted, they could buy. Prices of regular items skyrocketed thanks to the devalued currency. Newer players that didn't have the ability to abuse these glitches now cannot use the auction house thanks to the price of everything being way too high, thanks to the infinite quantities of cash flowing in the server. This causes even more players to leave; and heavily discourages any more from joining.

Servers are now at critically low levels, and the in-game systems work against it yet again. With less people playing, taxes aren't being paid. This causes towns to decline, crafting stations to lose their levels, and suddenly nobody can craft anything. Everything is stuck at level one, and it takes time and resources to level them back up -- not just cash. This causes those dying servers to lose even more, putting them in a death-spiral they can't recover from. At the time of writing, the most populated servers in the entire game, in all regions, hardly go over half of their total capacity anymore. And many, *many* more do not even come close to half capacity.

1643320,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"Edit: I'm out, I'm done for now. The main quest is softlocked. I'll come back someday when modders fix the utterly broken quests, or the devs do. Easily the worst initial release of a game I've ever played.

Out of the gate, it's as sloppy of a launch as I expected. But after all this time, I expected more, despite expecting nothing more than the original Stalker game remade in UE5. I spent the money to support the developers, but didn't expect a borderline early-access title.

The game itself is there, but most of the mechanics feel sloppy and half-baked. Feels like somewhere between Fallout 4 ""exploration"" and Farcry gameplay, though the animation work is significantly better in Stalker 2. The only mechanic I think that is improved from the previous titles is the Anomalies. All of the dev resources seem to have gone into cutscenes, while the rest of the game seems to be in a, ""we'll finish that later"" state. I hope the team realizes that they need to have more of a game with less cutscenes. 

I swear, Skif can kill hundreds of people when he's in my hands, but gets his shit pushed in during a cutscene by a guy with a loaf of bread in one hand. 

I can't give this game a free pass because of nostalgia, and I sincerely hope the devs add some depth, solid DLC, and modding tools. All the foundation blocks are here - and I hope they capitalize on the success they've had so far. I don't want a refund - I want this game to be better than all the previous entries combined, and destroy my and others' criticisms with more exciting gameplay down the line.

Gripes:
- Items are plentiful and I cannot imagine buying anything besides equipment upgrades, merchants either need to carry a wider variety of goods, or the items in the game need some tweaking - I can't believe I'm griping about too much loot, but the economy is so aggressively against you that without so much stuff, I dunno if you could ever really afford anything.

- Many inventory items are seemingly pointless. Water, for example, restores a little bit of stamina, but it's heavy enough to rarely be worth carrying. Anything that I would run away from is faster than me anyway. Energy drinks seem to have the same effect as water, and no buff-over-time mechanic seems to exist. They just give you a bit of stamina. Barely a mechanic, and more of an inventory clutter than anything else, even weapons.

- You have to toss most weapons on the ground because you can't do anything with them due to starting at low condition (and they don't despawn, at least after 10 or so hours of playtime), leading to an incredible amount of tedious inventory management. Someday, we'll have a hotkey for unloading a weapon, but more likely a modder will fix that. Leaving an item in a corpse will leave the 'lootable' pip on your compass, so it creates a false idea that you missed loot.

- Mutants are exclusively there to waste your resources, dropping nothing. Bloodsuckers in particular are cartoonishly tanky, to the point where I am almost positive there is a bug with damage falloff, or they're invincible past a certain distance / when cloaked. You'd think the devs would have taken anything besides the awful AK reload from the years and years of popular mods. *Edit*: To continue my frustration, the Chimera takes an ABSURD amount of ammo to put down. Not only that, but the fact that there is no player collision (that is, other stalkers and mutants can run through you) means that when the chimera jump attacks you, it jumps through you, and can immediately turn around and smack you in the time it takes to whip your camera around to keep shooting it. And on Stalker difficulty, it 3 shotted me in the best armor I've found with three and a half bars of physical protection. And one of its attacks can knock you down, and it keeps smacking you so that by the time you could stand up, you are already dead. 160 rounds of AP 5.56, 32 buckshot, and I do not even know how much .45 ammo I had, but all of that was expended on a single mutant. This wasn't a boss sequence, this was a random encounter. I would have used more buckshot, but there is ZERO time to reload shells while it is crawling up your butt. Thank goodness it doesn't have a magic stunning roar like the bloodsucker. No WAY this was tested outside of best-case-scenario.

- Spawning seems bugged / random. I jumped into a warehouse, for example, and fought 2 bloodsuckers. Then an emission hit, finished, and another bloodsucker spawned. Then I left the warehouse, and 2 *more* bloodsuckers spawned outside. I understand the devs are probably very proud of making an enemy that has an annoying roar that stunlocks you (for some reason?), but I am already tired of fighting them and I doubt I'm even 20% of the way through the game. Enemies also frequently spawn in response to me looting a stash, so it feels VERY artificial and game-y.

- You need to basically shove your character into somebody's nose in order to speak to them. It feels really silly getting skin-licking close to someone to start a conversation.

- *Edit*: The reputation system is either very buggy or weirdly hidden. After 36 hours of play, a story event made a faction hostile to me and I got the reputation tutorial popup for the first time. I... cannot even begin to understand how my rampages in the zone have not altered my reputation until now.

- Most quests seem to have a be-a-dick option that rewards you with valuable items, and a be-a-good-person option that gives you significantly less stuff (or nothing) and the feeling that you helped an artificial person. I have yet to be rewarded for being a good person comparably to murder-hoboing my way across the zone, and while that may be the point - from a gameplay perspective it is really stupid. Quests giving me hundreds or even a thousand coupons feel like a drop in the bucket of what I need to do anything, and I get far more from selling a few medium quality weapons. Even getting less than 50 coupons from low quality weapons would be a massive QOL upgrade, but the weight system would also need to be reworked. Like... a backpack slot, maybe? 

- Replacing invisible walls with instant-death water and instant lethal radiation is somehow worse than invisible walls. Just have Skif say, ""I'm not finished yet"" or something, stop wasting my time in loading screens for trying to explore. There hasn't even been a, ""Skif can't swim"" joke to show that someone wanted to give a hint to avoid invisibly deep water. There's just a magic point in bodies of water where you will go from wading cartoonishly slowly, to instant death. Whoever decided this was okay on the design team should be banned from salt and pepper for a year.

Overall, the game is less mechanically dense than the original Stalker, and has SIGNIFICANTLY more running in empty spaces with enemies randomly spawning either in front of or behind you. I'll revise the review once I finish the game in case the trash is frontloaded, but I really doubt it. After all these years, you still can't loot armor or masks off people, AI still have infinite ammo and can't path worth a damn (but have perfect grenade tossing and either machine-precise accuracy or drunken mag-dumping into nothing accuracy with nothing in between) and it's really hard to not make comparisons to a modding community that has enhanced even the simplicity of the original game with more depth than the main studio has.

It's very pretty though.

Unless placed manually by the Dev's or is a scripted event, enemies spawn very close out of view usually 30-40 meters behind me. Makes since why they removed it from the products description as a re-brand. Without A-life, this just isn't stalker. Most likely scrapped due to weak ass consoles.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"I've bought Cyberpunk in summer 2022. Back then version of game was 1.52 and minor (sometimes not) bugs appeared during gameplay, but despite everything game has kidnapped me. I haven't played Deus Ex or Ghostrunner, but at first time when started to play I got the feeling like it's GTA with some role playing elements set in futuristic cybercity. And at this point, it was a total immersion in it's cyberworld, first run through the story until reach point of no return, then completed every gig, every NCPD, spend much time with Johnny, Panam, Judy etc. Couldn't believe that it's suddenly ended when completed everything, but this game was pure satisfaction <3

Year ago with v2.0 update and when I pre ordered Phantom Liberty DLC, it was a reason to dive back again with new story and characters which got even more memorable for me than original base game

Two years has gone since I tried it first time.. This game is like a drug, still satisfying to drive around Night City, still making calls to V's friends, still having feeling is like some unfinished business left here. So many unforgettable memories <3

10/10 Outstanding visuals, great story, huge open world, requieres much time and best action role-playing game of last years <3

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Edit2: Rockstar have now sent a cease and desist letter to the main modding program. It disables itself online, it has no effects for hackers, it's just for modding SP. They are trying to stop it to drive more people to Online and microtransactions. Their reason was that ""OpenIV allows users to create malicious mods that allowe harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience"". OpenIV does not touch online and immediately disables itself if you try.  Why are people still supporting Rockstar?

Edit: These problems seem to be ocurring less by now, but I'm leaving this review up as a warning to the scummy business practices of Rockstar.
-----------------
People are being banned for no reason and Rockstar agrees with them, yet they are still refusing to reverse the bans or do anything to help. Using Discord, Fraps, Any third party Framerate counter or any program that adds an overlay to your games will result in you getting banned, and support will not reverse it. Heck, if you buy shark cards and they don't work they won't even refund you for that!
Do not support awful business practices like this. Their anti cheat is terrible and their support just wants your money.











EDIT: A lot of people seem to be taking this as ""Waaaah! I got banned!"", so let me clear things up. I have not been banned, I uninstalled the game myself as the hard drive space it took was massive and I didn't play it much. For those who don't believe the large amount of people who have been falsely banned, here are a few more reasons why you shouldn't support R*.

There is a limitless amount of bugs for Online. Ranging from everyone in your session suddenly leaving the game at once, you being booted for no reason, connections timing out randomly, all of these are punctuated with the worst error screen I have ever seen. Instead of presenting you with a simple ""You have timed out"", the game instead spends much time loading up Single player, puts you into the world, and *then* gives you an error message, with an option to rejoin. Which how ludicrously long the load times in this game are, that's a good 2-5 minutes waiting for an error to appear just so you can start waiting again to get back into the game. It is incredibly easy to fix, but rockstar still haven't because they do not care.

There is no server browser. This means that with the endless adversary modes they add, all are dead within a week. The only options you have when in an adversary mode is to invite people of a similar level (which almost never works) and to invite everyone who was in your previous free roam session. If you are playing free roam, would you want to suddenly be pulled into a small mode which likely won't have many players? I thought as much. Thus the modes die off extremely quickly.

And finally, the Anticheat is still terrible. You can have people flying around the map, spawning props locking you in place, dropping money bags on everyone (Which in an amusing way, can result in *them* getting banned) and just generally causing havoc. Every ""attempt"" Rockstar has made has resulted in false positives, and an extremely intolerant system towards modders. You remember how much Rockstar said they ""loved"" the PC Audience and their modders? That's amusing considering they're filling the game with dummy code to confuse them, and you will be instabanned if you go anywhere near Online with the slightest hint of a modification to your game files.

In all, do not support a developer who does not care about their audience. They release modes (The recent Further adventures in Finance and Felony update is a great case for this) that require either for you to grind an unreasonable amount of money, or buy shark cards to make it all easier. Not to mention the adversary modes they throw out are easy to make and take little to no effort, as again, they'll be dead within a few weeks.

You will be better off supporting another company.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"R* is currently taking legitimate money away from hundreds, possibly thousands of players.
Their cheat detection is flawed and honest players are paying the price for it.

If you're reading this and are skeptic about it, so was I, until it was my turn to pay up. 
I play in private sessions only, for the sole reason to avoid cheaters. It didn't help. You'll get your turn.

I do not recommend this game until R* gets their act together.

Edit: 
I'd like to add that buying the game for single player is absolutely worth it, but online is simply a mess. 

It's been 3 weeks now and R* refuses to acknowledge their error, so I stopped playing and caring. There's no point in playing online if R* can steal your legitimate money away at any time. And the irony is that legitimate players are getting hurt while cheaters are unaffected.

I will never buy another R* game again and I doubt I am the only one. The way they treat their players is ghastly. Their support desk is insulting.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"[h3]Good Morning Night City![/h3]

Night City, 2077. You play as V, a mercenary that wants to be a legend in Night City, and for this to happen, you'll need to steal The Relic, a biochip invented by Arasaka, one of the most influential megacorporations in the whole world. Now that I've just scratched the surface of the plot, I can begin with this review. 

[h3]A City Of Dreams.[/h3]

Cyberpunk 2077 has the most beautiful city that I've ever seen in a Video game and at first sight the most vivid city in game history. But only at first sight. When walking through Night City you can see all NPCs going on with their lives, working, shopping, or just walking around, but of course like in any game it is just an illusion to make the city feel alive, however, they failed trying to build up this illusion, mainly when there is no major interaction with the NPCs, just a one-line dialog that repeats over and over again, just like in The Witcher 3, but here in cyberpunk hits different. Another thing that killed that illusion for me personally was the crowd AI, oh boy, that AI is terrible. When you look back at GTA V and older games even and compare its AI with cyberpunk, well there is no comparison, Cyberpunk 2077 AI, in general, are awful and totally immersion breaker. 

[h3]And For Sure They Were Big Dreamers.[/h3]

Continuing on with the world itself, CDPR managed to handcraft a beautiful and immersive open-world full of details that you can get lost in its beauty, although there isn't a lot to do in it. In my point of view, night city as I said, is the most beautiful but at the same time the most empty city that I've seen in the past years, because there is absolutely nothing to do in this huge city, besides walking and doing some repetitive activities that pop up around the map. Yet, there are no random events like we've seen in Red Dead Redemption 2 for example, nor extracurricular activities as we see in many other games, hell, even in GTA San Andreas (2004) we could go to the gym, barbershops, casinos, even take a taxi, so on. Another one of its downsides is the lack of character customization after the character creation. For a game where style is everything, this is a huge problem. I'm pretty sure that CDPR planned a lot of those activities but to meet the deadlines they've had to cut it out of the final game, now we just need to wait and see if they're going to implement some of those things in the game.

Back in 2019, CDPR stated that Cyberpunk would have a 'Wanted' system and corrupt police. Well, at least we got a wanted system, but not as you expected. The police system is just awful. Literally, there is no car chase or a proper AI for the police, they just spawn behind you whatever the place you are at. I remember GTA 3 from 2001 having a better police AI than Cyberpunk, and that's ridiculous.

[h3]This Is a RPG After All.[/h3]

At the end of the day, Cyberpunk 2077 tries to be an RPG, but is it really? When they first announced the lifepaths I got really excited, and even more when I read that every lifepath choice would affect the world around you, and that was a big fat lie. First of all, lifepaths just change the game introduction and some minor dialog options, and that's it, no major changes at all. About the general choices, yes, a lot of the choices that you made in the main quests or even side quests can have an impact on your ending or at least some important dialogs throughout the story. When it comes to RPGs, one of the most important things is the skill tree. Here in Cyberpunk, we have a huge skill tree, and it works quite similar to the Skyrim skill tree, you can upgrade your character to be a melee specialist, heavy weapon specialist, or combine everything in one and be an overpowered one tap machine.

The gameplay itself is pretty average, nothing spectacular but not bad either. We can carry 3 main weapons and toss a variety of grenades. There are the implants that we can only buy new ones or change the currently equipped on ripper docs. The implants that you acquire on ripper docs can play a huge role in your gameplay, as you can upgrade your max health and carry weight, etc.

[h3]The Hidden Gem, Not So Hidden.[/h3]

The best part of the game so far is the main story and the main side quests, if I can put it that way. CDPR did a great job telling the story in a way that you don't feel overwhelmed or tired and gets even better when you get to know the characters and their stories. You can connect really easily with the characters, and that's a huge point for me. In this huge game industry, lately, there's been a lack of good characters that you feel for, and Cyberpunk 2077 makes you care about the characters, even more than you should.
The soundtrack is impressive, even if many of the songs didn't suit my style, they did awesome work creating the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the main quests are too short compared to Witcher 3, about 20 hours if you rush throughout the game. I finished the main plot in 50 hours, however, half of my playtime was doing side missions and exploring the map. I've had so much fun doing side missions, and some of'em are, I dare say, better than some of the main story-related quests. 

[h3]The Not So Good, The Bad, And The Ugly[/h3]

Nonetheless, the bugs. As everyone might know by now, Cyberpunk 2077 is full of bugs, I can make a book with five thousand pages about the bugs. In my playthrough, I didn't encounter any game-breaking bug, thank god, but there's a lot of glitches, for example, cars flying around, NPCs appearing from nowhere, and a lot of clipping glitches, more than usual, etc. The most annoying bugs are quest-related ones, even though I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs, there are still some glitches that ruined my immersion, and I hope that they'll fix those very soon.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

I'm really divided about this game, in one hand, there are the great main story/side quests, and the great characters, but on the other hand, there's a lot of bugs, glitches, and main issues that make this impressive world, well, less impressive. I'll recommend Cyberpunk 2077 more because of its great story, characters, and fun gameplay. However, we should treat this review as a mixed one, but steam doesn't allow us to do so.

1643320,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"1. Atmosphere and sound - Amazing 100/10
2. Bugs - didn't find anything critical
3. Optimization - it's just bad. Waiting for patches.
4. A-LIFE - there's no A-LIFE. Game just spawns enemies within 50-100 meters. Hope patches will make it work like in previous games, because without it it's not STALKER and the world is empty and lifeless without it.
5. Enemies are just sponges for bullets. Need rebalance. 4 mags to kill a bloodsucker? Really?
Other things to mention that I would like DEVs to change/add:
- Day/night cycle is too short
- No sleeping bags
- It costs a fortune to repair weapons and suits
- No dymanic shadows from the flashlight
- eneimes just spam you with grenades all the time
- would be cool to have more food/drinks options and cook monster parts like in GAMMA or order some meals in the bars
- weapons/suits condition goes down waaaaay to fast (shot 2 mags from AK and got -3%. Whaaaaaat?)
- when you sit at the campfire you cannot eat/drink/open PDA/inventory etc.
- you get hungry every 5-10 minutes. I assume longer day/night cycle would be a great option as well to fix the issue.
- mutants AI is strange. If you're being chased by the mutants and jump of the car for example they just run away. When you get down they appear again. They don't try to jump or at least swarm around the car waiting for their meal.

2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"Likes.

Impressive graphics. There's a lot of visual bugs that go unnoticed because of how stunning the atmosphere is.

Animations for me are the single most impressive part of the game. The movements from the player as well as the enemies are unmatched by any game I've ever played right up there with RDR2.

The leveling system is unique and offers sort of an on the fly build changing of perks, so you don't have to worry about were you put attribute points, you can swap those out for free, any time, and that's awesome.


Dislikes.

I do not like the combat. It seems repetitive at times and just doesn't scratch the fighting itch for me. You have your standard light, heavy, dash and jump attacks, but too often I find myself playing a turn-based game and just waiting for them to finish there move so i can spam light attack while waiting for my specials to charge. You can unlock perks to help make combat more versatile(that's putting it lightly, there's a lot to unlock), but the fundamental combat mechanics are dull to me.

Hit detection. Its not Elden Ring. Don't expect to always be flashy and cool and not get hit by some attack that you are 10 feet away from and take half damage from some trash mob.

The map. There isn't one. Now generally, I don't care for a map cause I like exploring, but when i'm supposed to progress a story, i want to know where i'm going, and where I've missed. You won't ever know where you're going, or where you've missed.

Balance. The enemies in the beginning are comically bad, then get slightly harder, then immediately become avoided at all costs. After 6 hours playing, the mobs just aren't fun to fight. The Bosses are really fun, though.


OVERALL. I recommend trying it with Steam's return policy. Your'e not likely to experience everything in my review after less than 2 hours of gameplay, but you'll get a taste and can hopefully make an informed decision.


EDIT: After this review, i forced myself to play again to like this game, i just can't get over the wonky combat and terrible hit detection. 7 hours will be it for me.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 732,771 user reviews for this game are positive.",like impressive graphic visual bug unnoticed stunning atmosphere animation single impressive movement enemy unmatched rdr2 leveling unique offer sort fly build changing perk worry attribute point swap awesome dislike not_like combat repetitive time scratch fighting itch standard light heavy dash attack turn based waiting finish move spam light attack waiting special charge unlock perk help combat versatile putting lightly unlock fundamental combat mechanic dull detection not_elden ring expect flashy cool not_get attack 10 foot half damage trash monster enemy generally care cause exploring supposed progress missed missed balance enemy beginning comically bad slightly harder immediately avoided cost 6 hour mob fun fight boss fun recommend trying policy e not_likely 2 hour taste hopefully informed decision forced play wonky combat terrible detection 7 hour

739630,Phasmophobia,"This game is extremely fun to play. Luckily my friends and I were looking for a co-op horror game right at this time and I stumbled upon this game. None of us regret it one bit. It's very promising for an early access game.

Pros -
While the game still has jumpscares, it doesn't rely on them very much at all, and instead relies on the natural tension of large, dark areas and the natural activity (or lack thereof) of the ghost in order to build suspense. This means, for me at least, the feeling of dread doesn't end up wearing off and I can still feel genuine fear when going on a new mission, even if I've been there 20 times before, while also letting those jumpscares still be somewhat scary. A win/win in my book.

The voice recognition is something I wasn't sure would work out to be very enjoyable, but boy was I wrong. It creates a great experience, actively speaking to the entity, trying to provoke it to show you what it can do, risking your life for the mission, but it's gotta be done. It's thrilling and fills you with dread. Having the mission react to the things you say is extremely immersive, one of this games biggest strengths.

Immersion as I said, is huge in this game. I always feel like I could actually be in the level. Especially if you are playing in VR, it's hard to be ripped out of the experience, even if you're fucking around with friends, like I was. Being able to be the one in the truck tracking movement and and activity throughout the location is just as thrilling as wandering the house itself looking for activity. It's been hilarious and immersive the several times my friend got impatient waiting for clues and went into the house to insult the ghost only for it to immediately lock the door and begin hunting him. 10/10

Cons - I don't really feel that it's entirely fair to list these as cons, as the game basically JUST came out as I write this, and I have very little to complain about and feel very positively about this game and it's future, but these are things to keep in mind, and that they may and will likely change in the future.

When playing in VR, you can hold a video camera in your hand and carry it around, and others can have a clear view of what you're pointing it at as you move through the house. I would like to see this also become a feature for desktop play, while you still can equip the camera and view it, the angle is very low and bobs sporadically, making things hard to see. You can buy a headmounted camera that I assume fixes this. I am not a high enough level to buy one yet so I'm not sure.

VR players definitely have an advantage in many scenarios as you can turn on equipment such as the EMF reader and the spirit box, then but them on your belt to use them hands-free. I would like for at least the EMF reader to do something similar, instead of turning off when you put it away. It makes a noise when you get a reading, and I think that could stay, while requiring you to pull it out again to see exactly how strong the reading is, I feel that would be a good compromise.

As for VR QOL, my only 2 concerns right now are 1. placing cameras. Currently you grip them by the left or right side in a set direction, and it's only different for each hand it's held in. It can make it difficult to place a camera facing a set direction. I would like to be able to grip cameras from a front angle, as well as from the top, in order to make placing them much easier. And 2. switching hands, currently you have to drop an item manually and catch it if you're fast, or pick it up off the floor in order to switch hands if you don't have room in your belt. Many other games allow you to grab object out of your other hand and I feel it would be very helpful. 

Mission design - Again, keep in mind that I'm writing this in very early access, so I expect this to change at some point. Currently, the only missions are identification. Go in, find clues, deduce the ghost type, leave. I Don't have a problem with map design, but I would like to see other mission types, such as full on removal, as the game talks about you, the identification team, doing the research for a future removal team, missions like that would be great. Another is finding out how the person died and became a ghost, the journal mentions a few times about death and people becoming a ghost. Finding clues about the death of the ghost would be a very interesting mission design and I'd love to see it come to light.

Sanity is also something I expect to become something much more than it is currently as the game goes on. I feel that is obvious but I will give my 2 cents anyway for complete transparency. Right now, with my current understanding, it doesn't matter until you hit 50% at which point the ghost becomes more aggressive against you. This on it's own is interesting and can be useful for drawing the ghost out, but I would like to see more, such as hallucinations, both visual and auditory. There's not much more I can say on this, anything I could is just as obvious as that so I won't bother, and again, expect changes to this.

Lastly, when you die, you become a ghost and wander the map as an invisible entity. I think this has a lot planned for the future, but currently that's all there is to it. I think it would be extremely interesting if you could interact with the world in a similar way to the spirit your team is still hunting. Things like flicking the lights, writing short phrases on walls, or maybe being able to speak in a ghostly filter for just a couple seconds to give them a clue, would be very fun and make it so you're not just a passive and clueless observer if you are killed. If done in a way where it isn't always clear if the interaction is between the hostile spirit or your fallen friend, it would be possibly the most unique thing I've ever seen in a co-op horror game.

All in all, this game is a steal at it's current $15 price, and I got it on sale for less than $13! Even if you want to wait to play it when it's more developed, pick it up now! I have no issues recommending this to anyone, and I anticipate a very bright future in those dark corridors.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Alright,
I really tried to hold off on rating this game, as so many people love it, but I just feel like it really let me down in many ways, and I am not happy with my purchase due to the type of ""open world survival crafting"" player that I am.
Thus, this review is not exactly meant to bash the game, however, hopefully to paint a more clear picture for others on the fence about purchasing.

As an avid ""Open World Survival Crafting"" player with over 10,000+ hours in this genre, here is what I found pleasant, as well as, unfortunate about this game:

Pros:
-The game is very beautiful, the animations are good, and I never feel like I couldn't move how I wanted to
-The open world is very large, there is certainly a lot to explore
-Unlocking different larger areas via towers is very fun, I enjoyed this the most out of everything in the game
-The idea and story is unique, as are the enemies and the challenge they bring to the table
-It is a very easy game to play, the learning curve is pretty low, in my opinion (which will also end up being a negative below for others reasons)

Cons:
1. The base building:
People rave about the base building here, and architecture is one of the MAIN reasons I play Open World Survival Crafters, however, I feel, Enshrouded, REALLY let me down here.
Don't get me wrong, the ability to really take pieces out and replace them in any place of a piece is just amazing, I really applaud that ingenuity, however, not being able to rotate pieces less than 90 degrees is a HUGE deal breaker for me. I get that MineCraft was a good game for its time, voxel building DOES allow players to build essentially anything using cubes, it DOES open up more creative options.....However, this is a graphics demanding game, set in a world with lots of curvature; not allowing me to rotate building pieces in order to simulating curves in a world with a magnitude of curvature will be the #1 reason I do not recommend this game. If this changes, I will happily come back and change my review. But being expected to be happy building cubic structures using varying sized cubes is not my idea of a fun building experience. I feel incredibly limited here, and reshaping my doorway with cubes any way I want doesn't make me feel better about it.

2.
The skill system:
I feel like....something is missing here. Once I played with most of the weapons and their animations, I felt like I had.....essentially played the entire game when it came to my character. The new skills you unlock are more percentile based than anything, and they don't leave you with a plethora of new combat techniques to choose from. I sort of felt like.....after the first few bosses, I kind of knew how I was going to beat the entire game. It made me feel like my character growth wasn't really a large factor of the equation, and this made me feel limited, and less individuated as a player; especially since I could just hand someone the best gear in the game for any class and they'd be able to perform pretty well with it without any skills; the game just doesn't really encourage having your own individual skills and play style, it just kinda....buffs what already exists. This was saddening to me and made me not exciting to carry on with the game.

3.
Limiting the open world:
So, in this game, there is this red cloudy ""dust"" looking effect that kills you within a couple seconds if you walk into it, it blocks certain areas of the open world that are outside of your level.....I do not feel this was a wise choice.
I get that it might be a protective mechanism, designed to keep players on track, but again, it didn't encourage freedom, it made me feel boxed in and limited. I would rather die going into somewhere I shouldn't be than be forced in a linear path.

4.
The NPCs for crafting in your base are incredibly annoying, a waste of time, and an extra unneeded step when the Devs could have just made it so you unlock the skills to do things without needing a loudmouth in your base yelling at you every 5 seconds when you walk by. I almost never want to walk in my base because there's immediately 3-6 NPCs begging for my attention or the blacksmith flat out insulting me. Funny at first, but now I want them all out of my house/base.



In conclusion, I found the game to be rather....dull, limiting, linear, etc; I always felt directed, not free, I consistently felt like my desire to play how I wanted was discouraged.
I realize this makes this product/game more accessible to most, whom may want an easier experience, however, I cannot recommend this game, at this time, to people whom truly love Open World Survival Crafting games.
Enshrouded is MUCH more similar to Zelda than ANY respectible Open World Survival Crafter.

Thank you for your time, I hope this helped you either purchase this game or another. You don't have to be me and share my interests, I am only writing here so others can have a better idea of what they are walking into.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"I'll start with the advantages of the game, they still exist:
1. The gameplay is very pleasant, it's nice to run, it's nice to fight. Attention is paid to things that infuriate in many games, like unnecessarily long animations of climbing / getting off somewhere: everything is fast and smooth here.
2. The locations are very beautiful.
3. Leveling of the equipment is done surprisingly wisely. You're not messing up a bunch of low lvl junk items. Instead, equipment cannot be sold, each item is in one copy and when you would have to find/knock out/buy the same item, the one you had is improved instead. It may be a disadvantage for fans of managing things, but it was not bad for me, because over all these years I was already tired of the ""traditional"" approach to loot in RPGs.

Now what I didn't like about the game:
1. Cartoon graphics cause dissonance. Almost all the main characters and NPCs are unsympathetic: big heads, strange body proportions, ridiculous clothing designs.
2. The game is absolutely weak and childish in terms of the behavior of your character. You can't be an asshole (hello DAO and MAE), you can't even be just sarcastic, selfish, greedy, indifferent, or anything else that deflects you from the goody-two-shoes mark of a fool.
3. The game is absolutely weak and childish in terms of the behavior of other characters. Negative characters are caricatured and uninteresting, they won't even risk insulting you in dialogue more than ""you're a fool"", and even there are few of them. The world is like everyone is afraid to talk to each other normally. 
4. The game is absolutely weak and childish in terms of partner conflicts. Yes, that most important part of the Bioware games is completely ruined.
5. The romance with the character I chose turned out to be a dummy. There was no chemistry, it seemed like my companion wasn't interested in my character at all for most of the game.
6. The frivolity of everything in spite of the content of the plot, up to the point of absurdity. We have two evil elven gods here staging an apocalypse, corruption is spreading on a scale never seen before, but the priority will be to discuss how to talk to someone properly. And these are not isolated cases, this is regularly the case. There is no atmosphere. Blood mages? Demons? Slavery? Templars? Conflicts with magicians? Well, all these things that set the tone in past games? They do not exist, except when they pop up in the dialogue in the context of ""slavery is bad, venatori are not good people, okay?"", and then we return to the discussion of ""important"" things.
7. There are a lot of puzzles, but they are all so simple that they can only break a six-year-old's head, and even that is not a fact. And after a couple of hours, they don't get any better.
8. ""Everything is hand-touched, hand-crafted, very highly curated"" according to Bioware, in practice it's running from one note/letter to another. Most of the quests have no depth, they are uninteresting.
9. Dull and monotonous fights. The opponents present no challenge. You spam with an auto-attack, and once a minute you trigger some kind of combo of companions, because the cooldown has passed. 
10. As a continuation of the previous point, leveling does not make any sense when you can have only 4 skills and you will almost never use them. The ideal solution is to set an easy difficulty level and simply perceive each fight as a necessary routine. There are no tactics, no planning is needed, you can throw leveling points anywhere — what's the difference.
11. The illusion of choice. In 9 out of 10 cases, choices are 3 options that do the same thing. At best, they will influence which of the characters will approve of it (but approval feels like it doesn't do anything either, you can't even watch it). In conversations with your teammates, you have three different approval options and nothing else besides them. 
12. Many players speak positively about optimization of the game, but I had such bugs: textures in locations periodically disappear, the store loads for a long time, after a lot of special effects on the screen the game crashes, and sometimes when I load the save, my character's appearance changes to a default bald character.

Game has come a long way. SInce very first CS up to this point. Current trends actually killed this game for good. I don't think I will ever come back to it. I can't imagine going F2P on this game is a good idea purely because of cheaters and scummy players. Matchmaking is awful as is thus i see no reason to TRY to have fun playing. Battle royale? I am waiting for new Need for Speed to have that gamemode too (kappa). I don't know, I am honestly disappointed, once again by this game. Best FPS ever made has actually hit rock bottom by not being itself anymore
EDIT
I can see that people who have the same opinion as me are usually more experienced, whereas people that are basically new and have under 2 years of playtime would just be toxic and be part of this /perfect cancer-free/ community. Shame, but I like the discussion.

2582560,EA SPORTS™ Madden NFL 25,"I haven't bought a Madden game in over 15 years. It was a franchise I really enjoyed in my early 20's. I've been wanting to try one of these again for a while now, and seen a lot of the positive reviews it was getting here and said ""Why not?"" It was fun for a while! I'm really not a football fan, but I was having the same kind of fun that I had back then, and that accounts for something. I found the ""Superstar"" mode to be kind of my jam, because it's basically football RPG, and I like that idea... Until it started to quit me out of games for disconnecting from the EA server. This happened over and over again, and that would be fine, if it were saving your progress along the way... But no. That 300 yard passing game you were on your way towards? Gone in the forth quarter because you're ""Not Online"" or whatever. I know most people who play these just buy them every year and this probably is nothing new to you, but I'm leaving this here for the one person who's like me. The one person who wants to give this a shot because they heard good things. I'm not saying nobody should enjoy this, it's perfectly fine when it comes to the football itself. Graphics are decent, but wow, I didn't realize how annoying the always online aspect of so many games has become. It's not my first exposure to it or anything, but usually an auto save is happening to soften the blow... Not here though. So I think I'm good on this franchise.

2139460,Once Human,"Lets talk about their privacy policy:
https://protocol.unisdk.easebar.com/release/latest_v475.html 

Over-collection of Personal Information and security risks: The policy collects a wide range of personal data, including sensitive information like government-issued IDs, which is typically excessive unless specifically required by law or for a legitimate purpose. Collecting and storing extensive personal and sensitive information like government IDs, credit card details, social media data, and communication history poses significant security and privacy risks. They also list numerous third-party recipients of personal information without specifying how these parties will handle the data.

Lack of Transparency and Purpose Limitation: It's unclear why such extensive details are needed for ""correction of personal information."" Transparency about data collection purposes is crucial for users to understand why their data is being collected. There's also little to no mention of user consent or control over their data. GDPR and similar regulations require clear consent mechanisms and user rights, such as the right to access, correct, and delete personal data. While it mentions consent in some contexts (e.g., marketing), it's unclear how users can exercise control over their data, such as accessing or deleting it. GDPR and similar regulations require clear mechanisms for users to manage their data. The policy also doesn't specify how long different types of data will be retained, which is essential for users to understand their data lifecycle and rights regarding data deletion.

Legal Basis and Justification: Although the policy mentions legal bases for processing personal data (e.g., legitimate interests), it does not elaborate on how these bases apply to specific data processing activities, which is crucial for compliance and user understanding.

TLDR; this privacy policy is problematic because it lacks clarity, transparency, and appears to over-collect personal information without sufficient justification or safeguards for user privacy. regularly, privacy policies should prioritize user consent, data security, limited data collection, and clear communication of data usage purposes.

Personal peeve: 

You also cant claim closed beta rewards on steam unless you download their NetEase spyware launcher. This was never stated during the closed beta, I would say I wasted nearly a hundred hours on the closed betas just to get smacked in the face with a ""due to limitations"" account linking bs that was never mentioned before, all to get me to download their launcher.

2842040,Star Wars Outlaws,"has to be one of the biggest letdowns this decade right after Starfield of course. This game has a lot of success when it comes to level design and visual details. It compensates for this with NO Gameplay, yes this ""game"" barely has any ""play"" in it.
If you count going a->b as gameplay, then go ahead.
If you think a shooter game with broken takedown animations and NO GORE is okay, then go ahead
If you think that being locked to a SINGLE laser gun is okay, and you're unable to carry even a single rifle, then go ahead.
If you think that an ""outlaw"" character should be locked to pickpocketting from BAD GUARDS only, then go ahead, for reference check red dead redemption 2 with absolute freedom when it comes to outlaw activities.
If you think facial animations and character design is acceptable for a game of this scale, you are wrong and your opinion doesn't infact matter at all.
For reference, look at Death Stranding facial animations and character design, that really sets the BARE MINIMUM for how these games should look like coming out RIGHT NOW. 
Truth is, we all know what's happening, we all know studios are ridden with DEI hiring policies and actual talented team members are swapped with new hires based on unimportant factors.
Star Wars Outlaws would already be discarded by me due to the movement being janky as hell, I got stuck on a curved doorframe, character moves like a robot, this was mentioned countless of times, ubisoft did nothing with it, unacceptable.
Main character is made UGLY on purpose to pander to a select organization whose name we shall not speak off, EVERYTHING in this game is centered around it.
This game is yet ANOTHER spit in the face of the consumers by Ubisoft.
as usual anyways, didnt expect anything else.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Destiny is undoubtedly a tough game to get into, but there’s a good chance that you’ll enjoy at least some aspects of this game. If you’re lucky you might find something that brings you coming back or you might be turned off of this in the first five minutes. Destiny has always been something you have to be patient with. If you just play until there’s no story left and leave, then you really haven’t gotten into the part of the game Bungie intended as the core experience. Frankly, I can’t blame anyone for doing that, as Bungie does a piss-poor job at explaining exactly what to do for inexperienced players (or even me, someone who has over 5,000 hours in this series). 

When it comes down to it, the game is free now, so the only risk you have trying this out is some download time. There are MANY potentially enjoyable experiences in this game. It’s up to you to determine if any of them are for you. Do yourself a favor and look for some people willing to sherpa you through the content you don’t understand or simply look it up.

[Also, beware of some reviews on here. Armor customization IS free and people aren’t patient enough to unlock it like normal people. There is absolutely no incentive to buy armor due to grinding because armor you buy has no actual power unless you already have powerful armor that you then infuse said armor in to. The armor system does EXACTLY what they said it would do and there’s no denying that. There is, unfortunately, a group of people who continue to say the opposite because they must point their finger at some random thing they make up because they aren’t qualified to put their thoughts to words. Take all praise and criticism with this series with a grain of salt. Everything is subjective, and if any game proves that, it’s this one.

If you have any questions about any aspect of the game, just DM me and I’ll give you my honest, unbiased-as-possible explanation. I would explain everything in this review, but what would be the point? Everyone who likes this game like it for their own reasons, so hop in and see what interests you (or not).","Very Positive80% of the 615,480 user reviews for this game are positive.",undoubtedly tough good chance enjoy aspect lucky brings turned five minute patient play no_story left leave gotten bungie intended core frankly blame bungie piss poor explaining exactly inexperienced player someone 5 000 hour series come risk trying download potentially enjoyable experience determine favor willing sherpa understand simply beware review armor customization patient unlock normal no_incentive armor due repeatedly performing action gain resource armor no_actual power unless already powerful armor infuse armor armor exactly no_denying unfortunately group continue opposite finger random qualified thought word praise criticism series grain salt subjective prof question aspect dm honest unbiased possible explanation explain like reason hop interest
238960,Path of Exile,"[h1][b]Path Of Exile		* 10/10[/b][/h1]

[i]""All praises to PoE, Lord of terror and Survivor of the Dark Exile...""[/i]

Yes, that was one of the books you find in the dungeons of Diablo. I loved Diablo. More than I should have. I loved Diablo II, maybe even more than the first. And Somehow I didn't expect it to be possible, but I love PoE even more.

[h1][i]INTRO. What is Path Of Exile about?[/i][/h1]
There are a million ways to describe PoE, I could tell you it's an isometric action RPG, I could tell you its story where you're a hero exiled in this land where everyone struggles to survive.
Or I could tell you it's Diablo on Steroids. Heavy steroids. [b]FOR FREE[/b]

[h1][i]GRAPHIC. Engine And Artistic aspects.[/i][/h1]
Grinding Gear Games developed their own engine that works well but that's not the important thing. What really matters is the artistic aspect of the game. When you get into dungeons, or cathedrals, or temples and so on, all levels have been designed with a maniacal care for details and some awesome art such as mosaics, paintings and so on. It is simply amusing to walk through randomly generated maps that give such fine compositions.
Anyways, Lots of art can be found in any other aspects, from the passive skill tree screen, to cards, or items you will find all the time. Definitely good talents have been working on this game.

[h1][i]SOUNDTRACK. Themes and Accompaniments.[/i][/h1]
Yes, soundtrack is incredible too. I can't believe how inspiring and epic it can get, with most of the title tracks (changed through time, from expansion pack to pack), and other themes you can hear along dungeons or various locations. They all fit the atmosphere with music mostly made by arcs, choirs and other particular instruments such as sitar. This convinced me to purchase the soundtrack as well and this happens rarely.

[h1][i]GAMEPLAY. How does it work?[/i][/h1]
Like Diablo. On steroids.
No, seriously, the base system is always the same. You choose your hero's class first (there are seven available, one of them gets unlocked during your first playthrough in a mission), each one is meant to fight better with different weapons or fight approaches.
Every action is made with your mouse cursor, with a few key shortcuts, so you move, interact, attack and organize with your mouse mainly. Each enemy death grants you some experience and when you level up you get a point to spend in your own character's giant skill tree filled with stats, bonuses and variables.
There are different tabs, starting from the inventory with slots for items to equip or to carry around to sell or store in your personal stash in town; there's a map with all quests as well, then there's the character's tab with all his/her personal stats (strength, dexterity, intelligence) damages, resistances and so on; there's a social tab with your friends and guilds.
Actual magics and physical abilities are given by skill gems you find around and place into sockets of weapons or armours you are wielding or wearing. Those skills level up with the same experience you gain with each kill.
Unlike Diablo there's no gold. No money. Everyone here is an exile, so the only currency here is barter. You trade an item for another item. There's a criteria of course. Enough for you to know that regular items grant an identification scroll fragment, while different class of magic, rare and unique items will grant you a different kind of gem fragment that allow the player to improve regular or magic objects stats in many different ways.
And there's much more but it would really take me an entire day to describe everything I know or remember and it's not everything the game has to offer or hides for you to discover as there's a wiki with articles on every single aspect of the game you want to know in order to better understand the game

[h1][i]LAST NOTES. What doesn't work?[/i][/h1]
Not much, actually. How am I supposed to say something wrong about a game that is almost perfect and for free?
I really have to dig into the game to realize that it's vast. There's a lot to do, to know, to see, and to take. Which is mostly a good thing as gives the game an immense replayability, if you consider the different classes, the immense length of the game, the random maps and encounters. And maybe this vastity can scare or bore some casual gamers. But Actually I love this aspect of the game as it gives the game a far superior value compared to any other AAA title. And, in case you didn't notice, [b]IT'S FREE[/b]. And it's [b]NOT A PAY TO WIN[/b]. Every purchase is about cosmetic elements only.
A character's power and level will entirely depend on the time you invest with the game and your ability. Yes, item drops are random yet related to your character level, however this could be another turndown for some players, as your loot depends on your luck, so your character will get stronger or not if you stumble upon a good or a bad item.

[h1][i]TL;DR. Pros And Cons[/i][/h1]
[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]
[*][b] FREE.[/b] Honestly, this is the very first reason you must love and worship this game and their developers. This title is simply put ""well developed"" in all its aspect and it's immense. It's not a pay to win and you will end up buying stuff on your own will to support developers because they did an immense job and definitely deserve it.
[*][b] SUPPORT.[/b] I started playing this game in 2014 when it barely had 3 acts, now in 2017 it has 10 acts and an infinite map system that expands the game further. How can you hate a game that constantly expands... For free?
[*][b] DIABLO ON STEROIDS.[/b] If you love Diablo and other isometric ARPG this is the definitive game for you. Base mechanics are always the same, but here everything is expanded way beyond your imagination. If you love text books with stories and lore, here you can find books as well around the maps, not to mention all discussions with NPCs in towns.
[*][b] COOP.[/b] There's only one thing that makes this game even better: coop. You can play all the story with your friends, make a guild and go around. You can also challenge other players, there are public events, giving even more variety to the multiplayer and social aspect of the game, but I didn't try them as I only care about coop.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"EDIT: Put in my thoughts after the ending at the bottom of this review. 

I'm an old school nerd, and I mean OLD. I played Baldur's Gate - the very first one - by buying it on a CD. When the sequel Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn came I was all over it and replayed it like a dozen times. I wrote fanfiction about the characters on old message bords. When Dragon Age: Origins came out it was for me the New Thing, the Different Thing, but I loved it all the same. It did weird things with the tropes I knew, and I wasn't always crazy about them, but it stuck the landing all the same. I'm saying all this to explain how to me, Dragon Age: Origins isn't where it starts for me, but rather way before that. 

So what's Veilguard like? Well... Playing the Dragon Age games is playing with an indecisive DM who houserules and modifies all the time, be it gameplay, how races look (remember the hornless Qunari), how characters look (remember how DAO Isabella looked) and many other things, so that must at this point be expected. DAO was largely a classic party strategy game with WOW-style bars to scroll up and down to find your abilities. DA2 introduced a faster pace and more arcade-y fighting, DAI tried to mesh the two and it went... so-so. Now Veilguard is here, and once again it's doing its own thing. The fighting reminds me or DA2  - with a bit of Mass Effect of all things blended in. The inventory management is once again a bit more on the arcade-y side as well, and generally I'm getting the sense of ""action-adventure"" more than the ""strategy-lite"" style of for example Pathfinder or once again DAO. 

Yet, do I enjoy it? Having accepted that Dragon Age as a series kinda goes all over the place trying different things? Yes. The combat's a bit halfway between DA2 and DAI, and seems to offer the same ability to combo things into insanity if you know what you're doing that DAI did. The companions are making an impression on me, and while I haven't seen that much of them, they certainly seem more interesting than for example Mass Effect Andromeda's. The world looks great - even if again a bit different - and I already had my first gleeful giggle at the verbal bitchslapping my Rook delivered at one point. All that is making me hopeful, making me feel like the Dragon Age I adore is back. 

Will this last? Who knows?! But at least right now, I'm happy.

EDIT: Sitting here now having complete the game, I can say that overall, it did last. Was it wonky in some places? Was it sometimes a bit stiff? Did it fumble a decent chunk of the previous lore? Do I wish they had actually made use of events in previous games? All yes. But did I have fun? Did I get excited? Did the ending satisfy me? Also yes. I won't begrudge anyone their issues with the game (unless they're the ""weeh weeh woke"" people), but all the same it was a satisfying game all in all.

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"What started out as a promising looking multiplayer rpg with decent graphics, interesting story, plenty of quests, useful crafting, and functional combat has turned into a nightmare of bugs, exploits, imbalance, toxicity, and exponentially increasing grind. The development team puts out inconsistent patches that are reactionary and only punish players with more imbalance, more bugs, and more time wasting repetition. This has made accomplishing anything, especially crafting, almost impossible without a 'no life' game play style. New World is technically in alpha as it is not feature complete nor ready for the bug fixing and polish of beta making us unpaid QA testers. Those are facts in my subjective view.
My assumptions? They bought a tech demo IP from a small company outside the US, slapped together a cheap and inexperienced team to 'tweak' it, put a price tag on it and shipped it for a quick turn around profit. You might recognize this practice since big publishers like EA have been doing it for decades; scooping up an IP at rock bottom investment, exploiting the heck out of it, making profit, and dumping the rotting corpse never to be seen again.
Sadly, Amazon Games has shown with New World that they are not a new game dev company that wants to break into, improve, innovate, and succeed in the games industry. They see a multi-billion dollar industry and want to grab as much of the pie as they can selling cheap products to the masses. Huh, sounds like the parent company.
This can change. But Amazon Games need to pull their head out and actually care about making great games. They have the capital to bring in the best and make the best. With that they could become leaders in the industry with a reputation for quality and innovation. But this first step was very much in the wrong direction.
If you're wondering why I have so many hours in a game that I ended up almost hating; it's because I have this idiotic thing called hope. I saw potential and hoped things would get better but they did not.

216150,MapleStory,"I've played this game since I was 10 years old when it came out in america.

The best way to describe maplestory is a deep, deep hole out in the woods.
When you are bored and looking for something to do you fall into this hole.
At first you are scared, you panic and try to get out of the hole.
But slowly, you begin you like it in the hole. 
You spend thousands of dollars on making this hole cooler, nicer, and do more dps. 
You meet friends, lovers, and faggots inside of this hole, it begins to feel like a community.
Then high school girl drama will go down, and you will sell all your gear and quit.
You will struggle to climb out of this hole. And finally....you're out.

You go back to the way your life was before, and you become happy again.

After a couple of months...you feel this craving...this...hunger...
You miss the hole. Sure, the hole has its ups and downs...but you...you were safe in the hole...you were...home...
So you go back, and thus begins the never ending downward spiral of your life.

2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"This game is nothing short of spectacular! It’s visually stunning, beautifully crafted, and offers a unique blend of thrilling fights, breathtaking views, and engaging combat.

Before deciding to buy and play 'Black Myth: WuKong', I did some thorough research to determine if it lives up to the hype. While I found many positive reviews, I also came across several criticisms and complaints that made me reconsider. 

My advise is 'Don’t let negativity sway you' and here’s why you shouldn’t be deterred with these comments:

-Trailers look too good to be true: Sometimes trailers can seem misleading, but this game truly lives up to the hype.

-It doesn’t look like a Souls game: Some people argue that if it’s not a Souls game, it won’t be enjoyable. However, while Souls games aren’t for everyone, this one offers its own fun, challenge, and rewards.

-It looks like a Souls game: Others might complain about another Souls-like game. While it’s challenging, it’s more forgiving compared to other Souls games that can be punishingly difficult.

-It might be too short (15 hours of gameplay): While some may worry about the length, the game actually offers much more content than anticipated.

-It’s not an open-world game: Though it’s not an open-world game, it’s also not overly linear. There’s plenty of exploration and hidden areas to discover.

-It’s a boss rush game: While it features many bosses, it’s also packed with smaller enemies and challenges that keep the gameplay exciting.

It seems some critics are quick to judge without giving the game a fair chance. If you’re on the fence, I assure you it’s worth it, especially if you’ve enjoyed the Sun Wukong character from TV series. Playing as him brings a wonderful sense of nostalgia and excitement.

In summary, this game is a fantastic experience and definitely worth your time!","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 732,771 user reviews for this game are positive.",short spectacular visually stunning beautifully crafted offer unique blend thrilling fight breathtaking view engaging combat deciding play myth thorough research determine life hype found positive review across criticism complaint reconsider advise negativity sway deterred comment trailer good trailer misleading truly life hype soul argue not_a soul enjoyable soul game offer fun challenge reward look soul others complain soul challenging forgiving compared soul game punishingly difficult short 15 hour worry length offer anticipated not_an open world not_an open world not_overly linear plenty exploration hidden area discover bos rush feature boss packed smaller enemy challenge exciting critic quick judge giving fair chance fence assure worth especially enjoyed sun tv series brings wonderful sense nostalgia excitement summary fantastic definitely worth
2878980,NBA 2K25,"Takeaways from 6ish hours park gameplay(Old Town event, 94% win rate):

- Pro play is massively improved from last year, steam users don't have a reference for proplay 1.0 but it was not good
- Game speed is not higher but the spacing of the court and snappiness of ball handling/animation canceling allows for better movement than 24 next gen
- Interior D is strong still, no difference really from last year
- High-risk high-reward shooting system is excellent, if you can time a jumper/lay-up
- Lane steals are back(much needed), bump steals are kind of OP right now
- Defense overall is about the same, more rewarding for good placement this year
- Shooting is a lot better than 24 next gen, imo

I am comparing this to 2k24 Next Gen on the Xbox last year. I played about 20 mins offline mycareer gameplay, it was solid no complaints. I dont play MyTeam or MyLeague mode so I can't speak on that. PlayNow Online seems good although I did not play it myself but based on mypark gameplay it should be fun. 2k to me is about half basketball realism(concepts like spacing, ball movement, shot selection etc.) and half stupid fun(like the old days) 2k25 delivers on both ends solidly. Rewarding gameplay for skilled and high IQ players. No game is without its flaws, those are noticeable as well, but overall nothing has ruined my experience.

230410,Warframe,"It's been almost 7 years now. Being with this game for that long as a founder, you see a lot of good... and a lot of bad. 

Do I recommend this game? Not for everyone, no. There's been many bad choices leading up to the current state of Warframe that has left many veteran players discontent. Hell, even I feel burnt at times. If you're looking for a game to no life everyday for the rest of your life, I'm not sure if you'll find it in Warframe in it's current state. The lack of a true endgame and the current nature of recent updates catering to new players over old has made the game wider but not deeper. For the other type of players that are more... let's just say sensitive, you'll find that the community has certain perks that may discourage a few behaviors. For one, begging for free items is heavily frown upon. Similarly, if you ask for help on mundane and simply task that anyone can do (that includes using Google), you'll find many people to not be receptive of your inquiry. The community is not so much toxic but rather passionate. The ones that truly stick it out knows that one of the best ways to enjoy Warframe is to build yourself up with your own hands. So if you're the type who likes their hand held 24/7 or be boosted/rushed to the ""endgame,"" steer away because you won't be welcomed here.

Please also be aware that, while there is an extensive in-game market, it is by no means a pay to win model. Virtually all items that is prevalent in gameplay is farmable and the premium currency is actually tradeable between players. There is a very prominent trading community in the game and if there's something you want, someone else most likely has it. The somewhat convoluted menus and lack of proper tutorial contribute to the confusion. However, do not be discouraged once you've seen it for the first time. 

In regards to update, it's quite a mixed bag. Because the developers do not have a fixed schedule, updates can either be extremely frequent or extremely sparce. And much of the content content you get can equally be as randomly enjoyable or otherwise. There is a massive array of activities you can do and it really boils down to your preference what you like or what you don't at all. It really is an effort by the devs to cater to everyone. Or atleast they try to. 

You may also find that many updates come with an astonishing amount of bugs. This dissuades many players but I just want to pose a quick question, why don't you just not play the content until it's fixed? Since most activity are in essence optional, it's really up to you if you want to do it. No one is ""forcing"" you to play it, as I have heard many complained about before. If you feel forced to play a video game, that's more of your own priority issues, not the game. But the real caveat is, this is just how the game updates operate. Because one of the most important factors of Warframe is community and developer communication. Updates and fixes are very frequent and fast (minus holidays naturally) and the only issues that are usually left unchecked are miniscule  or ones that are difficult technical wise. Other than that, it's not as much of a slough as many would like to proclaim. The devs give content to the players, players give feedback, developers start patching as soon as an hour after the content drop.

For the veteran players, do I think the game need a lot of work? Absolutely. I won't deny that current content drops have not lived up to the expectations of many but it's also mostly pointless to whine about it. If you truly no longer enjoy the game, get off it. Go live your life, play another game, and if the day comes, come back to Warframe. But if you truly want to make a difference, get on the forums, get in game and spread the word, create some influence. Be an actual member of the community rather than a ragtag pitchfork mobs. In the end, it's just a game and you can leave and come back anytime. 

I'm not trying to be a white knight nor am I trying to hide the miscontent of many players, I just find it unproductive to whine and mope about. If a game really does bring about the worst in you, don't play it, it's a pretty simple concept. If you do want it to be better, finds way to help improve it, screaming your miscontent does no one justice. Not you, not the developers, not the game. Unless of course, you think it's morally right to riot and form a lynch mob, in which case I'm sure you can find the developer's address somewhere. In all seriousness though, I understand that some pressure is needed to push the devs to steer towards the direction we the community want but we often forget that they're people too. So unless you have never made a mistake your entire life, you're not in much of a position to talk :P

Make clear your mind but keep it civil, productive, and educated. You're better than that.

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"As a game to be able to dip your toes into MTG for free, this is fine. 

As an already established magic player, this is objectively one of the worst ways to play MTG. 

It's missing 3+ player game modes, Commander, Modern, Pioneer, Legacy, Vintage, Cubes, and Pauper. The only game modes it has that do not use the Alchemy cards is Standard. The other formats try to mimic actual MTG formats like Commander and Pioneer with things like Brawl and Historic, but these are not the same thing. They are infested with Alchemy cards which are digital only cards, meaning wizards thought this was a great opportunity to introduce effects on cards that they straight up copied from Hearthstone. If I wanted to play Hearthstone I would play that instead. I wouldn't even have an issue with these cards if there was other formats besides Standard and Limited that exclude these cards. 

This isn't even mentioning the monetization and the battle pass being one of the greediest, FOMO inducing ones I have ever seen. If you miss more than a week during a battles passes duration you likely will never be able to finish it. Dailies are all boring skinnerboxs. Typical F2P practices.

1790600,DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO,"The most unbalanced and hard to understand game both in the franchise and in years and I can't recommend it more.

To temper expectations of those who were being patient: this is not a competitive game, nor does it even attempt to be balanced like one.

Characters are balanced in line with the series power levels and that's how it should be. Roshi ain't got nothing on Beerus and it's fantastic.

The game does do a pretty sub-par job at explaining it's mechanics, but offers a lot of reward to those willing to put in the time to learn them, and the tutorial's shortcomings aren't anything a few youtube videos can't assist you with. Timing for your defensive mechanics is very strict which from watching my friends play seems to be the biggest frustration, but that is only really evident during battles against high leveled AI, which reads as many inputs as it can and has an answer to anything. Personally for me however, this just makes the game that much more exciting for me.

Singleplayer could use a lot more content, there are only premade stories for Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, Trunks, Frieza, Goku Black, and Jiren. These stories are a lot of fun and provide a lot of engagement with the game, though I wish there was more of it. The way the story is told is fairly brief, limiting full cutscenes to very specific moments, which is definitely in the game's benefit as we did not need a full retelling of the same story we've all watched, read, and played again and again. This is a bit of a double-edged sword though, as certain iconic moments in the story are reduced to screen shots and some text, and the brevity makes you feel the lack of content beyond Goku's story quite a bit.

The What-If Sparking Episodes are a lot of fun, I recommend going for as many of those as you can. Gohan got some much needed justice.

Thankfully, the game alleviates the lack of pre-made singleplayer content with user-created custom battles with a built in cutscene editor. Making these cutscenes is a bit of a chore to me, you cannot input custom text and are instead required to select from a very long list of dialogue. Filtering for specific lines and replaceable dialogue is quite difficult too, there is no manual search and the tags you use to filter don't seem to help all that much. You can't even sort the character name list alphabetically which needs to be there ASAP. But my own personal struggle with the cutscene editor aside, players have put in the work and made some pretty remarkable stories and I can only imagine how much this mode will add to the game's longevity.

Menu's are a bit clunky in certain areas, but navigating them isn't much of a hassle.

Looking forwards to the DLC, my only real hope with them is they'll bring more singleplayer content along with them.

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"I went in to Metaphor knowing almost nothing about it, and ended up being surprised by a personal contender for game of the year. The game is beautiful, moving, and has a delightful cast of characters. The combat mechanics are also fantastic (I'm always a sucker for a FF3/5 style job system).

This game recaptured a love for optimistic JRPGs that I haven't felt since playing Skies of Arcadia as a kid.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"See, I don't normally play MMO's. If I try one, it usually captures my attention for a solid week, then I lose interest, uninstall it, and never play it again.

This game? Oh man oh man. This game is great. I've only ever played free MMO trash around the web, but this one is by far THE BEST MMO I have ever played.

The combat is like you should expect; if you've played any other MMO, it plays similarly to what you would expect out of an MMO. There are a variety of classes that you can choose from as your battlecraft classes and, the best part, you can have every class on one character. This is especially helpful when you're doing end-game raid stuffs. Form one team, and depending on what your team has leveled, you can form different groups with the same team.

When I first started playing this game, as a low level I thought the gameplay was spectacular. Everything felt so fresh, and I felt like there was a bunch of things about the game I had yet to discover. Boy, was I right. Once I hit 50 (the max level for every class BEFORE Heavensward, which will increase that cap to 60), I felt like the game suddenly opened up to me. To this day, I still find that I have a LOT to do.

If you're looking for a great MMO to play and don't mind a monthly fee, look no further. Final Fantasy XIV will surely fill your MMO needs.","Very Positive87% of the 71,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",normally play massively multiplayer usually capture attention solid week lose interest uninstall never_play oh man oh man great massively multiplayer trash web far best massively multiplayer combat expect massively multiplayer play expect massively multiplayer variety class choose battlecraft class best class on_emphasizede especially helpful large group player tackling difficult challenge stuff form depending leveled form different group started low thought spectacular fresh bunch thing discover boy 50 max class heavensward increase cap 60 suddenly opened great massively multiplayer play mind monthly fee no_further fantasy surely fill massively multiplayer need
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Steam says I have 352 hours on GTAV/GTAO. Considering I ported my character over from Xbox 360, it should be at least double that. 


So lets say 700 hours. 

I have spent aproximately 700 hours playing this video game.

Yet I cannot recommend it. 

Yes I have had some of the best gaming I've ever had with this game. I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign, I played online mostly and had a a character legitimately over level 100 and with a nice sum of money set aside. I even supported the game further with the very occasional shark card. I was there for the DNS glitch that caused 9 billion dollar bounties to occur, and I was there when they cut literally everyone's funds to 500,000 as a ""fix""

But one day I was playing and some guy joins the server, forcibly teleports myself and a handful of others to him, freezes us, and makes bags of money rain from the sky. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not stupid, I know people hack and people give out money. I've seen countless people ask for them and praise them etc. I've generally ignored them, but this guy didn't give me much of a choice. 

Regardless once I figured out what was happening I left the server. I didn't want the money in my bank so I blew it customizing street cars and blowing them up. 

A couple hours later I was temporarily banned and my character was reset. I lost all of my cars, including old ones with rare paint jobs that could only be obtained by an exploit that had been patched, not to mention the majority of that 700 hours I'd put into having a character I liked. 

Rockstar punished me for something that was thrust upon me. My ingame wallet was raped and they decided to blame the victim.

There was no way for me to voice my displeasure to Rockstar. No appeals process for them to hear my case, check the evidence, and see my innocence. 

That was several months ago. I uninstalled the game and let it go. 

I'm only writing this now so that others can see what they're getting into. 

Yes, as I've said, this game is incredibly fun and contains hours upon hours of content. From an objective standpoint, its very good value for money and the free, regular, DLC is a nice touch. 

What ruins all of that is the way Rockstar treats its customers. There's no consistency, and no compassion. I know people in real life that have been taking free money for ages and they've never had any trouble. Yet it happens to me once, without my consent, and I get temp banned and lose literally everything. 

What motivation is there to play legitimately then? If people who do can lose everything in an instant with no way to appeal the decision, and those who don't can get away with it indefinitely. 

Hell you actually get a bonus for playing illegitimately because those people can just make new accounts and hack their way back to wealth and experience. 

Rockstar, if you actually end up reading this, please start treating your customers with some compassion.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"After ~210 hours and almost three months, I've finally completed the game (I'm a completionist and a slow player who likes to absorb the world carefully and slowly, explore everything, read everything a couple of times, etc).

The sheer level of complexity of interconnected stories, dialogues, outcomes, various characters, and factions is simply unbelievable. Hats off to Larian for managing to create such a rich, complex and meaningful world with hundreds of characters, dozens of factions and interesting groups, vast maps with an abundance of interesting locations to explore and secrets to uncover... While being almost completely nonlinear and giving players the opportunity to do everything in the way they want to do it.

Pros:

- Character models and animations (especially facial animations) are some of the best I've ever seen. It adds so much to the immersion. No matter how important or unimportant an NPC is.

- Superb voice acting, done with so much love, passion and care. And most importantly, with an understanding of the characters they give voices to.

- Generally, the writing is great. It successfully balances Larian's signature humour and silliness with a more macabre and serious tone of the world and the game's story.

- A diverse cast of memorable companions with their own agendas, personalities, personal stories and major questlines. I will miss every single one of them.

- Combat is mostly fun and rewarding. It rewards a tactical approach, experimenting and thinking out of the box.

- Every encounter is a meaningful experience, every combat is hand-crafted, every questline a story on its own, and every location is a unique place. There are no fillers or padding.

- Dozens upon dozens of interesting side stories and quests of various scales and importance.

- Great level design with attention to detail. It’s a pure joy to explore various locations and just look around.
 
- Memorable and multilayered villains with distinctive personalities and agendas.

- Amazing music by Borislav Slavov. Kirill Pokrovsky would be proud.

- Excellent implementation of D&D rules into a video game.

Cons:

- The game's tempo varies. In the early game, it seems that some relationships with companions are developing extremely fast. On the other hand, in Act 3, there is a dichotomy between the urgency of the main quest and the amount of quests, side stories and general stuff you can do and explore in the city of Baludr's Gate.

- Bugs and some general unpolishness become much more obvious in Act 3. Luckily, Larian is actively working on ironing out everything and making the experience truly complete.

- There are some balance issues when it comes to combat, gear, and classes. But that’s also something that will be fixed over time.

- Inventory and companion managing is absolutely horrendous, by far the weakest spot of the game. It’s a nightmare when you try to juggle between characters, find and store items, etc. Recommend using modes for this.

- I personally don't like that almost every companion is player-sexual. It kinda kills their uniqueness and takes away from the immersion when they can all fall in love with you.

- The game should have some kind of a codex where it will store all books and notes that you find, info about characters you’ve met, info about the types of enemies you have encountered, etc.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 597,972 user reviews for this game are positive.",210 hour three month finally completed completionist slow like absorb world carefully slowly explore read couple time sheer complexity interconnected story dialogue outcome character faction simply unbelievable hat larian managing rich complex meaningful world hundred character dozen faction interesting group vast map abundance interesting location explore secret uncover completely nonlinear giving player opportunity pro model animation especially facial animation best add immersion no_matter important unimportant non controlled artificial superb voice acting love passion care importantly understanding character voice generally writing great successfully balance larian s_emphasizedignature humour silliness macabre serious tone world s_emphasizedtory diverse cast memorable companion agenda personality personal story major questlines miss single combat mostly fun rewarding reward tactical approach experimenting box encounter meaningful combat hand crafted questline location unique no_fillers padding dozen dozen interesting side story quest scale importance great design attention detail pure joy explore location memorable multilayered villain distinctive personality agenda amazing music borislav slavov kirill pokrovsky proud excellent implementation d_emphasized rule video con tempo varies early relationship companion developing extremely fast hand act dichotomy urgency task objective given non quest side story general stuff explore baludr bug general unpolishness obvious act luckily larian actively working ironing truly complete balance issue come combat gear class fixed inventory companion managing horrendous far weakest spot nightmare juggle character item recommend mode personally companion sexual kinda kill uniqueness take immersion fall love kind codex book note info character met info type enemy encountered

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"One of the best MMOs, period. Years ago, I played hundreds of hours of ESO on XBOX. After trying New World, I longed for a similar game where your character knew what swimming was and understood the concept of using your feet to run. So thanks to NW for getting me back into ESO. 

Pros:
- Combat is fast, fun, and engaging. 
- The game world is vast and beautiful with a delightful variety of locations and creature types
- Satisfying character builds with tons of potential configurations
- Interesting and varied quests tell stories instead of just having you gather X items or kill X enemies.
- Solid gathering and crafting features. 
- All the fun of an Elder Scrolls game and then some
- Your character knows how to run (unlike New World)
- Your character understands what swimming is (unlike New World)
- Your character can ride horses and other mounts (unlike New World)

Cons:
- Combat in the open world areas isn't very challenging. I can crush most enemies with just one ability even as a glass cannon. It feels like playing Diablo 3 when you're right on the verge of needing to up the difficulty level. It's still enjoyable unless you're really looking for a challenge.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"""Respawn’s Latest Attempt to Kill Their Own Game: Apex Legends Season 23 - The Ultimate Flop""

Today, Respawn has truly outdone themselves in their apparent quest to drive Apex Legends into the ground. With the release of Season 23, it feels like they’re not even trying to hide the fact that they want us to stop playing. Every update feels like another desperate attempt to push players away, and this season is the absolute pinnacle of bad decision-making.

First off, the new “content” they’re so proud of? It’s a recycled mess, forcing us into yet another season where we’re expected to slog through game modes and mechanics no one asked for. It’s as if Respawn is playing a twisted game, daring us to find the one redeeming quality in this absolute dumpster fire. Spoiler: there isn’t one.

They’ve introduced changes no one wanted, made tweaks that cater only to a small fraction of the player base, and the overall experience is now nothing short of torture. The new meta is awful, shoving players into uncomfortable playstyles, ruining previously beloved legends, and turning every match into a test of patience rather than skill. You think you loved your favorite legend? Not anymore. They’ve been nerfed to the point of being unusable, or worse—reworked beyond recognition.

And don’t even get me started on the matchmaking. Somehow, Respawn has managed to make it even more unbalanced, pitting you against squads that will wipe the floor with you in seconds, just to keep you hooked in a brutal loop of “maybe next time.” The “next time” is never coming, though, because the skill gaps in matches are wide enough to drive a truck through.

Meanwhile, server issues continue to plague every game. Lag spikes, crashes, and server drops are practically part of the gameplay experience at this point. It’s like Respawn wants you to disconnect just as you’re about to win. And what’s the support response? Silence. We’re talking about a developer that’s essentially given up on addressing any real problems in their game. Their idea of “fixes” is slapping a patch on it and calling it a day, ignoring glaring issues that have plagued Apex for seasons.

Oh, and the monetization? Even worse than before. They’re shamelessly charging exorbitant prices for low-quality skins that look like they were designed in five minutes. Respawn has made it crystal clear that they’re more interested in milking every last dollar from their player base than delivering a game that people actually enjoy. It’s predatory, and it’s pathetic.

In conclusion, if you’re still playing Apex Legends, Season 23 is your sign to stop. Respawn has transformed what was once a promising game into a miserable experience, seemingly designed to test the loyalty (or masochism) of its player base.

While it has some things in common with stardew valley, its closer to graveyard keeper with the player having a few quests to solve while progressing. Its worth it to explore a lot because there are secrets.
The game also has a balanced and robust economy. You can chose a proffesion in the start of the game wich will give you few quests to help you get started but its just faster progression(blacksmith, fishing, temple exploration etc).
You can progress any way you like if you follow the questline.

1203620,Enshrouded,"The game was an 8/10 for me in its current state. Needed more challenge in combat, more content as you get to end game builds and potentially some quality of life changes for certain class mechanics such as ammo switching (radial menu over mouse wheel perhaps).

I think with how they were at demo to what they are now is big progress, I believe they have an opportunity to nail this game type if they make a few game play corrections, both challenge wise and mechanically. its a game I will play again should the content grow and diversify. The quality of life things would be a nice touch but I would play again with them in their current state.

Really need some end game build content, maybe even some type wave defense on home tiles and/or dungeon based missions that are really challenging and scale with group sizing. Has a boatload of potential, I enjoyed the Battlemage gameplay on the first run, think I would change it up to tank should some of the additions I stated happen. Perhaps a rogue or ranger if not.

I'd suggest giving it a crack should you enjoy the survival craft genre, somewhat challenging with a great start to a game system. Few tweaks to improve game play experience and it is something to adore.

The world is big sure but it's more like a props for the story.
Most npc just walk back and forth with no activities with an exception 
of those npc at stores/stall and some minor npc doing random things.
Take out the story and you clearly cant do anything which is why you 
can't compare this to GTA and RDR.
In those game, the world have lore,secrets,random activities. 
You can do other sort of activities ,encounter weird things etc 

Don't expect immersion much in this game. 
Immersiveness is out of the picture. 

Don't get me wrong,I still enjoy it.
The story itself is good. Especially the interaction with Johnny. 
If you care about the story only, then yes the game should be fine. 

TLDR: Story driven RPG with big map, hollow world and dead npc

Is it bad? NO
Is it impressive? NO

I would rather rate this as A instead of S tier game.","Very Positive84% of the 693,658 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

230410,Warframe,"I know, I know. Another negative Warframe review from a salty player with lots of hours in the game. How original.

Look, you've probably heard plenty of crap about this game from other negative reviews, but this is just my two cents:

For the amount of time you put into this game to earn things, you could achieve so much more in other games.
For the amount of money you put into this game, you could gain so much more from other free-to-play titles.

But what is it recently that made me quit?

[h1] THE GRIND [/h1]
Well, a fair few months ago, when Vauban Prime came out, I took a ~8 month break from the game, because of how unbelievably grindy it got. DE (the developers) increased the resource cost of things astronomically - like how some resources can only be obtained during rare, limited-time missions (nitain extract) or rare resources that remove themselves from your inventory after just 24 hours (Argon Crystals).

[h1] CONTENT IMPLEMENTATION [/h1]
But it's okay, because DE releases fresh new content sometimes, right? Well, every time DE implements something, it's terribly implemented. Atrociously so. But sometimes DE comes back and revisits this content, sticks ""2.0"" at the end of the name, and treat it like a whole new thing. They might fix some issues, but introduce a slew of new problems.

An example of this is the ""focus"" system. Basically, without spoilers, you get certain types of XP for certain types of skill trees by using weapons or gear with a certain attatchment on them. When this was introduced, gaining ""focus"" points was ridiculously slow. After a while, DE responded to community complaints by advertising that they'd introduce a consumable that would appear on the map after certain time intervals, and give all players a 6x multiplier on their focus gains. Awesome, right?

What they really did was nerf how much Focus you get by making it an absolutely tiny fraction of what people were initially complaining about - then the 6x multiplier would only make up for the nerf. This is in the same update, mind you. And DE didn't communicate this at all.

And now they've moved on again, forgetting about the focus system, just like every other previously implemented system in the game.

[h1] WEAPON & GEAR BALANCE [/h1]
Update 18.13 introduced nerfs to warframes (exoskeletons that are essentially interchangable classes) that didn't deserve a nerf. Many warframes that previously filled niche purposes were suddenly completely useless or outdone by other warframes. Certain builds people had on their warframes were now irrelevant. It was a shit show. And DE left it like that.

But for the longest time, people had been asking DE to balance all weapons in the game. Because there are hundreds of them - and it's a mess. Some can instantly wipe out all high level enemies in the vicinity, others require constant firing for minutes on end just to take down the same enemy. It is the worst I've ever seen in any game.

But that's okay, because DE created a fix that came with update 19, otherwise known as The War Within. This fix would be known as...

[h1] RIVEN MODS [/h1]
Riven mods. Basically, these are meant to be how DE rebalances the weapons of Warframe. And it is just the worst thing I've ever seen be added to the game.

Basically, Riven mods are mods for your gear that make them better. And they can make them way better. The problem? This didn't just apply to the terrible weapons that needed rebalancing - this applied to all weapons. And this is meant to be the fix that rebalanced weapons. I cannot fathom the stupidity behind this decision. It's laziness and stupidity.

Want to rebalance all weapons in the game, just like the players asked for? Sweet! Players will now have to grind against a time-locked grind on sortie (daily) missions for a small chance at obtaining a Riven mod, which then requires player to complete another arbitrary task just to ""unveil"" the Riven mod and make it usable, and then the player is left in the hands of RNG on what weapon the Riven mod worked with.

That's right, Riven mods are locked to only working with ONE weapon. Just one. Out of hundreds. It could be something you don't even own. It could be for a useless weapon, and still not make it good enough to compete with the high-tier weapons, or just be further nerfs to what are already the best weapons in the game.

So what do these Riven mods do? [b] That is also left to RNG. [/b] These mods can do anything from giving a flat-out boost to damage, coming with useless buffs (adding additional % slash damage on a weapon that only 1% of it's damage as slash) or even nerfs, such as decreased damage and increased recoil.

Didn't like the way your Riven mod came out? You can reroll the traits it has with a whole new resource that requires a constant, conscious effort to grind, all while the cost for re-rolling your Rivens increases with every re-roll.

However, DE did make two fixes: they capped the resource increase for re-rolling Rivens to 3500 kuva, and made it so lesser-used weapons gain stronger buffs from Riven mods. But only after community outcry. Because the devs are so lazy, oblivious and moronic that it took the players say ""umm, buffing [b] ALL WEAPONS [/b] with rare mods doesn't fix the weapon balance issues"" for them to change anything. And when they did ""fix"" it, it barely made a difference.

[h1] THE LAST STRAW [/h1]
The Glast Gambit came out a few days before I wrote this review. With it, a new weapon was introduced - the Hema, and a new warframe - Nidus.

Now, what's great about some warframes is that you can get their parts in quests. Sure, these quests were super grindy, but it was better than the alternative - many warframes in the game can only be obtained by having boss enemies drop CERTAIN PARTS of CERTAIN WARFRAMES which requires credits, resources and TWELVE HOURS EACH TO BUIILD and THEN you may construct the warframe with the final stage of crafting - actually constructing the warframe. Which takes SEVENTY-TWO HOURS.

In quests, as you complete each grindy objective, you're rewarded with a part, which you craft - for credits, resources, and and a twelve hour wait. But it's better than having the part drop from a boss - where there is only an obscure chance that you get the part you want. This was the case with the warframe known as Chroma.

DE decided Chroma was clearly too easy to get, after a while, and decided to split up the pieces and making rewards for clearing different systems, sets of levels, and side objectives. Yep.

Now, the Glast Gambit rewards you with one piece of the Nidus warframe - the blueprint. Not other part. The other parts can only be obtained from a LOW DROP RATE from only EVERY FOURTH ROUND from a [b] new, grindy, repetitive game mode. [/b] That's right. You have a low chance every foruth round after much repitition on just one level - the only level to contain this new game mode - and play it over and over and over and over again until you get the warframe parts. Which then require twelve hours, some credits and some resources to complete. And then you may build the warframe - requiring a 72 hour wait.

Well, that's shit. So what about the new weapon, the Hema?

It requires mutagen samples. A lot. Mutagen samples are a very uncommon resource that can only be found in certain areas of the game, and [b] requires more mutagen  samples to research than all other weapons requiring mutagen samples to research combined. [/b] Now, you see, weapon research gets a bit cheaper when your clan has less players. So those clans dedicated to helping out new players? Fuck them. DE just shat on them. And you can only be in one clan at a time. So people are being mass-kicked from clans, and it's anarchy. And DE doesn't care. They want people spending real money to buy gear from them, and will encourage players to stab each other in the back to make a buck. What scum.

I'm done. I'm sad it came to this.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"While this game is fun, it's a low-hanging-fruit full of worms. A few developers have tried the 1 v Many asymmetrical slasher game to no success (Evolve, Friday the 13th), but finally Behaviour cracked the formula. It's like hide-and-seek meets freeze tag. Being the killer is great fun, and scratches a primal itch deep in my hunter brain. Outsmarting survivors, tracking hidden foes with rapidly fading clues, getting the perfectly timed stab, all are great fun. However, they are perhaps the least competent developer to make any game in general, let alone be responsible for the quintessential slasher simulator.

Behaviour's history as a developer is terrible, they make shovelware games based on cartoons and children's movies. They make the games that grandparents buy for their grandkids at christmas, fun for a minute because ""I love that cartoon, this game will be good"" but the kid never finishes the game because somewhere deep down they know it's not fun, even if they can't articulate why. So, a bit of speculation on my part: This game was originally supposed to be a horror-movie tie-in cash-grab, but the license fell through during development, so they hastily changed it from Licensed Killer to Similar-To-But-Legally-Distinct Killer. Amazingly, they made something pretty fun. It's a genuine wonder we haven't seen this before. As I mentioned, others have tried, but missed the mark. This hits the mark, but it's still just the developers responsible for 20 years of shovelware. As such, this game is made by amateurs.

Bugs, bugs, balance issues, and more bugs. Every single update comes with broken content, and breaks old content. The newest killer (The Twins) just doesn't work at all. Switching between The Twins will break the game. You'll go blind, or get stuck in place, or move slower than a snail, or clip through the floor, or lose the ability to switch back to the other twin. I saw every single one of those bugs in my first 2 matches with them. Oh, and they also managed to break the abilities of all the old killers at the same time. Last month there was a bug where the killer couldn't kill the survivors. The version of this game on the Switch had a bug where survivors couldn't run at full speed. There are spots in maps that will trap you in place until the game ends. These bugs are all completely game-breaking, and they're just the bugs from the past few months. If you go further back, you'll see more. A lot of them are really quite baffling. Updating one killer breaks another because they both shared code. Sometimes killers can't break obstacles, making survivors untouchable. Some killers had the ""kicking metal"" and ""kicking wood"" sounds mixed up. How do you miss that? One single test match would reveal that. The list goes on, and paints a picture of a development team with literally no testing process.

Balance issues. I mentioned these. I won't go into too much depth, but the developers are quite obviously unaware of how their game is played. Watching developer streams is like watching your little brother trying to play a video game. You'll shout at the screen ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING"" every 5 seconds. They'll say things like ""the statistics say this killer performs below-average, but we know the skill ceiling is high and good players do fine"" which is great, but in the very next breath say ""the statistics say this perk performs below-average, so we won't be nerfing it"" when the perk in question is ""you always know exactly where the killer is"". Slaves to math when it suits them, but enlightened on the lies of statistics when they want to be.

Most recently, the event that made me write this review: The Twins. As I mentioned, they just don't work. $5 for this killer and it breaks every time you try to use it. Worse yet, they are actively trying to police any and all conversation regarding the twins. The Twins are two characters: The adult female (Charlotte), and the tiny little baby (Victor) that lives inside a hole in her chest. Cool concept, but strangely enough we are not allowed to call Victor a baby. Twitch, discord, reddit, the forums, any platform where this game is discussed, you cannot call him a baby, you cannot refer to him as a baby, you cannot even allude to the fact that you cannot call him a baby. You will be deleted, kicked, banned, for referring to Victor as a baby. ""Why?"" Because the survivors can kick Victor. Thus, if he's a baby, the game ""encourages violence against children"", so he cannot be a baby. He is an ""adult"", despite being the size and age of an infant. Aside from the absolutely terrible and hypocritical logic (This is a game about murdering innocent people, but kicking the homicidal demon baby is encouraging violence?), it reveals a basic fact: Behaviour does not think. They don't think about anything, at all. How did this question never come up? How did they never realize that people would be making ""Kick the baby"" jokes? Why does the discord server have to ban every single person that says ""baby"" when there is an actual baby in the game? We cannot even discuss the actual game because the most common word to refer to the killer is forbidden. 

So, finally, we've found the issue with this game: This company does not think. They don't think about balance, they don't think about bugs, they don't think about their game, they don't think about us. If they were carpenters, I wouldn't live in their houses. If they were car manufacturers, they'd make exploding pintos. If they made guns, you'd be more likely to shoot yourself than your target. There isn't a single tester, or a single person with any common sense in a position of power. So while the game really is fun, I can't recommend giving these people money. It's terrible, it's buggy, and it's never getting better. Every day I pray that another company will do this better, but Behaviour already has all of the licenses, so the odds are slim.


I initially wrote this review from the perspective of someone who only played killer. Since then, I have played a bunch of survivor, and what can I say, except: holy crap this is horrifically unfun. Most of the game is holding down M1 while you watch TV in the background. The only ""fun"" part is being chased by the killer, but that's about 30 seconds of entertainment sandwiched in between 10 minutes of waiting. All killers run some overpowered build, or camp, or tunnel, or camp and tunnel, and generally just aren't good sports. Random teammates range from actually brain-dead to actively sabotaging you. The only thing that is even close to enjoyable is playing with a squad of 4 friends, but killers can smell fear, and they'll pick off the weakest link and tunnel him to death. Over, and over, and over. And once he's dead, the game is already over. The rest is just a clean-up simulator where everyone else pretends to try but really has already given up and started checking their phone, basically wasting everyone's time. I absolutely do NOT recommend this game as survivor. Under no circumstances should you imagine it will be fun or enjoyable.

Also, this newest update, the Resident Evil chapter, HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. AHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. AHAHAHAHAHAHAH. The map is broken on release? You can't play it for 2 weeks?

394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"Hearts of Iron IV places you in control of a nation during the build-up to the greatest conflict mankind has ever seen. At release there are two scenarios available - 1936 and 1939. The latter drops you right into the thick of it at the outbreak of war while the former allows you to prepare your chosen nation for a number of years in advance. There are seven major factions: America, Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy, Russia and Germany, each with their own special traits, bonuses and penalties. Players who like to root for the underdog will be pleased to know that Paradox have lifted the restriction on what minor nation you can play as. From Liberia and Albania to Brazil and Portugal - every nation on Earth is playable (though whether they’ll survive long is another matter altogether).


The running of your nation is done by your representative political party, which can be moderated by governmental decrees. Your choice of political representative is by no means static - put the right policies into place and you can overthrow it with a stance of your choice. I’ve played as a communist France and a fascist Great Britain and even almost managed to create a democratic Germany (thus negating the entire war). What surprised me is that each of these eventualities has its own tailor-made notifications, events and consequences. I’ve gone through multiple campaigns turning countries into communist or fascist states just to see their flags change (pro tip: check out the badass communist America flag when you can). To further these crazy ambitions, Paradox allows the player to uncheck a ‘historical reality’ box on start-up that lifts the restrictions on the AI as to what decisions it makes, giving it free reign to create a true sandbox of ‘what if?’ questions.

2408820,Luma Island,"Very addictive and well-rounded in most aspects. I'm only 14 hours in and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface - about half of that time was solo, and the other half multiplayer. I appreciate that you and your friends can either team up to work on certain tasks like the mines or dungeons, or just go off and do your own thing with your profession(s). There's always something to do and new areas to explore. 

Like others have said, it's pretty important to upgrade your tools and weapon EARLY on or the game may feel a bit sluggish and tasks will be very time consuming. Thankfully this mechanic is unlocked immediately at the start so you can just go ham on the mines and get the materials you need to upgrade things quickly, and there is no stamina or sleep requirement that will limit what you can do in a day. 

I do hope they flesh out a few more areas or add other mechanics with future updates - like others have said, romancing would be great. I'd also like to see better combat but maybe that'll come later on with further Whip upgrades; blocking would be huge, especially with how fast the enemies can be. 

Anyway, in its current state this is a really fun and cozy game that's well worth the price point if you're considering picking it up.","Mostly Positive77% of the 1,313 user reviews for this game are positive.",addictive rounded aspect 14 hour barely scratched surface half solo half mode multiple player interact compete real appreciate friend certain task mine dungeon profession area explore others pretty important upgrade tool weapon early bit sluggish task consuming thankfully mechanic unlocked immediately ham mine material upgrade thing quickly no_stamina sleep requirement limit hope flesh area add mechanic future update others romancing great combat maybe whip upgrade blocking huge especially fast enemy anyway state fun cozy worth price considering picking

2582560,EA SPORTS™ Madden NFL 25,"[b]For the first time in [u]three[/u] years... I'm [i]not[/i] happy....[/b]
A bit of context...  I'm an overseas NFL football fan from the Netherlands. 3 years ago I grabbed myself Madden '22 and had an amazing time; it even helped me discover the NFL gamepass and I've been following the season ever since. Madden '23 and '24 followed and even though some weren't perfect I always had a good time playing and could also recommend the game to others.

This year though... not so much. There are too many problems haunting this title, and even though I got to play the game 3 days before its official release... none of the problems which I've encountered and which got confirmed (!) have been addressed, let alone fixed. Now an easy 3 weeks later.

[h1]The good[/h1]
The new presentation and overal look of the game is defintiely a step up I think. When you start the game it truly feels as if you're stepping into a ""[i]Official presentation of the National Football League...[/i]"", even the music matches. And the game has 49'er vibes all over, I really love it.

The menu has been redesigned and is now shown as a column on the left side of the screen, making the game look more seriously and less, well, ""arcadish"". Not that there's anything wrong with that of course.

As one could expect we get all the good stuff which we came to expect... franchise mode, Ultimate Team, training options and quick play to name but a few.

[h1]The bad[/h1]
And unfortunately it's here where things immediately start to fall apart. I play with a Steam controller, yet for some dumb reason Madden '25 insists that I have [u]two[/u] controllers installed instead of one. The bizarre thing though is that this [i]only[/i] happens within quick play, when I try to swap my controller or when I mess around in other game modes: no problem. But in quick play I now have 3 controlling devices: 2 controllers and my mouse + keyboard. It's totally insane. 

Not to mention problematic because this actually prevents me from starting a game against the computer; because the game insists that the 2nd controller (which is basically the same I was already using) needs to be used to select the other team, but if I do that I'll end up controlling both teams using 1 controller. And that doesn't work out too well :P  Some people claim that you need to disable ""Steam input"" from the game properties but that doesn't do anything for me. Instead... if I play with my Steam controller turned off and the input settings turned off then the game still insists I have a controller installed. Which I now somehow control with my keyboard?

[b]Game refuses to complete several training drills[/b]
One of the first things I do with a new Madden game is hop into the training options in order to refresh my experience with the controls. This is especially fun because if you manage to complete several so called ""drill sections"" then you'll get rewarded with a few bonusses for Ultimate Team, which is a game mode I really enjoy to play with. [i]Unfortunately[/i] the game plain out [b]refuses[/b] to acknowledge the completion of several of these drills. Drills across several sections, which is a [b]huge[/b] problem because only a fully completed section counts towards those UT rewards. In the first section only 1 drill is broken (""Catching mechanics""), in the second section I managed to come across [u]four[/u] drills which wouldn't complete, not even with a perfect score!

What the heck?!!

And these mishaps surface all over the place...  when I check the game settings then I get asked every so many times if I want to ""[i]Reset my settings[/i]"", this would reset all my custom options to the default settings. Note: all I'm doing is click ""RB"" in order to move to the next settings tab. It makes absolutely no sense at all.

[h1]The ugly[/h1]
The gameplay itself is also [i]seriously[/i] compromised. When I press 'a' to snap then I expect a snap to happen, not me having to wait even more seconds before something finally happens. Things like...  players running from left to right (or vice versa) while I never asked them to do so and although it shouldn't happen.. this is actually delaying my play somehow. It makes no sense.

In previous games we were granted an actual glimpse into the official team playbooks...  if you (re)played an official game and checked out the ""coach suggestions"" you would more than often see an extra marker which indicated [i]actually used & preferred[/i] team strategies. It actually followed the general teams strategy. Oh, and for the record: this also applied to upcoming games, so it wasn't something that merely got added in later. Well, that's now apparently gone.

Another major issue for me...  Madden has always been a solid combination of gameplay and [i]presentation[/i]. The atmosphere of the game has always been superb, when you play a game and you hear the crowd and the commentators and what not... it really feels like you're actually there.

Yah, so, like... why can't you hear [b]any[/b] of the referrees anymore?  I would understand if this would sporadically happen because.. it sometimes also happens during real games; which is when the commentators really should be earning their pay. But ...  in Madden '25 this is happening [i]all the time[/i]. I've played a ton of games already and each and every time you can barely hear the referee... if the commentators are also talking you can't hear him at all anymore!

[b]This game is broken[/b]
I'm sorry to say, but that's honestly my conclusion. If I can't even start a quick game using my Steam controller in a normal way...  then how else would you call it? If the settings want to reset themselves for no reason at all, when the game refuses to acknowledge you succesfully completing challenges...  

And IMO it's a darn shame, because it could have been so much better.

427520,Factorio,"Easy to pick up, difficult to master, Factorio is a sort of base-building/tower defense/puzzle game all wrapped into one coherent concept. You explore, you build, you acquire new resources, you develop new technologies, and you protect your shiny belongings from the ever-present horde of bad things that want to destroy it.

No specific thing in Factorio is really complicated, it's the interacton between structures and the scale that really make it shine. Factorio lets you do a whole lot of creative stuff using simple building blocks and logic tools. The graphics aren't amazing, but they are effective at displaying what they need to in a game that could easily get cluttered with too much information.

It's also moddable, if you start to get bored with the vanilla game you are still just scratching the surface of what you can do with Factorio.

The steam integration isn't perfect, but it's still early access and being steadily developed.

If you like base building and tech games with epic scale, you will probably enjoy Factorio.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 156,951 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

2379780,Balatro,"Balatro is one of my new favorite games of all time. I am nowhere near done playing this one, despite 100%ing everything in the game except for grinding the Gold Stake difficulties; I'll be doing that for many months to come, and even after I'm done with that I won't be surprised if I come back for even more.

As for my actual thoughts, this is, no exaggeration, the perfect roguelike experience for me. Every single time you start up a run, it is a completely different game. There is so much content, so many different combinations of things you can do. From 15 decks with 8 difficulties each, 150 unique Jokers to cheat your way through poker, nearly 30 different bosses, and 20 unique and difficult challenges flipping some of the mechanics of the game on their heads, this game is packed to the brim with addicting gameplay. Even compared to Slay the Spire, the gold standard for deckbuilder roguelikes, this game has so much to do.

My absolute favorite part of the experience, especially compared to something like StS, is just how fun it is to get something going. You don't need to know too much about all of the different Jokers available or card variations to deduce some insane synergies. Almost all of my runs started with a Joker that I hadn't started with before, and I tried to build everything around it, which was incredibly easy to do due to all of the different combos. Flushes are easy and consistent, straights are a bit harder but satisfying to pull off, high card decks with a lot of planet upgrades and steel cards are so much fun, and I love the secret hands like 5 of a kind and flush five. Everything feels viable given enough skill and luck, which I certainly can't say about other roguelikes I've played. I love pulling something off with a Joker that I saw in the shop on a previous run and thought ""there's no way that could ever be good"" and then it takes me to the end game.

My other favorite part of this game: endless mode. Sometimes in Slay the Spire, I would have an absolutely insane deck, crush the heart in 4 turns, and then just have to start from the beginning again, when I just wanted to keep using that deck. Well, Balatro just has that baked in, making runs feel so much more exhilarating. Sure, the ""final boss"" is on ante 8, but ante 12 ramps up to 300 million points, which feels much more threatening a lot of times. My highest score happened in ante 17, past the SECOND ""final boss,"" which involved numbers so large that scientific notation was required to display them. Every time you think you've blown the game wide open, it throws another insane milestone at you, which I absolutely love.

If I had to complain about anything, it would be the hardest difficulties and challenges. Most of the challenges I found very fun, but I spent way too long on the final challenge: Jokerless. It felt far too luck based and unfair, but it was still addicting and kinda fun to grind. My run that ended up beating the challenge got to ante 13, with a bunch of red sealed, polychrome glass 5s of spades, which was scoring billions by the end game. All that with none of the 150 Jokers in the game gave me a true appreciation for how well balanced this game is, and how, as I claimed before, everything is viable. I am hoping that going through that challenge makes the rest of the gold stake difficulties feel a little bit more manageable, because the first one I did was a grind fest that was very hard to get off the ground. 

I'm glad that this game is gaining the traction it deserves, and I really hope that LocalThunk, the SOLO DEVELOPER (HOW) of this game, continues to make great work. The patches and demos and community surrounding this game has been incredible, and I just want to continue playing Balatro forever now. Even if Persona 3 Reload and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth have the greatest stories, visuals, and gameplay of all time, I think that this is my personal game of the year, and in my top 5 games of all time.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 47,019 user reviews for this game are positive.",favorite game nowhere near despite 100 ing except repeatedly performing action gain resource gold stake difficulty month surprised actual thought no_exaggeration perfect roguelike single completely different different combination thing 15 deck 8 difficulty 150 unique joker cheat poker nearly 30 different boss 20 unique difficult challenge flipping mechanic head packed brim addicting compared slay spire gold standard deckbuilder roguelikes absolute favorite especially compared sts fun different joker available card variation deduce insane synergy run started joker started tried build incredibly easy due different combo flush easy consistent straight bit harder satisfying pull high card deck planet upgrade steel card fun love secret hand 5 kind flush five feel viable given skill luck certainly roguelikes love pulling joker saw shop thought no_way good take favorite endless mode slay spire insane deck crush heart 4 turn beginning wanted deck baked run exhilarating final bos ante 8 ante 12 ramp 300 million point feel threatening time highest score happened ante 17 past final bos involved number large scientific notation required display blown wide open throw insane milestone love complain hardest difficulty challenge challenge found fun spent long final challenge jokerless far luck based unfair addicting kinda fun grind ended beating challenge ante 13 bunch red sealed polychrome glass 5 spade scoring billion 150 joker gave appreciation balanced claimed viable hoping challenge make rest gold stake difficulty bit manageable grind fest hard ground glad gaining traction deserves hope localthunk solo developer continues great patch demo community surrounding incredible continue forever persona 3 reload final fantasy vii rebirth greatest story visuals personal top 5 game

230410,Warframe,"""Would you recommend this game to other players?"" - After 2000 hours, no. The game has been available for ten years, every argument pro and contra has already been made. So for brevity's sake I'll reduce it to those four points most important to me:

1) The random number generator day-one frustrations are the same on day-one-hundred and day-one-thousand. Yes, you don't have to pay for anything with real money, but you pay with your time. DE once stated that they never wanted it to be a slot machine, but that's what it is. The majority of time is spent on you pulling the lever over and over (most prominent example being Rivens). That is the core mechanic. Not jumping and shooting, but chance.

2) The incremental release ""game as a service"" business model means you cannot ever know what you're getting, and the direction the game is developed towards is infamously inconsistent. My read has always been that this was intended to keep the developers engaged, so instead of them leaving to work on a spaceship game, or a Souls-like, or something with mechs, DE just squeezed a poorly-made version of those other games in here. I understand that Warframe as-is has successfully financed the company, and that the following would have been unwise from a business standpoint for DE, but tying up the game a few years ago and instead starting clean with a ""Warframe 2"" that has a clearly defined scope would have made for better products. Warframe does one thing very well, and a million things poorly. As another consequence of its historical growth, the game is full of (semi-)abandoned or just poorly aged content, in some cases so crude that you can't show it to anyone because it makes the whole game look bad. The years of difference are painfully visible. Players engaging with new content first (e.g. Duviri wyrm boss) and later encountering old content (e.g. Sergeant, Tyl Regor, Phorid, etc....) must feel like they've accidentally stepped into a different game - essentially, they do. There's no incentive for DE to invest time into reworking this old content, so there's a built-in ""culture shock"".

3) The core gameplay soon becomes completely monotonous because a) waves of uniform enemies run towards you in a straight line, to ineffectively fall over dead, and b) because most missions are not structured - there's just randomly connected rooms and hallways, with enemies spawning from thin air, and once you have pressed the button you are supposed to press or killed enough enemies to reach a certain counter, you just run towards the end of the random chain of rooms to finish the mission. But for a few exceptions (like Kuva Fortress Assault), most missions have no story, no stakes, no structure.

4) The story as of recent years. This is what did it for me. Warframe had sparks of brilliance when it comes to sifting stories out of the rich and engaging lore they have built up over the years. For example, the twist introduced in The Second Dream works incredibly well. The narrative highlight for me was The Sacrifice, genuinely one of the most satisfying stories I've seen in a videogame. But that was released in 2018. Beginning with The New War, it all crashed and burned. Using ""parallel dimension to the rescue"" (Eternalism), ""none of it is real you just made it up, none of this matters"" (Duviri), teasing big events just to skip over them entirely (New War), and inconsistently reintroducing characters (Erra, Vor) has made the narrative so thin and weak, that there's no clear threat, no clear motivation, just a tangled mess of storylines that slapped against the void-wall at full speed.

Warframe is a huge sunk cost fallacy. There's a kernel of a fantastic action game with a grand sci-fi story in there, but it's buried under layers and layers of grind, distractions, meaningless time-sinkholes, and unfinished dead ends. That's the most frustrating part about it - everyone who gets deeply into it will have dozens of ideas on how to fix it - because it's obvious that it needs fixing, and that there's something there worth saving.","Very Positive87% of the 598,811 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Before I start with my review, I just want to give a general warning to all those who are considering purchasing this game. It is a major time sink, at least in my opinion. The game is extremely rewarding if you are the type of player who can stick with it in the long run. Rewards, such as being able to own a house, and having all classes fully levelled, are ultimately tied to total game time. The more you play, the more substantial these rewards. If you are not the type of person who can commit to 10-15 hours a week, year-long, then you may find yourself not getting value for money. 

The Pros:

+ Great Graphics. It's not next-gen, but the game can look seriously beautiful at times

+ Near infinite levels of content. I'm not kidding. Every patch brings more content to a game that has a Main Story that will take you about 250 hours to complete. If you want to level all classes, get all the best items, and do everything, I would put total time to completion at 1,500+ hours. 

+ Helpful Community. I have never really experienced unusual amounts of toxicity. You might get a bit of it happening in the higher level raids, but nothing infuriating. Free Companies (Guilds) usually have veteran players who will help you clear content, advise you on how to gear up etc.

+ Excellent Music. If you have played other FF iterations, you know that the music is fantastic most of the time. Well, this is one of those times. Fairly diverse soundtrack. Not an expert, so won't comment more on it. 

The Cons:

- The Subscription: If I must be honest, I don't like it. Many argue that the subscription is justified by the hard work of the devs. This is true, but the model here can be seriously frustrating. The way the game is designed, you have to keep paying the subscription if you want to retain the rewards. An example of this is housing. For many people, owning a house is the pinnacle of their RPG careers, and there is enormous satisfaction in owning one in FFXIV. The problem is, if you are not active for 45 days, the game will put your land up for auction, at which point another player will snap it up, and you will get 90% of the sale value. So, if you want to retain posession of your home, you got it; pay up. ""But I don't want to be forced to pay a subscription for a game I don't play regularly"" is the dilemma I am sure many players face. The subscription model limits your choices. 

- Time Sink: I bought this game when I was in high school. Back then, I had enough time to play this game. I am in university now, and I don't have that kind of time anymore. This means I am always behind others who can invest that time. Now, this is a basic element of all MMORPGs, so I am sure I sound stupid. BUT, the time sink in this game is especially potent. Missing a couple patches is going to put you back 100+ hours, and playing catch-up from that point on is going to become more and more frustrating. 

So, if you can wrap your head around the fact that the subscription model is somewhat prohibitive, and that the game expects you to be a frequent player, you will find one of the most fulfilling games on the market.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"For context, I played the campaign to finish on veteran and have played a few hours of MP.  

Overall:
Graphics took a very nice leap forward, character movement is smooth and fluid, gun animations are somewhat realistic but the mechanics are great. Finding balance on different weapon platforms so far. Audio is outstanding- again like MW 2019.

Campaign:
Excellent, IMO is not better than the first MW campaign (2007) with some of those classic and reminiscent missions, but it is good. I have played every COD campaign and this is up there with some of the best. This is also the first one where I felt like I had to watch the cut scenes, very movie like and very cool. They did an excellent job dropping them in there to piece the missions together and to make you feel really ""in,"" and part of, the story. 

I will say, Veteran felt like the easiest its been on any campaign thus far. Don't know if I magically am smarter and better (doubt it) or they made things a tad easier (more likely). 

Verdict- Play it, watch the cut scenes- enjoy the story you're being told- you wont be disappointed.

Multiplayer:
Great- very fun to play. Much different that MW 2019 so do not buy this with the expectation that it is the same or built upon. This game went for a slower pace and more realistic feel.  Read that again.....I personally love it, I enjoy Mil sims (not this that is one) but COD moved in that direction ever so slightly. What do I mean by that ?

The basics- movement speed is slower. Ive always hated how for a majority of COD's, movement speed reigned king. Oh your 15 years old and had 25 monsters energies in 2 hours? Awesome ! You can move around the map at the speed of light shredding players with your sub machine gun or melee weapon. Not in this COD ! It stops here. 

Grenades and snipers- if you enjoy sniping youll be happy to hear that COD listened to the MSGA crowd (make sniping great again). 95% of the time its a 1 hit kill from what Ive experienced. Grenades are now pretty useful and more realistic where you can get a decent amount of kills per match throwing them in ""hot lanes,"" ones with a lot of enemy traffic. 

Maps- so far so good. They feel bigger and more complex. That means more places to hide ( a campers dream !) but more places to surprise your enemy. It feels weird being able to vault more things and do more climbing in this COD but its a nice change of pace. Will you use it more often to regular gameplay? No probably not, but it doesn't take away from the experience at all, it only further adds to the realism COD MW2 is going for. 

Gunsmith- Absolutely amazing. The best part of the the multiplayer experience so far. There feels like an endless amount of attachments (their basically is...). You start with the ""base"" gun in a weapons family tree. For instance, once the M4 assault rifle is leveled up enough you unlock a new marksmen rife and a new LMG. You use these enough, you unlock a new short, SMG M4 (the honey badger for those who know) and the finally the M16. this is a new spin on things, much different then the hard unlock at X,Y,Z level up. 

For the first time ever you are able to tweak the bonus's an attachment gives you. This tuning tool is unlocked when a weapon level is maxed out. This essentially provides infinite combinations of any given weapon, don't like the ADS? lets boost it, dont like how inaccurate it is? we can fix that. A very very big leap forward in COD weapon customization. Do I think some weapons will be cracked this way? Yes it always happens, lets see what creative insane combos the community comes up with this time....

Verdict- Real COD multiplayer is back baby ! None of this vanguard or black ops garbage. Its different, its fun and its tuned more to your ability to get on target and hit accurate shots. May the better gun fighter win is motto here. If you are looking to dominate because you have your sensitivity turned all the way up and 18 red bulls in the system, sorry, this COD has essentially nerfed you.  

Final word- Buy this COD ! its the best in years, and so far better than MW 2019 for a multitude of reasons.

1401590,Disney Dreamlight Valley,"This game is one of my favourite games of all time but I regret it. I've logged a lot of hours, and will probably continue doing so but at great cost. This game cost me $100 to support it. I was aware of the introduction to the premium shop but I was unaware of the false promises of the devs. A quest was released for $20 which takes about 2 hours of overall play time to finish. The devs have promised that gameplay would not be locked behind a paywall but they not only broke that promise, they charged $10 an hour for players that have all paid to support this game. The prices in the premium shop are far higher than most other games of this genre and despite a petition and constant complaints on their socials, they have stayed completely silent, ignoring the people that have paid to test this game, which is already greedy of the company. There are so many game breaking bugs that half the player base can't even play the game. This is another promise broken by the devs. They said that they would prioritise game play and clean user experiences over earning money but their game is broken, their customer service is atrocious and they've ignored everything I've ever sent them requesting aid for bugs. It's a really great game but the company's greed is running it into the ground before it has even released. The company has lost the goodwill of the players and people are leaving in droves. I will never buy another game run by gameloft, I wish I didn't buy this one.

     You would think that for as many hours I have played this game that I would fully recommend it, but I don't, really. I bought the cheapest version, and refuse to spend anymore money on it. I just save my moonstones from blue chests to spend on the events. Speaking of which, I used to get 2 blue chests a day, but for the longest time now, I only get one per day.
     At first it's a lot of fun, collecting characters, critters, clothing, etc., but it really just gets tedious after awhile. I have to turn off all the voices and sounds because those get annoying really fast. The quests are all just fetch quests. 
     The thing I enjoy the most is changing my wardrobe, but even that gets old. 
     Decorating my house is okay, but you can't really interact with things. As a long time player of the Sims, I wish I could do more with my house and the items in it. 
     I've played so long that there is rarely anything new in Scrooge's shop, and when there are things, they are often just stuff I can make myself in the customization area - things like different colored head wraps and turbans, or tee shirts with motifs I could make myself. 
     I like the new Dream snaps event, because it is a good way to get more moonstones. I also liked the Potato quest to get the rainbow fox.
     Speaking of critters, I have collected almost all of them, but there are a few rare ones that only show up once in awhile, and  sometimes even after feeding them their favorite food, I still don't get to collect them, so I don't know if that's some kind of bug or what. Edit: Apparently you need to feed some of the critters more than once, but who knows how many times. So that makes it really hard to collect the ones that only show up once a week.
     I am not a fan of the in game clock because sometimes the only time I have to play is at night, at it's so dark in-game that it is really hard to see anything. I don't really like when it's foggy, either, for the same reason. Edit: I found that in the graphics setting, it is possible to offset the time to combat playing in the dark, so that helps. In in-game clock remains, but at least I can see what I'm doing. Now they just need an option to turn off the grass.
     I do like that it's controller friendly, because I play on PC with a controller, but I do find that setting up furniture and decorations is a little easier with a keyboard and mouse. 
     There have been some bugs in the game, but the devs seem to correct those pretty quickly, and usually they will give some sort of compensation. 
     After you've collected pretty much everything, there isn't really much to do in the game anymore. I log into it each day just to see if there's anything new in Scrooge's shop (usually not), and to find the blue chest. Other than that, I just wait for a new event to come up. 
     I think it would be nice to be able to make some of the characters stay in their houses. I don't like some of them, and wish they weren't wandering around all the time and talking to me if I get too close to them.","Very Positive91% of the 16,111 user reviews for this game are positive.",6 10 hour recommend bought cheapest version refuse spend anymore save moonstone blue chest spend event speaking 2 blue chest longest per fun collecting character critter clothing get tedious awhile turn voice sound annoying fast quest fetch quest enjoy changing wardrobe get old decorating house okay interact thing long sims wish house item long rarely scrooge s_emphasizedhop thing stuff customization thing different colored wrap turban tee shirt motif dream snap event good moonstone liked potato task objective given non rainbow fox speaking critter collected rare one awhile feeding favorite food collect s_emphasizedome kind bug apparently feed critter know time make hard collect one week not_a fan clock play night s_emphasizedo dark hard foggy found graphic setting possible offset combat dark help in_emphasized clock remains turn grass controller friendly play pc controller setting furniture decoration easier keyboard mouse bug correct pretty quickly usually sort compensation collected pretty anymore log scrooge s_emphasizedhop usually not_and blue chest wait event nice able character stay house wish wandering talking close

2878980,NBA 2K25,"Just avoid the online stuff, it's pure cancer. Play MyNBA Eras, it's by far the best mode. Want to recreate Jordan's dominance in the '90s, make it even crazier, or maybe prevent him from winning with Utah Jazz and the beautiful duo of Stockton and Karl Malone? Want to play the 76ers of Julius Erving and Moses Malone in the mid '80s and stop the Lakers - Celtics dominance? Maybe you want to convince the mediocre Bulls team to trade their exciting rookie in '84 and create an alternative reality where the '90s Bulls never existed? Or maybe you want to actually win an NBA title with that mediocre Bulls team in the '80s with just prime Jordan (with Hall of Fame difficulty lmao)? 

You could also try to trade Charles Barkley in '92 when he becomes a free agent and make an insane trio of Jordan - Pippen - Barkley (you'll probably need to trade half of your team to just manage the salary cap hahaha)

Or play as Allen Iverson in early 2000's and actually win a title against the mighty Lakers' duo of Shaq and Kobe? Or more recently, stop Steph Curry from dominating? (impossible honestly lol)

And yes, some rosters in some eras are not 100% complete, but you can load custom rosters made by the community and you'll have a greater experience (notably Charles Barkley and Blake Griffin are missing in the official roster due to some licensing issues). 

All in all, just this mode is fantastic honestly, no sports game comes close to recreating a historical era so well. It's quite immersive, including rule changes that actually happened in real life, teams relocating and actual historical drafts (witness a rookie Shaq, Kobe, Duncan, Iverson, McGrady, Irving coming into the league) and most importantly, team tendencies and styles being so different — if you play ball in the '80s era, there's almost no 3's, the game is slower, more inside baskets and intense defense and closer game; in the '90s there's some 3's being thrown but they are almost negligible compared to the current era, the pace though ramps up compared to the '80s. And the current era is just splashing 3's most of the time lmao which can be annoying but it's also much harder on defence in my opinion. Players are so well-rounded in the current era it's actually insane, before you had just a few well-rounded players and it was mostly about role specialists. Now you can have a center like Jokic that can do basically anything. 

Just having this sandbox of options is fantastic and worth getting the game. If you actually play like real basketball with pick and roll and calls (and broadcast camera) it's basically watching real ball, it can get very immersive. And again, I just don't care about online, tried MyCarreer a little and all the cutscenes and the low rating of your player (incentivizing you to buy currency with real money) is just cringe as hell, so I just avoid it. 

Pro tip: if you want to ""simulate"" a MyCareer like gameplay without all the predatory stuff just turn on the ""player lock"" setting and set it to a specific position (PG if you want to play Iverson in the 2000's 76ers, for example), it can get a bit annoying when subs are automatically done as you'll basically be forced to play another player temporarily, but you can manage that with manual subs. This way you can have a ""MyCareer"" without the flashy stuff and cutscenes that I mostly don't care about. Also, playing as a historical player is much more immersive than a random custom player you generated, but that may be just my preference.

You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/S7rSgub_1bw

If you ever wanted to be a paranormal investigator like on Ghost Hunters or Paranormal State, but for real instead of those grifters, then this is the game for you. Even though it is in Early Access and buggy at the moment, there's enough here to make for a very memorable and spooky experience. 

This game is definitely geared for online coop play, however, you can play solo. You'll have take on different jobs where you go to different sites and investigate several different paranormal entities. You'll have tools like an EMF meter, or UV lights, or spirit boxes. 

There's a surprising amount of depth to this game as you try to uncover the mysteries of each job. You'll also have some side tasks to accomplish for extra money and experience, such as taking a photo of the paranormal entity or get the freezing temperature checked. The locations can be pretty dark, but this game does a nice job with the use of light and shadows and strange sounds all around. There's not a lot of jump scares, instead this game relies on the slow building of tension. Of course, if you're not careful, it could be the death of you.

The game is running on the Unity Engine. I was usually getting a steady 90 frames per second on my 1060 GTX. There is full locomotion plus smooth turning available, along with teleportation. Unfortunately, the locomotion was a bit too slow for my taste. I also experienced an issue where my teleportation stopped working. Also, my turning would intermittently stop working as well.

I also experienced several connection issues. Even when I did connect to an online group, I would get kicked out of the group most of the time almost immediately upon joining. The good news is that there are a lot of people online for this game, although many are Non-VR. I also experienced several freezes at the loading screens where I would have to manually quit the game to get it work properly again.

Despite all the issues I experienced, I still recommend this game. It was a blast to play when it worked properly. This is already one of the better VR horror experiences and might even be the definitive horror experience in VR once all the bugs are smoothed out and the gameplay is polished up. This is a must buy for any VR horror fan. 

[b]Rate 7/10. Buggy game, but it is in Early Access. I had fun & it got me scared. I already feel like I got my money's worth. [/b]

I don't usually repeat games, but I've played this one twice, and have almost gotten the platinum trophy on it. 
I paid full price for the deluxe edition of this game, and so far it is worth every bit I have paid for it. 

Only downsides may be lack of replayability, and build variety, by second playthrough there are two, maximum three builds that wreck everything, anything else you use is just for fun. The game is really nice sure, but the second time over, the charm isn't the same anymore. The boss fights are so well made however that I couldn't pass a single one, not even the optional ones because of how much fun it is.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 732,771 user reviews for this game are positive.",best game long graphic gorgeous amazing combat fluid give lot option usually repeat game twice gotten platinum trophy paid price deluxe edition far worth bit paid downside lack replayability build variety playthrough maximum three build wreck else fun nice charm t_emphasizedhe anymore bos fight pas single not_even optional one fun

230410,Warframe,"Warframe in it's simplest parts is a amalgamation of Mass Effect 3 shooting, old school Diablo looting / hoarding, Free Running / Parkour, and freaking space ninjas!  Did I say Space Ninjas?  It's really really fun living out your childhood dreams of dropkicking baddies in the face while throwing stars at a secondary target.  If you ever wanted to be Bruce Lee; this is your game.  

It has boss fights with actual strategies, plenty of unlocks to find, lots of socializing for those that want to chit chat as much as kick things in the derriere.  The new weapon damage system gives hardcore mathematicians something to theory craft about, but is as easy as Paper, Rock, Scissors in it's simplest form.  Weapon choice is varied in feel thus you many choices to find the perfect weapons that suit your playstyle.  

Alternative playstyles such as Stealth plays a prominent role in Warframe.  You can absolutely wreck targets from the shadows!  You can choose between Support frames, Offensive frames, and Defensive frames for a mission.  Invite your buddies or grab some guys / gals from the recruiting social channel.  If you want to meet new people, join a completely randomized group of 4 players hell bent on conquering space!  

You have multiple saved loadout slots for free!  Digital Extremes doesn't really nickle and dime you in this game like other F2P games.  They do need to make a profit so they sell cosmetic items, XP boosters, warframe slots, weapon slots, and materials for those too busy to go fight.  Nearly everything in the game can be acquired by doing fun events that last nearly a week so you can choose when to partake of them.  They give away the best guns for free during those events.  

They have a XP system that also nets you some of the best guns in the game for just running missions to collect loot and crafting that loot into weapons and warframes.  Leveling up those frames and weapons gives you the XP necessary to unlock the sickest weapons!  This is a Play to Win game where you can buy materials to craft if you are impatient, but you can just play more and get it.  Isn't playing the game the purpose of it?  Of course you can buy completed Warframes for real money, but spending a couple hours of your time you can get the same thing for free.  Of course you still need to buy the inventory slot for that frame to use it.  At less than $1 a slot, no subscription fee, and no initial game purchase, this sounds like the steal of the century.  And you don't have to buy them and still have fun, but it's nice to be able to support the developer for their time and effort.

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"Well, where to start?
First: Warzone, started to get bad when they changed the game map, leaving it worse than it was at the beginning of it, but it still had fun gameplay and few bugs, in addition to being optimized in a much more decent way than the original. current.
Second: The previous game started with skin trends, which was cool, because in the first game, the skins were well done and fun, for the most part, the weapons chosen for the skins were weapons that were actually usable and didn't have as many Pro Team packages.
Third: The weapons in the game really had correct damage, compared to this one, in the first warzone, you created the class with that weapon and it killed, today you create the class, one hour it kills, another time, it seems that it only shoots beans , it doesn't even kill a chicken, the weapon categories are unbalanced, the players' vests have become infinite, unless you get one of the crappy weapons that are practically insta kill, but not usable in practical terms for the game.
Fourth: the previous game had problems with cheaters, yes it did, however, there you saw the anti-cheat system working, in this one, in addition to the game being infested with cheaters, if you report it, you can end up being banned for ""false report"" , that is, the developer itself does this so that no one else reports the suspects, so as not to have the trouble to keep checking, at least that's what it looks like.
Fifth: Many, like me, spent a lot of money on skins, etc, on the other game, and what does the developer do? Throw everything in the trash, if you want something, buy it again in the current game, so far so good, it's the market, they have to make money, etc, so make decent skins, same complaint as in the second topic...
Sixth: Are we playing COD, or are we playing Fortnite, or something like that? Call of Duty is a franchise that I've been playing since 2003, having paused only in the futuristic era of the game, because in my opinion, it was horrible, and coming back in 2017 when they released COD WWII, which was bad too, but better than the futurists, now in this COD, even characters with superpowers have it, if those weapons that kill you and turn you into pieces, into lightning, explode you etc, now you have to deal with flying characters and the like, I'm sorry to say, but this game that in theory it was supposed to be for people over 18, this is becoming a game for people under 12, it just needs to cartoonize the scenario and you can now call it Call of Fortnite.
Finally, the game has serious optimization problems, it has many cheaters, many grotesque bugs, it is not fun like the previous one, the store has practically nothing decent, the devs in each update, which in theory was to improve the game, do the opposite and they shit on everything that ""worked"", the map is not bad, but it is not good enough like the first warzone, and the worst the DEVs do not decide which game mode to leave, each week or even in the same week , the game has a different mode and for those who play in a duo, they usually just get screwed. Play at your own risk, I don't recommend.","Mostly Negative32% of the 39,711 user reviews for this game are positive.",warzone started bad changed leaving worse beginning fun bug addition optimized decent original started skin trend cool skin fun weapon chosen skin weapon usable highly skilled experienced package third weapon correct damage compared warzone created class weapon killed today class kill shoot bean kill chicken weapon category unbalanced player vest infinite unless crappy weapon practically insta kill not_usable practical term fourth problem cheater yes saw anti cheat working addition infested cheater report banned false report developer no_one else report suspect not_to trouble checking look fifth spent skin developer throw trash far good market decent skin complaint topic sixth cod fortnite duty franchise 2003 paused futuristic era horrible 2017 released cod wwii bad futurist cod character superpower weapon kill turn piece lightning explode deal flying character theory supposed 18 12 need cartoonize scenario fortnite finally serious optimization problem cheater grotesque bug not_fun practically decent theory improve opposite shit worked not_bad not_good warzone worst not_decide mode leave week week different mode play duo usually screwed play risk recommend

Another live service failure. This is why you don't make something as complex as a flight sim into a fully online streaming asset disaster.

Even when things stabilize and they compensate for the number of players trying to run the game.. We will still experience weird quirks like long loading times based on bandwidth or even stalling out altogether. Visuals will look worse than MSFS2020, even if you have gigabit or higher speeds. Most of the time the game struggled to load in textures even with a wired connection. Just a completely asinine decision to make this product into a streaming service.

Performance is just as lacking as 2020. Don't be fooled by the claims that they focused on multi-threading. I have the same stutters and inconsistency that existed in the previous game with a 7950x and RTX 4090.

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"Mainly , solo PVE experience. I honestly don't really care about PVP content even thought it's a big part of the game. 
I always wanted to try an MMO , customize my character , gear him up and just fight PVE with a group of people.

To keep this short , game lacks content . The first 0-30 levels are great , 30-50 is fine and then endgame is extremely stale. Not much to do besides waste your time gathering thousands of materials to level up your trade skill ,  just so you may get a lucky chance to craft something good which is very unlikely unless you have a specific armor set for that tradeskill.

I really enjoyed the first levels experience , just running around with friends questing , but honestly my friends quickly dropped the game after max lvl and the solo end-game is really bland and boring.

Season pass was meh , the only good item in it was the premium lvl 100 skin , the journey chapters and challenges are too difficult to complete if you're not blasting thousands of hours on this game and not even gonna mention it's not really worth your time either.

Overall an okay game , needs a lot of work to become good and hopefully I could one day be able to do dungeons again , cause holy crap I havnt been able to get into one dungeon for ages.","Mixed68% of the 243,329 user reviews for this game are positive.",mainly solo versus environment honestly care versus thought big wanted massively multiplayer online customize gear fight versus environment group short lack 0 30 level great 30 50 fine endgame extremely stale not_much besides waste gathering thousand material trade skill lucky chance craft good unlikely unless specific armor set tradeskill enjoyed level running friend questing honestly friend quickly dropped max lvl solo bland boring season pas meh good premium lvl 100 skin journey chapter challenge difficult complete not_blasting thousand hour not_even gon na mention not_really worth okay need good hopefully able dungeon cause holy crap havnt able dungeon age
1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"So I've beaten this game beginning to end. I've completed all the gigs and NCPD scanner quests. The only thing I've missed out on was a relationship quest which didn't trigger. (Even after a year, it's not surprising.)

After all of that, I can confidently say, this game was and still is one of the most over-promised and under-delivered titles I've ever seen apart from maybe No Man's Sky (but at least they've put in the maximum amount of effort to deliver the promises they originally made, Cyberpunk will NEVER reach the heights and content initially promised).

The things they promised us that sold me on the game that turned out to be lies? Choices made outside of the starting prologue literally doesn't affect anything except for some very far and between dialogue options (which don't change the path of the story in any way). There is incredibly limited choices to make in the main story to actually effect the path it puts you on (won't spoil but the promise of multiple playthroughs being unique? An absolute lie. The story/dialogue options are ultimately as linear as the average Telltale game, an illusion of choice, all leading to very limited outcomes AND EVEN THEN, the story in my opinion is absolutely nothing special). The AI is braindead (STILL). Purchasing safehouses? A lie. Character Customisation? Very limited. If you want the full breakdown of promises that weren't delivered, there is an entire Reddit thread you can find with a quick google.

If you bought the newest model of a Ferrari and were told by salesperson it was the fastest road car ever, you take it home and it won't move faster than a crawl, you would not be happy being told ""It crawls now but we'll patch it over the next few years until it hits its top speed"". It would be unacceptable right??? 

So, why do these big game devs keep getting a pass by players for bullsh***ing us? They were nominated and WON the award for the Steam Outstanding Story-Rich Game Award for their lies, when none us would accept this nonsense in any other industry. Restaurants wouldn't be getting Michelin Stars for serving bad food and Actors wouldn't get awards for bad performances, but as gamers we're sold blatantly unfinished products and are expected to accept it? The game industry will never improve if we keep taking this laying down.

Anyway, remember this review when Bioware releases Dragon Age 4, inevitably in an unacceptable state and we gift them with a Game of the Year award for it!

2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"Maaaaan, this game has been such a nice surprise!

Positives:
- Wonderful combat
- Drop Dead Gorgeous Graphics
- Controls are nice and smooth
- Story is good so far
- Huge Variety in Environments/Biomes
- Well crafted Game world
- Cool setting that we don't see very often with Chinese Mythology
- Great audio
- Atmosphere is top notch
- The Calymation style cutscene at the end of Chapter 2 was unreal, dem feels!
- Tons of really cool abilities to try out and use
- So far it runs well, 60fps on PC with Ray Tracing on Full, Frame Gen, DLSS & Quality & Settings @ Very High with a 4060ti & 5700x & 32Gb of Ram. Or if I want more FPS I keep the same settings as above except I turn off Ray Tracing and I get 120fps.

(Also runs on Steam Deck to at 30fps which I was not expecting, considering how amazing the game looks!). Also ZERO crashes.

Negatives:
- Would be nice to have the option to invite a friend for boss fights ala Dark Souls/Elden Ring
- HDR option would be nice


Overall the game is fantastic so far and I don't have any negatives really yet. So far I have not had any crashes or FPS issues and I am loving the combat, the game world, the graphics, the audio and the setting alot!

These devs did a wonderful job on there first ever PC and Console game, top notch stuff here and its up there with my favorite games of 2024 so far. Probably in my personal Top 3 of the year with Elden Ring Expansion and Hellblade 2.

The game is a nice mix of say the Combat and Boss style of Elden Ring/Dark Souls, but with the Linear world and style use of Mythology of God Of War. Chinese Mythology has not been done that often in videogames, never mind this well before, this is Top notch stuff so far. Played 2 and a half hours before bed and I am already itching to play more of it tomorrow.

If you want tons of bosses to fight and a a gorgeous world to explore and a cool setting, pick this game up ASAP, you can tell the devs put alot of love, blood, sweat and tears into this one.

I wouldn't call this a full blown Souls like game but it does have some elements like Dark Souls and Elden Ring, but it also has a ton of its own ideas and unique aspects to.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"It's important I preface this review with the following: I don't normally enjoy MMOs and I don't particularly like paying subscriptions to games.

The game however completely exceeded any expectations I had for it. I expected to play for a couple months and then be done with it. I'm still playing. I log on near every day, I have multiple classes past lvl 60, which NEVER happens in an MMO for me.

This game is gorgeous and stunning in not only character modeling, but animations, and atmosphere as well. The locations are breathtaking and I find myself just hanging out in places enjoying the scenery from time to time.

This MMO has a plot. It's a great plot. It's not totally flimsy like a lot of MMO plots, and heck, this one even ties into the original FFXIV. Well done. The characters are amazing and I really grew attached to many of them as a result.

Combat is enjoyable. As well it should be. As I found with most MMOs this game did have a slow start through the first 20-30 levels, but the story should be enough to keep you entertained, and its also great for getting those levels fast. The game also does not have to make a whole new character if you want to be a different class. You can level ALL the classes on the same character. It's amazing and I love that it does this, because I often want to play a variety of classes, but don't want to go through all the story questing again, or am far too attached to the one character to have to make a whole new one. Classes are also super varied despite falling into specific roles. My one issue is that queue times for finding Duty Finder groups is painstaking at non-peak hours if you are a DPS class.

The expansions never fail to disappoint. Heavensward and Stormblood are definitely worth picking up, and have been bundled together for your convenience. The new areas and locales are amazing to look at and adventure in.

All in all, this is the only game I will probably ever pay a sub fee for, and honestly, they deserve the money. This game is just that entertaining. I never regret spending my time playing.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"[h1] Avoid Because of Kernel Level Anti-Cheat (nProtect Gameguard) [/h1]

The truth is, this game's anti-cheat, Nprotect Gameguard, is the cheapest and most unsafe rootkit anti-cheat on the market.

Since it's kernel level the anti-cheat has kernel access to your PC, meaning it can go through all your files and control hardware. Some reported that even after uninstalling their games, people still can't get rid of the anti-cheat as it lurks in your PC.

Here's a list of awful Free 2 Play games that Helldivers 2 has the honor of sharing an anti-cheat with: [url=https://steamdb.info/tech/AntiCheat/nProtect_GameGuard/] Games List [/url]

The decision behind using this anti-cheat is because, the developers don't want cheaters to steal microtransactions like they did in the first game. Which is absolutely fair, but they have chosen the wrong anti-cheat.

It doesn't even make sense for a PVE Game to have such a strong rootkit anti-cheat that gives it access to your entire PC.

 [b] To protect their profits, the developers have chosen an anti-cheat that put players at risk. [/b]

Many people have been turned away from this game, due to their decision.  

I hope the developers read this and consider using one of the popular anti-cheats like EAC, at least that anti-cheat has a good reputation unlike nProtect Gameguard.

 [b] Edit: Thank you everyone for all the awards and kind messages. I hope the developers take the feedback of this review seriously and change their anti-cheat to a less intrusive one. [/b]

Random 3 AM loot inspections.
Paranoia of sounds that rival even the most seasoned meth head.
Man made architecture that could only be conjured by a schizophrenic.
A time machine that will consume your entire weekend.
You will feel like the victim of gang stalking at all times.
The clicking of stone on metal haunts your dreams.
Stare blankly into your furnace at night while eating a bowl of top ramen.
The situations you find your self in will become folk lore of your friend group.
The bad times will be recounted fondly with your friends.
The good times will be embellished to mythical levels.
God speed and may your wipe days be fruitful.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Better renamed as: how to cut out 99% of all meaningful content regardless of when it was purchased, with plans to cut a majority of content purchased [b]after[/b] the game went free-to-play, including notable exotics and their catalysts unless already acquired.

Entire planets and storylines, entire groups of items and unique rewards, entire armor sets and sought-after weapon rolls being ""sunset"" (a term used to indicate that you won't be able to enhance them up to current power levels indefinitely) all for shitty season-pass styled content and extra DLCs that will ALSO become vaulted. [b]Sunsetting was reversed earlier this year going forward, but didn't undo the damage it caused or return content forcibly removed. Every single article on the topic indicates already-sunset gear remained sunset.[/b]

Bungie hasn't been decent for awhile, but there was a glimmer of hope that was promptly taken out back and shot, causing most of the people I know (even really good PvPers from the Sanctuary Discord) and played with personally to abandon ship.

Whatever Destiny 2 was is long dead, the lore (what little remains) has to be accessed and read through third-party websites and videos and fan-made compilations; so you can't even play it for the story any longer.

Pretty much any reviews beyond 8~ months ago aren't valid any longer; there's a reason the DLCs are mixed-to-negative.

Do yourself a favor and play literally any other looter shooter that wants FAR LESS than $130 out of you; hell you can even avoid the pitfalls of an earlier Warframe arsenal for 20% of that, or literally buy four or five much better games at least.","Very Positive80% of the 615,480 user reviews for this game are positive.",renamed cut 99 meaningful purchased plan cut majority purchased play including notable exotics catalyst unless already acquired planet storyline group item unique reward armor set sought weapon roll sunset term indicate able enhance power level indefinitely shitty season pas styled extra dlcs vaulted sunsetting reversed earlier forward undo damage caused forcibly removed single article topic indicates already sunset gear remained sunset b_emphasizedungie decent awhile glimmer hope promptly taken shot causing good pvpers sanctuary discord personally abandon ship whatever long dead lore remains accessed read third party website video fan compilation play longer pretty review 8 month ago valid longer dlcs mixed negative favor play literally looter shooter want far 130 hell avoid pitfall earlier warframe arsenal 20 literally four five game
553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"Crazy to say that in February 2024, a successful 4 player coop live service third person shooter launched and it’s not the Suicide Squad. Arrowhead, with a much smaller team, accomplished what Rocksteady could not in the same amount of dev time. Gameplay loop is a blast, with procedurally generated missions giving what appears to be a lot of replay value. To me this is Deep Rock Galactic without the mining and a lot more emphasis on the bug killing. Being able to earn microtransaction currency means you can unlock everything in the game through gameplay. A breath of fresh air in the AAA multiplayer game space that seems motivated to squeeze every last dollar out of you.

2139460,Once Human,"Pros:
-Free game - probably the best free game I've played to date
-Gorgeous looking aesthetics with a lot of unique mechanics - I've paid a fortune for high end games that look and play half as good as this one
-Devs stated no 'pay to win' features, with all bought items being cosmetics and therefore optional purchases
-Consistent updates to improve gaming quality
-Friend invites to full servers - this happens at the start of the phases currently, but if a server is full, you have individual friend codes to invite additional people to play with you
-Reactive devs, with a discord server that allows for suggestions and posts all updates 
-PvE and PvP options, with the ability to make multiple characters across multiple server types  
-Great building opportunities - recent fix to help with some of the janky building mechanics, and although it's not 100% flawless at the moment, I assume future patches will enhance this further, and the latest dev talk as I'm writing this showed an increase in place-able items and more blueprints and shop items, which will lead to more creativity and making more unique and bigger bases
-Server wipes - putting this as a pro, since other similar game types that don't offer this usually have an inflated marketplace with noone starting off at the same levels, and I feel like it's more difficult to start as a new character because of this. This game offers server wipes with new scenarios promised to be built, so even if you don't currently have time to play consistently, you can wait a season and hop onto the next. This way feels like everyone on a server starts with the same advantages/disadvantages and is more satisfying to play like this in my opinion 

Cons:
-Not well optimised currently, with server lags when a larger amount of players are in the same space. This is more frustrating in PvP, but affects any type of server. Hopefully this is a future fix 
-Chaotic UI with many 'stores' and 'currencies' in lots of different places which can be confusing and unnecessary, but hopefully this is a future fix
-Servers going dead towards the later phases with no current ability for others to join to fill that gap, and no ability to take your character out to join a different scenario. This is definitely making this game better with a dedicated friend group
-Paid items are not account wide currently, and region locked 
-Characters currently created being region locked, which ties all progress to 1 region 
-Each new character created is forced to do the tutorial and full story mode again, even if you have characters who have already completed this on a different server, within the same account 
-Gambling style loot crates, that cost a small fortune to obtain everything, with dupes not converting into any type of decent alternative. Out of everything in the shop, this is the most hated feature server wide, with daily posts in the discord suggestions to remove it/be more transparent with % rates/offer items as a bought option too/no dupes/not use this as a method since it seems predatory etc 



Overall, a great game with an exciting future, and a lot of the listed 'cons' may be fixed in future updates and don't negate all of the pros imo. Give it a try, and happy gaming :)

238960,Path of Exile,"[b]Path of exile[/b] is an MMO Dungeon crawler that is unlike any other, with its unique concepts that haven’t been seen before in the genre and branching out further than any Diablo title ever has.
Similar to Diablo 3’s seasons, Path of exile features ‘Leagues’ which are separated between 3-4 month gaps where you must create a new character and start from fresh with each season bringing entirely new features and systems that help the player find new ways of playing the game or completely change the way they make builds or tweak past setups. Once the league is over, the updates, patches, new systems are added into the base game through the Standard League and the next update that comes after it to help build the games overall depth and replayability when going into next league.
The game includes [b]10[/b] main acts that takes the average player 4-8 hours to complete, the time might be noticeably longer on the first\second play-through. The acts are the games tutorial, slowly introducing more and more mechanics to the player as you progress and helping get your build off its feet and ready for maps. Once you complete the acts the game enters the endgame stages known as “Mapping” where you aim to complete the atlas through entering maps having similar layouts as which you experienced during the acts but now with extra modifiers that boost the enemies HP and DMG as well as increased drop rates for rarity and quantity of items. Maps range from tier 1-16 with difficulty increasing as you progress and introducing you to the never-ending grind for EXP and Currency.

[b]Path of exile[/b] does not have a Skill Tree and instead has a [b]Passive Tree[/b] featuring [b]1325[/b] nodes that every class in the game can reach that act as the building blocks to a working build, some nodes only increasing small bonuses like “+10 Strength” or “+4% Attack speed” but others may increase a variety of stats in large values with the larger nodes or change the fundamentals of how your character will work through the ‘Keystone’ passives.

Without a skill tree, abilities and skills are instead turned into gems that are socketed into your gear through either an “Active Skill” or “Support Gem” which link together to create more powerful spells or ‘Gem Setups’

[b]E.g.    Fireball (Active) + multiple Projectiles (Support) + Slower Projectiles (Support) + Added Fire Damage (Support)[/b]
^
This Linking system allows you to cater your abilities to better suit certain builds and playstyles with more complexity than ever seen before in a skill tree. This is the largest defining difference between POE and Diablo III. 

[b]Path of Exile[/b] cuts out the boring gold system where money only has one purpose. In POE currencies are instead ‘orbs’ or [b]currency items[/b] that are used to alter and change an item stats through upgrading, adding sub stats, rerolling, corrupting, changing the number of gem sockets, socket colours, socket links, changing implicit stats and changing the items rarity. Most of the currency items are not used in player trading and are instead used for their upgrading purposes while others are used strictly for trades and are rarely used in crafting such as ‘Chaos Orbs\Exalted Orbs’.
Outside of the game, path of exile has a lot of third-party tools that can be used to help in making currency or making player trading more accessible. 

[b]Item Filter[/b] - https://www.filterblade.xyz - An item filter allows you to filter out certain tiers of gear and items as well as prioritizing specific currency items, gear or gems. Item filters are a [b]necessity[/b] for the endgame as it helps remove screen clutter from the hundreds of low tier items that will flood your vision and reduce FPS.

[b]Trading[/b] - www.pathofexile.com/trade/ AND https://poe.trade/ - Path of exiles trading and economy is [b]strictly player driven[/b] with these websites allowing you to search up certain unique items or pieces of gear with your chosen set of sub stats or DPS. The economy and market in this game is my personal favourite part, and with the help of the in-game whispering system, trades are hassle free.

[b]E.g. @UWU Hi, I would like to buy your Shaper's Touch Crusader Gloves listed for 1 chaos in Heist (stash tab ""1""; position: left 1, top 1)[/b]

[b]I love Path of Exile[/b] with a passion, but that doesn’t mean I play it every day of the year. The majority of the player base comes and goes as leagues are released with most players only playing the league for the first 1-4 weeks before leaving and waiting for the next, pushing themselves to beat personal goals such as reaching a certain level, getting richer, completing challenges or trying to beat the late game bosses. 

[b]Path of Exile is not Pay2Win[/b].  

[b]Path of exile[/b] has never featured a system where using money can increase your stats, give you gear or EXP and instead gets all its revenue from its MTX’s and Cosmetics for your armour, portals and hideout. The cosmetics in Path of Exile are gorgeous and packed full of detail, and with a team of developers that work [b]so hard[/b] to constantly pump out update after update, I feel my purchases are really helping the team to strive forward. Seriously, [b]the team are some of the hardest working developers I’ve ever seen in a game besides Warframe, they really listen to its community and work closely with Youtubers and streamers to create an experience that is balanced and fun for all kinds of players whether it be a Speed runner, hardcore fan or casual player.[/b]","Very Positive89% of the 227,830 user reviews for this game are positive.",massively multiplayer online dungeon crawler unlike unique concept genre branching diablo title similar diablo 3 s_emphasizedeasons feature league separated 3 4 gap fresh season bringing entirely feature system help way completely build tweak past setup league update patch system base standard league next come help build game depth replayability next league includes 10 act take average 4 8 hour complete noticeably longer play act game tutorial slowly introducing mechanic progress helping build foot ready map complete act enters endgame stage known mapping aim complete atlas entering map similar layout experienced act extra modifier boost enemy hp dmg increased drop rate rarity quantity item map range tier 1_emphasized6 difficulty increasing progress introducing never_ending grind exp currency not_have skill tree passive tree featuring 1325 node class reach act building block working build node increasing small bonus 10 strength 4 attack speed others increase variety stats large value larger node fundamental keystone passive skill tree ability skill turned gem socketed gear active skill support gem link powerful spell gem setup e g fireball active multiple projectile support slower projectile support fire damage support linking allows cater ability suit certain build playstyles complexity skill tree largest defining difference poe diablo iii cut boring gold purpose poe currency orb currency item alter stats upgrading adding sub stats rerolling corrupting changing number gem socket socket colour socket link changing implicit stats changing item rarity currency item not_used trading upgrading purpose others strictly trade rarely crafting chaos orb exalted orb third party tool help currency trading accessible filter http www filterblade xyz filter allows filter certain tier gear item prioritizing specific currency item gear gem filter necessity endgame help remove screen clutter hundred low tier item flood vision reduce shooter trading www pathofexile com trade http poe trade exile trading economy strictly driven website allowing search certain unique item piece gear chosen set sub stats damage per economy market personal favourite help whispering trade hassle e g uwu hi shaper touch crusader glove listed 1 chaos heist stash tab 1 position left 1 top 1 b_emphasized love passion play majority base come go league released player league 1 4 week leaving waiting next pushing beat personal goal reaching certain richer completing challenge trying beat late boss not_pay2win b_emphasized never_featured increase stats gear exp get revenue mtx cosmetic armour portal hideout cosmetic gorgeous packed detail developer hard constantly pump purchase helping strive forward seriously hardest working developer besides warframe listen community closely youtubers streamer balanced fun kind player speed runner hardcore fan casual

i usually wait until i've been playing a game for longer before i leave a review but in the spirit of early access and active updates i did want to chime in and offer suggestions to improve the experience

its worth mentioning beforehand that though this is rather bare bones currently, what it offers is incredibly solid! i've not laughed and had good times with a new release like this in a good long while.

one of my main issues is if someone rage quits on their turn before it plays out it will lock the match and the remaining seats won't be able to finish, this is something i hope gets patched because this has made me rule out playing with randoms entirely. i have it on good faith this game will be a masterpiece once everythings ironed out, with serious potential when they introduce new game modes!

216150,MapleStory,"-Great art style.  This includes music, monsters, characters, skills and maps.  Incredibly unique.
-Tons of classes to pick from.  You'll find yourself making one of almost everything.
-Noticable power increases after each milestone, achievable with just time spent in-game.
-Items and equipment is diverse, but becomes more limited as you level up.  You'll find yourself chasing a few specific things that feel impossible to aquire.  You'll have to kill a boss, but you're unable to kill that boss without a lot of help or amazing equipment.  And most people don't want to share the drops.  Just like in the real world, it's about who you know.
-I have mixed feeling about the community.  Generally, it is an older playerbase.  Most people keep to themselves.  
-Grind heavy.  This is both a good and a bad thing.  Always something to do.
-The in-game player owned ""free market"" is not new player friendly.  
-You'll find yourself training on a select few maps instead of exploring the great world.  For efficiency, of course.

However, I would not recommend this game to a friend.  It takes a lot of time and/or money to reach ""end game"" content.  This end game content will make most players feel inadequate after about 30 hours of gameplay, after you reach level 140 or so.  Levels stop having meaning and everything falls onto equipment.  And the equipment system in maplestory is not friendly to your wallet or your watch.  

If you can look past some of the negatives I listed, then this game might be for you.

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"I can not recommend this game. Here is the story why:

I was in real life invited to play magic the gathering commander format. That was a very fun expierience for me, and i had a great time. At that time i had no MTG cards myself and as my friends play MTG on a weekly basis in real life in a pub, i decided to give it a shot and bought some starter decks and a commando deck. The starter decks came with codes for MTG-Arena so i thought i might learn some basics about the game playing MTG-Arena. In the beginning i got some free digital booster packs to build what i considered a strong deck if played in real life, turns out MTG-Arena proofed me wrong. As i played some ranked games i had to realize that 'competetive decks' are either cheese or 'burst your foe in 3 turns'. For example i had to play against an opponent who did exactly the following: played a card that let him explore cards in his deck and then discard the other cards into the graveyard. He did that the first 3 turns only playing mana cards and draw and discard. In the fourth turn he had neerly no cards left to draw from and had alot of mana out. Then he played a 2 mana worth creature that stated if his mana-cards are greater in number than the number  of cards left in his deck he wins the game. BOOM. YOU LOST. To a card that costs 2 mana in the 4th turn of the game. In real life nobody would dare to bring such a deck to play. He would simply getting slapped by the players in the pub. For real: go to the MTG-Fridays, bring some friends, drink a pint of beer and watch some soccer. And maybe the waitress will give you some smile. But dont waste your time and/or money on this. Its not what games are meant to be: fun.","Mixed64% of the 14,968 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_recommend real life invited play magic commander format fun expierience great no_mtg card friend play mtg weekly basis real life pub decided shot bought starter deck commando deck starter deck code mtg thought learn basic mtg beginning digital booster pack build considered strong deck real life turn mtg proofed wrong ranked game realize competetive deck exploiting mechanic strategy gain unfair advantage burst foe 3 turn example play opponent exactly following card explore card deck discard card graveyard 3 turn mana card draw discard fourth turn neerly no_cards left draw alot mana 2 mana worth creature stated mana card greater number number card left deck win boom lost card cost 2 mana 4th turn real life dare bring deck play simply slapped player pub real mtg friday bring friend drink pint beer watch soccer maybe waitress smile dont waste not_what game meant fun
2300320,Farming Simulator 25,"Basically the same game as F22 with some mild improvements. Its not worth the full price if you are a long time player just keep playing FS22 with mods until FS25 drops in price.

What I was most curious about was the ""new"" A.I. workers which are still a pain to work with and mods do it better if you want that type of gameplay like other people have said instead of improving simulation aspects and gameplay it got a little texture update and now when you drive over fields it gives tire marks. The rice farming is basically the same as what you already have only with a different machine and textures.

In simulation there has been non to very little improvements. Animals look and move a bit more realistic but are still static animals that are nothing more than a spreadsheet when you interact with it same goes for all the other aspects of the game.

I'm disappointed to be honest that the franchise has improved so little and asking so much of customers. This is not a hate review I'm a long time fan of the franchise I started in 09 and I wanna see the game succeed and improve where it can but what the difference between this and a yearly Train simulator release?

1203620,Enshrouded,"First off, for early access I got almost 100 hours of good gameplay. 100%'d all the achievements so far. Worth the price.

UPDATE: Still exploring this VAST world and am over 150 hours. I just want to say to the developers/designers/writers: 
The amount of love put into the design and implementation of Embervale's geographic diversity is incredible. There are POI's as FAR as the eye can see, and in between each, i'd say HUNDREDS of hidden secrets. It cannot be stated enough, that this is a VAST world to explore with SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU COULD EVER SINK YOUR TEETH INTO in less than i'd say 180 hours of exploring.

UPDATE UPDATE:
The new dungeons they added are astoundingly detailed and vast. New enemies and environmental hazards are great. Good stuff. Frequent updates.

^ also with all that stated, the game is in Early Access and I have to point out that also means MOST of the map is restricted and you cannot go into it. This means that you already get an unheard of, and STAGGERING, amount of stuff to explore and its like, 30% of the overall planned map size. This is amazing.

I'll try to offer info on stuff most reviews won't go into.

You can tank. Like, you can keep threat, so your teammates can get backstab damage. This is a big deal for me, because I tank in a lot of games and most survival open world crafting games don't have this ability.

Skill Tree!!!
Wanna be a tank? Wanna be a rogue? Wanna be a battle mage? Wanna be all 3? You can go down twelve skill trees and mix and match grabbing fun things from other trees pretty easily. Respecing is low cost so you can experiment or change for quick role swaps easily. This feature really makes the game FUN!

Craftspeople
You find 5 ""craftspeople"" (aka npc's) that you place in your base as a new take on crafting benches.
They are new and different because they give quests to go get <crafting bench upgrade pieces like a table saw for example>
They have requests about how they want to live, like, hey, give me a roof would ya? Which is a nice personification of the crafting station, makes you want to invest in your base.
For example, we got the alchemist, and thought whoah lets make a really great looking alchemy workshop for this guy and went ham for a few hours really building a nice area for him. Now we scavenge books like crazy to put on his bookshelfs.
It makes investment in the building system into a nice cycle as you unlock more and more furniture, block types etc.

Differences from other games of its type:
- Skipping the night doesn't require all players to sleep. One player sleeping increases night speed by 30x (differs with number of players on) and that stacks.
- Gliders replace any need for a mount.
- You may place down a flame shrine to teleport to and from it. More placeable at a time as you upgrade the flame shrine level at your base.
- Sticky flair arrows for night time gives options for leaving a torch off your hotbar. Also firefly potions.
- Crafting from containers is reinforced by lore, as you have boring normal containers, but you can imbue them with magic to make crafting from containers ""wirelessly"" from all npcs or workbenches.
- Screw up while building or mining? Hit the 'Y' key to undo!
- Don't have the key to the door? OH well, just mine through the wall. No one has time for annoying back tracking.
- Friends who don't have time to no life it? Have them login, afk, and all xp gained gets partially given to them no matter how far away the kill is.

Just a few things. I'll update as I go.

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"I have played this game 3155 hours and would have given in a thumbs up until recently.  I am not your typical player as I am a 52 year old father of 4 teenagers.   One of them played with me and we had some unforgettable times.  I have played MMO's for 25 years when Ultima Online came out.  New World started off a bit slow once you got to 60 but I believe the devs put their heart and soul into the game over the past year and it shows.  First it is a gorgeous game from a graphics stand point.  There was times I am out running around and I would have to stop to watch the sun go down.  It was incredible!  Some of the changes the devs put in was it cost less azoth to fast travel, you can get to all your storage from any storage, the umbral shards became a lot easier to grind you gear score up, OPR, new Expeditions, soon to be new lands that you do not even have to pay extra for, and many other changes.  I was incredibly excited about the future of the game.  

I really enjoyed all the professions and had them all at 200+ except for Weaponsmith that was at 187.  Wars and OPR were a lot of fun and challenging especially for more of a PVE type player like myself.  50 on 50 going at each other what is there not to like?  Expeditions and Invasions were fantastic especially with friends and company mates. Farming for resources on full servers was difficult because it seemed that there was more players looking for resources then resources available but it is something I still enjoyed doing.  Sometimes I had good runs and others not so much as others beat me to it.  In the end over time I was always able to get what I needed but you could tell others were not able to as they would get upset if you beat them to a resource node.   With the new lands and more space I think this will be corrected though.  

Obviously I really enjoyed this game and even with it's flaws I felt it was one of the best overall MMO's I have ever played!   In all the years I have played MMO's I have never even been accused of cheating let alone suspended or banned from a game.  That came to an end in New World as I was first suspended for 'cheating' on 5/20/22 for a week.  That is the only description they give you and you can only appeal as you are locked out of any other way to communicate.  I followed the appeal process that day and appealed the ban.  A week later I still had not received a response so before logging in I went to the New World forums and explained what happened trying to figure out what to do.  An admin on the forums was empathetic and told me to appeal again and showed me how to add the logs stored on my computer to my appeal.  So I appealed again.   In the end I figured it was a mistake so I jumped back into the game I so enjoyed.  I never received a response to either appeal except for a canned response that they are working on my appeal and one of them thanked me for playing Lost Ark.  Not sure how they messed that up as the appeal was for New World.  At this point I was 1900 hours into the game. 

I put in another 1200 hours until I was permanently banned on 9/21/22.  I appealed immediately thinking after all this game time how can this happen to me?  Within 8 hours I received a canned response that I have seen all over the forums that I had 'cheated', my appeal was denied and any future replies would be ignored.  I tried to email them back to find out what I specifically did and within a minute I got the same response. 

So after 25 years and untold hours of playing MMO's with a perfect record here I am banned from a game that I was loyal to, enjoyed immensely and I have no idea what I did to deserve this.  How can I support a game that treats it's player base like this especially a loyal player who stuck with them during the tough times when so many players did not?

My apologies it got long.  If you made it this far thank you for listening.

***An update on 9/25/22 - I was told to try and appeal a few days after the initial appeals by multiple people so I tried it this morning.  I included 8 logs (rather large files stored on my computer and the most I could fit in the space provided), a Steam forums post explaining everything (also long winded) and the official NW forums post from May when I was first banned for a week along with other information and within 5 minutes I received the canned denial.  No way could have they looked at anything to make a determination if my appeal was warranted or not.  I did reply to that email and I got two emails they are looking at my appeal.  Maybe I will get lucky.  

So to keep track my first two appeals from the week ban I sent on 5/20/22 and 5/28/22 were never responded to.  On the permanent ban from 9/21/22 the first one without logs was responded to and denied within 8 hours and the second one that same day with logs was not responded to.  The third appeal with 8 logs on 9/25/22 was denied within 5 minutes.  The fourth appeal made on 9/26/22 also with my last 8 logs was not responded to.  So far I have appealed 6 times and only two were even responded to.  

My appeal today, 9/28/22, with the last 8 logs and two forum posts that are again rather lengthy to get more information to AGS was denied in 3 minutes!  So the only 3 appeals responded two were denied in 3 and 5 minutes.  Those two had 8 large log files stored on my computer that can prove my innocence where are the other appeal that did not took around 8 hours to deny.  

I would hope what we all can agree on is that AGS's appeal process is an embarrassment.  I feel for the innocent players that are still suspended that bought a dupers item on the trading post because if they have to go through the appeals process many others who are innocent will be banned permanently.

***10/8/22 update:  On 9/26/22 the dev Katy K said on twitter that AGS is investigating the dup and housing trophy issue and once the investigation is done and you are still banned to appeal.  I am not part of that as I had not traded anything recently and i keep my trophies separated in my three houses.  I appealed again on 9/28/22 and it was denied in 3 minutes.  Really AGS are you taking this seriously at all, 3 minutes???  She said  the investigation was concluded on 9/29/22 and since I was still banned I sent another appeal.  There was never a response.  On the same day a friend contacted Amazon about a return and spoke to Antiqa.  He asked if she could unsuspend my account and agreed to and that I should be able to login in 48-72 hours.  It was still banned 72 hours later so he contact them again.  Mohommed helped this time and sent an appeal to AGS stating that I should receive an email within 48-72 hours.  He also had a manager call my friend and they spoke about the dilemma I was in.  She transferred him to a direct line with AGS but they never answered.  I had heard this before from others trying to get there accounts unbanned.  Both reps tried to be helpful  but were not able to help in the end.

The patch notes from updated 1.6.7 New World on 10/4/22 that said they adjusted an in game penalty message to provide additional clarity and context.  Finally I had been asking for this since I first was banned! Know what you are banned for will at least help you defend yourself.  I logged in all excited and it still says I was banned for 'cheating' with no additional clarity or context.  Back to square one as they fail to even get the patch right.  I appealed on 10/5/22 and again I never received a response.  Today on 10/8/22 I just made my 8th appeal.

1643320,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"I am so torn on this game. In some aspects you can feel the love and care but in many its like last minute school project.

PROS

landscape is pretty, authentic and it builds on previous stalker games

audio design is pretty good, when it works

gun-play is solid, with some caveats

characters and clothing looks awesome

lighting and reflections on high or epic is stunning

NPCs in villages feels good and immersive


CONS

Performance - with 120-150 fps it feels like 40-80 fps at best. My guess is frame timing. I can tolerate low consistent fps but this is just bad. (4070 super, 5800x3d, 32gb ram, ssd) on medium settings

medium and low settings are plagued with visual bugs and glitches which ruin immersion

clunky inventory and stash management with dumb controls

bullet sponge enemies with armour values, where is bloodsuckers apparently have invisible eod suit..

weapon and armour degradation vs price to repair is not balanced or lacks mechanic to fix it my self

consumables are everywhere and there is no limit on healing, so argument for difficulty goes out of the window (i smell poor balancing for console players)

no descriptions for difficulty variants and it feels like someone did whole balancing of most aspect day before release

weapons balance is straight from some Ubisoft game, PM which shoots 9x18mm has better damage and ballistic than USP?

lack of tiered reload system for guns is criminal in 2024

KEYBINDS, cant change essentials like consumables, flashlight and default is ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥. 

day night cycle is too short

And the worst offender of all is lack of A-life. That is what differentiates STALKER game from some post-apo wannabe clone. I personally don't buy, that it has some bugs and will be hot-fixed, since they removed it from steam description.



Mod community already does heavy lifting but it will take time and full modding support from developers.

In conclusion i want to love the STALKER 2 and i can overlook a lot of problems. Even most of them, but when main bones of game are missing, its not full release, its EARLY ACCESS.

I get that development was for GSC hard and i don't want to be harsh on them, but its still product and i regret buying it right now. Wait for A life patch, performance fix and mods.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"So, I've thought long and hard about this, and I can say now, without a doubt, that I do not recommend this game.


Let's start with the pros to playing this game.

+The Story 
The game does, for the most part, have an engaging storyline. At least in my opinion. Without going into detail and spoiling anything, if you like the side quests in skyrim, you'll like the story and playing through the zones in this game.

+The Crafting System
With crafting motifs and different materials and upgrades available, the crafting system is an indepth and interesting system. 
From alchemy allowing you to mix and match different reagents in different ways, from enchanting giving you an interactive experience in creating your runes, if you are a crafter, you'll find a way to fill out your niche in this game.

+The Atmosphere
This game has an atmosphere unique to the elder scrolls series and you'll see all the familiar sights and some new things as you explore the world. Whether you enjoy playing as an argonian in the swamps of the black marshes, or you prefer being a wood elf in the great forests, you can experience all the different scenery of the elder scrolls series and their respective moods.

+Visuals
The game looks pretty appealing, visually. This does come with the drawback of some heavier processing requirements. 

And now, we get to the negatives of this game, and some of them are fatal flaws I cannot forgive.

-The Combat
The combat system is clunky. Swapping between bars in combat has a brief period where you cannot do anything, and its just long enough to feel irritating for me.
Combat feels samey in all respects, with no fights standing out in regards to uniqueness or 
mechanics.
Unless theres a major combat overhaul, I don't foresee myself ever getting any interest in the game again. Its plain boring.
Even with the stunning mechanics, all enemies feel like meat sponges for you to inflict numbers onto.
There's no satisfying feedback when you pull a big attack off. 

And this point leads into another.
-Class Identity
At some core point in the game, when you finish leveling multiple characters, you find yourself settling into a rotation.
If you wish to perform decently well at endgame, you will discover that for stamina characters, the rotation is almost exactly the same on other classes as it is for the class you started out with in the beginning.
Tanking is the same way, with your abilities all feeling similar to another one in another classes kit.
And Magicka dps, unfortunately, falls into the same trap.
Magicka dps even feels similar to Stamina dps, you buff yourself before the fight, you lay down your aoe abilities, then start applying dots. Its the same old song and dance for each character.
Some of the classes are even difficult to determine which is which until you see their ultimates, which ultimately do the same thing as another classes, but with a different skin.

-Direction
There's no clear direction to go with in this game. 
Sure, you can fall into all the same trappings as other mmos, trying to hit the level cap, and all that jazz.
I made it to CP220~ish, and I can tell you that every level beyond CP10 has felt hollow and empty.
The way that gear scaling works in this game, it makes acquiring gear only an imperative need once you get to a point where it isn't hitting as hard as it needs to, or giving you the mitigation that you need.
The scaling system takes a lot of the wind out of the sails of the progression in this game.

A lvl 30 set of gear is sufficient to level all the way to 50.
Not to mention the fact that there is no unique gear to shoot for aside from monster sets and some of the arena rewards, but they don't provide anything but some number boosts, rather than a unique mechanic to base a playstyle off of.
You also make your own legendary gear.
This may sound cool, but upgrading a piece of common gear all the way to legendary literally only makes numbers higher.
It doesn't impart any interesting or unique benefits. Its just a path from making a 10 become a 12.

-Skill Progression
Skills are necessary in every mmo. 
So why does achieving new skills in this game have to be such a drag.
Half of the time, you don't even use them to gain the new skills in the tree, you just have them slotted in the bar while you wait to use the skill you actually want. It's not interesting, or fun to have to wait to use a skill because you haven't leveled a tree that only has boring skills on the path to the one you want.
Guilds are one of the biggest sore thumbs sticking out in regards to this system.
Grinding for the Mages Guild ultimate took a serious effort, and the end payoff wasn't anywhere worth the time I put into getting it.
The fighters guild is the same way. You need to kill a stupid amount of creatures to rank your Fighters guild up, for something that will only marginally benefit you.
This isn't the straw in the camels back for me, but it definitely doesn't help with my urge to play the game when I make a new character I have to wait for an inordinate amount of experience to use a skill in a tree I want. If you're someone like I am, someone who likes to make alternate characters in order to see everything thats available to you, to play and enjoy, then these issues only stick out more and more on each successive leveling.

This game is just tedious. Like a grindstone slowly wearing away the edge of a knife.
Maybe some people can let the game sand them down enough to enjoy it, but I can't. Frankly, I've done everything I can to give this game a proper go. I've tried the pvp, leveled multiple characters to 50, hit 200+ in the CP, crafted as much as I can, explored plenty, and I still find myself asking

""Why am I still playing this game.""

However what has been definitive for me is how P2W it is in the endgame. The trait system requires so much effort that the fact that you can buy traits makes too much of a difference. And worst of all, this difference makes events where the reward is tied to your performance, blocking that content for anyone who isn't a whale.

The sheer amount reactiveness this game has is just insane, most of every action you take will be taken into account by the game. You might find here and there some illogical response or event the game throws at you because you did something so rare and out of place that it wasn't foreseen by developers. However, the overwhelming majority of the stupid things your brain might come up with to mess with the game logic has been taken into consideration.
And considering the gigantic of amount cutscenes in existence, this is truly a manga opus in modern days.

- Awesome non-limiting gameplay
- Great characters with many diverse personalities
- Good story with multiple satisfying endings
- Gargantuan level of interactions that feel limitless

2408820,Luma Island,"I really wish there was a neutral option rather than just positive or negative. I played the demo twice soon after it's release with two different professions. Since purchasing I am generally enjoying the game very much however, I have some gripes with how things have changed since the initial demo release. 

The negative:
- I don't really understand the dev's choice of how they're handling difficulty modes. They said based on feedback they decided to combine the cozy and harder modes into one more balanced mode and removed the lose on death mechanic for the temples and mines. I can appreciate the thought behind this however, I don't think its ever a good idea with a game like this to force all players to play one way. I feel like it would have made much more sense to have added somewhat customizable difficulty settings with the aspects of each game mode: ability to toggle lose on death, adjust combat, etc. 

- Another issue I have with the full release is that the villagers don't really seem to have a purpose and as far as I've been able to tell there's not even really a way to increase friendship with them. I understood there being a lack of relationship building in the demo but expected that it would be a part of a full release. 

- I am also someone who likes to play games somewhat realistically as it helps immerse me. So, I typically prefer to sleep in game if its an option but the ability to do this seems pointless. There is no energy mechanic or anything that sleeping boosts and with how quickly the days go by it really feels like more of a hindrance than anything else. Why sleep when you can get an extra 8+ hours each night of exploring and progressing with no drawbacks?

- Time also seems to go incredibly fast, this is in no way helped by the fact that the only time when time isn't moving is if you specifically pause the game. It doesn't pause during dialog or when opening menus like the inventory. This when paired with the often very long stretches of dialog from the villagers and lack of any true reason for talking to them, other than curiosity, makes talking to villagers also more of a hindrance than anything else. I found myself going from wanting to talk to all of the villagers and get to know them to still wanting to but choosing not to as all it really does is waste time. It feels like there either needs to be settings for making time move slower and/or a change made so that it pauses at least in dialog and potentially also the inventory menu.
 
Now the positive:
I really love the exploration in this game, it truly feels like there's something to discover around every corner and discovering new areas feels amazing and exciting. I also love the idea of the different professions as they really do feel very different from each other and allow you to experience different aspects of the game. I've seen a fair amount of people complaining about the graphics but I personally love the art style of the game. I've also seen a large number of people complaining about the grind of the game and about how long it takes to gather resources but as long as you upgrade your tools it really gets so much better. It provides incentive to prioritize upgrading at the beginning, which I don't think is a bad thing and I feel like is typical of games like this. 

Overall, this is the only farming sim type game I've enjoyed this much since Stardew Valley. I am excited to see where this game goes and I hope that the devs keep improving it and add a little more customization with the settings and difficulty so each player can play the way they want to.","Mostly Positive77% of the 1,313 user reviews for this game are positive.",wish neutral rather positive negative demo twice soon release different profession purchasing generally enjoying gripe thing changed initial demo release negative understand choice handling difficulty mode based feedback decided combine cozy harder mode balanced mode removed lose death mechanic temple mine appreciate thought t_emphasizedhink good idea force player play sense somewhat customizable difficulty setting aspect mode to_emphasizedggle lose death adjust combat issue release villager purpose far able not_even increase friendship understood lack relationship building demo expected release someone like play game somewhat realistically help immerse typically prefer sleep pointless no_energy mechanic sleeping boost quickly day feel hindrance else sleep extra 8 hour night exploring progressing no_drawbacks incredibly fast no_way helped moving pause pause dialog opening menu inventory paired long stretch dialog villager lack talking curiosity make talking villager hindrance else found wanting talk villager wanting choosing not_to waste feel need setting move slower pause dialog potentially inventory menu positive love exploration truly feel s_emphasizedomething discover corner discovering area feel amazing exciting love idea different profession different allow different aspect fair complaining graphic personally love art style large number complaining grind long take gather resource long upgrade tool get provides incentive prioritize upgrading beginning t_emphasizedhink bad typical game repeatedly defeating enemy completing task gain resource sim type enjoyed stardew valley excited go hope improving add customization setting difficulty play
739630,Phasmophobia,"As someone who doesn't like being scared by horror movies or haunted houses, I didn't think that I would like this game. What got me hooked was how your level of game knowledge correlates to how scary each run will be. There are no planned jump scares or spooky moments, everything that happens is a result of what kind of ghost you are hunting and how effective you have been at finding the ghost. You also always have the option to take a breather in your mobile truck-base before heading back in to continue the search. With a clever equipment setup, you can even continue to support your friends from the safety of the truck. Speaking of friends, this game is a blast to play with a couple of good pals. You'll quickly find out who are scaredy cats and who are psycho-masochists in your group. Of course, it's also easier to face your fears when you have your best buds egging you on. Solo is a solid spooky challenge, and you can sort of set your own difficulty by taking less equipment once you have become proficient at the game. All in all, if you are hesitant to give this one a shot because you think it'll be too scary, take it from me and give it a chance. This game is a unique and entertaining experience, definitely worth your time and sanity.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 588,193 user reviews for this game are positive.",someone scared horror movie haunted house t_emphasizedhink hooked knowledge correlate scary no_planned scare spooky moment happens result kind ghost hunting effective finding ghost breather mobile truck base heading continue search clever equipment setup continue support friend safety truck speaking friend blast play couple good pal quickly scaredy cat psycho masochist group course easier face fear best bud egging solo solid spooky challenge sort set difficulty taking equipment proficient hesitant shot scary chance unique entertaining definitely worth sanity

2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"The game devs have said many times this is not a souls-like, I corrected people many times to tell them it is not a souls-like. Turns out that yeah, I think it is very much a souls-like. 

Right off I think this is going to create a problem for a lot of buyers who likely were expecting an ""action RPG"" as while it certainly does have some of those characteristics, make no mistake, this is a very difficult game at times. 

The combat is definitely souls inspired though it is quite unique in some ways, as there is effectively no base blocking mechanic but rather you basically build up energy to unleash heavier attacks and you can do so via dodging perfectly or many basic hits on an enemy (to put it simply). At first as a souls enjoyer I struggled to understand what they were expecting and the combat initially felt clumsy and not at all tight. 

But once you lock in and start learning how to perfectly dodge, there is nothing more satisfying than pulling off multiple perfect dodges back to back, with a very satisfying audio and visual effect to indicate you did pull off a perfect dodge. But it took me hours of dying to the first 'boss' (Wandering Wight) to finally realise the combat is fast, punishing but immensely satisfying and I think that is being overlooked with all the drama surrounding the game. 

That being said, I would have loved a ranged option to deal with the very annoying archers that appear regularly and for a monkey man, he seems to have a distinct lack of climbing ability which seems a bit odd

On that note, we all probably know the premise of the story and it is presented beautifully, if slightly confusing if you are unfamiliar with the source material. The Chinese mythological setting of the game is not something I have played in often if at all, so it makes for an interesting and original setting for me and the fact it is absolutely beautiful and atmospheric is just icing on the cake here. They have created some full AAA quality cutscenes to move along telling the story and they feel not unlike the grand cutscenes in God of War in scope and quality, they really have done a great job here in my opinion. 

The world is absolutely beautiful with a very distinct Unreal 5 look to it, though it is very linear with some limited exploration to be had but you will often find an invisible wall stopping you from venturing off the trail and they maybe could have been a bit more creative with how they keep you in the limits of the map without just straight up invisible walls but for me this is just a minor complaint. 

Sound is great and of course the graphics are stunning, though of course with the caveat that this is an Unreal 5 game and it uses all the latest visual fluff, so don't think you're going to max this out on your GTX 1050 and have good time. But it scales well and if you follow guides like the Hardware Unboxed optimisation guide you should be able to get it running well on very modest hardware. 

In summary I think this is one game that surprisingly lived up to the hype, while it isn't perfect I think overall these guys have done an amazing job for their first big release and it could very well end up being one of the top games of this year. 

I think a big thing to understand as a potential buyer going into this game, is that it is VERY difficult at times and this I am sure is going to catch a lot of people out as an unpleasant surprise.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 732,771 user reviews for this game are positive.",time not_a soul corrected time not_a soul turn yeah soul problem buyer expecting action role certainly characteristic no_mistake difficult time combat definitely soul inspired unique way effectively no_base blocking mechanic rather basically build energy unleash heavier attack via dodging perfectly basic hit enemy simply soul enjoyer struggled understand expecting combat initially clumsy not_at tight lock learning perfectly dodge satisfying pulling multiple perfect dodge satisfying audio visual effect indicate pull perfect dodge took hour dying bos wandering wight finally realise combat fast punishing immensely satisfying overlooked drama surrounding loved ranged deal annoying archer appear regularly monkey man distinct lack climbing bit odd note probably premise presented beautifully slightly confusing unfamiliar source material chinese mythological setting not_something make interesting original setting beautiful atmospheric icing cake created aaa quality cutscenes move along telling not_unlike grand cutscenes god war scope quality great world beautiful distinct unreal 5 linear limited exploration invisible wall stopping venturing trail maybe bit creative limit straight invisible wall minor complaint sound great course graphic stunning course caveat unreal 5 us latest visual fluff t_emphasizedhink max gtx 1050 good scale follow guide hardware unboxed optimisation guide able running modest hardware summary lived hype perfect guy amazing big release top game big understand potential buyer difficult time catch unpleasant surprise
2139460,Once Human,"Pros:

- Not grindy. Unless you want to min-max otherwise I made it to level 50 solo without needing to grind resources or mods. Just follow the progression and do the side quests and you'll be fine. Until you get to endgame. I'll get to that in a sec. Also, this is only for the first ""novice"" scenario, Manibus. I have no idea what the next seasons or scenarios will be like since I'm not there yet.

- Can play solo. Like I said, I completed all the main and side quests in Manibus completely solo, which is nice, but can't comment on future seasons.

- Base building. Best part about the game IMO despite it being janky af. Just try not to lose your sanity attempting to connect the pieces where you want them to esp roof pieces.

- Beautiful environment

- Crisp audio. From gunshots to enemy sounds, it's great. I like it.

- Radio stations. Subjective, but I like it so it's going on the list. Esp 107.2 FM. Nice and chill.


Cons:

- Buggy. Ranges from ultra frustrating to progress-breaking, tho they have fixed some these issues, but not nearly there yet.

- Performance issues. Inconsistent frame rates, %100 CPU usage and pop-ins that would make Todd Howard proud.

- Slow and unresponsive command inputs. You gotta spam your F key if you wana pick up items, plant crops, open doors, etc. Same with using items in your hotbar. This can be troublesome if you need to heal quick in combat. It's frustrating.

- Painfully generic story, poor dialogue and forgettable characters. They clearly took inspiration from games like Death Stranding and Control, but only the aesthetics and none of the substance.

- Braindead AI. I know the bar for enemy AI is really low these days but somehow Once Human managed to go even lower. Took out an entire camp while all the hostiles are busy attacking a squirrel completely ignoring me mag dumping on their faces. You can shoot an unsuppressed rifle a few meters directly in front of a group of enemies and they won't care. You can kill one of them and the others will simply just walk to where their buddy died. And you'll be fighting the same dumb enemies over and over again. They'll even respawn if you walk too far from their spot making ""clearing"" strongholds tedious.

- Bosses are meh. Figuring out their phases and weakspots is hilariously easy and the higher level ones are just more bullet spongey and hit harder.

- Copy-paste buildings. Yes the environment is great, but a lot of the structures are exactly the same inside and out.

- Cringe outfits and weapon skins. If you like normal looking guns you're gonna have a bad time. Seriously, why can't we have an option for normal skins for higher level guns? Even the enemies have normal looking guns so why can't we? Why can't I use the regular MPS7 skin for the DIV-EVO? Or the KAM Pioneer skin for the Crank or Abyss Glance? Some Rosatta soldiers have black ARs. Why put that in the game if players can't have it? I want my black AR. The textures are there, just please, for the love of god, let us use it. Or at the very least let us be able to paint the guns black.

- Sub-menus within sub-menus within sub-menus. You unknowingly completed some challenge and are rewarded for it, but you gotta first find it deep in the bowels of their sub-menus to claim it. Good luck.

- Atrociously confusing, incomplete and sometimes incorrect information on index. Get used to Googling everything.

- Server wipes. Yeah yeah I know you can migrate a lot of your stuff and keep your blueprints and looting isn't difficult and there's Eternaland blah blah blah I don't wanna deal with it. If the gameplay loop was actually fun then it would have been fine, but I can't be arsed to do all that again just to rebuild my memetics and level up. Plus, this puts pressure on the player to log in and play making it difficult to enjoy the game on your own pace. I see no reason why this should even be a thing for PVE servers.

- Endgame. After completing all main and side quests you'll have nothing left to do but build your base, collect pokemons or grind to max out your gear. How engaging the grind will be will vary per player, but since I don't like the gameplay I found the endgame very boring.

- Dude that airplane deviant looks badass! Can't wait to fight it! Climbs the mountain to get to it. Climbs on its back it to begin event. Oh damn it's taking off! We gonna fight in the air??? Sick! Nope. It's balloons. You shoot balloons while riding around on its back. Then when it's over you just unceremoniously teleport to some random spot on the ground. This disappointed me more than I ever could my own parents.


Additional notes:

I work from home and usually just have the game running in the background while doing other things hence the high number of hours played. Most of that is me just AFK while talking with a client or spent base building.

I don't consider being a free game as a pro because these free games with mobile gaming business strategies make more money than a more ""traditional"" type of paid game. It's free, but they will purposely lower the quality of the gaming experience in some way in order to pressure the player into paying for something that is usually overpriced (like a piece of cosmetic that's worth a full game). This practice is very anti-consumer, manipulative and the reason why a lot of games suck these days and Once Human is no different compared to other free games in this regard.

That being said, there is some enjoyment to be had here and I'm sure plenty of you will find that out for yourselves especially after they smoothen the rough edges and fix the bugs, which I'm fairly confident they will in time.

Some of these cons (like the one about cosmetics) are completely personal and subjective. I know a lot of you don't mind goofy looking skins and a good number of you really enjoy that. If so then more power to you. But for players like me that prefer a more serious aesthetic that IMO works better with the game's dark atmosphere, the budget pokemons, wacky outfits and Fortnite-looking guns do the immersion a disservice. Cute and scary can work, but it doesn't here.

The game also has PVP, but I'm not interested in it, didn't touch it so I have no opinions about it.

So it's mostly not grindy, but gameplay is also disappointing. I would actually prefer if it was more grindy but with good combat. Take a game like Warframe for example. Super grindy, but I don't mind coz combat  is badass.


Conclusion:

It's free so try it out yourself. I came in with very low expectations knowing it's a free-to-play mobile game ported to PC. It got me hooked on the first few hours and it took some time before I discovered everything I hate about it but by then I had already invested too much time building a base I really like to stop playing. From then on it gave just the very bare minimum for me to log in and play some more, but it's no longer enjoyable. Will most likely stop playing in a week or two or if something better comes out or if one of my wishlist items goes on sale.

If you're looking for something free to sink a few hours in then have at it. But if you're in search of a new main game to invest hundreds of hours into then keep in mind that the disappointment might not hit you right away.

You might or might not have a similar experience but for me considering the bugs, pathetic combat, awful cosmetics and poor endgame experience, it's gonna be a no.


Update:

While playing I was randomly logged out then the game crashed. Annoying, but nothing out of the ordinary. Relaunching the game took a lot longer than usual but when I finally made it to the main menu I realized my character had been erased. Great. Repair client option doesn't work.

But I understand now.
Salt tastes good.

This game is hella fun and succesful jukes can be pretty satisfying, especially when you get those 'heat of the moment' scenarios and the monster just completely loses you and runs off in the opposite direction while you cheekily crouch in the middle of a cornfield. Or those satisfying times when you see a sneaky survivor in the distance, crouching behind a rock or climbing into a locker, thinking they're safe, only for you to round the corner and deliver the final blow before they even know what's happened.

Though there are some bugs I've encountered:

- There's the basic falling through the ground bug but that happens in a lot of games and it's only happened to me once in DbD, when I was playing as the Trapper. It didn't blink me back to the map after falling for a certain amount of time either. Just got stuck there in skybox oblivion forever. Free win for those four, lucky souls. (Oh god don't do it! If you play as the Nurse, for the love of God, don't try to blink up the basement stairs.)

- Survivors try to jump over barricades or hide in cabinets, but getting caught by the monster and picked up during these animations sometimes causes the survivors to glitch out and get stuck in the air. They even orbit parralel to, and around the monster, like they're attached to a certain point of him, as he spins around. Everyone is confused and visually it's hilarious. The monster can just drop them on the ground and pick them up again which fixes the issue, but it really breaks your immersion when you see this happen. Still funny though.

- Playing as a survivor, occasionally any kind of interaction with a monster can cause your game to crash, which is a pretty terrible bug considering the rules of the game. I sometimes notice people 'disconnect' after they get picked up or hooked by a monster. I thought they might just be rage-quitting, and I'm sure there's plenty of that out there, but after my own game has crashed at exactly these points (right after a monster's finished their animation of picking me up, or placing me on a hook) my game just ctd's and I can't help but wonder if it happened to those people as well. This is pretty rare; I've got just under 150-ish hours and it's only happened to me three times, but it's still pretty concerning when it does.

- Adding to that last bug if you're playing as a killer, on the off chance that a disconnected players character magically remains in the game, absolutely DO NOT try to interact with them. I know it looks like an easy kill, as they just stand there complacently, but that empty body is now actually a deadly trap (for killers). Don't pick them up and don't try to hook them. You will get stuck and freeze anywhere between 10-20 seconds (in my experience) for reasons I still haven't yet deciphered. You CAN try and slash them and leave them on the ground to bleed out, but that's as far as I would go in that regard. Also, this happened to me only once whilst playing as the Trapper.

Regardless of all this, there is still a pretty solid game hidden underneath. You'll be enjoying yourself (or stressing out about being hunted down like an animal) more than dealing with any bugs and whatnot.

Equipment, add-ons, and offerings are all consumable so use 'em as you get 'em or hoard them all like some sort of digital kleptomaniac (like me), because you can only use them once. But perks are good. You get to keep those, for the most part. (You'll lose your perks and have to earn them again if you choose to 'prestige' but if you decide not to then you keep them forever.) Make a bee-line for perks as soon as they show up on the bloodweb or you'll regret it.

The hefty buggery brings the score down quite a bit and if you're looking for a perfect experience then you will probably be disappointed. In that case I'd strongly recommend waiting for those bugs to be fixed before making a purchase. However, 98% of the time I'm still having great fun, so at the very least I'll give it a 5/10. Or a 6 if we're being generous. Pretty good. I still recommend it overall.

The game is highly optimized for hardware
What we see is unquestionable loyalty to the legend of the Monkey King

The music of the game is faithful and at the same time charming and reminiscent of old Chinese movies
I am very happy to see that the legend of the monkey king finally got what it deserved
The graphics of the game are very stunning and jaw dropping
No matter how much the beauty of the game is talked about, it is still not enough
The game has many, many battles and various boss fights based on ancient mythology, which easily maintains loyalty to ancient Chinese mythology
The first time I saw the Monkey King was in the movie Empire, and after that in the game Dota 2, so we can conclude that the Monkey King has not been treated much throughout history.
It can be said that like the great and beautiful works of history like Resident Evil and Dark Souls or Cyberpunk, it is worth countless repetitions
I hope I have expressed the respect that was in the ancient myth of the monkey king

1790600,DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO,"Great successor to the tenkaichi trilogy but not as comprehensive. Gameplay is extremely good from what Tenkaichi 3 achieved. It builds on the existing system and expands on it. This isn't a step back in terms of gameplay.

The accessory and outfit systems are considerably under utilised. Most characters don't seem to have any outfits or accessories. They're mainly for Goku/Vegeta/Gohan in all their incarnations across the series.

Maps are good, detailed and large but lack any dragonball flair. Maps lack any essence that they take place in the dragonball world. Things like capsule Corp branding and familiar landmarks in the background. There are 12 individual maps compared to 23 from tenkaichi 3. 

No real offline modes to sink into. Things like dragon arena in Budokai 3 or Ultimate Battle in Tenkaichi 3 are absent. I prefer offline battles, and it's a bit empty just redoing tournaments and selecting opponents everytime.

The two game modes the game has right now are very fun.

There is definitely tension as the match progresses, but the inclusion of the character's animation to nod or shake your head to call out your opponents, and voice chat adds a lot of funny moments.

After playing BT1 and 3 on the PS2 a long time ago this game just completely returns me to those times.

The game is a straight 10/10. However, there are just some small things that I dislike. For example, the small amount of stages which mostly are just the same stage with daytime differences. The soundtrack isn't nearly as good as the old Budokai Tenkaichi games. Although, I guess it has to do with nostalgia, so its fine.

But on the bright side, the combat is fast paced and feels good.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"They did it. A solid and fun RPG today, but I think as time progresses, I think it will be eventually remembered as a beautiful and poignant story and piece of art, like how we view a classic work of literature today, like a Joseph Conrad novel or For Whom The Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway (both authors works are referenced which the writers make clear nods to). I'm so happy I played it and avoided all spoilers. Absorb the story and world as you would a good book or TV series.

The best way to describe the relationship of the main game and the DLC's attributes is using a real world analogy: If the main game (NC) is Hong Kong, then Phantom Liberty (Dogtown) is the Kowloon Walled City. If you think you knew Hong Kong, wait until you learn how insane the Kowloon Walled City was. Apart from the main themes of the Cyberpunk RPG like capitalism gone amok, I liked how the game raises a point how our mortality forces us to question our life choices and the meaning of life. And how time waits for no one.

What really shocked me was how well written and how fun Phantom Liberty DLC was, and how it even surpassed the main story line in story quality, characters and world-building at times.

Regarding lifepaths, personally I think corpo V is the best V since it narratively ties in very well with Arasaka and the price of being a corporate wage slave and the corpo opening scene is my personal favourite of all three, and it even gives the opportunity to show how bloodthirsty the world is and allow V's voice actor to show both strength and vulnerability in a single scene. Corpo V also has some great lines I love. But streetkid and nomad lifepaths also ties in very nicely with achieving your best, and the finding your family in life respectively. Each lifepath also gets 1 unique mission. But ultimately the lifepaths is mostly for flavour and does not affect V's main story in significant ways.

This game affected me quite personally. Some parts I even cried, or even felt that visceral rage at the injustice or powerlessness of some characters, which no other game I played has ever done before. Wonderful voice acting, character design, character animation, fun combat, music, world building. The last time I felt the same way was The Last Of Us released almost a decade ago, and that really got me to seeing video games seriously as a new emerging medium for good stories. And good stories do not necessarily must have happy endings, but good ones meant to provoke thought and feelings, and the writers understood that incredibly well.

I played Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, The Longest Journey, Dreamfall and somehow I feel that they taken the best parts of those games which are flawed in their own ways (some more than others) and put it into Cyberpunk 2077 and the DLC. Really helps that you get to pilot a robot in a point and click adventure style reminiscent of the Longest Journey. I was impressed that the DLC has that Cynosure horror level which also surprised me, a nod to their ability to integrate the psychological horror of Alien Isolation. Perhaps I'll go so far as to say it surpasses the quality and dread you will feel from the ""Ocean House Hotel"" level within Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines. Not to mention Judy's cabin mission and underwater level is unforgettable.

The music in this game is fantastic. Even the character creation menu has its own theme song, and that is one of my favourite pieces. There is even a Chopin piece played by Arasaka's sister, a complete break from the usual electronic or rock music played in the BGM and in world music. That should tell you how awesome the music is. You even get to hear some of Silverhand's band Samurai's rock music pieces. There is a whole station playing songs from Nina Kraviz as you drive through Night City. She even appears as a minor ripperdoc character, which is ironic because she is a trained dentist while V makes an offhand remark to Viktor that they feel like being at a dentist's.

This game had characters that talked like human beings, have their own fears and desires which drive their characters which drive the story. Cherami Leigh has delivered one of the best performances in this game as V, and she has acting range, from joy to anger to fear and despair, you'll feel every moment of it. It certainly helps that Keanu Reeves plays Johnny Silverhand and V's wingman, and is with you almost throughout the entire story, and it would be a completely different game without him throwing his opinions, grows as a character and has his plot brings in the same existential questions about the nature of consciousness as Soma did. I expected Idris Elba to become Stringer Bell from the Wire, but what I saw was a restrained performance of a conflicted and world weary government agent, but in a way that is realistic and still ultimately human. Carla Tassara as Judy really performed and gave one of the most heartbreaking and real performances I felt in a video game ever in one of the scenes, felt too close to home at one point that I had to stop and take a breather. Erica Lindbeck as Misty in both the main game and DLC as V's mother figure had her moments as well, especially in the storage room outside the El Coyote Cojo Bar (another extremely real scene) and also at the ending of the DLC on the staircase. Michael Gregory as Johnny Mnemonic's Spider inspired Viktor Vektor delivers some great scenes as V's father figure in the main game and DLC. The scene where Arasaka Sr and Jr are fighting in Japanese is on another level, like you are watching a forbidden family drama unfold in a foreign language. There are many more voice actors that bring in their best in this, so it is best you experience their performances yourself.

They got into some deserved criticism over game breaking bugs or over-promising in their marketing. But at this point, I think it just became irrelevant in hindsight with the eventual fixes and expectations becoming re-balanced after COVID. Also helped that the Cyberpunk anime on Netflix and DLC attracted new players who were previously uninterested in the game, and see the game for what it is: a masterpiece that needed more time for polish, minor features and fixes. They did not compromise on the story and characters and acting and world building, and that everything technical can always be patched in the end.

It is a shame that the REDengine it runs on will no longer be used in the next Cyberpunk and choosing Unreal instead: this game alone proves it can be used for horror, RPGs (Vampire the Masquerade cough cough with safe areas), racing etc.

I don't know how the team in CD Projekt Red pulled this off, but thank you for making a piece of art that will surely be remembered fondly for generations.

This review is borderline rambling because I'm speaking from the heart for the most part. It's better you experience it first hand yourself instead of watching someone else play it over YouTube because there is much more depth and beauty in this game that should be experienced first hand. If you're still skeptical, I can only quote Silverhand in Keanu Reeves's best scene in the game as he delivers his monologue (or manifesto? hehe), followed by his best line in the game: ""You still don't see it.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I'm what has come to be known as a World of Warcraft refugee. I started playing Warcraft back in 2004 and stayed faithful to the popular MMORPG through all of its nearly 14 year run. It was in it's latest expansion however where I had to finally admit the game isn't what it once was. 
The expansion felt like a template of those that had come before it but not as fun. 

A close friend of mine told me about Final Fantasy XIV and how I might prefer it so on that advice alone, I jumped ship. I was a little apprehensive at first when discovering that the game first launched back in 2010. 'I've missed so much!' I thought, but continued anyway. 

From creating my character (an Archer named Amaethon who also has a flair for carpentry) to playing for about an hour, my mind was blown. I couldn't believe I've slept on this game for as long as I have. 

Final Fantasy XIV is not some Warcraft clone, in my opinion, after 37 hours of game time I would say FFXIV in many ways is a superior game. The in-depth story, plentiful amusing side quests, the characters, the beautiful scenery, getting to ride a chocobo!, joining a free company (guild) and getting to buy housing that you can by furniture for. The game has built into it, so many really fun mechanics. 

I think the biggest change for me though with comparing the both games is how much the community differs. The players. I feel more at home within the Final Fantasy community in a way I never really did in Warcraft. Everyone I've met so far in game are just genuinely lovely people who've helped me a lot.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"""Contains Spoilers."" 52 hrs. Completed all quests. I will judge this game as a sequel.

I honestly can't recommend this Dragon Age to the old fans of Dragon Age at full price, or really at all, even after finishing. It was a drag.
Quick summary, game is overall more about acceptance, diversity, and moving on in life.
Few good things, ran perfectly fine, environment looks great, and there's lot to explore.

Combat is ok, it's a simplified hack & slash, button spamming style. Light or strong attacks. Mages are practically just warriors, then battle mages, then full on mages near the end. (Dependent on mana build.)
Enemies mainly hard focus you instead of your teammates. This sucks when you're trying to do a combo, but easily avoided by just activating an ability and you don't take damage.
Cartoony, whimsical, cutesy feel I don't prefer for Dragon Age. This includes the enemies. Just unappealing,and not very interesting. Dragon fights are also all the same. So after you kill 1, you know how to beat the rest.

Dialogue is horrible, you hear and repeat the same stuff nearly every cut scene. You ok, you sure you're fine, we got to do this, we're going to do this, bla bla bla. This never changes, the whole game is like this. You will hear the same thing repeated constantly over and over.
I pick an elf, I seemingly don't know anything about elf history or even speak like I'm an elf in the dialogue 90% of the game. Race use to be a part of DA and have an impact on dialogue.
Solas is instantly backlined in the first act. He's not the big threat that was built up. Solas was useless, the whole game, then sacrificed at the end.

Your companion quests, are also just the same thing on repeat. Example being Harding, gets new powers, ""I got these powers, who am I, what am I."" You're still Harding. Next conversation same thing, and again, and again, confront her inner feelings, repeat again...This is the same thing for each companion quest. Davrin, just the whole time talks about how to train his Griffon and if hes good at it. Taash the kid that never grows up and fights with identity acceptance as a non binary and has mommy issues that you need to constantly back her on.
Romance was crap, (Bellara route), kiss > cut to black > finished. 

The world, the game, and how everyone acts and talks doesn't even really feel like there's a threat. This doesn't really change much. Gets more gloomy near the end, but it's practically the same as like DA 2 was in the sense, but more cheerful.
Too much positivity, as weird as it sounds, this game is too good, you can't really be bad, even the ending. Spoiler, at least 2/3 endings I did were the same outcome, just how you reach it changes. Narrative choices have an impact, but 90% of the time I didn't feel they were that big of an impact. Biggest impact is you just grinding the game. Pick whatever choice you want mostly. They're all good choices, just different tones of good. There is no like, you suck, you threw the fight, you cost us, maybe you shouldn't be a part of the team, nothing like that. There just wasn't much risk taking involved in this.","Mostly Positive71% of the 24,035 user reviews for this game are positive.",contains spoiler 52 hr completed quest judge sequel honestly recommend age old fan age price finishing drag quick summary acceptance diversity moving life good thing ran perfectly fine environment look great explore combat ok simplified hack slash button spamming style light strong attack mages practically warrior battle mages mages near dependent mana build enemy mainly hard focus teammate suck trying combo easily avoided activating t_emphasizedake damage cartoony whimsical cutesy prefer age includes enemy unappealing not_very interesting fight kill 1 beat rest dialogue horrible hear repeat stuff nearly cut scene ok fine bla_emphasized never_changes hear repeated constantly pick elf seemingly elf history speak elf dialogue 90 race da impact dialogue solas instantly backlined act not_the big threat built solas useless sacrificed companion quest repeat example harding get power power harding next conversation confront inner feeling repeat companion task objective given non davrin talk train griffon he good taash kid never_grows fight identity acceptance non binary mommy issue constantly romance crap bellara route kiss cut black finished world act talk threat get gloomy near practically da 2 sense cheerful positivity weird sound good bad ending spoiler 2 3 ending outcome reach change narrative choice impact 90 big impact biggest impact repeatedly performing action gain resource pick whatever choice mostly good choice different tone good no_like suck threw fight cost maybe risk taking involved
2300320,Farming Simulator 25,"This game brings some truly impressive upgrades and feels like a step forward in the series. The graphics have been significantly enhanced—everything from the landscapes to the vehicles looks more polished and realistic, which really brings the farming experience to life. The lighting effects, weather, and seasonal changes make every in-game day feel dynamic, adding an extra layer of immersion as you work through the seasons and watch your farm grow.

One of the highlights for me is the improved vehicle physics. Driving tractors, combines, and other machinery feels more authentic; the handling has been refined, so working the fields feels smoother and more realistic. The game also integrates popular features from previous mods, like GPS guidance and seasonal cycles, directly into the gameplay. This addition makes it convenient for players like me who previously had to rely on mods, and it’s nice to see these features officially supported.

Managing crops is satisfying and, for the most part, well-balanced, and it feels rewarding as you go through each phase, from planting to harvesting. Livestock management, while still primarily menu-driven, has been streamlined, making it easier to tend to animals while focusing on expanding other areas of the farm. Though it would be great to have even more interactive options here, what’s offered is solid.

There’s a small downside with some initial stuttering as the game builds its shader cache, which can interrupt the immersion, especially during the first few hours. I’m hopeful that the developers will address this in an upcoming patch, as it seems to be a common concern among players.

Overall, this game is a joy to play, especially if you’re a fan of the series or the genre. The blend of new features and refinements makes it feel fresh without straying from the core farming experience. With a few fixes, this could easily be the best installment yet in the series, and I’m excited to keep building up my farm!

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"After spending 15 years in World of Warcraft, I think I've finally found a new home. Final Fantasy XIV is at once familiar and unfamiliar for an MMO veteran, and likely will not appeal to anyone who plays these games solely for the dungeons and raiding. But if you've been dying for a well-written MMO that isn't held back by schlocky, fan-servicy plot twists, then look no further, my friend. Final Fantasy XIV may just be for you.

Unfortunately, the time commitment it takes for the story to pay off here is quite steep. Things begin incredibly slow, and if you're put off by long-winded and flowery monologues, you'll likely find yourself falling asleep through the first 40 or so levels of gameplay. But for anyone who's considering buying a level boost to get to the GOOD stuff as soon as possible, I STRONGLY urge you to hold off. Yes, that means trudging through menial tasks for far too long. It means running numerous errands that'll have you backtracking all over the world in what feels like wild goose chases. But it also means you'll be building and nurturing relationships with the main characters of the story, and this is vital for the enjoyment of important plot developments further into the game. Characters I'd once been annoyed with had become dear to me over the dozens of hours I'd spent with them. And when the shit hits the fan, which it is wont to do, it makes the emotional beats of the story that much more poignant. So skipping past a good chunk of the story just to hit Shadowbringers right away would mean missing out on what makes the story in Shadowbringers so good in the first place, the excellent build up of its plot and characters. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1873056544
Ah but I've barely even touched upon the gameplay. Well, if you've played WOW or one of its clones, FFXIV will be quite familiar, although with several small caveats. With a 2.5 second global cooldown on abilities, combat can feel sluggish in the beginning. This improves as you gain more abilities, including several that are off the GCD. But even when you start getting all of those lovely skills, the Duty Finder (Group Finder) scales your level down for lower dungeons, somewhat like Timewalking in WOW, and you often don't keep all of those abilities. So if you end up outleveling the Main Scenario Quest, which will likely happen, you may end up losing useful buttons when running certain dungeons. And when a smooth and satisfying rotation relies on said buttons, losing them for a dungeon or raid can be quite the annoyance. Then there's having to click through several menus to get to things, and being unable to click out of them without having to backtrack through those very same menus. I'm sure all of this is a result of the game being developed for PC and consoles alike (and needing to be playable with a gamepad), but it's an irritation I could live without. Still, none of these things are deal breakers when the lore and gameworld is so beautifully and deeply crafted that you simply don't want to log out of it.

FFXIV looks and sounds beautiful. Perhaps you may be scratching your head over that statement as the game is nearly 6 years old with graphics and animations that are already dated by today's standards, but the art design, lighting, and camerawork does wonders with the older game engine. The way the action is framed, the swells of the fantastic soundtrack, and the gorgeous particle effects all combine to create something uniquely stunning and emotive. No, this may not be as beautiful as the more recent Final Fantasy games, but it has the same charisma and charm. And did I mention the fantastic soundtrack?

Which once again brings me back to the story. As someone who has probably put more than an entire year's worth of game hours into WOW, I have never been more invested in an MMO story as I am now. All of the characters are interesting in their own ways with clear story arcs that make sense for them. There are deaths. There is politics. There are ACTUAL shades of gray in the storytelling. There are villains with motivations that I understand and don't entirely disagree with. There's loyalty and betrayal, humor and pathos. I love these characters and I love this world, and I truly TRULY hope Square Enix continues adding onto it in the way they have. If they do, I swear I will be here for it all.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"***ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS WERE BEFORE TAMRIEL UNLIMITED***

Yes, this game was pretty bad before the free update. They knew that no one would like the paid subscription and so they finally made it free (after initial purchase).

This game is a MUST HAVE for Elder Scrolls fans, and players who want a ""new"" type of MMO.

PROS:
+ Good Combat System, No turn taking, and no point and spam keys.
+ No ""Grab this, kill ten of these"" Quests are INTERESTING AND FUN.
+ Lore is great, I really get immersed in this game.
+ NOT PAY TO WIN.
+ GOOD ECONOMY. I can buy iron ore 12g in one area and sell it to another player 15g in a different area.
Also no Crowns for Gold, So rich people cant mess up the economy.
+ Decisions affect gameplay.
+ Feels like a single player game, plays like an MMO.
+ First person, third person, and birds eye veiw for all players and preferences.
+ Amazing soundtrack.
+ No paid subscription.
+ No lowkey *BUY OUR STUFF PLZ* (ex. Guild wars 2 chest drops and keys.)
+ Quick and fast customer support.
+ PvP is very fun. Destroying forts with siege equipment is a blast.

Cons:
- Character creator is absolute trash. needs WAY more hairstyles and body mods.
- Must do quests to level up. Grinding takes forever.
- Needs more classes besides 4 basic ones.
- Needs more spells.
- Wish it had more of a ""I am me"" feel. 
- Shopkeepers will give you 1 gold for items that took your FOREVER to get.

The good outweighs the bad TREMENDOUSLY. Buy this game, have fun and recommend it! Lets get this to overwhelmingly positive like it deserves.


***EDIT***

After playing for some time, I started to play with a friend. We started two new characters and were going to complete quests together.

The group questing needs some major improvements.

Suggestions to the Developers:

+Add need/greed system
+If I complete an objective, my partner should NOT have to complete that same objective.
+Players should have a ""Waiting for buddy"" before going to next area/ talking to an NPC.
+Players should be able to teleport to buddy, their exact location if they become to far apart.
+Players should be able to ""duel"" friends or other players.","Very Positive83% of the 123,718 user reviews for this game are positive.",negative review tamriel unlimited yes pretty bad knew no_one paid subscription finally initial purchase scroll fan player type massively multiplayer pro good combat no_turn taking no_point spam key no_grab kill ten quest interesting fun lore great immersed not_pay win good economy iron ore 12g 15g different no_crowns gold rich cant mess economy decision affect feel single play massively multiplayer third bird eye veiw player preference amazing soundtrack no_paid subscription no_lowkey stuff plz ex guild war 2 chest drop key quick fast customer support versus fun destroying fort siege equipment blast con creator absolute trash need hairstyle body mod quest repeatedly performing action gain resource take forever need class besides 4 basic one need spell wish shopkeeper 1 gold item took forever good outweighs bad tremendously fun recommend let overwhelmingly positive deserves started play friend started character complete quest group questing need major improvement suggestion developer add greed complete objective partner not_have complete objective player waiting buddy next talking non controlled artificial player able teleport buddy exact location far apart player able duel friend player
2183900,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","[h1]The Strongest 40K game for the Strongest Day[/h1]
For anyone with even the slightest interest in Warhammer 40,000, this game's arguably the best Warhammer 40,000 title to release after the bankruptcy of THQ, after 13 years of getting a bunch of shitty games that between 2018 and Boltgun's release, the best way to enjoy the Grim Darkness of the 41st Millennium in video games was honestly to create Space Marines in SoulCalibur VI. I'll admit i've only played the first missions of the main story and the co-op campaign respectively, though my first impressions of the game have me confident that I'm gonna get a lot of enjoyment from the rest of it.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Being a continuation of Relic Entertainment's Space Marine, combat is meant to have you split your attention between melee and ranged combat, and I feel like Saber Interactive did a much better job at making melee more viable compared to SM1, and I think the dodging and parrying mechanics were the main things that buffed the game's melee, cuz I remember that using your chainsword in the first game was a very fast way to get got by the Ork Boyz and Nobs, often really only being used in the campaign's jump pack sections.

One thing which I can already tell that people miss is SM1's health system. While I personally don't have issues with how health is handled in SM2, I feel like they could've introduced a temporary health mechanic similar to L4D's pain pills for the executions, cuz the armor blips tend to not last very long in the face of your ankles being bitten by multiple hormagaunts, and fodder enemies can be equated to death by a thousand paper cuts. This is a minor nitpick on my end, though one thing I've found from the first half of the second mission is a harsher criticism.

While other games might enjoy putting the player in a forced turret section, Space Marine 2 has forced flamethrower sections, where the game leaves a Pyreblaster near a door to inform the player that they will have to fight against Rippers, small legless creatures that are about the size of a house cat, but swarm you in the hundreds of thousands. It's annoying enough that firing the weapon slows your walking speed significantly, though the fact that they deal pathetically low damage is needless frustration, especiallly since the smaller mortal-sized flamers have been proven to be effective against Hormagaunt and (former) human alike in other forms of Warhammer 40,000 media.

Moving onto the co-op Operations mode, this to me feels like the co-op experience that fans have been craving since the days of the first Space Marine game. Though I've only really played the Vanguard, I found it to be a pretty solid experience, though I personally wish they added a Firstborn class in the game. To those unaware, Games Workshop has been trying to redesign the Space Marine identity from the ground up, though certain weapons from the earlier days of Warhammer 40,000 are unavailable to the modern depictions of the Adeptus Astartes.

[h1]Performance[/h1]
With Warhammer 40K being full of intricate gothic architecture you'd expect to find in a fantasy setting with the first antagonist you fight being a swarm of buglike creatures that hope to overwhelm you with their numbers, I think it's fair to expect a hardware-intense game. With the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X targeting 1440p and 30FPS, it's fair to say that it's a pretty demanding game. I'm personally on a Ryzen 3800X and RTX 3070, and while i'm on 1080p myself, the game typically hovers around 50-81 FPS, though there are occasionally some dips down to 41 in moments of high activity. While demanding, I wouldn't call it unstable since in the 6 hours I've clocked in so far, I've actually only had one crash, which is a huge improvement from how frequently the leaked build would crash on the same machine. I don't think more modest machines can realistically target 60fps without utilizing the game's built-in upscaling options, though I think the Dynamic Resolution option isn't functional.

[h1]Customization[/h1]
Those who have spent a lot of time personalizing their Space Marine in the first game are gonna be let down with the second one. With Games Workshop trying to push the Primaris Space Marines as the new face of Warhammer 40,000, the number of options available to customize your looks has been severely neutered, to such a degree they had to make colors and emblems unlockable. It's especially egregious in my personal opinion that the fully sealed Mk X Phobos helmet isn't in the game, since that at least is a callback to the old scowl helmets from the pre-9th Edition days of Warhammer 40K.

[h1]Conclusion and other minor nitpick[/h1]
While we might never get a chance to beat up those holier-than-thou knife-ears that Guilliman seems so attracted to these days, Space Marine 2 is definitely one of those games where an admittedly painful wait turned out to actually be worth the delay it ate, which is a welcome surprise when you consider that game delays in current year are a sign of the dev team thinking that their game's an absolute dumpster fire, especially with 40K. Do i think that this game will be the standard that other devs will follow when handling the license? Unfortunately, no. With that said, I think the June 2024 leak has proven to be a blessing in disguise, and I hope that Saber would at least consider releasing the prologue and first mission for free as a post-release demo.","Very Positive80% of the 87,349 user reviews for this game are positive.",strongest 40k strongest slightest interest 40 000 arguably best 40 000 title release bankruptcy thq 13 year bunch shitty game 2018 boltgun release best enjoy grim darkness 41st millennium video game honestly marine soulcalibur vi admit mission mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal series connected mission level form storyline impression confident gon na enjoyment rest continuation relic entertainment s_emphasizedpace combat meant split attention melee ranged combat saber interactive melee viable compared sm1 dodging parrying mechanic thing buffed melee cuz remember chainsword fast ork boyz nob series connected mission level form storyline pack section already miss sm1 health personally issue health handled sm2 introduced temporary health mechanic similar l4d pain pill execution cuz armor blip tend not_last long face ankle bitten multiple hormagaunts fodder enemy equated death thousand paper cut minor nitpick found half harsher criticism game enjoy putting forced turret section forced flamethrower section leaf pyreblaster near door inform fight ripper small legless creature size house cat swarm hundred thousand annoying firing weapon slows walking speed significantly deal pathetically low damage needle frustration especiallly smaller mortal sized flamers proven effective hormagaunt former human alike form 40 000 medium moving onto mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal operation mode feel mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal fan craving day vanguard found pretty solid personally wish firstborn class unaware game workshop trying redesign identity ground certain weapon earlier day 40 000 unavailable modern depiction adeptus astarte performance 40k intricate gothic architecture expect fantasy setting antagonist fight swarm buglike creature hope overwhelm number fair expect hardware intense playstation 5 xbox series x targeting 1440p 30fps fair pretty demanding personally ryzen 3800x rtx 3070 1080p typically hovers 50 81 shooter occasionally dip 41 moment high activity demanding call unstable 6 hour clocked far crash huge improvement frequently leaked build crash machine t_emphasizedhink modest machine realistically target 60fps utilizing built upscaling option dynamic resolution functional customization spent personalizing gon na game workshop trying push primaris marine face 40 000 number option available customize look severely neutered degree color emblem unlockable especially egregious personal sealed mk x phobos helmet callback old scowl helmet pre 9th edition day 40k conclusion minor nitpick never_get chance beat holier thou knife ear guilliman attracted day definitely game admittedly painful wait turned worth delay ate welcome surprise consider delay sign absolute dumpster fire especially 40k standard follow handling license unfortunately no_with june 2024 leak proven blessing disguise hope saber consider releasing prologue post release demo
1063730,New World: Aeternum,"New World should be a case study in how to ruin an amazing game concept and fail to capitalise on a monumental launch through incompetence, hubris and a misunderstanding of how to listen to and manage an emerging community.

This should have been the game to revolutionise the MMO space, which has been long stagnant and full of WoW wannabe's - and it had that potential; the gameplay was incredible, the feeling of PVP and scope of competition was exhilarating and fresh and the graphics and setting were immersive.

On launch, the game worked, and we enjoyed a few weeks of something genuinely new and exciting. Then the patches started. I don't even know where to begin with the complete mismanagement and sheer incompetence of what followed, but the bugs were game breaking, the response to incidents were farcical, the priorities were all over the place and the communication was terrible. The community began to sour almost immediately.

People started leaving, thinking they would come back when things improved.

Things got worse.

See, New World relies on populated servers for the PVP territory wars to function. Once people started leaving and some servers fell below the critical minimum for them to function, they needed merging with other servers in order to maintain the games functionality.

But they weren't ready for server merges, they hadn't prepared for it. So we waited. And more people left.

Then, the merges happened, and were so mismanaged that they broke guilds and further damaged the community. The communication was again awful. More people left. More merges were needed. Around and around we go. All the while they kept pumping out more untested patches, allowing unfinished development code to find its way into the main game and break even more things. The cycle seemed endless.

While these technical problems were ongoing, the devs continued to pump out ""balance"" changes to correct issues with the PVP. They made things worse. Certain weapon combinations were so clearly overpowered, while others seemed pointless being in the game at all. It became clear that the lead developers favoured certain weapon and armour combinations because it's what THEY played. This chronic imbalance continued for nearly 8 months before any significant shift began to appear. Their response? Continue to misunderstand the issues and patch things anyway. They seemed to be listening to the most outspoken and toxic members of the community without properly testing themselves.

It was like they weren't even playing their own game.

So they were called out by the community. ""Yeah, you think this works? YOU try playing it.""

They did. AFTER making patches to nerf the area the community was desperately trying to tell them about.

What followed was a farcical video of the devs playing their own game, in which it became clear that they had NO idea what they were doing. They got destroyed by their own game. AFTER nerfing it to stack the odds in their favour.

The problems continued. They shut down the forums they clearly couldn't manage, shifting to Discord for community communication. More mismanagement. Less communication.

People kept leaving.

At time of writing, the average online players in this ""MMO"" is just over 3000. That isn't enough to populate TWO servers. There are currently 12 servers live. One of them has 11 players on it.

New World is in its death throes. It's still a fun little RPG to play co-op with friends if you don't care about the PVP or the MMO element of the game, but that's about it.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"First off, I am a big fan of the Dragon Age universe. I fell in love with Dragon Age Origins, played Dragon Age 2, enjoyed the open-world of Dragon Age Inquisition and was looking forward to this installment in the series. Unfortunately it falls short of any expectations you may have had. While the graphics are amazing any other aspect of the game is poorly implemented. 

Combat can feel incredibly floaty at times with seemingly little weight behind your attacks. Enemies are just an amalgamation of colours rather than distinct opponents. The darkspawn, a major theme in the Dragon Age world, have become a side note. The world itself is no longer open-world but linear in its design, this does not have to be a major drawback but the depth of the gameplay has suffered with it. Whereas in Dragon Age Inquisition you had mounts, different potions and a real tangible inventory you now have.. nothing. There exists mere corridors to fight in and to perform the odd simple puzzle, none too riviting. Moreover the writing is not particularly strong in this game. 

Overall the game is a step backwards from Dragon Age Inquisition and you get less bang for your buck as it is much shorter. If you are a fan of the Dragon Age world you will still get some enjoyment out of it, no doubt, but not because of the greatness of its design. Any fun is fueled by the already established lore and the strength of the brand created by old Bioware. I would not recommend this game to anyone who hasn't already been craving a new Dragon Age game for ages, therefore a thumbs down from me.

230410,Warframe,"I've been playing Warframe since 2013, and still do today. 
A bad thing about Warframe -> people are lacking creativity. Most of the players seem to play like blind people, since almost every player is focused on ONE thing... Leveling up, and when they've reached the current max lvl they complain about a lack of content and nothing more to do...
Warframe is a game of customization, filled with opportunities to make every player fit in. Every weapon, Warframe, Archwing etc. can be good. People often seem to think that the prime/stalker weapons are the only thing to use, and that the ""how to mod: ____"" videos on YouTube is the only well working option to make a weapon good. But that is in most cases a big mistake from the players. Sure a starting mk.1 weapon is not as good as the prime one, and of cause there is nothing bad about getting modding inspiration from videos. The thing is, if you put enough effort into a Weapon/Warframe/Archwing/Companion, then that might just work just as good. Why try to make the Ignis good, if you don't like the way it's shooting, why not go for an old school Burston if that's what you prefer?

A lot of people seem to only focus on those things: ranking up and getting good loadouts. It's like people seem to forget what the game is trying to offer you. Try to do something different if you don't like the game. Join a clan, do some Archwing races, finish the quests, challenge yourself like how long can you defend the objective and even better, how long can your squard which you currently are chatting with, having a good time, laughing together about how stupid and yet addorable Clem is, defend the objective!

Don't be a douchebag and join a clan because they've got full research and no taxes. When you join a clan, think of it as you join a community, sure some clans are only out there because of the remaining items they need to reach max lvl.
Do yourself a favour and look for a clan with a great working community, it doesent have to be a big clan, it can be even more exiting to help a clan grow from the bottom, reqruit players, and experience how a community can be made from a single free to play game.

And don't come and say the game is pay to win, because it's not... As they added trading in Warframe, every player is able to get as much platinum as they want. The only thing they can't get without paying is the steam workshop items, and the prime access accessories.... But those are all cosmetics...

1401590,Disney Dreamlight Valley,"Don't get me wrong, the game is awesome. It's fun, it's great to have all these familiar Disney characters in an interesting world that you can design however you like. You can design your character in many different ways and the quests are mostly fun too.

So what is it that makes me give this a negative rating?

No, it's not the micro (or rather macro) transactions in the game for otherwise unobtainable items. While I'd prefer the game to have ways to obtain these items without spending even more real world money it's an aspect of the game I'm somewhat willing to accept. But what really frustrates the hell out of me is the blatant exploitation of FOMO in the players. While the seasonal events are fun in its own way, what's not fun is certain items from those events being completely unobtainable when said event is over. So many live-service-games (or whatever you want to call them) do this and I don't see why anyone would see this in a positive light. Just now I was trying to craft something but I couldn't find a certain ingredient anymore and after looking it up online found out the item is simply GONE for now. That's not fun. Meanwhile, old quest items that should have delete themselves when said quests were done somehow manage to glitch and are stuck with you forever. No fix from the devs for those. This might be petty or whatever but as long as this game doesn't get some type of vendor for past event items or properly integrates those items to the game I can't give this a positive rating.

UPDATE December 2023:
So now they've added an expensive story DLC (which they promised they'd never do) and it actually messes with the game in the worst ways. For example items only available in the DLC will now sometimes be required as gifts for villagers.

730,Counter-Strike 2,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.

I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product 

Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).

Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.

It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).

Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).

Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.

If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.

In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"--14AUG24 Update--
No motion on the 180~ish countries still locked out nor community-wide comment. Unfortunate.

People complaining about stuff. I do not understand why. Developer Team wrote a letter saying they realize it is a co-opertive PvE game and that fun should take priority over ""real-balance"". I rotate Stratagems and weapons routinely without issue. So I do not think it is an issue. More so players like to keep using their META and get poopy when something changes in it.

Escalation of Freedom update adds a bit of new stuff. All I know is this game is meant to evolve, with that evolution comes new enemies and missions. The META will not be a 'what I bring' question, but more of a 'how to fight' and 'where do we accept risk' question. My group got wrecked this past weekend trying to do a Diff9, twice. This is expected as the enemies evolve and new threats emerge. I am here for it. Would you like to know more?

--10MAY24 Update--
A new emergent enemy, Sony, reared its ugly head only to be struck down by the Community within 48 hours. Props to Arrowhead for creating such a realistic enemy faction.

Unfortunately, from what I hear there are still 180~ish Countries locked from accessing the game. So while the enemy was defeated before it could inflict PSN-linking it was able to shut down many Helldivers' ability to play.  Arrowhead is still talking through the issue with appropriate parties.  I just do not know if the culprit is Sony - setting the environment for account linking, or Steam - not willing to sell a product to countries because it may get locked eventually and already having refunded a portion of those gamers. Steam seems to be protecting their audience.

--02APR Update--
They just patched and extended the profile level-cap to 150. This comes with receiving lost EXP from playing beyond level cap so I automatically jumped from level 50 to 60. Many weapon balances which are good, and they quietly release new enemies. 

Yesterday I unlocked the last item of the 3 currently available Warbond unlock trees. 

Current Caps:
Simple Samples max at 500, Rare Samples max at 250, Super Samples max at 100, Warbonds max at 250, and Requisition Points max out at 50,000.

Super credits are found and earned at a good pace.

GOTY.

This game has been fluid for connecting and game play for about two weeks.  Still some stability issues, but finally, rarely occurring. Developers are working on the known issues with weekly updates. New content coming as the game evolves. We must defeat Joel!

--19FEB Update--
After experiencing the Automatons, I definitely bought the Super Citizen pack.  It gets you into the 'End Game' Premium Section upon purchase without spending the 1000 Super Credits.  I believe this game is and will be great!

This past weekend has shown me the Networking issues and crashing that are throughout the review comments. It is very unfortunate that this company is slow-rolling the server capacity upgrades.  They could pump to 700k or more and lower it as needed after the first month. Maybe, just maybe, it is a server throughput or software issue and capacity has nothing to do with it. Hopefully Tuesday's patch solves the bulk of connectivity issues. It is never good when a company throttles their own just-released game.

--Update--
I have found Super Credits during Mission at Quantities of 10x per pick-up.

--Review as of 1.8 hrs on 08FEB24--
I cannot speak to any crashing issues, because I have not crashed.
I cannot speak to any performance issues, because it runs flawlessly on my rig.
I cannot speak to any Multiplayer or Cross Platform just yet because I have not used it yet. 
Single player is possible for easier difficulties so far.

I thought I was going to be disappointed by this game (especially after reading the reviews), I was wrong.  It is exactly what I wanted. For me, this game feels good and is a good successor to the original game. Game play loop is strong so far.

***The ""Store"" and 'Premium Currency'.***  
BLUF: All material is available if you play the game without need of spending actual money.

I have to speak the truth on this because there are comments that do not understand what has been employed.  

First, there are a couple of things to note first:
-You have EXP (normal progression), Requisition Points (for unlocking Stratagems), Samples (different rarities for unlocking Ship Modules), and Warbonds (for unlocking weapons, cosmetics, etc.).
-All of the above resources are given for mission completion at a pace commiserate with difficulty of mission performed or found on mission. 
-There is what appears to be a seasonal progression type system with 10-steps and ~8-unlocks per step.  You have to buy up to X Warbonds-worth of weapon and cosmetics before progressing to the next step. ...and then a premium section (I will get to this).

YES, there is Premium Currency, ""Super Credits"" that you can spend real money on. 
HOWEVER, My observations:
-If you progress through the 10-steps you unlock 10x batches of  ""Super Credits"". (Total about 800x)
-There is a Premium Season that costs 1000x Super Credits. 
-Once admission is paid you can spend WARBONDS for the normal unlock process on the Premium stuff. Essentially a competing/secondary use for Warbonds.
-Also, Super Credits can be spent on the ""Super Store"" to unlock Cosmetics. (Currently only 4 things are available, rotates every 48 hours or so)

THEREFORE, you can buy Super Credits to get access to unlocking the Premium stuff if you want, or you can play the game and earn access then unlock as normal.  I think of it more like the 'End Game Material'.","Mostly Positive74% of the 674,223 user reviews for this game are positive.",14aug24 no_motion 180 ish country locked nor_community wide comment unfortunate complaining stuff not_understand developer wrote letter saying realize co opertive versus environment fun priority real balance rotate stratagem weapon routinely issue not_think issue player effective popular strategy character build poopy change escalation freedom add bit stuff meant evolve evolution come enemy mission the_emphasized effective popular strategy character build not_be bring question fight accept risk question group wrecked past weekend trying diff9 twice expected enemy evolve threat emerge 10may24 emergent enemy sony reared ugly struck community 48 hour prop arrowhead creating realistic enemy faction unfortunately hear 180 ish country locked accessing enemy defeated inflict psn linking able shut helldivers play arrowhead talking issue appropriate party not_know culprit sony setting environment linking not_willing product country locked eventually already refunded portion gamers protecting audience 02apr patched extended profile cap 150 come receiving lost exp cap automatically jumped 50 60 weapon balance good quietly release enemy yesterday unlocked last 3 currently available warbond unlock tree cap simple sample max 500 rare sample max 250 super sample max 100 warbonds max 250 requisition point max 50 000 super credit found earned good pace goty 06mar fluid connecting play week stability issue finally rarely occurring developer working known issue weekly update evolves defeat joel 19feb experiencing automaton definitely bought super citizen pack get premium section purchase spending 1000 super credit believe great past weekend shown networking issue crashing throughout comment unfortunate company slow rolling computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player capacity upgrade pump 700k lower needed maybe maybe a_emphasized computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player throughput software issue capacity hopefully tuesday software fix bug balance add feature solves bulk connectivity issue never_good company throttle released found super credit quantity 10x per pick 1 8 hr 08feb24 cannot_speak crashing issue not_crashed cannot_speak performance issue run flawlessly rig cannot_speak mode multiple player interact compete real cross platform not_used single possible easier difficulty far thought disappointed especially reading review wrong exactly wanted feel good good successor original game_emphasized play loop strong far premium currency bluf material available play spending actual speak truth comment not_understand employed couple thing note exp normal progression requisition point unlocking stratagem sample different rarity unlocking ship module warbonds unlocking weapon cosmetic resource given completion pace commiserate difficulty performed found appears seasonal progression type 10 step 8 unlocks per x warbonds worth weapon cosmetic progressing next premium section yes premium currency super credit spend real observation progress 10 step unlock 10x batch super credit total 800x premium season cost 1000x super credit admission paid spend warbonds normal unlock process premium stuff essentially competing secondary warbonds super credit spent super unlock cosmetic currently 4 thing available rotates 48 hour super credit access unlocking premium stuff play earn access unlock normal material

2379780,Balatro,"To be honest, I hate doing these kind of reviews because when I see ""several hundred hours of playtime but doesn't recommend? Yeah okay buddy."" But to be honest when looking back at my time with Balatro I think I would say it's not very fun. Addicting yes, but not fun.

I think the game suffers from several problems, mainly noticeable once you get off the ground of White Stake and start working at the harder difficulties. A lot of the synergies or combos you think will be very cool end up working in ways that are very anti-player, and it feels more often than not the game is actively rooting for you to fail. 

I could probably list off a ton of examples as to little things that have annoyed me over the course of this game but I'll just throw out a few. There are way too many instances of Ankh duplicating a Joker that just does not apply twice. Sixth Sense, a Joker which gives a spectral card and destroys a 6 if you play it as your first hand. Another Joker like this is Vampire, with a scaling multiplicative effect by draining enhancements from cards. If you have two vampires, only one will gain the buff. Now it's easy to say ""well that makes sense"", and you're right, it does. But the problem I have is how often I find myself in many many situations with this game saying ""Look, I get it. But that's not fun. It would've been cool if it had worked the other way.""

I haven't even commented on the fact that there just simply aren't enough Jokers that actually scale with your build so what used to be a fun game at White Stake becomes a reset grind in the higher difficulties to get a run actually started most of the time, because there are just a lot of Jokers that are simply not good enough for all the imposed restrictions at a higher stage. Which is hilarious because the dev has added an achievement for completing a Gold Stake run with EVERY JOKER IN THE GAME. 

Not every run in Balatro is winnable. Sometimes you are just destined to lose, and it feels like the game wants that for you. I don't feel that Balatro values my time, but I've admittedly come too far to not complete it now. Save yourself the frustration and try something else.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 47,019 user reviews for this game are positive.",honest hate kind review hundred hour playtime recommend yeah okay buddy honest not_very fun addicting yes not_fun suffers problem mainly noticeable ground white stake working harder difficulty synergy combo cool working way anti feel not_the actively rooting fail probably ton example thing annoyed course throw instance ankh duplicating joker not_apply twice sixth sense joker give spectral card destroys 6 play hand joker vampire scaling multiplicative effect draining enhancement card vampire gain strengthen improve effectiveness easy make sense problem many_emphasized situation saying not_fun cool worked commented simply joker scale build fun white stake reset grind higher difficulty started joker simply not_good imposed restriction higher stage hilarious achievement completing gold stake joker not_every winnable destined lose feel want value admittedly far not_complete save frustration else

[h1]8. [b]Completely DISCONNECTED from the community/Game & only focus on 1%'s Streamers[/b][/h1]
A Small tweet from a random 'influencer' can get something changed, but an outrage on Reddit/Twitter, Esports Articles etc for 10 months+ is ignored.

[b]Gave Streamers Anti-Cheat bypass[/b] & easy Lobby priorities, although plenty of them were very suspicious with a known bad record of being [u]cheat-banned multiple times, in multiple games[/u] (Fortnite, Apex, etc). [i]Infact, many of them came to Warzone as they were banned on those games...[/i] [b] If they're not cheating, WHY do they need Anti-Cheat whitelist?[/b]

Often limit gamemodes to Quads ONLY; not everyone is a Streamer with 4x Squad Party!

[h1]9. [b]HORRIBLE GUN BALANCE! - In Warzone 1, we've had over 200 guns from 3 COD Games[/b][/h1]
Yet 1-2 guns at most were what's used of each category. RavenSoftware are the WORST when it comes to [b]Gun Balance.[/b]

Some Snipers literally had 0.03% unused pickrate, and they were nerfed further whilst ARs that are on top gets heavy buffs. (For some reason they're always Anti-Snipers)

[b]Break a gun => Sell Bundles for it => Nerf in 2 months => Repeat.[/b]

[h1]10. [b]BLATANT bias towards Console Market[/b][/h1]
They're fully focusing on Controllers/Console right now, [u]at the cost of Mouse & Keyboard players.[/u]
[list]
[*]Please see [b]Point #6[/b] above.
[*]MWII CODNEXT Release was [u]stricly controller only[/u], M&K Streamers had to use controller a month prior on their stream to get ready for the event. As everyone was forced to use one.
[*]MWII Camos [b]UI Menu originally could only be accessed through controller, or keyboard arrow keys.[/b] Yes, even the menu. The mouse cursor did nothing on a $70 game in 2023.
[*][b]Forced Crossplay.[/b]
[*][b]Increased visual recoil+noise, M&K users might need attachments to reduce them[/b], where controllers AimAssist works through them effortlessly without any attachments to the gun.
[*]WZ1, [u]SPECIFICALLY[b] limited Snipers Headshots at specific ranges[/b] where AimAssist doesn't work.[/u]
[*][b]The ONLY scenario PC M&K users don't have a disadvantage over AimAssist is sniping at long range[i](Where AimAssist isn't as OP)[/i], where in WZ1 that got Aim-Assist range limited, WZ2 Sniping Headshot completely gone.[/b][/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h1] [i][u]Results:[/u][/i] [/h1]

That's why MWII is more balanced than Warzone 2.

That's why with RavenSoftware's influence, Warzone 2 got the same changes & nerfs they've done in Warzone 1 is now here in Warzone 2 (ie Snipers can't Headshot, but SMGs can kill you faster than blink).

[b]Warzone 2 would've been better if they kept it to Infinity Ward, how it was in 2020.[/b] Look what happened to Warzone 1, look where the game was & how it became thanks to RavenSoftware & the more they are in charge (Warzone Pacific).

RavenSoftware own employees have boycotted & protested and went on strikes before as decisions are often made without QA, and few execs call the shot for millions of players. (Such as Caldera!)

[u]If they hadn't updated Warzone 1 for 3 years, the game would've been 100x times better, and Warzone 2 wouldn't even be needed.[/u]
[hr][/hr]

[h1]Facts[/h1]
Majority came to MWII & Warzone 2 as they loved the old Warzone 1, and hoped Warzone 2 would bring that back, as RavenSoftware killed the first one.

To go from the [b]""Best Selling Numbers in COD HISTORY"" is very telling after VANGUARD[/b]; And to [b]""THE LOWEST WARZONE NUMBERS""[/b] is also telling when [u]you've got all the hype, sales, support & numbers[/u], but your studios are disconnected from the community.

Warzone 2 needs to copy everything Warzone 1 had in late 2020 & Raven's influence to vanish. Men lie, Women lie, numbers & stats don't.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"The problem with this game is - it's getting worse and worse with every new patch.
Apex Legends is still the best battle royale out there and the most fun shooter I've ever played. It's different. It's fast. It needs skill and movement is important. That's an S-Tier game concept.
Respawn also really did an amazing job lore wise. You don't play some ""I don't care"" characters, you play legends with a Netflix worthy background story and an interesting plot.
But... the problem is: Apex is broken.
It's a broken game, no one would play if it costs money!
Respawn totally lost control over this game. They didn't know how to patch it for years. 
Audio is VERY important in this game. You need to hear your enemies, because knowledge is often the key to win tricky fights. But the audio system is the most broken part of it. It isn't consistent. You don't know if you hear anything or footsteps of your enemies at all. It's just random sometimes and you got shot in the back. This issue is getting worse for the last months, because Respawn completely lost track over server related issues. Many players think that the audio problems are also server related, because you can sometimes hear healing sounds from other teams all across the map. Very quiet, but they are rendered for you. Even if you're not close at all.
Since Season 10, when Seer got released, this issues are getting worse, so are the server problems. If a Seer is involved in a fight or you're playing him, you can't hear sh!t. Not for everyone, not always, but so often, that I couldn't play the new legend probably. We had a bad start with S9, when the servers didn't work at all for 2 days or so.
But in the recent season, server functionality is always random, most of the time really bad. You got all the kind of ""paket loss / high ping"" warnings, which are possible and sometimes the game crashes if you want to start a match.
The server related problems and a poorly programmed netcode for this game are such a big issue - it almost tops every other bad gaming experience I've seen in my life.
This is sad, because you don't have the feeling, that Respawn is aware of all this sh!t. They don't actually see, that their most profitable game is a big building site and instead of getting better, It's all getting worse.
EA needs to put more effort into this game. They need much more people who can FIX this game. It has such a good potential. And designers are really doing a fantastic job. They really developed a playworthy franchise, they expanded the Titanfall universe and it's beautiful - but they failed in making a bearable gaming experience and I don't know how long players will accept it. If they're still going down that road... Apex will slowly die in the near future for sure.
S10/11 is a turning point for the game (I'm playing since S4) - there is a huge potential for upcoming seasons or whatever the Apex universe will bring. But... there is not much patience left on the players side. They will stop playing this game forever. And it would be completely deserverd, depending on the recent status of Apex.
All that, because EA has such a short minded mangement and don't understand how to keep their games healthy & alive. It's all about making more and more money and you would be an idiot if you give them more of that.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"As someone who's dedicated most of my gaming life to simulation games, which are essentially my go-to titles, I can't really endorse The Sims 4 over any of its earlier versions. Despite its commercial success, The Sims 4 has some specific issues that have caused quite a stir among fans online. It all started with the absence of babies, pools, and ghosts initially, and other problems emerged that didn't sit well with players.

Both the base game and the various expansion packs, stuff packs, and game packs for The Sims 4 saw a significant price hike, especially with the release of Cats & Dogs. Many fans weren't happy with this move, as the increased costs imposed by EA made it even more challenging for players to afford the game's additional content.

I must admit, emotions take center stage in The Sims 4, promising a shift in how Sims navigate their feelings. For the first time, we could observe our Sims experiencing emotions such as anger, frustration, fear, or even boredom and responding accordingly. The game incorporates several emotions, with some introduced through expansion packs. Although emotions were touted as a significant gameplay changer, they don't quite have the impact on the unfolding of the game as expected.

Given that emotions are the primary focus of The Sims 4, it's crucial to familiarize oneself with at least the most important and common ones. The mechanics of emotions function in a simple manner, quite similar to the well-known mood modifiers from previous titles. What sets this title apart is the potential for situations, people, and even objects to influence a Sim's emotions. Furthermore, each emotion can manifest in different degrees, evolving based on the Sim's current state. For instance, a Sim could feel embarrassed, very embarrassed, and ultimately mortified—the maximum stage of this particular emotion.

One of the most persistent gripes from players regarding The Sims 4 revolves around the exceedingly fragmented content within the game. The company intentionally divided specific items or gameplay to generate more expansions or packs. A glaring example that left fans fuming was the My First Pet object pack, introducing the option to create hamsters and small animals. The discontent stemmed from the pack, launched post the Cats and Dogs expansion, which easily could have had its content seamlessly integrated into the animal-themed pack, eliminating the need for a separate sale.

It's undeniable that EA's latest title has its fair share of drawbacks, but for anyone who's a fan of the franchise and enjoys simulation games, The Sims 4 still holds its ground as a reference.

Boasting enhanced graphics and a handful of commendable expansions, the game certainly has its high points, delivering an enjoyable experience. Yet, its tendency to poorly recycle expansions from prior titles lends it a repetitive and eventually tiresome feel. Here's a swift and personal piece of advice: steer clear of purchasing the DLCs. Don't tumble down that rabbit hole. Opt for mods instead. They breathe more life into your base game than any DLC ever could. Plus, they won't set you back nearly as much, considering the limited value and opportunity cost of DLCs.","Very Positive87% of the 154,055 user reviews for this game are positive.",someone dedicated gaming life game essentially title endorse sims earlier version despite commercial success sims specific issue caused stir fan online started absence baby pool ghost initially problem emerged sit player base major addition add feature mechanic pack stuff pack pack sims saw significant price hike especially release cat dog fan happy move increased cost imposed ea challenging player afford additional admit emotion center stage sims promising shift sims navigate feeling observe sims experiencing emotion anger frustration fear boredom responding incorporates emotion introduced major addition add feature mechanic pack emotion touted significant changer impact unfolding expected given emotion primary focus sims crucial familiarize oneself important common one mechanic emotion function simple manner similar known mood modifier title set title apart potential situation object influence sim emotion emotion manifest different degree evolving based sim state instance sim embarrassed embarrassed mortified maximum stage particular emotion persistent gripe player regarding sims revolves exceedingly fragmented company intentionally divided specific item generate expansion pack glaring example left fan fuming pet object pack introducing hamster small animal discontent stemmed pack launched post cat dog major addition add feature mechanic easily seamlessly integrated animal themed pack eliminating separate sale undeniable ea latest title fair share drawback fan franchise enjoys game sims hold ground reference boasting enhanced graphic handful commendable expansion certainly high point delivering enjoyable tendency poorly recycle expansion prior title lends repetitive eventually tiresome swift personal piece advice steer clear purchasing dlcs t_emphasizedumble rabbit hole opt mod breathe life base downloadable additional released initial launch plus set nearly considering limited value opportunity cost dlcs
730,Counter-Strike 2,"No wonder CS is 20+ years old. This game is so addictive. I was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion. This is one of the most accurate FPS games ever made with 128 tick servers. This game requires passion, dedication, hardwork, skill & a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun. Rumours say CS:GO is going to shift on Source 2 Engine within 2 weeks, really excited for it. 

When you will play on low tier like Silver & Gold Nova you may lose many games because of your teammates. They may do basic mistakes like Run & Gun, Team Flash etc. But never rage on them.

1401590,Disney Dreamlight Valley,"I've been playing since the start of Early Access in September 2022 (first on the Nintendo switch and then switched to PC) and this is one of my favorite games!

The good:
- Many things to do in the game, especially for new players (quests, exploring, collecting, levelling up, farming, decorating, DreamSnaps, etc.)
- Fun to decorate & interesting challenges with DreamSnaps
- Touch of Magic tool allows players to create & share custom designs with motifs for certain clothing / furniture items
- Aesthetically pleasing, pretty immersive & several biomes / realms to explore
- Love talking & hanging out with Disney/Pixar characters
- Interesting main story plot line
- Lovely community on Discord
- Seasonal events, Star Paths & community challenges
- Multiple content updates per year

The bad:
- Sometimes grindy / repetitive
- Premium shop & its weekly rotation feels a bit like something from a mobile game + can cause FOMO for players. You can earn Moonstones (premium currency) via DreamSnaps, but that's not nearly enough to buy all the new weekly added premium items & buying more with real money is very expansive (1 house skin is 10-15 euros; 1 character skin is 10 euros; 1 critter/companion is 5-7 euros; 1 tool set is 15 euros).
- Gameloft often doesn't communicate well (although they do send out surveys once in a while)
- Many QoL improvements needed in almost all aspects of the game (e.g. better RNG, better UI, better filter/tag system, search bars, placing items diagonally, etc.)
- Some character quests lack depth
- Multiplayer not available for DLC & you can only look at eachother's Valley's, so not really play together
- Some characters shown in the original trailer are still not in the game
- Had to buy the game again to be able to play it on my PC

2344520,Diablo® IV,"The first ARPG I ever tried was Grim Dawn, but it couldn't hold my interest for more than 9 hours. Then I played Path of Exile for 130 hours, but the learning curve was too steep and I wasn't able to invest the huge amount of time needed to learn the game, so I decided to drop it.

Although I was hesitant at first because of the bad reputation it had, I bought Diablo 4 on sale during Season 2. I took my time and dedicated the rest of the season to enjoying the campaign and learning the ropes.

Season 3 was when I decided to get serious. To give it a proper review, I completed all the content the game had to offer and got 100% achievements.

Diablo IV is an excellent introduction to the ARPG genre. It is aimed at a casual audience. The campaign was so enjoyable that it convinced me to pick up the entire Diablo series. The game looks great, the atmosphere is immersive, the music is beautiful, the combat is satisfying and the performance is surprisingly good.

In my opinion, the best way to play this game is to come back for a few weeks at the start of a new season and try a new class and/or build each time. If you want to play an ARPG religiously for an entire season, there are better options out there. Diablo IV lacks depth in the endgame.

The Diablo series made me fall in love with the ARPG genre. Naturally, I picked up Last Epoch and decided to give Grim Dawn another try. Even though I'm not sure if I'll ever have the time to learn Path of Exile, I can't wait to try Path of Exile 2 when it comes out.

The upcoming Season 4 will introduce a major loot overhaul, as well as new seasonal activities and other changes to existing activities, so it's the perfect time to jump in if you haven't already.

I've only had one break so far. It was in 2017 and it lasted 1 month. I took that break cuz I had other games I wanted to play more.
But now... I don't, I have nothing to play and nothing to do. Yet I can't get myself to play this game I loved with all my heart.
I've been there for most of this game's history and I am telling you... Warframe was never in such a bad state.

[h1]THE MAIN PROBLEM[/h1]

So, what exactly has happened? It's pretty simple (and that's why it's even more sad that the DEVs can't do anything about it).
DE's (Digital Extremes) approach to this game has changed a lot. The same DEVs that used to be praised as the ""best developers ever that listen to the community's feedback and are like a family"" stopped caring about the feedback almost completely. They only listen to new players feedback, they listen to the players that can't see the game's issues. They listen to the players that will be constantly patting DE on their head saying how everything is awesome and this is the best game ever.

Because of this, the content DE started making is extremely mediocre. It's boring, repetitive, non-challanging and usually lasts about a week. DE also tends to release content, do few patches for it and then completely abandon it. Which is the better case. In the worse case, they can even kill part of their own game with some new content. 

[h1]ENDGAME IS A MEME[/h1]
This has always been a thing in Warframe... 
- ""So, what's the endgame of this game?"". 
- ""Well, there is non atm., but the next update looks promising!""

Guess what... No update brought the endgame people wanted. The game is extremely easy and requires absolutely no challange. The weapons and Warframes you have are extremely powerful and you oneshot pretty much everything. There might be some harder content in this game, but it doesn't matter. Because there are no rewards in this content that would any MR5+ player appreciate. 

[h1]COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT[/h1]
Warframe's support got extremely bad. People are getting auto-banned for doing things like staying in a mission for 2+ hours. Not even kidding with this one. Staying in a mission for this long used to be absolutely normal btw.
And guess what.. People are having troubles with getting unbanned. 
The community management team got extremely sensitive and they can ban you for literally anything that's not 110% politically correct. 
Warframe has a partner program. It used to have many cool people trying to help their favorite game... DE canceled this program not so long ago and when re-creating it, they basically refused every content creator that makes amazing content, but isn't always super positive about everything DE does. They want no feedback basically.

I tried to apply to the old program in 2018, because I also used to make WF content. Back in 2018, I didn't have enough subscribers to join, but I tried it anyways.. Even tho I didn't meet the requirements, I got an answer. Actually, I was messaging via email with a really nice guy from the support team. He told me to make sure I'll apply again once I meet the requirements.

It's 2020 and I applied again. I meet all the requirements now, but... I got no answer.. I sent another apply.. It's been few months now, still no answer. Guess they don't care about a smaller content creators anymore.

[h1]BUT IT'S FREE, DON'T JUDGE IT![/h1]
This is honestly the biggest bs I've ever heard. Warframe earns an extreme amount of money from the microtransactions. Their budget is huge, yet they still don't have own servers except for relays (the game is still peer to peer). I don't know what they are doing with those money, but they are definitely not investing into the game's future as they could.

[h1]OUTRO[/h1]

And that's pretty much it... I tried to put it as simple as possible. Funny, right?
I still hope DE will realize they are slowly killing their game and will do something about it. But right now, I am really sad about Warframe's state.

2139460,Once Human,"Despite investing 1000 hours of my life and over 600€ to support the game, I find myself questioning...

Where is the money being allocated in the game?

As the same issues persist without noticeable improvements, including mismatched subtitles and an abundance of AI-generated content.

My experience with Starry Studio has been disappointing, particularly due to my loss of Premium Currency (Crystgin) as a result of game bugs. Despite providing evidence, including timestamps, and having reached out by Starrun (Starry Studio Employee), I was ultimately left unresolved and without the in-game currency that I had purchased with real money.

TL;DR - Do not be stupid like me, hold your money for yourself! They are obviously using it for something else rather than improving the performance of servers. Also, be prepared to have a good time at first until your first Prime War, Thermal Purification or Lightforge Collection.","Mostly Positive71% of the 104,699 user reviews for this game are positive.",despite investing 1000 hour life 600 support questioning allocated issue persist noticeable improvement including mismatched subtitle abundance ai generated starry studio disappointing due loss premium currency crystgin result bug despite providing evidence including timestamps reached starrun starry studio employee left unresolved currency purchased real tl dr not_be stupid hold obviously else rather improving performance server prepared good prime war thermal purification lightforge collection

listen buddy, I've been gambling everyday for 20+ years. It's all I think about and I still haven't gotten addicted. If life has taught me anything is that the only thing you can't get addicted to is gambling . how can I be addicted if it makes me happy? Gambling is therapy, gambling is LITERALLY my therapy. Life is gambling, everyday I wake up and I think about gambling. Every morning I grab my laptop and start gambling while I make my morning coffee. It's literally all I think about, I can't be at peace if I don't gamble at least 2000$ a day. LOSING IS JUST A PHASE. but I know a big win is always right around the corner that's why I keep gambling my life savings away.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"TL;DR: Game is ok base game wise and has it's own strengths and weaknesses, DLC definitely improves it though. Price is definitely terrible for DLC, so wait for sales. Base Game 7/10, Game with the 4 mentioned DLC 9/10

This game WITHOUT DLC is... meh. It's definitely shallow in comparison to Sims 3, and it's missing several features that seem vacant for no reason at all. An open world being one of these removed features. The moodlet system is really nice and it changes up how the game is played overall as now you ACTUALLY have to play while keeping your sim's emotions in mind. The relationships between sims are a bit more dynamic it seems, and skills that were once unnecessary are now key to making certain things go as planned like pick-up lines and jokes requiring charisma and the new comedy skill. More dynamic job systems are definitely welcome.  Some side gigs like writing and such have been reworked and even overhauled in some ways to be ultimately better. Creating a Sim is more dynamic as far as body goes, but the clothing options are severely hampered due to the inability to make custom clothing or even hair colors. The hair color options are slim, so removing the ability to have custom hair colors seems like a bad move in my opinion. The AI of sims have somehow both gotten better and worse. Sims will actually actively take care of themselves better based on what I've seen, but they also make nonsensical choices for seemingly no reason at all. For example, When instructing my sim to go indoors he picks the longest way to get there sometimes. Also, sometimes sims will have conversations while making food and even though there's an open spot at the table they will actively go to the sofa in the other room, thus ending the conversation abruptly. Aside from these gripes, I think the base game is pretty alright. Also, there are no substantial community hangouts on the map at all in the base game, only parks which is strange. The game itself is just plots to build a house and put sims in as random sims come and go from your house. That effectively brought this game down from a good game to an underwhelming meh game immediately. This means the only plot worth visiting is your own house, then you just hope that sims that have time to talk to you show up. They later added more in DLC, but this segment is for the base game. Ultimately it had me on the fence the whole time. Certainly wait till the base game goes on sale for super cheap. 

Once you add DLC though, this game ends up becoming great. For this segment, I have particularly gotten Get to Work, Get Famous, Get Together, and Seasons. I think these 4 are the quintessential DLC's that you must get when you can. These expansions add what the game is missing like the aforementioned local hangout spots (which are added in Get Together). The content the expansions add are definitely something worth noting. Get to Work and Get Together are the ones (in my opinon) you ought to go for first. They add what the game needed for sure, such as more interactive jobs and social hang out locations. The other two I listed add stuff like a fame system that actually works better than the one in sims 3 and seasons with more holidays than the sims 3 by a landslide (you can even make your own holidays). HOWEVER there is one glaring problem with all of the DLC's... the price tag. These DLC's have no business being priced as much as the game itself. None. So my advice, just like the base game, WAIT FOR A SALE. There's even DLC for DLC, its kind of absurd (Looking at the ""My first pet stuff pack""). Aside from pricing though, these DLC's are actually solid and even adds stuff that sims 3 didn't have/handled poorly.","Very Positive87% of the 154,055 user reviews for this game are positive.",tl dr ok base wise strength weakness downloadable additional released initial launch definitely improves price definitely terrible downloadable additional released initial launch wait sale base 7 10 mentioned downloadable additional released initial launch 9 10 downloadable additional released initial launch meh definitely shallow comparison sims 3 missing feature vacant no_reason open world removed feature moodlet nice change play keeping sim emotion mind relationship sims bit dynamic skill unnecessary key certain thing planned pick line joke requiring charisma comedy skill dynamic system definitely welcome side gig writing reworked overhauled way creating sim dynamic far body go clothing option severely hampered due inability custom clothing hair color hair color option slim removing custom hair color bad move ai sims somehow gotten worse sims actively care based nonsensical choice seemingly no_reason example instructing sim indoors pick longest sims conversation food open spot table actively sofa room ending conversation abruptly aside gripe base pretty alright no_substantial community hangout base park strange plot build house sims random sims house effectively brought good underwhelming meh immediately mean plot worth visiting house hope sims talk downloadable additional released initial launch segment base fence certainly wait till base go sale super cheap add downloadable additional released initial launch end great segment gotten famous season quintessential downloadable additional released initial launch expansion add missing aforementioned local hangout spot expansion add definitely worth noting one opinon ought add needed interactive job social hang location listed add stuff fame work sims 3 season holiday sims 3 landslide holiday glaring problem downloadable additional released initial launch price tag downloadable additional released initial launch no_business priced advice base wait sale downloadable additional released initial launch downloadable additional released initial launch kind absurd pet stuff pack aside pricing downloadable additional released initial launch solid add stuff sims 3 handled poorly

The soundtrack is obviously taken from Disney films, so nothing new. The photo mode is the one that disappointed me a little more, it could have been better with more movement and the possibility of taking fantastic screenshots, unfortunately however it is very focused on selfies and little on the surrounding setting which I consider beautiful.
The gameplay is fluid and there is really a lot of farming and many things to do.
I expected many more ""old-time"" characters and much less new entries (perhaps because I come from the 80s generation).

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"Oooh I'm in a reviewin' mood tonight apparently.

Baldur's. Gate. 3. I have waited for this for so long. I have literally spent years playing Baldur's Gate 2 since it came out. I mean I must have collectively put in at least 3000+ hrs into that game over the decades it's been out. And [b] I still find new things in it![/b] (I play through the game every year, a different class/race combo every time.)

This game has a lot to live up to for me.

First things first: What is Baldur's Gate 3? It's a turn based (ehhh ok, I'll live with it) isometric, full 3D tactical RPG. It's got our standard fare DnD rules setup with some added flair. It's got some wickedly fun tactical options in combat right down to throwing your boots at enemies when desperate. And it's Baldur's fucking Gate 3.

Ok. I'm ok.

Anyways how's it run? It's good, it's not completely optimised yet as it has issues running on my older gaming laptop (MSI GT780DXR i7 2670QM w/ GTX 970M) but runs fantastically on my Area 51M (i7 9700K w/ RTX 2080) and if you don't have this installed on an SSD you're just asking for trouble in my opinion as it really helps. I haven't encountered any crazy crashes but I have encountered quite a few game breakers that blocked progress or flat out broke the game. It's early access. I'm forgiving it for now.

How's it look? Fantastic. I wish BG2 looked this good. The characters are incredibly detailed and the world itself is lush and alive. Textures, art style, models, animations, everything is well crafted. Mucho variety.

How's it sound? I like it. The music is excellent and keeps to the theme. The sound quality is superb and the voice over work that is present at this point is extremely well done and very convincing. The environments are detailed and immersive with excellent background noise.

How's it play? Oh, this has me conflicted as I really enjoyed my real time combat with tactical pausing. I enjoy a good turn based game like X-Com 2 or Wasteland 2/3, but I was hoping for a more Pillars style for my sequel of the century. Anyways combat is fast and fluid except when it breaks and every enemy in the map gets it's turn and it takes fucking forever to resolve. That's a bug. I know.

How's the story? It's cool. I don't see how it even remotely relates to the previous titles, other than it being set in Baldur's Gate in the Forgotten Realms world, but then BG 2 was set in Amn so whatever. The characters are... interesting but fall a little flat. They're too similar, in that they are all assholes. Each one. Complete assholes. To you, to each other, to others. Maybe that's how he game is supposed to be? You're all assholes trying to survive? I'm not sure that's what they intended really but it's funny and makes me laugh so I'll enjoy it for now but I expect some more depth in the future. And Shadowheart is lame. And what are the odds we get two games in the same year where something in your head is trying to kill/change you?

What's your verdict then? I recommend it. It's a good game on it's own merits. Do I recommend you buy it right now? Not unless you're a fan. It's still broken, it's still in development, it's not polished and it's not even remotely complete. But that's the beauty of early access right? You get to see the progress, the finish and the work that goes into the final product. The final product, if Larian Studios is as consistent as they have been so far, will be fantastic and hopefully will live up to a giant of a legacy.

[b] TLDR: It's a great game that is in early access and as such is incomplete. Do not expect a full game. Do not expect a bug-free experience. Enjoy the show, enjoy watching the progress, enjoy being part of the process on the sequel to one of the best RPGs ever made (I know, it's my opinion here and I'm biased as fuck) and relax, Larian's got this.

2183900,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","An excellent third-person shooter that immerses players in the Warhammer 40k universe.
I'd say the game is a bit pricey for its current content, but a roadmap has already been released with content through to the end of 2025.

The single-player campaign, is the sequel to the first opus and can be played solo or in co-op for up to 3 players. It's really good, but rather short (I'd say 8 hours of play). 

Then there's a less scripted co-op campaign where you can customize your space marine and play different classes. It's fairly short, but is designed to be played several times to improve your characters. 

There is also the 6vs6 PvP mode, which is really cool. Progression is pretty good, and you want to keep playing to unlock the next weapons and cosmetics, but unfortunately there are only 3 maps and 3 game modes at the moment.

In conclusion, I'd recommend it to all fans of the 40k universe or anyone looking for a good shooter, but I'd advise you to buy it at a reduced price or wait for the developers to add a little more content.","Very Positive80% of the 87,349 user reviews for this game are positive.",excellent third shooter immerses player 40k universe bit pricey roadmap already released 2025 single series connected mission level form storyline sequel opus solo mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal 3 player good rather short 8 hour play scripted mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal series connected mission level form storyline customize play different class fairly short designed time improve character 6vs6 versus mode cool progression pretty good unlock next weapon cosmetic unfortunately 3 map 3 mode moment conclusion recommend fan 40k universe good shooter advise reduced price wait developer add

252490,Rust,"Rust.

- What it means to me - 

What is there to say. It started as a faster pace version of the game (mod) i love Dayz or well the Arma Operation arrow head version. 

Even though the game started as of what even garry Newman (the creator) said ""a clone of dayz and STALKER"" It has over the years turned in to something MUCH more. Rust in the start was the first game when it was only accessable to youtubers and other known people that i wanted to get into and when i finally got in to it damn i was hooked. 



Ever since the start i poured hours and hours in to the game loving every bit of it. I went from casually playing on the pc and more on Xbox too quitting on the consoles and playing PC. What im trying to say is that this game by a quite small developer team made me quit all other games to focus on this one.


- The Game - 



As refered to before, rust in the begining was a fast pace version of the arma mod (Dayz) with added features that had been missing like Base building and a way better combat system for gun-play. the focus of Rust was and is to build up your base and get ""loot"" and slowly climb from a primitive state to a more ""advanced"" state, aswell as pvp (player vs player) and raid you're enemies. Ofcouse thats my point of view and rust can be played however you like it farm, build, fight, make friends, ""role-play"" and much more. Thats the thing that makes this game so great, that you can really make it your own. 


- current farm/system- 

at the time of this ""review"" rust is in the component and bp system in witch you farm ""scrap"" aswell as find items in the wild to learn and then craft, this is imo the greatest change to the game it has made the early game alot slower then before, but not too slow like the XP system that was a few iterations back. It makes every item in the game feel more valuable and if you find that ak in a loot box you really care to get it back and it feels like a real loss if you loose it.



in rust you have you're general farming system when it comes to get materials like stone and wood and ore. You hit trees, farm rocks or hit metal and sulfur nodes to get them, there has recently been added a quite nifty mini game to make farming more fun aswell!

- the gun-mechanics - 


the gun-mechanics of rust and gun-play aswell as general pvp feels fluid and smooth in general at this time and date some items do need rebalancing and changes but thats why its in a early access stage still, im talking at the moment about the general feel of everything.

to compare rust to a few games i would say that rust is highly skill based like games like counterstrike, since they added spray patterns to alot of guns and generally removed alot of the aim cone issues (reduced) it feels like the gun play is really getting somewhere. all guns in the game have a durability before the break and different patterns, aswell as you need to craft your ammo , all the guns also carry out different stats that are suitable for different situations and cost a different amount in  materials to craft. This makes taking an ""ak"" out for instance will be better then a ""waterpipe shotgun"" but puts you in a higher risk of loosing alot more if you die. There is a WIDE variety of different weapons in the game, so you can really use what you prefer, like shooting a massive high damage high output machine gun?, like using primitive weapons like the bow or a spear? you can do that!

-- Building--

Rust has one of the most simple but most advanced building systems i have ever seen in a game of this type.

basically you have a building plan and a hammer, the building plan is used for, well to plan out your building with ""twig"" (can also be used in raiding situations). when building you can map out how you want you're base with triangles and squares for the foundation, which might sound very limited but belive me its far from it. 

You protect your base so other people cannot build and ruin it with a tool cupboard and can even put up traps and other items to make it safer. 

there is 5 different tiers of materials you can use to make your base out of and you can mix and match them twig (only really used for mapping the base, since it can be broken really easily), Wood (used in the start (quite easy to get and is easy to break but still usable in the start)  , Stone ( a great material but has a soft side and a strong side), metal (is great has a soft and strong side like stone but is much stronger, weakness is that people can look trough the sides of it) and armoured (stronger then every other type and has no real downside except that its much more expensive). 


-- Raiding -- 

Raiding probably the biggest thing about this game. Raiding in rust is very interesting and its what brings the most crazy situations aswell as the most fun and sad ones. 

most of the time when raiding your putting a lot on the line to get another group or persons stuff and sometimes house for your own. 

in rust there is a wide variety  of items to use just like the guns, you can use a rocket-launcher which has a high splash and damage rate which is the highest tier of raiding but is for the most part quite hard to come by in this current issue of rust, you also have C4, satchel charges explosive ammo and even things like the flamethrower, aswell as using items like pickaxes and melee weapons to break soft side of walls. 

when raiding you have the possibility to use ladders aswell as (currently) foundations and floors to get higher up on bases, there is also the possibility of ""boosting"" you're teammates by jumping on top of them. 


-- updates/devs/changes --


I recently gave rust ""the labor of love"" nomination on steam because ever since the release of the game it has consistently gotten updated and improved and for a LONG while the game has gotten updated every week, the devs of the game always listen and for the better or worse looks to the player base to see what is wrong with the game and they are very active on social media. The dev team have their own dedicated site where they can be contacted and post frequent updates on what they are doing in the form of dev blogs.

(not posting link since i dont know if that's allowed) 


- The issues - 


imma keep this section shor.


The only real issue with rust besides sometimes there being laggy servers and hit reg issues witch i dont really consider issues since i know they will be fixed before the game leaves early access.

The only and main issue is the life time of servers before the ""die"" most servers (it has gotten better and devs are aware) live for about 3-5 days before they start dying out. most people after the first few days just wait for the next update that's on thursday. 

-- conclusion -- 

There is alot u haven't talked about thats in the game like how you can paint or that there soon* will be cars in it or that you can farm and forage and that is because i dont want to make this ""review"" longer then it has to be. I also want to make it clear that this is my point of view and that others may think different and have other opinions and that i might have missed things.

When it comes down to the question should you get rust? in my opinion even though its a hard game to get into and also to get into if you are alone its an experience that i belive everyone should try aswell since its 50% off on steam atm!

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"on a technical level its pretty good, combat is good, performance is great with no bugs and very pretty world spaces.

But the writing is so bad; the dialogue is honestly the worst in any rpg i've personally played, made worse by some genuinely criminal voice acting; Neve in particular, either the voice actress or her director belong on Riker's Island for that performance. Its really a shame because i really like the lore and from what i hear the ending of the game is supposed to be really good, but I can't sit through this.

I paused my second run of bg3 to play this and after the first couple hours all i could think was ""I'd rather be playing baldurs gate"". I finally caved in during the beginning of Treviso when, with no effort, your immediately introduced to the head antivan crow and provided with some boringly delivered exposition while, for some reason in a high fantasy game, mass effectesque synth music was playing in the background.

1401590,Disney Dreamlight Valley,"This game started off really fun.  It is compared to animal crossing, but take that lightly.  Also Disney characters what not to like?  I really loved it.  But it is in early access and with each update they seem to take something away.  An example of this is Kristoff's stall which gives you common materials needed to craft, you were able to get stacks of 99 items, and it was nerfed to 3-10 items each.  The materials needed to craft is insane, so this really puts a huge damper in the game.  It is going to be FREE TO PLAY.  So keep that in mind, with each update it is heading to that sort of game play, like a mobile gatcha game.

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"OK so I have been playing this game since it released, as a long time magic fan i was excited to have a tool to practice at home that was easier to access and use then other free magic games, and its been great for that. My MTG skills have improved significantly. HOWEVER, The cards are expensive you have to use what is known as a wildcard to unlock specific copies and the digital packs cost about the same as IRL packs which is crazy to me.  THERE ARE WAYS TO EARN CARDS FOR FREE, through daily quests you can get enough gold to unlock probably one pack a day almost which is not terrible if you intend on playing everyday. You can also buy draft tokens with gold which is also a really good way to gets cards from new sets. These 2 things combined can make the experience of starting a fresh account for EXPERIENCED magic players not so terrible. However if you are a new player or just noobish when it comes to mtg you might struggle building your first deck.  

PROS: 
FREE TOOL TO PRACTICE MAGIC
WAYS TO EARN CARDS FOR FREE
FREQUENT BANS AND LIMITS ON REALLY OP STUFF

CONS: 
LOTS OF CASH COWS WITH WHAT WOULD BE A 3K DECK CASUALLY GRINDING OUT BO1's
CAN BE HARD FOR NOOBS TO GET STARTED 
VERY PREDATORY STORE DESIGN
FREQUENT CLIENT ISSUES

Overall if you are a hardcore MTG fan you will probably love this like I have. If you are not you might have a hard time getting into it cause playing the same crap starter decks over and over feels like running uphill during a mudslide.

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"Pros: when this game works, it can be incredibly fun and the combat can be heart pumping.
The gun play feels as solid as ever and every firearm feels like it has its place.

Cons: that being said this game is fun 'when it works' 
This game is highly unstable, crashes, stutters and lag are extremely common on my otherwise capable PC.

As well pay to win elements are present, that being if you own the full game you get an extended 20 slots to store firearms found in raid compared to the base 10, whilst this may not seem like a very big issue, it will quickly become an annoyance to have to destroy fully modded and highly capable firearms because the game simply said so. This could easily be cushioned with a system in which destroying firearms and keys gives you experience but the developers clearly overlooked this. As well some skins in the store are straight upgrades from base characters, giving increased camouflage over free-to-play users.

The developers also seen more concerned with adding new content and skins into the game rather than fixing the rampant bugs. Notably the bugs when loading in which characters will simply be in the floor, holding your firearm or simply won't exist. Then there is the funny bugs in which AI enemies will simply be floating in the air like they got lessons from Houdini.

The AI is also very inconsistent, some will notice you behind cover at 100 meters while some won't notice their friends being shot six feet behind them. As well, the accuracy of the AI seems to be completely random, sometimes they put accurate automatic fire on you when your running in a Zigzag pattern and sometimes those with shotguns manage to miss at point blank.

Another thing wrong here is sometimes quests are in locked rooms that require specific keys, thus not allowing you to accept them, this is such a basic issue that should have been caught in development. Once again developer complacency.

This point isn't much of a critique as it is a pet-peeve of mine but this series continues the trend of giving firearms a random name to avoid paying fees to licence them, while this isn't a big issue it compiles on top of the other issues to show that this isn't the project of love it is claimed to be but instead another COD cash grab.

In short: this is a game I wish so desperately to love, but clearly the developers wish otherwise.

2183900,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","My initial thoughts were that the game is an improvement in every conceivable way over the first one. It obviously looks better, has more combat mechanics, more equipment, additional gameplay modes. However the more I think about the game and try to engage with its mechanics the more frustrating it becomes. At this point in time I only recommend buying this on a sale of at least 30% if not more.

At this moment the game is significantly overpriced for what little it offers.
The campaign is short and looks extremely cool.
PvE has six linear maps in total, each is completed in about 25 minutes or less.
PvP I haven't played because despite there being an anti cheat there are plenty of cheaters anyway. 
Congrats on wasting money on EAC.

The visuals are amazing. They are the best part of the game. I know the visuals and assets for the game were incredibly expensive (they look the part) and therefore there isn't that much content, but I wish the gameplay came first. But it truly looks absolutely amazing.

The gameplay, sadly, comes far behind the visuals. At the moment it can be downright painful at times.
I spent the majority of my time thus far in PvE (online coop). My problems with it are as follows:

Class lock in PvE feels awful. You cannot play with a full squad of tactical/devastator/assault. I'm not sure what came first, the idea for class lock and then they decided to make each character ""unique"" to compensate or whether it was the other way around. Anyway it doesn't feel good to be restricted in this way in a game that has so little content to do.
The voice lines attached to each character aren't even that hyperspecific to their class, they would be passable on other classes.

Enemies have mile long healthbars. Knowing the lore it makes sense to me (in particular for larger tyranid gribblies and Tsons) but with how its done in the game it makes combat feel like a chore at times. You just keep shooting your gun or wailing on an enemy with your melee weapon and its not having any noticeable effect other than vfx/sparks (which look nice).
The majoris+ enemies should have more flinch/stagger animations at least when getting shot.
I think its a miss to not add some sort of battle damage system where nids get their limbs hacked/blown off but keep coming at you. The Tsons could have ceramite, adamantium and engravings getting shorn off their armor from bolter fire. 
In fact it would be cool if we could shoot off the guns off ranged enemies.

Just something that shows the player ""this guy is taking damage"", not just particle effects. 
Small enemies have the beginning of this system, but it doesn't feel right.
Shooting a termagant for it to reset the 1st frame of the same ""owie I'm hit"" animation 6 times in a row makes me feel like my weapon is either a nerf gun or downright bugged. 

Its extremely disappointing with how little damage melee weapons deal. The finishers and their animations are extremely cool, I wish there were more and changed with direction you approach an enemy, like in Doom 2016/eternal. I also wish I could decide whether my marine does a hand-to-hand finisher or uses his weapon to do it.
However taking several swings at a termagant/tzaangor with a thunder hammer only for it to keep fighting just feels bad.

The melee feels inconsistent in most situations. Parry and dodge sometimes just don't work, or possibly due to nearby enemies overlapping their attacks when close to you they force you to miss the parry and dodge window. Then you get stuck in the block animation (where at first you don't take damage) but you can't input any command, and then another comes in and keeps you stunlocked and makes you lose majority of your health. 

The worst parts of melee is when you are in a crowd and get attacked by lots of small enemies - hormogants or tzaangors. Their attacks come out very fast and overlap and clip through each other, either forcing you to miss the parry window on the warrior/Tson and you block and then take damage, or you just whiff the parry and take damage anyway. Let me dodge/step out of a parry animation please.

Enemies have iframes on their dodges. It feels like you're being cheated out of what little damage you can put out.

The gunstrike is way too slow and I died multiple times while locked in the animation. Its generally a theme for how deaths happen in the game, you get stuck in some sort of animation/stagger you have no way of cancelling or getting out of and then you die.

The jump pack makes me very sad. In the campaign it worked just fine, but it is gutted in PvE. 
Lets say you want to jump over a chasm or from one walkway to another, but they are separated by about 2 meters of empty space. 
The game seems to draw a line from the base of your character and directly in front of a him. That line must be drawn over terrain you can walk on. 
If that line encounters impassable terrain, such as a small safety barrier or a gap, in 90% of situations you can't jump over the barrier or that gap. So you see a distance you are certain you can jump over, you could walk to your target (so you know you should be able to jump there), but the game just doesn't let you. In addition, sometimes when the jump indicator (at the end of the line being drawn mentioned above) hits or collides with certain objects, the jump just won't activate. It just feels very janky and unsatisfying to use.

Now when you jump up, you can do a slam attack where the marine flies at high speed to the target on the ground. 
You'd think the victim of that attack would get turned to paste after getting hit. 
Nope. They just get staggered a bit. 
In addition, during your slam attack you first hover midair ""charging"" the attack. This looks weird and should be removed, if anything the marine at the apex of the jump should slow down a bit, but not become stationary, and as gravity pulls him down he uses the jump pack to get more speed. Also during that little hover I get hit by melee attacks which shouldn't be able to reach me.

It feels incredibly unsatisfying, in particular with how long the cooldown is on the jump. With how little height you get from the jump I think it would be better if instead of a slam attack, it was a targeted charge where there is only 1 target (no AoE), but that target takes lots of damage and likely dies. That and also the marine hits the target with his weapon, not slams it into the ground. Also the jump pack should be the go to choice for tackling flying enemies (zoanthropes, levitating sorcerers), but there is no such option, You can either do a dash on the ground, jump from A to B, or jump and do a ground slam. There is a cutscene in the campaign that shows exactly how a jump pack should feel (it looks a bit OP there I'll admit, but it looks insanely fun) but having seen it and then trying the jump pack for yourself feels like you got cheated.

The ranged combat suffers from the same principal issue as melee - you just don't feel like you're doing any damage or that enemies are at all affected by taking multiple headshots in a row. 
I think its most telling that the most fun to be had was using the the underslung grenade launcher or the sniper las fusil and two or three shotting majoris enemies. The melta is excellent at staggering hordes and clearing smaller enemies and leaving the large guys to take care of - honestly this should be a flamer (which for some reason is absent from PvE) and the melta should have a smaller blast but be the choice weapon to deal with heavy armour as in the lore.
When you have strong weapons which have direct impact like the three I mentioned, the ranged combat felt good. However, 90% of the guns do not have such an impact and therefore feel like trash.

Additionally, the amount of spread would be fine for a standard human, but how can an astartes have this much inaccuracy and spread? It makes no sense to me, in particular when all enemies are great at leading the player.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"This is a review from a new player aimed at new players.

I played ESO back in 2014 during the beta and didn't like it. I was expecting Skyrim online and it didn't qualify so I lost interest very quick.

Fast forward to april 2018, after years spent on Dark Souls, Dragon's Dogma, Rocket League and others ... Me and my buddies are looking for a game to play together like in the good old days. We're all dads with families now and there's no way we can get back to grinding like we used to (no pun intended).

I remember ESO and wonder how it's doing. People are talking about the One Tamriel update. I start a thread on Reddit asking if it's casual friendly, and everyone assures me that it very much is. Might be worth a shot so me and my buddies decide to give it a try.

ESO still isn't Skyrim Online, and won't ever be. The logistics of a MMO don't really allow the atmospheric beauty and complexity of a game like Skyrim. It is however way deeper in lore and atmosphere than any MMO I ever played, and you can tell great care is taken into making the world of Tamriel feel alive and breathing as much as can be. Every NPCs are voiced and side quests are literally everywhere. Many of them feel generic after a while, but some are actually really clever and well written. The world is absolutely humongous and very varied, with there again great care paid to respecting the Elder Scrolls lore. Long time ES players will appreciate the numerous references to stories and characters they already know well.

Graphics are pretty great for a MMO as well. I run it maxed out and lighting effects are downright gorgeous in some places. Art direction is consistent and while some places feel a little rushed, others surprise you with high levels of details. Riding from city to city through woods and moors, across deserts and sea shores, you always feel immersed in the world as should be. They also keep improving as the latest chapter, Summerset, is more beautiful and detailed than ever before.

Gameplay is one of the things that surprised me the most as I wasn't expecting it to be so fast paced. Fighting takes skills and strategy and you do need to learn to get better to earn victory, as opposed to simply leveling and spamming skills like it's sometimes the case in similar games. Me and my buddies have progressed steadily and we find ourselves beating dungeons we never thought we could beat before, and not just because we leveled up but because we learned to work better as a team. It's a very satisfactory feeling that the game encourages.

Classes are varied and skill lines designed to make you enjoy a high level of freedom in gameplay. I run a Magicka Templar, and designed my character so I can switch from DPS to Tank or Healer or a mix of both when I play with my friends without much of a hassle. I'll never be as performing as someone who would 100% specialize in either of these roles, but I would say that for once hybrid builds are absolutely do-able in this game, which is very rarely true in MMOs.

One thing responsible for us enjoying the game so much is the famed One Tamriel update. It basically removed level walls from the world and introduced a scaling system on the world map. It basically means that from level 1 to 50, you will adjust to monsters on the world map and normal delves to a beatable level. It does remove true challenge from these areas, but also allows you to roam the world freely to explore as you wish, which is a worthy trade in my opinion as it allows new players to be free to discover this enormous world like they were on an actual adventure. There are also no limits for partying with friends, so you don't need to worry about overleveling when you play on your own. While it could take from the satisfying experience of leveling up in early levels, the very flexible skill system feels like enough of a reward to keep it interesting.

World Bosses, Dungeons and Trials aren't scaled, and that's where the challenge begins. Each dungeon has several levels of difficulty and we have been steadily progressing through them in our 2 months of playing. Boss battles require strategy and analyzing the mechanics and can be quite epic. Sometimes you just don't have the required level or gears, but sometimes you just have to keep trying to get better. We have beaten many bosses we thought we would never beat on our first couple tries.

Past level 50, you start getting Champion Points, to a maximum of 750. They allow you to keep enhancing your character slowly and end up making quite a difference in the long run. As you get stronger, you'll be able to complete more difficult dungeons, which grant better gears. This is really clever design, as the game never feels like a grind in the traditional MMO sense, but instead more of renewed challenges. So far it has kept it's freshness to us.

The lack of ""grindy"" feeling is really something I want to emphasize on, as it's what's been preventing me from playing MMOs for so long. In my 2 months of playing I never felt myself even having the desire of grinding for levels or gears. I had fun doing quests on my own and playing with my friends, and my character naturally improved by doing so. We are still a long, long way from reaching end game content, and are in no hurry. From my experience, this is quite a feat to accomplish this feeling in a genre that is most often grindy by definition.

On the negative side, I would say that the game can sometimes feel a little bland, but then again it's a MMO and Skyrim, Dark Souls, Witcher III and the likes have spoiled us in recent years. Quests can feel generic and repetitive but you also don't need to do 80% of them.

The monthly subscription is by no mean necessary but access to all DLCs and their dungeons is quite pricey (and free if you subscribe). The bottomless crafting bag you get with the subscription is also pretty mandatory if you want to craft efficiently, and then again it isn't a necessity as you can resell materials instead of holding on to them and ask players to craft for you.

Crown store is mostly cosmetics or a shortcut to things you can buy with ingame currencies like skill respecs and the likes.

All in all, the game we were looking for at the right time for us. I highly recommend it if you are also looking for a similar chill, friendly experience in the Elder Scrolls universe.

2379780,Balatro,"[h2]INTRO:[/h2]

If you think you know poker, Balatro puts a fun, rogue-like spin on the typical poker ruleset. I played plenty of poker with my father, though that was always against other people. In this game, you’ll battle against Blind amounts, boss Blinds, and the most intimidating opponent of all: luck itself.


[table]
[tr]
	[th]Pros[/th]
	[th]Cons[/th]
	
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]- Plenty of variety in items, decks, bosses, challenges, and combinations.
- Seriously, if you love card games this one is great. Adding the joker combos allows so much multiplication in scores, and runs can be ended in a single mistake at higher difficulties as well.
- I LOVE the designs of the cards, the incorporation of more than just standard 52-card deck options, and the Roguelike aspect of this game.
- Opening card packs
[/td]
	[td]- Sometimes the game would glitch on me. I played on Steam Deck and I’d press to deselect a card but it would keep it selected when redrawing, playing, etc. Not sure how much of that was Steam Deck only.
- Lack of variety in music [/td]

[/tr]
[/table]

[h2]Story[/h2]

While there’s no story to be had in Balatro, that’s certainly not a deal breaker. Read on to discover more of what this card game has to offer.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]

As a roguelike, Balatro runs are a little bit different each time. Of course, the core mechanics do stay the same. 

Players are engaging in a game of spiced-up poker. There is a Blind with each round selected that can either be attempted, or passed. A Blind consists of a certain amount of points the player must acquire through their card plays and joker multipliers. If a Blind is skipped, the game will reward money and potentially further items. 

Did I mention the jokers? 

That's right, Balatro's entire game mechanic changes up the poker-style Blind play matching with jokers. There are a total of 150 in the game and each one augments plays a little bit differently. One of my first jokers added a x4 multiplier to my hands played, allowing me to get decently far on my first run. While you can only have 5 jokers at any given time, adding ones that synergize can allow you to combo plays to easily meet early-game and sometimes even late-game Blinds in only a few hands. For someone like me who loves watching numbers go big, this feature is incredible.

Additional helpful cards include planet cards, which level up the kinds of hands you play like pair, full house, and so on, and Tarot cards. The Tarot cards have different effects per major arcana, allowing you to change the suit of cards, add effects to them that give you extra chips, and more. These can be acquired by purchasing in the shop with funds you get after each Blind (or skipping a Blind), or by opening card packs. These add even further fun on top of the Jokers. I haven't had two games be the same yet!

The deck types also impact game play, allowing you more hand plays before you lose, more discards, more money, and so on. There are a total of 15 decks to choose from, unlocked in a variety of ways. 

A total of two Blinds are met or skipped per ante before players reach the Boss Blind. Boss Blinds are purposefully tricky. The first I ran into was The Hook, which discards 2 random cards per hand played. There are, of course, varieties in the Boss Blinds as well. This makes it tricky  to win even with some Joker benefits, and I've had plenty of runs end because of a bad, tough Boss Blind.

[h2]Graphics[/h2]

Many of the graphics in Balatro involve visuals of normal cards. However, there are augmentations that can be done to them that add seals, shine, glitz, glamour, mechanical value, and even foil. Aside from the deck cards, the jokers are all easy to tell apart. Their visuals lend themselves, for the most part, in the direction of the mechanical benefit they’ll provide to you. There are differences in each one, which is good since there are a total of 150 within the game.

The planet cards and Tarot cards are also easy to tell apart. If you know Tarot, small depictions of each character lay on each card, making them easy to differentiate. The planet icons look like the planets in our solar system, so if you can get to a point where you can memorize the card effects, you won’t even have to read. 

While the background in most of the card levels doesn’t change much, that’s fine. It’s a formless sort of swirl of colour that doesn’t distract from the main feature: the cards themselves. Balatro developers are smart about their visuals, making everything easy to react to quickly. 

[h2]Verdict[/h2]

If you don’t like card games, I’m not sure Balatro will change your mind; if you do like card games, pick this one up. While there’s no story to be had, the gameplay on its own carries it through hours of content, luck-based plays, and skill-based consideration. Filling out the collection and trying different decks is fun, and the joy of opening up card packs is one that’s almost as good as in real life.

Update : now that i've spent over 300 hours on this game i can really say that i (almost) enjoyed every second of it which is rare for someone like me

Here's the things that i hated the most

sometimes when you not even fighting anything you can't access the map cuz somewhere something is agro on you and you gotta wait for it to leave you alone or find it and kill it .

Weapons are not balanced yet (for both pvp and pve) which is fine cause the game just dropped

Low fps and stutters on some of the most important open world areas ( i got a 3060 btw and my friend has a 6900 xt which is equal to 3090 and even he's getting drops) 

You can't ride on mounts in Coop Mode

I think that's all that i remember for now tbh the game is perfect and beautiful at the same time its not even a game at this point it's an Art 

it has some issues that every new released game had Especially an RPG Game and its Hopefully gonna get fixed soon

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"[h1]A Disappointing Journey That Fails to Live Up to Expectations[/h1]

I was genuinely excited to dive into Metaphor: ReFantazio, hoping for an engaging RPG experience. As a fan of Atlus titles like Catherine, Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, and other classic JRPGs, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, the game turned out to be more of a disappointment than a bad game.

[h2] Gameplay: [/h2]

The job system in Metaphor: ReFantazio seems to imitate the one from Final Fantasy, where changing equipment allows characters to switch jobs. However, the execution falls short. Many characters find it difficult to take on different jobs due to their inherent stat growth. For example, characters with low STR (Strength) growth are ill-suited for physical jobs, making it challenging to diversify your party. This rigidity limits strategic possibilities and forces players to stick with predetermined roles.

Moreover, several characters join your party almost at the end of the game. In an RPG where character development requires significant investment and grinding, introducing new characters so late makes it hard to develop any interest in them. You're less inclined to invest time in leveling them up, especially when you've already built up your main team. As a result, the initial main characters remain the most commonly used throughout the game.

Additionally, some of the more advanced jobs unlock too late to be worthwhile. By the time you gain access to these ultimate jobs, you've likely already settled into other job branches out of necessity. The late unlocking of these jobs adds unnecessary pressure in the early stages, forcing you to manage without them for most of the game and diminishing the excitement of unlocking new abilities.

[h2] Storyline and Narrative: [/h2]

In the later stages, the plot takes a downturn, becoming overly simplistic and lacking depth. The initial excitement dwindled, and I found myself losing interest. It felt more like a chore to finish the game, driven only by the desire to see it through because I had already invested time into it. The story starts strong but ends anticlimactically, leaving many plot threads unresolved.

[h2] Character Development: [/h2]

Many characters require an excessively long time before their side quests become available again. This prolonged gap made it difficult to stay connected to their individual stories. For some less prominent characters, I couldn't even remember what had happened previously, making their narratives feel disjointed and forgettable. The lack of continuous engagement with these characters weakened the overall narrative and my connection to them.

[h2] Visuals and Art Style: [/h2]

While the game boasts a distinctive art style, the graphics feel outdated, especially when playing at 4K resolution. The visuals resemble games from the PS4 era, lacking the polish expected from modern titles. Although some environments are creatively designed, graphical inconsistencies and generic settings occasionally pulled me out of the immersive experience.

[h2] Sound and Music: [/h2]

Some of the music tracks are genuinely good and enhance the atmosphere during key moments. These pieces stood out and provided brief highlights in an otherwise unremarkable soundtrack. Unfortunately, the overall audio experience doesn't leave a lasting impression, and the voice acting doesn't add much depth to the characters.

[h2] Overall Experience: [/h2]

Despite its promising start, Metaphor: ReFantazio fails to deliver a satisfying RPG experience. It attempts to emulate elements from successful franchises like Final Fantasy but doesn't capture the essence that made those games great. The restrictive job system, unbalanced character progression, and late introduction of new characters and advanced jobs diminish the overall enjoyment.

[h2] 5/10 [/h2]

Engaging job system concept
Some good music tracks
Distinctive art style
[h2]Cons:[/h2]

Childish and shallow storyline in later stages

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"Long time DA fan, first steam review. A few hours in and wishing I didn't buy this game.  Many of the changes I can live with, and no issues with diversity and representation, but the cartoonish character designs, the cartoonish darkspawn and campy dialog in modern tone and voices are crimes against Dragon Age and other Bioware RPGs. ""It's kind of my thing"" says my companion after tinkering with an incredibly ancient mysterious Elven device.

The reviews were right - Tonally inconsistent, and changing/ignoring lore send strong soft reboot vibes, blatant God of War ripoffs (turning to squeeze through narrow openings), companions during combat are invincible so I don't care about them at all (neither do my enemies apparently) and its annoying to have to constantly set up their powers. This game feels like some EA exec told the team to mash up Fortnite, Baldur's Gate, and God of War and we ended up with a worse version of all three.

Really the only positive I have so far is that the game is absolutely gorgeous.

I've been invested in this story for over 10 years so I'll see it to the end, but it will be with a sad, disappointed heart. Maybe I'll change this review in the future.","Mostly Positive71% of the 24,035 user reviews for this game are positive.",long da fan hour wishing change live no_issues diversity representation cartoonish design cartoonish darkspawn campy dialog modern tone voice crime age bioware rpgs kind say companion tinkering incredibly ancient mysterious elven device review tonally inconsistent changing ignoring lore send strong soft reboot vibe blatant god war ripoffs turning squeeze narrow opening companion combat invincible care neither_do enemy apparently annoying constantly set power feel ea exec told mash fortnite baldur gate god war ended worse version three positive far gorgeous invested 10 year sad disappointed heart maybe future

230410,Warframe,"This story requires a bit of setup.

Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a ""Grandmaster"" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.

Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.

On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now.

We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.

I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for).

Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.","Very Positive87% of the 598,811 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"After the latest announcement that they are rereleasing the game for console players but not providing any new content to the existing player base, I have to put forward a negative review to this game. The new world Dev team are absolute MUPPETS!  They have no idea what made this game great and how to keep their existing players happy. All they know how to do is to try and milk their first ever game as long as possible by deceiving  a new lot of players (players that most have probably never played a mmo before) into paying top dollar for a game that has been out for 3 years. They have lied to their loyal players for 3 years telling us it will get better and they only seem to  release content that people dont care about or want. They have redone the single players story game now 3 TIMES!!  What does this say about their dev team.
For any console players looking at this as a new fun game to play with your friends, please stay away or if you want 10 hours of a single player rpg experience maybe pick it up on a sale.

2139460,Once Human,"I don't write a lot of reviews but this game definitely deserves one. 

I was lucky enough to play the game in the last beta thanks to a friend of mine recommending it. I had no idea what the game was about or anything but I fell in love with it within the first few hours and put a good 100+ hours in the last beta alone.

Now I just want to address some of the negative reviews this game has sadly got. 

*The terms of service/privacy policy: First off this game takes the same data all other online games take, just because one not so clever person tried to read for the first time and misunderstood what they said doesn't mean they are stealing your credit card details or any other nonsense they have been trying to review bomb it with. 
Don't be put off by someone having a fit because they can't read properly or understand how online games works.

*Multiple characters: the devs have fixed this issue within the first few hours of the release. Its already no longer an issue, and I found that a lot with these devs during the beta. They listen to what everyone has to say and if something is broken they will fix it a lot faster than most companies. 

*Spyware: I can't even be bothered commenting on this, its so stupid I don't want to waste mine or anyone's time that's reading this review. This game is not going to steal your bank details.

*Cryptominer: This is even dumber than the spyware one haha I can't even begin to lower my IQ enough to understand how they even came up with this one. 

*In-game purchases: First off, the game is absolutely free, you can download it, play it for a few hours and if you don't like it just uninstall it. If you do like it, you can enjoy the game for absolutely free without purchasing anything. You CAN of course purchase cosmetics and a season pass that unlocks other cosmetics and cool little things. None of which is pay to win because none of which contribute to stats, just cosmetics. And guess what, if you DO decide to purchase anything in game, you will purchase it through the STEAM STORE. Like every other game on steam. You don't have to send samples of your blood with your address and mothers maiden name to purchase anything. 
I just want to make clear I don't like any micro transactions, but when the game is free I may be tempted to spend £10 on a cool outfit and some skins for my weapons. 
People do this in 100's of games, and if people want to support the developers that way, then each to their own. 

*Server wipes: Yeah this sucks but from what I understand we get to keep our blueprints which are the hardest thing to get in game. The building & crafting is really fun in game so I don't really see a problem with it in that sense, it just gives people options to build in different areas etc. I'm not 100% sure how the server wipes will work until they do one, so for me I will enjoy the game until then and see what happens after the first wipe. 


And now the boring part is out of the way.

I really like this game, I fell in love with it in the beta and like it even more now its fully released. I like the survival and crafting, I love the graphics and huge open world map. I love the fact that me and a bunch of my friends can load up into server and pick an area and build our houses/bases near each other, share resources, fight bosses together. I love the deviants in the game which are these little pokemon-like creatures that mine, gather materials or fight for you. I love the fact that there's always an option to switch between PVE and PVP.

The game isn't perfect, but the developers are constantly working on improving the game and fixing any issues, which is a breath of fresh air in today's gaming industry. 

If you're into survival games, mmo's, 3rd person shooters with a ton of customisation options then you'll love this game.  If you play it with friends its awesome, if you play it solo you'll soon find people looking for others to create a hive or a warband. I'm not saying this game is for everyone, no game is. But if there's one advice I could give you is give the game a try, its free & if you don't like it that's cool, it didn't cost you anything and at least you've tried it. But if you like it, I promise you will have hours and hours of fun.","Mostly Positive71% of the 104,699 user reviews for this game are positive.",write review definitely deserves lucky play last pre release version available testing thanks friend mine recommending no_idea fell love hour good 100 hour last pre release version available testing alone address negative review sadly term service privacy policy take data online game not_so clever tried read misunderstood stealing credit card detail nonsense trying bomb someone fit read properly understand online game work multiple character fixed issue hour release already no_longer issue found pre release version available testing listen broken fix faster company spyware bothered commenting stupid waste mine reading not_going steal bank detail cryptominer dumber spyware haha lower iq understand purchase download play hour uninstall enjoy purchasing course purchase cosmetic season pas unlocks cosmetic cool thing pay win contribute stats cosmetic guess decide purchase purchase send sample blood address mother maiden name purchase clear micro transaction tempted spend 10 cool outfit skin weapon 100 game support developer computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player wipe yeah suck understand blueprint hardest building crafting fun problem sense give option build different area not_100 computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player wipe enjoy happens wipe boring fell love pre release version available testing released survival crafting love graphic huge open world love bunch friend load computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player pick build house base near share resource fight boss love deviant pokemon creature mine gather material fight love switch versus environment versus perfect developer constantly working improving fixing issue breath fresh air today gaming industry survival game massively multiplayer online 3rd shooter ton customisation option love play friend awesome play solo soon others hive warband not_saying no_game advice cool cost tried promise hour hour fun

Cyberpunk 2077 is a game of contradictions, deliciously ironic contradictions. CDPR's anticipated magnum opus turns into CDPR's apologetic mea culpa. Cyberpunk seethes and bursts with BURN CORPO SHIT outrage, only to be undermined by its very own and very corporate master overlords. The game is good but sometimes it's... bad. Gah!

Imagine a famous artist is meticulously crafting individual pieces for a massive masterpiece. He announces when he will unveil his work and everyone is very excited. However, he encounters a myriad of problems, halting his progress but not the reveal date's as it looms closer and closer. He delays the unveiling a few times but eventually decides that he [u]is[/u] done, after all, and reassures everyone of the quality of his work. As the curtain lifts, the onlookers are presented with an unmistakably rushed and unfinished product. In his haste, the artist had cobbled everything into an amalgam of fine, intricate details and rough, crude shapes. Some of the beautiful craftsmanship is apparent, but it is altogether a bit of a bloated and awkward mess that is held together by duct tape, delusion, and deception. That is Cyberpunk 2077.

However, for a game that was vomited out at the last minute, Cyberpunk does have some impressively redeeming chunks floating around in the muck. For one, the game looks quite amazing. It is the perfect canvas for creativity, with Night City posing as a gorgeous model for the one too many screenshots you will inevitably take. Unfortunately, the city itself only serves as a beautiful cardboard backdrop and not much else. It manages to appear full of life and yet it's lifeless at the same time. The excellent writing at least infuses personality and vitality into Cyberpunk and is the greatest strength of the game. When I beat it for the first time and got my first ending, it was a bad ending and I absolutely loved it (that particular ending is still my favorite after experiencing all the others). I was genuinely fascinated by its very cynical tone and the dark questions it raised about life and technology and the latter's ability to define the former. But whatever significance you might like to draw out of Cyberpunk's thought-provoking narrative, it's diluted by the large and empty open world and dull filler quests. This kind of self-sabotage happens throughout the game. CDPR will dazzle you with a bright little gem, only to dunk it moments later into a pool of rubbish.

And so I treasure the small but brilliant positives of Cyberpunk, glittering in the morass of bugs, glitches, half-baked bits, and a swamping of other problems the red-thumbed reviews will elaborate for you. If anything, in the few areas that CDPR succeeds with Cyberpunk, it succeeds extremely well, and well enough so that, for me, the game ends up more good than bad despite its issues. But Cyberpunk is a mixed bag to be sure, and one that requires waiting for a sale, careful sifting of the contents, and a willing blind eye to overlook the flaws.","Very Positive84% of the 693,658 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Let me make this clear, I love Dead By Daylight, which probably confuses you as I have stated that I wouldn't recommend this to other players, and there is a very good reason for this.
Firstly, certain elements of this game are incredibly unbalanced. The map system in this game is complete garbage, and even though I am a survivor main with 75% of my hours across all platforms being that of a survivor, most of the maps in this game are ruthless for killers. I wouldn't say this game is survivor sided, as realistically a ""scummy"" killer can hold all the power in a game by simply going against the ""survivor rulebook for killers"", but it is still brutal. Multiple videos providing evidence for this can be found online, including videos from Demi, Tru3Talent, etc. From broken loops to sweat squads with locker flashlighting on dead dawg saloon, the potential to destroy a killer's motivation to play this game is definitely there.
Secondly, after 1000 hours in this game, you would expect to be able to have all perks for all characters on at least half of the cast for one of the sides. I am sure if you were ridiculously efficient with how you spend your bloodpoints form the VERY beginning of the game, then it just might be barely possible. Tier systems for perks in this game are outdated and needs to be completely removed for both sides. This would avoid needed thousands of hours to be able to play any killer however you want, and play any survivor how you want as well. I'm aware changing survivors doesn't really matter too much, but for killers this is a really big deal.
Lastly, mmr is complete trash. The ""ranking"" system in dbd has never been accurate and probably never will be. Ironically the current ""grade"" system is better at ranking than the mmr ""ranking"" system. I'm aware in a game like this it is hard to create a sustainable ranking system, but just slapping a bad system onto it and calling it a day is not a solution.
Every new patch in dbd seems to make the game slightly more unplayable for both sides, but mostly for killers. Everyone runs the same 4 perks out of a pool of 6 or 7 on both sides, and it's ridiculous how little variety there is in this game. Half of the excellent perks are locked behind paywalls (which whilst not an issue for myself personally, is a giant issue for a 5 year old game). 
This is no longer a game that I have an infinite amount of passion for like I used to. I have played this game (on console) from just after it's launch, but repeatedly came back as I found the concept to be original and enticing. Back in late 2018 I switched to the PC version, stopped playing yet again but in 2019 was drawn back into it again. This was probably the peak of dbd for myself and a lot of others, as whilst it was unbalanced it was nowhere near as hellish as it currently is. I met some lifelong friends through this game so will always be grateful to it, and it will always hold a special place to me as far as a game can.
If you are thinking of getting this game, be prepared to sink thousands of hours into it before being able to play at an optimal level. I wish you luck, and hope you grow to love this game as much as I did.","Very Positive80% of the 546,855 user reviews for this game are positive.",clear love probably confuses stated recommend player good firstly certain element incredibly unbalanced complete garbage survivor 75 hour across platform survivor map ruthless killer survivor sided realistically scummy killer hold power simply survivor rulebook killer brutal multiple video providing evidence found online including video demi tru3talent broken loop sweat squad locker flashlighting dawg saloon potential destroy killer motivation play definitely secondly 1000 hour expect able perk character half cast side ridiculously efficient spend bloodpoints form beginning barely possible tier system perk outdated need completely removed side avoid needed thousand hour able play killer play survivor aware changing survivor matter killer big deal lastly mmr complete trash ranking dbd never_been accurate probably never_will ironically grade ranking mmr ranking aware hard sustainable ranking slapping bad onto calling not_a solution software fix bug balance add feature dbd slightly unplayable side mostly killer run 4 perk pool 6 7 side ridiculous variety half excellent perk locked paywalls whilst not_an issue personally giant issue 5 old no_longer infinite passion console launch repeatedly found concept original enticing late 2018 switched pc version stopped 2019 drawn probably peak dbd others whilst unbalanced nowhere near hellish currently met lifelong friend grateful hold special far prepared sink thousand hour able play optimal wish luck hope love
1063730,New World: Aeternum,"I'm not changing my review YET. However the Dev Update linked below represents a DRASTIC change in attitude and direction from the Dev team. It almost feels like an anti-player decision maker has been removed from power.

If these changes go through as indicated it would be an actual significant positive change in the player power increase system from the old 'Watermark' system to the new 'Expertise' system WITHOUT the big negatives that were previously announced.

ORIGINAL REVIEW
------------------------
TLDR: New World is and remains buggy and every patch causes more problems than it fixes. Game direction is trending towards 'make things take longer and reward less' instead of focusing on making gameplay more engaging and rewarding.

'Hardcore' players are struggling in a 'sunk cost' trap while newer or casual players are being punished for not grinding when things were faster/easier. Unless direction drastically changes new players should stay far away and existing players need to re-evaluate continuing to invest their time in a game that doesn't respect them.

-------------------

I have 783 hours played in New World as of the writing of this review.

I am part of the 'hardcore' population with 3 maxed out Crafting skills and most others 120+, all Gathering and Refining skills maxed besides Fishing. My gearset is solid for endgame PvE and PvP, with a Armor 590+ / Weapons 570+ watermark, significant coin and material wealth. My Company is PvP-centric and had to swap servers to stop having boring easy wins in war.

The above is not a brag, its meant to classify me as someone who SHOULD be fully SUNK COST invested and in denial defending the game. Unfortunately the New World Dev team seems to determined to take the game in the wrong direction.

On the technical front ... every patch seems to break more than it fixes, it generally feels like one step forward then two steps back. Currently servers feel 'laggy' no matter what activity you're engaging in. The 'player driven economy' they tout so heavily has been put on full lock down for multiple days twice now because they can't seem to control or manage the pervasive glitch/duplication exploits, some of which were known and publicized even before the game launched.

On the game design/direction front ... major changes seem largely focused on artificially lengthening the progression loop rather than making that loop more fun or at least less buggy.

The two highest level KEYED dungeons have been bugged since launch being incapable of progressing your watermark(gear drop level). They finally fix that bug, but in the same patch significantly reduce the drop quantity/rate of gear in general. Also in the same patch the boring 'elite zone' chest grind has been made longer by increasing mob health ... without any changes in engagement/difficulty. This boring 'end-game' task now takes longer and provides less progression than before. 'Add more hp to enemies' is the laziest and most obvious way to increase timegating of content. Its not harder or more engaging, just LONGER.

They've also significantly increased the grind to leveling all crafting tradeskills. If you didn't focus grind a skill to 200 already, welcome to being even FURTHER behind because now your grind is longer than the people that hit 200 already.

They've also retroactively changed crafted and dropped gear, FOR THE WORSE with no notice. This isn't 'balancing' by adjusting numbers, its completely changing stats and perks so the gear no longer serves the same purpose. This is absolutely disrespectful of player time and investment.","Mixed68% of the 243,329 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_changing linked represents drastic attitude direction feel an_emphasizedti decision maker removed power change indicated actual significant positive power increase old watermark expertise big negative previously announced http forum newworld com blog 619609 5 original world remains buggy software fix bug balance add feature cause problem fix direction trending towards thing longer reward focusing engaging rewarding hardcore player struggling sunk cost trap newer casual player punished not_repeatedly performing action gain resource thing faster easier unless direction drastically change player stay far existing player evaluate continuing invest respect 783 hour world writing hardcore population 3 maxed crafting skill others 120 gathering refining skill maxed besides fishing gearset solid endgame versus environment versus a_emphasizedrmor 590 weapon 570 watermark significant coin material wealth company versus centric swap server boring easy win war not_a brag meant classify someone sunk cost invested denial defending unfortunately world determined wrong direction technical front software fix bug balance add feature break fix generally feel forward step currently server laggy no_matter activity engaging driven economy tout heavily lock multiple day twice control manage pervasive software programming error cause unexpected behavior duplication exploit known publicized launched design direction front major change largely focused artificially lengthening progression loop rather loop fun buggy highest keyed dungeon bugged launch incapable progressing watermark gear drop finally fix bug software fix bug balance add feature significantly reduce drop quantity rate gear general software fix bug balance add feature boring elite zone chest grind longer increasing monster enemy health change engagement difficulty boring task take longer provides progression add hp enemy laziest obvious increase timegating not_harder engaging longer significantly increased grind leveling crafting tradeskills focus grind skill 200 already welcome grind longer 200 already retroactively changed crafted dropped gear worse no_notice balancing adjusting number completely changing stats perk gear no_longer serf purpose disrespectful investment

1. The matching mechanism of this game is poorly developed, with many people frequently losing several games in a row. It's rare to gain a few extra points when ranking wins, but not a single drop when losing. If you lose too many games, you will be assigned a completely inexperienced man-machine game.
2. The phenomenon of cheating in games has been repeatedly banned, and the authorities have been perfunctory in handling it.
3. The player's suggestions are ignored and perfunctory.
4. Difficulties in implementing new content.
5. The quality of legendary skins in games is getting worse and worse.
6. The game feels worse every season.
7. The plot has been out for four seasons and has never been released again.

Great game, with amazing potential. But lack of developer trancparency and rampant cheating will lead to it's downfall.

Lets start this off by saying V.A.C. is a joke... it doesn't do much other than be a meme for the community to bash on. Valve makes billions of micro transaction and yet does nothing to improve player experience by cracking down on cheater and hackers. Every low skill competetive game is full of smurfs (players with alot of experience playing in lower level games) and or hackers. Valves overwatch program catches non cheating players who happen to have a streak of good games/plays, and fails to capture the ""closet hackers"" - or people who using hacks, but play a style that makes it seem that don't. 

""Prime Matchmaking"" failed to deliver on it's goal of seperating out cheatings/smurfs from players who wan't to play against players their skill level and have a good time. It was a good idea, worked at first, but if a player can get a program undetectable by VAC, how hard is it for them to buy Prime Ready Accounts, and get access to a phone number?

Rumors have been spreading on community forums that Valve is in the works of a ""Super VAC"" yet it's been 5 or so years since the games launch, and they yet to deliver on anything more than in game accessories (gun skins, stickers, music kits, GLOVES, pins, etc) and questionable mechanic changes. I understand they want to make money - but who is going to buy their products when no one is around because of the shakey servers and toxic/hacking community.

I'm extremely disappointed in Valve - like many others, this review will get drowned in the vastness of QQ and phony reviews. There is only one way to getting Valve to act...

Boycott all Valve microtransactions. I'm am no longer buying any more products through Counter Strike or any other valve game until they make reforms to match making. When they have they revenue stream in jeopardy - only then will they listen to player/community concerns and start making changes we want/need to see.

For current players, I feel your struggle, hear your cries, and share your rage. Stop purchacing valve skins, keys, kits, pins, whatever. Stop using the community market and boycott all valve micro transactions.

For future players - hold off from playing this game, the current experience will only turn you away and make your want to quit before you have seen the small glimor of light that is the csgo community. As well, don't purchase the game unless you are ready to pay 5$ a month for a 3rd party subscrition in order to have a decent competetive experience.

TL:DR - Game has potential, but too many hackers. Valve doesnt do ENOUGH to remedy the issues.
Use your wallet as your voice, stop buying Valve related products (including your favorite skins) until our concerns and issues are addressed and fixed.","Very Positive86% of the 8,406,353 user reviews for this game are positive.",4 10 great amazing potential lack developer trancparency rampant cheating lead downfall let saying v c joke meme community bash valve make billion micro transaction improve cracking cheater hacker low skill competetive smurfs player alot lower game hacker valve overwatch program catch non cheating player happen streak good game play fails capture closet hacker hack play style make prime matchmaking failed deliver goal seperating cheating smurfs player wan t_emphasizedo play player skill good good idea worked program undetectable vac hard prime ready account access phone number rumor spreading community forum valve work super vac 5 year game launch deliver accessory gun skin sticker music kit glove pin questionable mechanic change understand product no_one shakey server behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner hacking community extremely disappointed valve others drowned vastness qq phony review valve act boycott valve microtransactions no_longer buying product counter strike valve reform revenue stream jeopardy listen community concern change player struggle hear cry share rage purchacing valve skin key kit pin whatever community market boycott valve micro transaction future player hold turn quit small glimor light csgo community purchase unless ready pay 5 3rd party subscrition order decent competetive tl dr potential hacker valve doesnt remedy issue wallet voice buying valve related product including favorite skin concern issue addressed fixed

Pros:
-Waifu bosses
-(reboot server is the only aspect that isnt p2w)

Cons:
-need pay-to-win gears to get to and beat waifu bosses

-boring events and / or recycled events

-dev doesnt listen to the community (they recently did a survey on r/maplestory, however, every person's concern were either skimmed over or just blatantly ignored, instead the devs addressed the issue by making up  their own opinions. Basically a survey of wasting players 5mins)

-community manager sucks at communicating (r/maplestory hates the community manager because he has blatantly banned a player on the official forums reason being the player criticized the CM on reddit...like really dude?)

-no transparency between devs and the community (theres no communication channel between the CM and the community unlike every other game this age, theres no weekly stream, theres no dev logs, theres no updates on if any of the glitches/issues are being worked on, NOTHING)

-toxic community 

-censor words in the game are just ridiculous, ""my first time"" is censored...

-grind fest (surely it's been made easier to level from 1-200, however, most end game content is located at lv 220, to put in perspective, lv 219-220 is leveling 1-200 4 times)

-useless quests, an insane amount of useless quests (what's even worse is the rewards doesn't even scale to level, and the rewards are straight up fodder made for NPC or tossing it away, consequently you can progress in the game without doing a single quest, whats even better i you'll lag LESS if you dont do them)

-game is filled with hackers, botters, and cash farmers (aka the economy in the game is absolutely horrible, and it isnt that easy to get money either)

-game masters doesnt do jack with hackers (to top it off, game masters themselves dont know how to play the game, i.e. during GM events, they dont even know the censorship is outta whack in the game (you can see the words not censored on your side, but on other people's screen it's censored), doesnt know how to cancel buffs via right click)

-very easy to hack in and will result with no consequences whatsoever

overall, a mediocre, less-than-average game to waste time in but not good enough to stick around if youre coming back or wanting to try this game out

Needless to say, I was hooked. The cartoony yet oddly satisfying visuals, the huge world that was set before me, the deceptively simple class system, all things that I adored about it. For a while, I couldn't get enough of this game. It was my first MMO ever, and, to this day, probably still my favorite. Nothing comes close to the fun I had while killing mushrooms in the starting zone, slaying Balrogs on airships, destroying robots in Ludi, and finally, conquering Zakum. I made many friends, joined a slew of guilds, and mostly, just had fun. That's what videogames were about back when I played Maplestory, and in a sense, it seems like they've kind of lost that recently, although that's a different topic entirely. Maplestory now seems to be much more oversaturated in terms of classes and things to do, actually making it an overwhemingly experience rather than an extremely enjoyable one, one that I had when I played. Needless to say however, I still had a HUGE amount of fun with this game, and is hands-down one of the best experiences, if not THE best, I've had in gaming.

[b]Comment:[/b]
The game is infamous for an objectively awful launch after many years of hype and promises. Thing is, had they left many promises out, the game would have been received better and maybe they would have enough time to Polish it before launch (pun intended). Finishing up in 'rona lock-down times didn't help either. This is apparent by patch 1.5 which fixed a HUGE amount of problems this game had. But coming 15 months after launch already had lots of people lose interest. I pre-ordered the game but after reading about the launch didn't touch it until April of 2022. And I am SO glad I did. I will go right ahead and mention the strongest part of CP2077 - the story telling. Most dialogues are really good, and make you realize how most other RPGs have ""robots"" talking to each other in stare-downs. There is just something more organic here, and while not perfect, it flows nicely. The characters often start as your standard stereotypes but get more interesting as you learn their stories and motives. And, by the end, you will be left with many memorable moments etched in your brain by a superb soundtrack. Then we have the gameplay and all you really need to know is that it's FUN. There's a big bunch of side stuff but not once did I want it to be over with already. And the variety here is cool - stealth is just as useful as full sprint combat, and while a couple of missions prefer you to go in quiet, most leave it up to you entirely. So much replayablity presents itself here that everyone can find something that's fun for them. For weapon there are three main types of guns - power (standard ricochet bullets), tech (wall hack laser slugs) and smart (auto-targeting missiles). Honestly, they all feel great and it's up to you to pick your favourite (mine were tech pistols, Burya FTW!). Melee can feel clunky at start, especially hand-to-hand combat. But once you get used to the camera-to-enemy distance it's actually pretty strong and viable. There is an abundance of pistols and katanas so it's easy to guess what the devs aimed for the most. The other stuff is just as great though, albeit less varied. Third type of ""weapons"" are cyberdecks, which let you hack your enemies or their surroundings. Eventually, you can walk into a room full of enemies and kill them all by just looking at them. The skill tree and crafting complement this gameplay but you can beat the game without checking out either. Probably a good thing because the balance between them isn't that great (some are meh, some too OP). They are there to just enhance the experience but in the end it's all up to how YOU move and aim. The variations are crazy and I didn't even mention all the other gadgets you can use. It is very rare for a game to engage me so much that I think of what's the next playthrough going to be like while still in the ""prologue"". And even more rare to have that momentary feeling of ""what do I do with my life now..."" after finishing the main story line. You might not want to support CDPR with the full cost for all the things wrong at launch ... but I'd say at half off most people will not feel like a gonk by getting this game. Recommended, my choombas!

The lore has been flattened and the writing is one dimensional. You will be treated like a moron with a 2 second attention span by the repetitive dialogue.

Three choices from Inquisition alone make it into the game. None of your choices from the entirety of Origins, 2, and the rest of Inquisition are touched upon, which feels like a slap in the face.

Speaking of character, Rook doesn't have any. You might chose all the most ""aggressive"" dialogue choices, but there's so much scripted dialogue which you don't have a say in that turns Rook soft and bland like a mushy porridge.
I can't and won't speak for the game after the 7 hour mark because I will not be playing it any further. If you want to know how the rest of the story goes, just watch spoilers on youtube like I did.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Enshrouded is a survival-crafting game that is trying to emulate great game play mechanics from other great games without an understanding as to what makes them great.

To be clear: in my first couple of hours, I was having fun. I enjoyed exploring the landscape, finding bits of lore hidden away, being an absolute loot gremlin in the process. I think that the base building mechanics and Terrain editing has a lot to offer those who like building a cool base.

That said, the combat is incredibly shallow. At times it's trying to be a souls-lite, but the enemies are not intelligent enough, responsive enough, or frankly interesting enough to put up a real fight. Dodge-rolling is present, but simply jumping is an easier and more stamina effective method of avoiding incoming damage in most cases. Enemies, for the most part, don't become more technically challenging as you progress; rather, it's a game of ""number go up"" where the same enemies make the same attacks, but have more HP and do more damage. 

The ""craftspeople"" you rescue to unlock further building capability feel odd. They provide commentary and some quests, but for the most part just stand there and act as a living workbench. Would be way more interesting if they had passive jobs while at your base.

Overall, from what I could tell from watching higher-level gameplay from youtubers, it doesn't seem that gameplay expands or changes dramatically after you climb the first tower. Numbers go up, you get more crafting stations, but otherwise it's all the same. 

Finally, the performance. I don't have a super high-spec computer, but this game is so horribly optimized that I get more frames and graphical fidelity playing Cyberpunk than I do from this game. Add to that, while playing it would take up several gigabytes of space on my SSD.

I could go on and talk about a bunch of more minor issues, such as the lack of character customization options, or how wonky the gliding mechanics are, I think the above critiques are enough on their own for me to decide that I'm likely not playing this again. 

And, yes. It's early access. I am well aware that this game could be patched into a better game. But a game should have it's core fundamentals figured out well before it leaves alpha. Valheim launched with several biomes unfinished and it's still not ""done"", but the gameplay loop was so solid and well designed that few of those core mechanics have been tweaked since, and it's regarded as a well-made modern survival crafter to this day.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"""Even if it does violate... The Golden Order.""

These are some of the first words you will hear in Elden Ring. It plants a mystery in your mind that persists until the very end. I knew right then that this game was something beyond special.

Elden Ring is a difficult game, especially for new-comers like me, who are new to the Souls-series of games, but that did not stop my endless amazement and sense of wonder every step I took. The environments, the bosses, the silent storytelling of the world around me was so.. unique. The more I played, the more I wanted to know, and I fell deep down the rabbit hole of this game's world.

I will never forget the cinematic landscapes you see for each new area, the distant castle walls or giant golden trees. It is truly something you need to experience.

The gameplay itself is quick and tight, the bosses pose interesting challenges that respect your time. Slaying a boss, especially the ones in the main story, feels like you really did something substantial, as often the world changes around you in their absence.

You are only ever given one goal in Elden Ring that truly matters.

Sudden Pop-in's?  Never seen it, i have seen it's fixed in recent update notes.
Bad facial animations?  Apperantly fixed with 21 november update. All animations i see are really good if not among the top tier.
Weak AI?  Fixed as well, i don't see a trace of it.
Woke propaganda?  I think they are saying that just because you play with a female character... There is nothing woke about this game it's just good old Star Wars dialogue nothing that resembles real world and our politics.
Does it run bad? It isn't optimized perfectly like Doom Eternal but it's decent by industry standard.  Also there is lots and lots of graphic options you can tweak around, I haven't seen that many options without mods in a long while.

I would assume most people that actually try to play the game instead of just hating it randomly, would actually love it. If the game starts falling apart after a while which i really wouldn't think so, I will update my review accordingly. Good luck and have fun!

2344520,Diablo® IV,"Tldr: I kept playing thinking it was going to get better. It didn't. 

Gameplay: So if you're as old as me you might remember Diablo and then the improvements made for Diablo 2. This is a devolution. The main gimmick it to kill LOTS of minions with a variety of flashy spell animations, collect better loot, outfit your character with said better loot and then kill LOTS more minions. Same loop as in D2, except they've downgraded the difficulty. I remember distinctly the boss battles and things you had to learn and do to survive boss battles, even at easy difficulties. Here, there is none of that. It wasn't until I hit nightmare difficulty that I even died, and that was just because I'd grown so lazy. I'm not sure what the draw is here for continued playtime but I definitely was dragging from about hour 4 on. We tried to rush through the story once we realized we weren't getting any better loot in normal difficulty, and thought maybe nightmare would be better. It really wasn't. 2/5 for gameplay and only giving the 2 because some of the spells are flashy.
Story: The story has always been a little bit reserved in Diablo but at each point you progressed to a new area in the older ones you were rewarded with a gorgeous cut scene (for the time) and some additional progression/lore that you learned. The story is more present in this game as many quests relate to it, but it's just god-awful. You don't care about any of the side characters, their motivations are paper-thin or extremely in your face tropey. I only remember one true cut-scene that was fantastic towards the end of the story, but it almost felt out of place since everything else was just so barebones. 2/5 for story.
Music: Forgettable. 1/5.
Graphics/Artstyle: Very bland. Everywhere looked basically the same shade of beige. Enemy types are very samey as well. 2/5.
Fun factor: Played 26 hours looking for it, couldn't find it. Gave it a good shot. I knew it was gone, but held out hope they might come back, RIP Blizzard. 2/5.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"[h1]Overview[/h1]
[h3](100% Spoiler-Free Review)[/h3]
[b]Cyberpunk 2077[/b] (CP 2077) is an open-world action RPG set in Night City, a sprawling techno-metropolis built by the mega-corporations that rule the world. In a dystopian future where violence, corruption run rampant and money is all that matters, players impersonate ""V"" - forced to become a gun-for-hire after their previous life is shattered by a chain of events. Along with their longtime friend Jackie Welles and other characters, V will be struggling for survival, money and fame in the ever-risky life of a Night City mercenary.

🟩 [b]The Good Side[/b]
[list]

[*][b]No, YOU are breathtaking![/b]
Even with all the performance issues, CP 2077 proves to be an outstanding technical milestone for gaming as a whole. A bustling, crowded metropolis is recreated flawlessly, with imposing skyscrapers and neon lights dominating the skyline. In more open areas such as the Badlands, desolate plains full of wreckage span for miles, with Night City always dominating the landscape in the distance. At the same time each location is rich with individual details, which wouldn't be expected given the overall scale of the environment.

[*][b]Content, so much content.[/b]
This title is abundant with side-missions and activities. From police department calls to help fight crime, to mercenary contracts given by the city's Fixers or unique side-quest lines featuring significant characters, CP 2077 has it all. The amount of actually handcrafted, unique side-quests with their own plot and variations is great - while even in the small-time jobs like police calls, there is always some lore to be found that tells a small story. Since most of these activities award achievements, unique weapons, vehicles and gear, they're definitely worth doing.

[*][b]V whoever you want to be[/b]
The character build possibilities offered by CP 2077 are deep and varied enough to warrant multiple playthroughs, to experience the diverse possible playstyles. Since there is no way to max out all attributes in a single run, many gameplay-changing implants and skills will be locked out at some point. The game as often RPGs do, favors min-maxed builds over hybrids. From hulking metal-clad behemoths armed with machineguns, to stealthy netrunners using hacking and subterfuge to succeed, V has many possibilities to develop his or her skills in a unique way.

[*][b]Fear & Loathing in Night City[/b]
The storyline of 2077, and to a lesser extent its most substantial side missions, are both well written and interesting. The characters surrounding the odyssey of V are distinct, coherent and fleshed out very well. Though not all of them share the same personal evolution in relation to the events, they stay in-character till the end. The plot itself is interesting especially a bit later, and uses good quality art direction along with music to create the necessary pathos when needed. Choices are not as broad as one would expect from a RPG, but they open up a lot more towards the ending parts.
[/list]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2320760487

🟥 [b]The Bad Side[/b]
[list]

[*][b]Cyberbug 2077[/b]
CP 2077 is one of the most bugged AAA releases I have ever seen, on par with new Vegas at launch if not worse, to give the idea. From minor glitches such as people disappearing as soon as V turns, to game-breaking issues like quests getting stuck or mission critical items simply not working, there is just an immense amount of problems. The game is playable, but hardly really enjoyable. This is not the state in which a game with this much budget and dev time behind it, should come out at any point.

[*][b]The chosen one?[/b]
Balance becomes an issue in late-game, as V will acquire so much powerful hardware and perks, to become very close to Neo in Matrix in terms of power. One-shotting any non-boss enemy will become more and more common even on the hardest difficulty, while even bosses become only a nuisance once level cap is reached and all the best gear is acquired. This makes supposedly legendary enemies become underwhelming, and their fights much less epic.

[h1]In-Depth Breakdown[/h1]
🎮 [b]Gameplay Analysis[/b]
Gameplay is divided into Exploration, Combat and Character Management.

[b]Exploration[/b]
Is performed on foot and with vehicles, progressively obtained by purchasing them or from certain quests. Fast travel terminals are also present in the world and unlocked by going near them. Night city and environs form an immense amount of space, but fortunately all relevant missions are already highlighted on the global map for convenience. Each location of both main and side missions often houses secrets and plenty of loot, other then lore documents to know more about the world. At first only one sector is available, while others are unlocked a bit further in the main storyline. 

[b]Combat[/b]
Plays out in first person, with an equal focus on firearms and melee weapons depending on one's style. Both weapon categories have different mechanics, for instance melee ones can block, parry and counter, while each ranged weapon class feels different to handle and can mount specific accessories. Hacking is also a strong component of any fight, with hacks capable of disrupting enemy weapons, turn machines into allies, or even instantly kill someone. The environment can be a formidable ally, with explosive containers and similar items being plentiful. Implants, mods and perks can change how combat plays out significantly: some slow time, others allow using unique ammunition or specialized hardware.

[b]Character Management[/b]
Is performed via a series of menus including inventory, crafting and cyberware. Most customization can be done anywhere out of combat, while to change implants, V has to go to a Ripperdoc and undergo surgery. Weapons can be upgraded with Crafting to get better stats, though it becomes more and more expensive each time. In the same way items can be scrapped for materials or sold to merchants for a quick buck, though this is worthless until late game. Attributes and perk points are awarded each level or from certain rare items, allowing the creation of a specialized build with several skill trees to match each.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"If you're buying this game for the singleplayer, go ahead, it's a pretty fun and still somewhat amazing game, but don't go for GTA Online. It has been completely ruined throughout the years, every lobby you run into has a modder or more guaranteed, grinding is extremely boring and repetitive, and you'll probably run into hundreds of thousands of Broomstick MK2 braindead griefers trying to ruin your experience, and since the company (Cockstar) cares more about selling you virtual credit cards instead of actually attempting to make their game more fun or even playable, you'll most likely get a really negative experience in the online, and maybe even your account banned for nothing, and your personal info stolen and your internet DDOSed in the worst case scenario (modders can do that), unless you play solo (which kinda breaks the point of multiplayer don't ya think) or with friends only, there's really no point to the online. Which makes me really sad, since it has so much wasted potential because of company greed, me myself i love to dogfight in this game using jets and helicopters, but it's completely ruined when a tiny ass moskito which is really hard to hit comes at you with a barrage of absurd almost aimbot tracking homing missiles.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"I could write an entire textbook on why this game sucks ass, with cited examples and sources, but that won't fit in a steam review. so I'll summarize. The devs do not give 1 singular fuck about this game or franchise. none of the current dev team are trustworthy and all they care about is the money they get from shitty recolors of old skins and random color patterns. The devs have an extensive and well-documented history of directly lying to their players, over several years and across multiple games(not just apex).

The ""skill based"" matchmaking in this game has been entirely nonfunctional since season 12(which was in early 2022) and it is IMPOSSIBLE to play this game casually. ""Pubs"", the non-ranked gamemode, will put ANYONE against ANYONE else, and that means the champion squad is always a premade team of 3 of the top 0.04% of players in the world(real number, not exaggerated). In ranked, which is supposed to be the competitive gamemode that matches you against people of similar rank/skill, there ARE skill brackets that it uses to put people into matches, but they barely exclude any ranks at all, and are rarely even used, so it is possible to see the HIGHEST RANK IN THE WORLD in a lobby with the LOWEST RANK IN THE WORLD. This is a known and extremely well-documented problem that has been going on for over a year, and will likely never be fixed, because it is functioning as designed. Yes, you read that right, the matchmaking is not broken in any way and is functioning exactly as intended.

On top of the matchmaking bullshit, the audio in this game(specifically enemy footsteps) doesn't work 40% of the time, and the servers have performance comparable to a 2012 model macbook, with constant stutters, rubber banding, freezes, the occasional slow motion server, etc.

This is a multi billion dollar game with infinitely worse performance, function, and servers than pretty much any indie game I have ever played.

I cannot say it enough, do not play this game. And if you must, do not EVER think about giving a cent to this lying, credit stealing, backstabbing scam company.

I wish this game was good. It has the framework to be great. It was good once. But the devs ruined it against the wishes of their players.

216150,MapleStory,"Is the game as it used to be ? No, but the game itself is not bad, actually they fixed tons of problems over years, while creating a whole new problem - lack of socializing.

There is utterly no reason to ever be involved with other players, everything you used to do, all the big bosses are now easy to solo. Leveling is so fast it almost doesn't matter where you do it, and the wast world and content looks dead no matter how many people are in server, you will be lucky to meet anyone while exploring. Making new friends was what most people were playing the game in the first place, no matter how unfair, unforgivable and out right cruel and life consuming it was.

Is the game bad? No! 

Will you meet new friends? No!

Is the game still like decent mmorpg? Also no!

Is it worth trying it out? Probably yes, a lot of cool characters to play and the game is free, you don't have to buy single thing if you don't wish to. Decent time waster, i still enjoy the game though i have not met even single new friend in this ''multiplayer'' game.

252490,Rust,"The game itself is incredible.  The community is toxic AF.  There are no ""noob friendly"" servers, no matter what the server title may say.  This game is a breeding ground for no-lifers.  The grown adults who live in their parents' basements and play non-stop 48 or 72 hours at a time.  Every time you think you've found a ""casual"" server, you will end up rage quiting when you are gunned down on your spawn beach by someone who's been online 50+ hours camping that very spot waiting for the joy of killing someone who is defenseless.  And then you will type in chat asking why they can't give you a break while you are trying to learn the game.  They will immediately follow up with ""That's Rust"" or some similiar platitude.  But the game is really good so you will eventually get over your rage and try it again and again and you will just repeatedly find yourself in the same scenario repeatedly.  It's a love-hate relationship.

TL;DR: This is an A+ game that has been ruined by a horrific no-lifer community.  90% of the player base is literally that fatass no-lifer from the South Park WoW episode.","Very Positive87% of the 932,545 user reviews for this game are positive.",incredible community behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner af no_a inexperienced unskilled friendly server no_matter computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player title breeding ground no_lifers grown adult live parent basement play non 48 72 hour found casual computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player rage quiting gunned player enemy enter world beach someone online 50 hour waiting strategic location ambush defeat player enemy spot waiting joy killing someone defenseless type chat asking break trying learn immediately follow similiar platitude good eventually rage repeatedly scenario repeatedly love hate relationship tl dr ruined horrific no_lifer community 90 base literally fatass no_lifer south park wow episode
1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"Update: 1,000 hours in, and many well deserved awards later, I proudly stand by my first review of BG3. To Larian I say again- Well done mates. This is what an RPG should be. And to you, dear reader- This game is a gift, you know. You won't forget it.

Original review: 300 hours in and I'm still finding new quests that I've missed - New personal cutscenes with my player character and my companions - New dialogue and character development that I revealed by strengthening my relationships with my companions and gaining their trust. I wasn't going to write a review, I was going to just continue to enjoy my time in early access alone and with friends, but playing as much as I have, I feel compelled to share my experience. In all honesty, I am beyond impressed. Let's set 'early access' aside for a moment because it has the customary visual bugs etc that one would expect. However; the story being told here in the world and especially between you and your companions is beyond top notch. The dialogue in this game has made me laugh my ass off at times, and has also made me cry real heartfelt tears. Anyone who enjoys story driven games and has the time to really dig in and get to know the characters in this game will be rewarded. My advice is to take your time with it. Save often. Go back to camp and sleep often. Make new races and characters, and make different choices to see how different one playthrough can be from another. Take the time to gain trust between your companions and they will respond in kind. If the first act is any indication of what the final product will be, saying that I am looking forward to the full release is a large understatement. Well done, Larian. Well fucking done mates. This is what an rpg should be.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 597,972 user reviews for this game are positive.",1 000 hour deserved award proudly stand bg3 larian mate role dear reader gift forget original 300 hour finding quest missed personal cutscenes companion dialogue development revealed strengthening relationship companion gaining trust write continue enjoy player purchase play official release alone friend compelled share honesty impressed s_emphasizedet player purchase play official release aside moment customary visual bug expect told world especially companion top notch dialogue laugh as time cry real heartfelt tear enjoys driven game dig character rewarded advice save camp sleep race character different choice different playthrough gain trust companion respond kind act indication final product saying forward release large understatement larian fucking mate role

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"[b][u]STORY: (5/5)[/u][/b] The story is the main draw of this game for many people in my opinion. It's scope and depth is well beyond most normal MMO fare and will take you from humble adventurer beginnings to seeing you to becoming [spoiler]""The Warrior of Light""[/spoiler] and beyond across the base game and at current count two expansions. So it's quite easy to say that there is a lot of story available to sink your teeth into. In fact it took me about 200 hours to get through the base game's story and 100 hours for each additional expansion. YMMV as I like to take my time and do every quest and side quest available. The expansions in particular are quite good. Do yourself a favor and don't be in a rush to end game(or worse spoil it by purchasing a skip potion from the Mog Station) or you will miss out on a huge part of the game.

[b][u]GAMEPLAY: (5/5)[/u][/b] FFXIV is almost exactly like a standard MMO when it comes to most gameplay mechanics. However, it takes those mechanics and excels at it better than every other MMO currently on the market and adds extra stuff besides. The amount of content in this game is staggering. There is so much to do in this game you will get lost and it may end up seeming overwhelming at first. I've sunk over 1,300 hours in this game(on PC, I also played on Playstation previously before switching to PC) and I've still not done everything the game has to offer. End game you can do anything from Raid to your hearts content, delving into dungeons, participating in PvP matches, Crafting or Gathering, participate in hunts against high level and difficult world boss type monsters, playing pretend Sims and decorate your house or do some gardening in one of the wards of player housing available, creating glamours for your character, playing music if you're a Bard, collecting minions, playing mini-games, participating in seasonal events, ect the list can go on. Suffice it to say you will never lack something to do. The best part is content is reguarly added as well every 1.5 to 3 month intervals. The next patch 4.2 should be coming sometime in Jan 2018 and will have a ton of new content and dungeons to play.

Now to the downsides. The biggest would probably be the Mog Station is very controversial in the game. It is essentially a cash shop in a subscription based game that sells mostly cosmetic gear and mounts for sometimes very steep prices. However, it also started selling ""Jump Potions"" that will instantly level a character to level 60 in one of the combat classes. This is NOT the max level currently as that is 70 so they will still need to do some work to catch up. They're also selling ""Story Skip"" potions as well which allow someone to skip past the story in the base game and the first expansion Heavensward. My personal opinion is don't buy these skip potions. You're just cheating yourself out of content you paid money for. The other downside is that when Stormblood released they reworked some of the jobs to get rid of skill bloat. This made some of the jobs top heavy meaning that below level 50 they're kinda of boring to play and this may turn people off to the game who just started playing who don't know about it. On another note pre-50 most people(myself included) consider ""Tutorial"" for the game. Keep playing the Main Story and don't worry about rushing to the end game. Enjoy the ride while learning how to play!

[b][u]SOUND: (4/5)[/u][/b] This game has some of the best musical scores I've heard in any game. It also has an ""Orchestration"" system that allows you to collect ""Orchestration Rolls"", which are the musical scores in the game, and replay them in any Inn or at your house if you place an Orchestration(essentially a jukebox). It's quite fun to collect them all and again some of them are very good.

[b][u]GRAPHICS: (4/5)[/u][/b] The art and level design in this game is impressively good for an MMO. I'd say it's the best out of any MMO I've yet to play to date. If you need any exact examples feel free to check out some of the 100+ screenshots I've uploaded from this game over the period of this past year.

[b][u]REPLAY VALUE: (5/5)[/u][/b] This game has essentially infinite replay value as far as I'm concerned. There is an incredible amount of content to do and replay if you so desire. From dungeons to raids to hunts, ect. You will not find yourself without something to do if you look for something.

I picked it up between the Legion and BFA expansions of WoW as a game to kinda dip my toes into. Now it's my main MMO and I'm in love with this game and all aspects of it. Well...most aspects, not all

The combat feels deep and rewarding with a plethora of ways to handle building your character. You can try all types of creative and fun builds without the worry of being a parse monkey (unless you're going for the highest level of progression). The only bad part is the fact abilities sometimes fail to fire off which can be frustrating. Pls fix the bugs, ZoS.
The open world is the best of any MMORPG with how the game utilizes its world. All quests are voice acting, all NPC's are voiced. The questlines in the game are amazing.

I love the PvP even if it can be frustrating in its performance lately. But there's no game that feels quite like this one. Most people write off PvP because the skill gap and don't know why they are dying. But I promise if you take the time to learn the fundamentals and mechanics of it, you might fall in love as well.

Dungeons: Best dungeons of any MMO hands down. Maybe not the base game stuff, but the DLC dungeons on veteran and vet hard mode are incredible.

Trials/Raids: The only part of the game I can't speak to the quality of because I don't have the patience to be on a raid team. I enjoy the dungeons and the pvp and that's enough for me.

Arenas: Amazing solo and group arenas exist with tons of awesome rewards and weapons

Character building: This game is a true RPG in how you kit out your character and play specific builds. You'll find out when you play

The bad: Crown store. Stay so far from it, it is predatory to new players and half the stuff on it shouldn't be on it. Even worse, the crown crates rely on FOMO to get you to buy them. Please do not buy them. I am a hypocrite for saying this because I've bought them, but I'm the exact player they're preying on it with. I know I shouldn't buy them yet I do.

ESO Plus is also pushed on you pretty hard as a new player because you won't have a craft bag and won't have access to any of the DLC content. Fear not new players. When starting the game. DO NOT pick up crafting materials while on non-sub account. Instead, use the time to put items on research because you can't even really use those materials unless you have things researched. So research while exploring the game and playing at your own pace. Craft later

1643320,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"The new Stalker turned out to be not quite what was expected. Which is quite logical, in 14 years any game would be very different from the previous one. Therefore, the developers had to try hard not to make it a failure. A similar situation with Half-Life 3. If the continuation of the HL series came out after 14 years, it would either be a failure or Valve would have to come up with something absolutely grandiose, ideal, preserving everything as before. That's why it was not released and it is unlikely that this will ever happen. But specifically with Stalker 2, the situation is different. GSC Game World made a dystopian game in 14 or 6 years. They did not try, they made an average game, which at the start did not work properly, thereby throwing shit into the ventilator for Russian haters. Personally, I, like many others, obviously expected much more from this project, in 14 years. It seems that the developers from GSC really dislike their fans, releasing such a game. The developers' hostility towards the player is felt in the first minutes of a serious fight in Stalker 2. Enemies hear you and shoot through walls with amazing accuracy, when you can't kill an enemy without armor with your AKS-74 or MP4, emptying the entire clip. It feels like you're playing with players using evil Rage Cheats in CS 2. This is also indirectly confirmed by the fact that for so long they worked on the game they didn't do any optimization, people like me simply can't play at 10 fps. Unfavorable unrealistic economy in the game. Some tips on the loading screen are repeated under the same number, they sound ridiculous because the game simply doesn't have the mechanics described in these tips. And there are still many bloopers, bugs, lags, etc. Perhaps they just hyped up good reviews about their product and didn't even apologize for all of the above, and they are in no hurry to release patches. Although the reviews can be quite real, if they are written by some fools or just loyal fans, I will not claim anything, but nevertheless I am not the only one who wrote about serious problems of the game that they do not pay attention to. In general, the developers of this studio have already ruined their reputation by making the game for 14 years and with the release of Stalker 2 they completely ruined my attitude towards them.
Stalker 2 looks much worse than its competitors, Metro Exodus or Cyberpunk in terms of gameplay, optimization and graphics. And this is despite the fact that the listed games were released much earlier and Stalker was developed, let me remind you, for a very long time. I have not yet met a single game where the optimization was so bad on release that it was completely impossible to play.

More about the game:
After watching the gameplay trailers, it seemed to me that the game would be similar to Call of Duty in the style of modern shooters on UE. But my expectations were not met and this is good because then it would have completely killed the atmosphere of the first Stalker. What the developers really deserve to be praised for is that even after so many years and the transition to a new engine, some of the atmosphere of the first games has been preserved. They were able to repeat the same ""rough"" textures similar to those in the first games, which brings back that very atmosphere. But since this is UE5, this is not enough. This deficiency is immediately visible, for example, by the rounded geometry of buildings, etc. The first Stalkers had their own engine that did all this, any other, of course, will not repeat everything as much as it was before.
Although the graphics are inferior to other games, at the same time it is pleasing that now there is Stalker with high resolution textures similar to those that were before.
Otherwise, there are only disadvantages ...
There is no longer such a feeling that you are exploring abandoned places of the Soviet Union, zones in general as consequences of those times ...
I think this is also connected with the transition to UE.
They removed some mechanics from the first games. For example, displaying the name of the group when looting a corpse. Some associations, names, behavior of NPCs and groups have changed a lot, new ones have appeared. Which negatively affects the immersion in the game, if this is considered not as a new game, but as a continuation of the old ones.
They removed the atmospheric ambient music that played in the background in the first parts of Stalker, or at least they could not make the same new one.
Poor lighting, many darkened graphic objects, and the change of day and night works too quickly. During sleep, it is impossible to control what time of day to wake up.
Each time the game is loaded, shaders are compiled.
There is almost no benefit in looting corpses, they always have broken weapons, no ammo, no variability. Returning to the question of the economy in the game.
Changing weapons takes quite a long time, there is no automatic reloading with the default game settings.
Everyone speaks Ukrainian, and the translation in the subtitles is not entirely accurate. Which is unrealistic because in Ukraine many people also use Russian. I can't say anything about the plot because I haven't completed the game yet.
If you take everything listed at the beginning of the review and add cheating enemies, the mortality of the main character, bad economy, optimization, and the fact that the graphics and gameplay are inferior to competitors for so many years of waiting for this game, draw your own conclusions..

Now more about optimization:
This is just awful. After a while, the fps drops to 10-15. And when the fps stays around 50, stutters appear. The first two hours of playing were still bearable, but then the fps drops began to occur more often and it became unplayable.
With a decrease in texture quality, the inclusion of frame generation parameters and dlls, the game begins to work at 100 fps a little more stably, but frames still drop to 20 fps quite often.
Also, with normal fps, stutters still occur, input lag, and at some point the game just crashes. To fix a crash or fps drops, only a computer reboot helps.
The system requirements stated by the developers say that with my video card the game should run at 60 fps on maximum graphics settings. I wonder how they tested it so that they didn't notice how the fps dropped to an unplayable state in this configuration.
Once again, don't believe 80% of the enthusiastic reviews from idiots on Steam who bought the game and play at 40 fps on RTX 4090 or at 15 fps on other cards and are happy about it...

My review is not about politics, I don't feel any hatred towards Ukraine, and I know what is happening in the world now. In fact, I would like everyone to know that not all Russians are like the developers think they are. Therefore, my review is absolutely neutral and was not written with any subtext due to some personal beliefs/considerations, etc. I am sincerely sorry about what is happening now.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"""The game is no longer ours. It belongs to the community."" -Pushes update upon people that over 80% of the player base did not want, ask for, and actively spoke out against-

Otzdarva and Truetalent have serious debates about the state of the game and what would be the healthiest way for the game to go, but Behavior goes out of their way to belittle this by saying ""This is just a party game."" But then has competitive game modes and ranking systems in the game.

They have a microtransaction system that you'd realistically only find in F2P games, meaning you'd be buying most of the cosmetics, and buying individual characters and stuff, but then want you to pay full price for the game and buy each and every little DLC invidually... When doing so would net you well over $120 (Just noting it's over double the price of a normal AAA game) just to unlock the full game to play.. and you wouldn't even get any cosmetics to show for it.

They have perk bloat issues, 90% of the perks and in-game things you can get are useless. You also are not fully in control of the perks and stuff that you unlock for characters. The bloodweb system is extremely dated and needs to be replaced with something that lets you pick and choose the perks you want and to upgrade and unlock those at your own leisure. But Devs don't care and just want to keep pushing out skins/cosmetics/microstransaction fodder.

If you're survivor, you have to use certain perks and play styles in order to counter a meta that the killers are basically forced into, or they'll lose. Playing for fun does not exist in public matches. Everyone is toxic, You will be yelled at and told that you're a waste of space among other such things. The Devs do not care about this.

Also, they have awful anti-cheat. People get around it all the time. In any given match you could easily be playing with a hacker who's keeping his hacks on the down low so that he doesn't get reported. Because reports is the only way that they catch hackers. But they will straight up ban you if people decide to get all of their friends to report you for not playing how they like.

Their bans are also non-negotiable, they do not undo them. It's also more money for them if you have to rebuy their game and DLC and start over, that's the reason for them having a strict system on it. 

Then don't even get me started with their bugs and glitches.. The game is literally held together by chewing gum and paper clips it feels like.

The idea of Dead by Daylight is a good one on paper. It's just cursed with a company like Behavior running it. Any other company could likely take this game and turn it into a gem.

TLDR: The game is plagued with toxicity, has massive balance issues, massive glitches, the developers have fully shown that they don't care what the community thinks anymore, and I can't recommend this game in its current state.","Very Positive80% of the 546,855 user reviews for this game are positive.",no_longer belongs community push 80 base not_want ask actively spoke otzdarva truetalent serious debate state healthiest behavior go belittle saying party competitive mode ranking system microtransaction realistically play game meaning buying cosmetic buying individual character stuff pay price downloadable additional released initial launch invidually net 120 noting double price normal aaa unlock play cosmetic perk bloat issue 90 perk thing useless not_fully control perk stuff unlock character bloodweb extremely dated need replaced let pick choose perk upgrade unlock leisure care pushing skin cosmetic microstransaction fodder survivor certain perk play style order counter effective popular strategy character build killer basically forced lose fun not_exist public match behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner yelled told waste space thing not_care awful anti cheat given easily a_emphasized us unauthorized illegal method gain advantage keeping hack low reported report catch hacker straight ban decide friend report not_playing ban non negotiable not_undo rebuy downloadable additional released initial launch strict started bug glitch literally held chewing gum paper clip feel idea good paper cursed company behavior running company turn gem plagued toxicity massive balance issue massive glitch developer shown care community think anymore recommend state

I will say the crafting can be a bit tedious so we've hoarded everything we find but once you start a farm and are able to grow different things, it's a breeze. You can focus on combat and progression if you want to or you can grind for building material and build your base. I've seen some amazing builds! Which brings me to the base building mechanics, also a breeze! AND you don't have to build a base from the bottom up, you can find towns and set up base there. Building is completely optional.

2344520,Diablo® IV,"I cant recommend this game, I have played all Diablo games, but this one is a complete miss. First, being an online game means that I cannot play this most of the time. Without pause, I cannot attend to my kids while I am playing which means more often than not, I have to either die, or be disconnected restarting the quest or dungeon I am in. I have even missed dialogue because of this.
The gameplay is pretty meh, I dont find any of the battles challenging, I find myself constantly swapping equipment because of how quickly it becomes outdated, rendering a lot of the upgrade mechanics useless perhaps till after endgame (which I have no intention of continuing beyond since there are much better games out there in my backlog). Perhaps what I hate the most is level scaling. Combine that with the unengaging story line and writing it means that side quests are pointless, I only play them till I unlock enough renown.
A lot of the artwork and level design is reused, especially in dungeons, and they all feel more or less the same: slay lieutenants, pick up 2 boxes, slay boss, repeat.
The main story line does not leave me wanting more, there is little intrigue and the story plays in a very predictable and standard way.
If this game wasnt constantly lagging itself into oblivion, I would recommend buying it on a heavy discount like I did, but with technical issues that are only a result of Blizzard's greed not real gameplay requirement, I would say pass and wait for this to be available on some game pass in the future.","Mostly Positive71% of the 28,017 user reviews for this game are positive.",cant recommend diablo game complete miss online mean cannot_play pause cannot_attend kid mean not_i die disconnected restarting task objective given non dungeon missed dialogue pretty meh dont battle challenging constantly swapping equipment quickly outdated rendering upgrade mechanic useless perhaps till endgame no_intention continuing game backlog perhaps hate scaling combine unengaging line writing mean side quest pointless play till unlock renown artwork design reused especially dungeon slay lieutenant pick 2 box slay bos repeat line not_leave wanting intrigue play predictable standard wasnt constantly lagging oblivion recommend buying heavy discount technical issue result blizzard greed not_real requirement pas wait available pas future

427520,Factorio,"While this is a great game, I always felt like the $30 price tag was fairly high, especially when you consider that it will never go on sale. Now they're raising the price to $35, years after the release and after the game has already made them a LOT of money. There's also no new content to justify this. It's pure greed and seems like a cheap attempt to get people who had been holding off to buy it right now due to ""fear of missing out"".

I also think it's ridiculous that Steam will flag these reviews as ""off-topic"". The game's price and the developers' actions directly related to the game are very relevant for people who are trying to decide whether they should buy it.

1790600,DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO,"Having completed it 100% I can tell you that the campaign is the laziest most underwhelming clip show you've ever seen. Terrible way to experience the story of any era in Dragon Ball. 
The online pvp is buggy, constantly disconnects (no matter how good the connection is), and in the rare matches where I can actually fight other people for the entire duration of a match the framerate often slows down to an unplayable crawl.
To its credit, I  think there's a genuinely fun game under all the technical problems but THAT game is impossible to reach. The game I am actually forced to play is simply too broken and poorly made on a fundamental level.

In summary: This game is garbage. It's really bad. Don't buy it.
I have given it every possible opportunity and exhausted every effort in order to fix the issues it has on my end. There is nothing that can be done. It can't be fixed. My computers specs are great. My connection is perfect. The game is at fault.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Final Fantasy XIV is an mmorpg experience with its ups and downs. I've played over 10k hours of this game before finally calling it quits but that doesnt mean the game is bad. It has found its formulas, it repeats those every 3 months with the new patch and content and caters to its more casual fanbase a lot. 

Certainly has a slow start and the story really picks up after the dreaded ""100 quest line"" between the end of vanilla and start of its first expansion ""Heavensward"".The story from there is great for mmo standards however. 

Its raiding scene is very mixed. Most players are too casual to clear content properly and the ones that can do usually either belong to a static group or are lost between the casual fanbase. Dont try this game without having people to raid with if you want to go hardcore.

The crafting system is actually a game withing the game.Never before had i had fun with crafting but its a very hit and miss one. I can see why people wouldnt enjoy it. It certainly gets more interesting the higher you level it and that is a good thing to have.Its gear depended though so make sure you are ready for it.

The game has classes which after lv 30 turn into jobs. With only 1 created character you can be every job and swap on the fly. The leveling isnt that bad, a bit boring maybe after you've done the leveling dungeons 100+ times but there are many diffrent ways to level so find what you feel suits you.

PvP is well... just try it out a bit then stop if you dislike it. They keep trying to push it but it wont work. Dont come into this game with a pvp mindset. Final Fantasy games excluding dissidia were never intended to be pvp based. This one included.

Overall,i had a great time with the game. Certainly try it out. But go in with having fun as a goal and the rest will follow

[h1] This game ticks so many boxes for me. [/h1]

[h2] The good stuff [/h2]

[h3] Great game feel [/h3]

Walking, running, jumping, gliding, swinging, gathering, terraforming and fluidity of combat all feel really solid and play major roles in the world in their own unique way

[h3] Fun Exploration [/h3]

it has enough different meaningful encounters that you want to see what's upstairs in that derelict building, or cave that seemingly goes on forever. Usually when you go out of your way to explore, you are rewarded.

[h3] Seamless and interesting Questing system [/h3]

Quests aren't slow or meaningless. You're trying to find your next follower who have their own back stories to follow, or you can just happen to stumble upon a letter left by a [spoiler] mysterious princess in some shabby abandoned camp [/spoiler] which lead to scandals and secrets later on in your play through.

[h3] Less frustrating food and drink system [/h3]

You don't get hungry or thirsty, yet you can eat and drink. Why? Because they act as buffs! It's the best of both worlds because it's not a system you have to micro manage, yet if you use it, similar to potions, you will have an easier time, and it's totally your choice!

[h3] Clear map [/h3]

It's so easy to know what you need to do, and where you need to do it. You can place custom way points and uncover the fog of war system as you explore, it's so easy and intuitive. There are also teleport systems you can find (and ones you can build too) to make traversing the world much easier.

[h3] Upgrading weapons [/h3]

Really fun and easy upgrade system that lets you sacrifice weapons you find in the world for tokens which can be used to upgrade your favourite weapons to make them even more powerful. There are also other ways to get these tokens too.

[h2] The things i didn't like so much [/h2]

[h3] Building [/h3]

The game doesn't require you to build crazy things if you don't want too (I'm thinking like a big fortress to keep out waves of enemies like in Valheim or The Forest) Which is a good thing in my opinion. Building is fairly solid and easy to grasp, and someone with an imaginative brain could certainly create some wonders, however i found the UI for it a bit finicky. It stood out because it didn't feel as smooth as the rest of the game does.

[h3] Crafting [/h3]

I like the items you can craft, and the fact that it's pretty easy to craft stuff in general, but i HATE the fact you need to jump around from the work bench to one of the followers, or tab across to the basic stuff. I would like to see this reworked in a way that all the craftable items you have unlocked are available from the workbench. Do this and you have streamlined this process for us!

[h3] The red stuff [/h3]

Oh my god what a horrible awful frustrating mechanic!!!! GET RID OF THIS OR NERF IT PLEASE! you'll be walking jump and hopping over terrain to get somewhere and there is just this pit of death you couldn't see that kills you within 2 seconds. and most of the time you can't scamper up the edges to save yourself. You lose some of your items (Which is ok), however when you go to retrieve them, they have spawned on the side of the slippery terrain you can't properly scamper across to collect it! My suggestion with this, is make sure all the banks surrounding the red stuff are climbable, and increase the time you can be in there to give the player a fighting chance to recover from their mistake.,and also make the items that drop from you reachable 100% of the time.

[b] As an early access game this is a solid 9/10! There are some bits i would like to see changed in full release for it to keep this rating, but i have a lot of faith in the devs from what I've seen so far.

I didn't know what to expect when i first started playing, i wanted to give it a go and go against all the negativity and complains regarding bugs/lags etc. Barely 15 minutes in and i already knew i was about to be in for a ride with hours of amazing gameplay, and i was very correct. 

Cyberpunk 2077 gives you a whole new atmospheric experience where you can explore the futuristic-like Night City or what's surroundig it, The Badlands. You get to meet some interesting people or somewhat strange. An overall story-rich game with cool interactions and the amazing ability to customize your character to fit the loud and action filled streets of Night City. With amazing graphics and voice acting, Cyberpunk 2077 really gives the player the feeling of living in a second life. They really made an amazing job bringing out the smallest details in things, as well as pointing out some everyday topics that aren't seen in a lot of games. 

[i]I would definitely recommend Cyberpunk 2077 to anyone that likes Fallout and Watch Dogs.[/i]

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"The important bits:
Both Helldivers games will go down as some of my favorite playtime in games ever.  HellD2 specifically is right up there with the Killing Floor games in terms of favorite coop shooters. The immersion is incredible, you feel the weight of the chaos and the action around you. The friendly fire is fantastic! It can be crazy deadly when you are not careful which makes it fun and meaningful. But it's easy to avoid after a few lessons learned in game. :D I like the room to build up your own playstyle. There is a good selection for the level of challenge you want the game to bring. If you want more mindless casual fun you can lower it, if you are feeling badass and want the hurt thrown at you that is there too.
Best of all, the stratagem feature is just plain fun and unique which feels like it makes it stand out in a crowded genre of coop shooters. 

My time gaming is much more limited now, so I value what little time I have for gaming outside work. HellD2 fills every bit of that time with action and fun. I like the amount of customization of game style through armor, equipment, and stratagems. But I don't feel overloaded with choices and duties that keep me trap in a player hub for longer than I like so I can just keep jumping back into the action.

I bought this game at it's release and loved it immediately at the time. My early game with friends were great but due to time my limited play time, they all advanced through the game and I thought I had missed out on too much. FOMO fears made had me avoiding the game because I was worried I missed to many cool moments/ events in the galactic war. But after coming back to it recently after not playing it for months, I realized my mistake. I was silly for avoiding playing it without a dedicated core group of friends to journey through. 

Myself and one other friend stuck to matchmaking with pubs and it was fantastic. All the giggling around the chaos of fire, smoke, and bullets reminded why this game is so great. I'm not usually as into playing soldiers but the absurdity of the humor around being disposable soldiers yelling about forced freedoms on everyone is silly fun. Sometimes it's fun to be the baddies.

230410,Warframe,"One of the best free to play models i encountered:

- No content locked behind paywalls, except decorative stuff with no gameplay impact.
- Ingame currency you can buy for real money (platinum) is not locked to your account, and is tradeable amongst players.
- No lootbox gambling, if you decide to buy stuff, you get exactly what you pay for.

Also i wish i could travel back to 2013 before i started playing warframe and tell myself, that one day i would be more excited about a major content update of a F2P game, than the next Fallout game... just to see my reaction.

You're battling time pressure and each round slowly ratchets up the chips needed to beat it. And just when you think you've built the perfect Balatro engine and it's a cake walk to unlocking another deck...a Boss Blind turns up that throws a spanner in the works.

236390,War Thunder,"Oh how I wish i could call an arty strike on Gaijin's head office.

Let me list the most frustrating aspects of this game:
A bit of a lengthy review but if you are really interested in this game then you should at least skim this review to get an idea of what you're signing up for. Also the first serious review I've done of a game but I have been playing this for 4 years now and it's about time I told (warned) people about it.

The devs:
Has never listened to it's community's suggestions or bug reports. The closest we ever got was when everyone, including the largest Youtuber Phlydaily was pushing to have parts and fire extinguishers to come for free with every vehicle, instead of making it a module to research (or spend money on). So if you get shot in the transmission, yup you cant move the rest of the match, or get shot in the barrel? Yup, you are completely useless unless you can make it to a cap point which sometimes there is only 1. Guess what... they said ""no"" and have since never acknowledged community suggestions since then due to the horrible PR fallout. They balance the game based off players stats in that particular vehicle. Leaving some vehicles completely broken or overpowered for months while data comes in for them to actually do something about it. Easily the most frustrating of these cases was the fact that the battle rating spread is so compressed from power creep that they couldn't figure out what level to put the Maus at to make it competitive and balanced so they just removed it from the game. LOL yeah they barred new players from being able to research it cause they were too lazy to fix their game. They also will gladly make up stats or armor values about tanks to fit their view of what they think it should be capable of. 

The grind:
dear god the insane grind, if you don't get premium AND a high tier premium vehicle ($80 for a year of premium time and $40-$60 a piece for the vehicles, some of which are also broken - STRV 103-0 - to name one) then it will literally take you 6-12 months to grind out a single nation. So if you are strapped on time to dedicate to gaming, then just pick a nation and stick to it or you won't see anything past tier 3-4 (early world war 2 armored vehicles). It will easily take you a year or more to grind out the top tier jets/tanks of any nation.

New vehicles:
Anytime they add a new vehicle or whole nation, which is all the major updates contribute to the game, they generally make it overpowered so people will spend money on getting the ""op vehicles."" The other portion of new vehicles have some extremely frustrating broken/missing feature that they don't address for months and in most cases years after it being well known to the community. 

The maps:
Only 6/38 have protected spawn points, leaving you open to being sniped (sometimes from the enemy spawn) 15 seconds after spawning. There are countless ""unintended"" spots that completely break the map allowing you to see the entire battlefield while also being immune to fire if you have a strong turret (they tried to fix this but failed.) Horrible design flaws continue with layouts that, in combination with game modes, make tanks designed for hull down and defensive game play completely worthless because you HAVE to push to the objective to cap and win. Oh that's right there is 1 single type of game mode: domination, where you have to push to the middle of the map and cap a point, sometimes there's 1 2 or 3. Yup that's all we get for variation in game play across all types (sim/realistic/arcade). Also since they added thermal sights and night vision devices, every 10th game you get is a night battle. Ya and it can take a week or two w/o premium time to grind out the modules that allow for this. Especially for night battles but also generally most people just leave the match  after 1 death. This is only a problem for the higher tiers though, made worse by top tier premiums making for many players to not have lineups to  have a proper ability to fight and finish a match. The worst offenses for Gaijin's inability to make viable maps is that they give you city maps that measure 1km from your spawn to enemy spawn in modern MBT's... As well as very poorly thought out maps that encourage players to go straight to the enemy spawn and spawn camp instead of trying to navigate/fight in their confusing layouts that make no sense from a gameplay perspective but ""are accurate to a real life location.""

Helicopters:
Two words- completely broken. Damage models allow for a helicopter to shrug off 120mm APFSDS rounds through the entire length of the heli unless you precisely hit the pilot, and a lot of the time immune to even direct hits from SAMs and ATGMs. Even hitting the engine and causing a fire won't cause it to crash; only gently begin losing altitude all the while spamming hydra rockets at you, which auto-kill you if you're in a light tank/anti-aircraft. They don't even have their own (functioning) game mode meaning you're forced to use them in ground battles to grind out the later heli's. Which by-the-way require an EXTREME amount of grinding to get to the top of the line, OR as the developers likely intended: just buy your way to. For example, I'm grinding the German line with the BO 105 CB-2: I have 50 kills and 32 battles in a PREMIUM heli with premium time and I'm not even a 5th of the way through the first heli to research. 40k/170k RP (research points) and then there's 3 more after that (requiring an additional 1.2 MILLION RP+4 million silver lions) when you finally get the most OP/actually good heli for Germany. which gets 8 fire and forget missiles that allow you to raze entire flanks/teams within a minute if left unchecked. Did I mention only about a third of battles in ground mode actually will net you enough spawn points to even take one out with AGMs and not just dumb fire rockets. This coupled with the aforementioned horrible map designs, leading to many many games being throwaways, make it nearly impossible without spending money to achieve the top tier heli's. 

Air realistic battles: 
have 1 single game mode variant and it hasn't changed at all since it's introduction to the game back in 2011. It's fun but it takes 1-5 minutes in loading queue to find a game then it takes anywhere from 3-6 more minutes to actually see combat. Also it doesn't really have any use for bombers of any kind, AKA they are irrelevant to winning the game except for literally 2 bombers in the whole game that can actually win the match if they're ignored - B-29 and TU-4. You can't respawn either in this mode so if you spent 7-10 minutes climbing to altitude trying to catch a bomber, only to have them shoot you in the engine then guess what: you have to fly back to your airfield and repair and if the match ends by the time you are capable again you receive nothing for your effort. At which point you just spent 20 minutes waiting for a game, then just flying around climbing/running/cursing.


It reminds me of good old Battlefield 2/3 when there was mass war with helis/planes and tanks all duking it out for victory. 

Game modes: 

Realistic mode, a majority of players -including myself- play this, there aren't enemy markers unless they are hit with any type of munition, which pings a red icon on the mini-map. No assist to aiming and allows for sneaky plays at the cost of also being chop liver for aircraft which are constantly a headache and only require 2-3 kills. AA is cheap to respawn in but some nations get excellent AA while others don't even have any for certain BR's (battle ratings). A massive problem with aircraft being so easily available is the all too common revenge bombing, usually involving the enemy just flying directly into the ground on top of you dropping their bombs a second before death - usually also having enough points again to spawn into a light/medium tank again.

As of now, I have 1,354.4 hours clocked into this intense, skill-filled first-person shooter. I strongly believe that a good 768 hours (32 days) of my time played was spent questioning my very own sexuality. Shortly after I started playing this game, I found myself hyper-sexualizing Jager. Day and night I couldnt't stop thinking about Jagers dreamy, ponderous muscles and his iron-handed yet tender German voice. The mystery behind what Jager's face truly looks like, fuels my sexual fantasies. He could look like anything... handsome or hideous I yearn for him. At the end of the day, I would want nothing more than Jager's throbbing, white manhood.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"[b]As an average player, I do not recommend BG3 in its early access![/b]

I'm recommending this because I want to support its further development, but this is one of those early access games that is truly still in development when they say it is. I love that they're taking this game seriously, I can't wait to play the finished product, and I want to support them to hopefully create the best D&D video game ever. But I don't have the time or the desire to replay the same content multiple times due to character/progress wipes, so for now I'll sit and wait patiently for the 1.0 release.

I know it seems like I'm stating the obvious, but many times when big games are deigned to be put out for early access, the game is largely finished, and it's rare for the developers to make core changes that drastically affect the final product. It's mostly to generate hype, get free promotion from streamers, and collect lucrative marketing data from its players, while occasionally turning out token bugs and balance hotfixes. But in this case, they really do mean it is [i]in development[/i].

2379780,Balatro,"Everyone loves this game for some reason, but I can't understand why. I tried searching ""Blatro bad game"" and ""I didn't like Balatro"" and the results are ""I love Balatro so bad"" or ""I didn't think I would like Balatro this much"".

What I think a video game should be/what I like is to solve challenges, either by making decisions or mechanics. Balatro has neither of them, and is boring in a frustrating way.

This game is a ""strategy game that looks like a casino"". What they forgot to tell you is that it's actually a casino pretending to be a strategy game that looks like a casino:
- When you first launch the game you will think: ""Oh this is really cool I have to make a decision whether I want/have to greed for better hands, or go for something that's easier to make"". No, you don't. Once you buy your first jokers/planet card (those upgrade specific hands) you will effectively be locked into that particular hand for the rest of the run. If you want to go for any consistency, the entire way through you will play pairs, two pairs, and high cards, maybe a flush if you feel fancy. There are no other hands you can realistically expect to repeat in a standard deck. Making pairs out of playing cards is not very fun and you can buy a deck of cards much cheaper if you want to do that instead. It is less bad on low difficulties, but if you care about optimal play you are doomed anyway.
- ""So if the battle has zero decisions/thinking involved, maybe at least the shop does?"" Not really, If you decided that your life belongs to the High Card Jail, you buy whatever jokers support that playstyle, and it's not hard to figure out. There are jokers that give you consistent results and you buy them. Planet cards require no thought. Exception are tarot cards, especially the ones you can play during a fight. Those allow for deck interaction, and there's a limited number of situations where you have to think before you clik a button, however:
- Difficulty scales in the worst possible way for a game to scale: game gives you less hands, less discards and less gold in shops. All of these things remove already small amount of decisions that you have in this game. Less discards? I guess you play High Cards and Pairs, hope you have fun. Less gold? You probably can't afford to buy those fun tarot cards, because all your money is to be spent on the jokers that give you more power.

There is also absolutely no way to play online with your friends, which is one of, if not the biggest let down aside from the unplayable state of the career mode.

2139460,Once Human,"Let's address the elephant in the room. Yes, I have been playing and enjoying this game. However, I cannot recommend it to people who don't have at least 8-12 hours or more per week to dedicate to video gaming. The seasonal format is likely to deter casual players.

While the seasonal system could be appealing if it weren't limited to just 6 weeks, its current duration is too short. I understand the desire to time-gate and refresh content, but the fast-paced format they're using doesn't sit well with me.

Overall, I believe they should move away from seasons and adopt a more additive structure. As much as I disliked power creep and obsolescence in other video games, seeing the alternative here gives me a new appreciation for those systems.

Here are a few suggestions:
- Add more group content
- Introduce full-length raids
- Invest in reducing lag in Prime War
- Develop new areas with unique challenges
- Create new weapons and armor
- Find new ways to empower both players and enemies
- Enhance the social aspects of the game
- Implement a server-wide auction house (instead of just having vending machines available on a single world)

Overall, while wipes can keep certain games fresh, this isn't one of them.

2344520,Diablo® IV,"This is my first diablo game. The gameplay loop is pretty fun, I can see why the series is popular. It's grindy in a fun mindless way, and it's a good movie/podcast game. But the focus on multiplayer and monetization hampers it. I just wanted to play this single player, and you can't as it's always online. It shouldn't be deck verified for that reason alone. It's not really a handlheld game to take on a flight, you have to have wifi. Even if you play solo. You can't pause the game for this reason either, so if you have to get up frequently or put games to sleep, this one isn't it for you. The game seems like it was once a good game, and then they in modern fashion stripped away all rewards and incentive for playing and charge for it. I got this for 40 dollars and beat the main story, with one character. I didn't do any of the post game and only did maybe a third of the side quest. You are bombarded with ads frequently, every time you unlock some tier, or to go to the map, there is an ad asking you to buy an overpriced cosmetic. The armor and stuff you unlock in game all looks the same, incentive's you to buy the predatory monetization cosmetics. I paid 41 for this game on sale. I truthfully think it's worth maybe 30 in it's current state , maybe less. I played at a leisurely pace and beat the main game and a 3rd of the side quest in 37 hours, solo.. If you're playing with friends, you might get more value out of it and beat it faster or replay it, but I play single player because as a 32 year old with a weird schedule, it's hard to find time to party up with friends, and most of my friends don't play this type of game, and I'm too much of an introvert to add strangers and play. After work I just want to chill, and this game almost has that chill vibe to it, but it's got to constantly shoe horn in ads and purchases, and that ruins it for me personally. I have no desire to play it again due to it's short comings. If i could give a neutral review, I would. But due to the negatives outweighing the positives, I am giving it a negative review. I've heard D1,2, and 3 are better. If they ever come to steam I'd give them a chance, but I don't think I'd give Diablo 5 a chance until it hits maybe 20 to 30 bucks if it's like this one.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"As much as I love and adore Bioware games, I just can't recommend this one.

It's worth playing through once just for the fun of it, but only if you want to experience some bad writing and VERY awkward animations and whatnot in dialogue scenes. For the DEI stuff-- I'm part of that community myself, but even I felt utterly uncomfortable with how things were handled. Taash, for example, could have been a good character. But they're NOT. Rather than them encouraging people to be open minded and at least tolerant of non-binary people, I fear they did more harm than good and I even felt worry for my non-binary peers if that is how most people will experience their so called representation of them. One can argue that Taash goes through a character arc of sorts, but honestly-- they don't really. They're the most unlikable character in the entire game and it has little to do with their identity or preferred pronouns. But to turn away from the elephant in the room-- the use of modern terms is extremely immersion breaking, the pacing in the story is sometimes scarring and just badly done (for example; I romanced Lucanis and after he was promoted to Talon and suggested we leave early-- I expected SOMETHING, since it made sense. Emotions were high given the situation. But instead it was just him sipping coffee and my character awkwardly standing around watching him. Like, what...?), animations are extremely awkward and the dialogue is sometimes horrendous (I keep repeating myself here, but trust me--), there's no roleplaying of any kind since you're basically doomed to be the good guy no matter what (even if people prefer a good guy run, having a choice is always better than having none) and I felt like a lot of the laid out rules by previous entries were kinda made fun of? Like ""dwarves don't dream, but welcome to the fade"" or ""you need to be a mage to house a demon, but I'm as capable as a brick when it comes to magic-- oh hi, Spite""-- like it felt like they couldn't decide on one ""special exception"" character and instead just made everyone a special exception which lead to me viewing about everyone like someone's personal Mary Sue/Marty Stu creation. Aside from Taash, the companions grew on me over time. However, even then you can tell that none of them are properly and thoroughly explored. Like Lucanis being possessed. Why? Why give him a Demon that lives inside him when you literally do basically NOTHING with that Demon? You talk about Spite. Spite has a moment of dragging you into Lucanis' mind. But other than that? What's he here for? But enough rambling from my side. There are so many shortcomings I could be mentioning right here, but I'm kind of not in the mood to rant in a review. 

Long story short: buy it if you want to turn off your brain for a little while or just witness the cringe. However, if you want to have a gaming experience worth your time, then there might be better out there. Such as the previous entries to this series.

Edit a day later:
If you want to make the character ""Rook"" make sense, make them playful.
My playthrough consisted of me making this mischievous, sarcastic Antivian Crow Elf that always chose (what I call) the Jester Dialogue Options. It helped with staying in character throughout the game and I had a great time with it. HOWEVER; the moment I tried another ""goodie two shoes"" character, a lot of the quips Rook makes don't align with the character anymore and just feel off. So how well your experience with the game is, highly depends on whether you play Rook the way Rook was ""intended"" or if you want to actually enjoy some kind of freedom in how you play them.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Honestly. All in all; I recommend this, but it's a little on the iffy side of recommended.

I've been playing since Shadowkeep; I've been buying into 90% of the seasons, and starting with Witch Queen I started getting the annual pass [I'm doing the same with Lightfall], I would say I'm getting my money's worth.

Is Bungie always doing the right thing? No, not every time, but at least 65-85% of the time I think they're trying their best to make a fun experience. Sure, PVP is a trash fire, PVP will always be a trash fire, and I only play it while zoning out to YouTubers ranting about this or that or SiIvaGunner because I'm grinding some Year 1 exotic's catalyst or I want some neat cosmetic. Sure, they're making PVE a little more casual in the upcoming expansion, but lowering that barrier of entry to high-end content is, in my eyes, not exactly a bad thing. Not enough games respect a player's time, especially with everything slapping you in the face with a battlepass or similar.

If you're a new player, you NEED friends who play the game to help bring you up to speed, and you need to be willing to get into the expansions ASAP if you want any inkling of the story and any weapons viable in endgame content. The FOMO is real with the seasonal storylines, but at least the battlepass Destiny 2 loads you up with has a storyline to string you along and makes you want to log in at least once a week to sniff around for stuff.

Real talk though, my almost 2k hours? Assume one-third of it is waiting for friends/clan mates to log in, finish eating, using the restroom, ""doing homework"", etc, before you actually do content together. 

Hell, I'm guilty of it, too. Sometimes you just zone out between activities. It's not a bad thing. 

The new expansion coming up has me tentatively excited, though. I want this game to do well. 

While there's a free to play version, from what I hear it's barebones as hell, but it's worth giving it a shot.

And hey, if you do come in to play Destiny 2? For the love of the Traveler, please use Destiny Item Manager, or ANY third-party app that helps you with your item vault.

In all seriousness, it's an amazing game and a supreme example of how great aesthetic and game feel can carry a simple premise all the way until the end. It does get repetitive and I'm starting to have slightly less fun after putting 50+ hours into it (my time logged on Steam is far less than my actual time played) as it does rely a LOT on luck. 

But, that's the entire point of the game, whether you like it or not. It's brutally unfair and extremely rewarding. Getting a high score has never felt so good. The soundtrack is mesmerizing. There's a reason this game has become such a viral hit, and when you look at the negative reviews here on Steam, you'll see that most of them still have dozens of hours logged despite leaving a negative review. 

And to make things even better, the developer has been consistently updating it since release and I expect it to only get better over time.

It feels very similar to Valheim, but a bit more directed, they knew what they wanted to make and it really shows in the level of polish - a bit more goal oriented as well, at least initially (Can't speak for later)

Building feels intuitive and enjoyable, digging was simple to get the hang of and the resource costs allow you to play around with structures very easily; again, it doesn't seem interested in wasting your time, it gives you a good feeling amount of stuff.

Combat is tight and rewarding; comparisons to darksouls will be obvious in that you're parrying, dodging and blocking, but it does feel very good and the comparison isn't unwarranted - attacks have impact, and the dodge roll is clever in its manoeuvrability, getting behind enemies with it feels satisfying and easy to accomplish.

238960,Path of Exile,"Let me preface this by saying the following: Path of Exile is not a bad game. It's not. It's simply outdated. Outdated in its thinking, design philosophy, and execution. If this was the early 2000s, this would be the hottest thing in town. Today, though, it's just old and tired, with far too many bad design choices to even capitalise on the nostalgia quotient.

This appears, on the surface, to be a game built by someone who wanted to do ""Diablo 2, but more!"". It has the usual ""normal story, followed by harder, followed by even harder!"" which consists of a fixed penalty to damage resistances, and a proper endgame grind beyond repeating the final level/boss over and over (or freaking Pindleskin  because he was easy and dropped unusually high level items). Blow-by-blow, these are all definitely improvements, and I give them credit for it.

The game offers the illusion of choice when it comes to how you build your character thanks to the massive passive skill web (it's not really a tree, but eh). I say ""illusion"" because, while on the surface there's a vast array of possibilities, in practice, due to how the game is balanced, what you have is a few viable choices and a lot of roads to nowhere. Look online for builds/guides and on the surface it looks like plenty of variety, but it's nothing compared to the potential number of builds this kind of ""open"" tree offers.

Speaking of balance, the game downright abuses shitty uber-damage-spike-instakill mechanics because that's the only way the devs are able to challenge the most optimized builds. The devs seem to be locked in a fight to the death with the really hardcore optimizers, leaving a trail of ""lesser build"" corpses in their wake. This is obvious if you take a stroll through the patch notes of the curren league (Delirium). Every nerf and tweak to the Delirium mechanics has invariably been to tone down the instakill over-the-top-damage BS it brings (remember the insta-exploding bulbs of death? No? Lucky you).

Want another example? The Sirus fight. His main ""instadeath"" attack is an overlapping beam that does every type of damage and effect. Literally. If your final boss attack is ""a beam of everything"", that's tantamount to saying ""I give up"" when it comes to encounter design.

And that's another thing about this game. The big boss fights are really poorly design. There's a quote somewhere about the devs bragging that they really know how to make good boss encounters. It's laughable. Things like the Sirus and Catarina fights, where the players spend more time wondering what is going on than actually fighting the boss, say otherwise. Both fights have had changes due to player outcry, and they're still pretty damn terrible.

The community is very nice, but has a serious blind spot about these issues. The usual response to any discussion about the game's shortcomings is ""git gud"". Which often is a good response. But in this case, what ""git gud"" means is simply ""git gud numbers"", i.e., one of the meta uberbuilds and better gear. If you look at gameplay videos you'll notice something curious: Nobody is actually working with the mechanics of the game. All people do is get big enough numbers so that they can IGNORE the mechanics of every fight and just bruteforce encounters while facetanking everything that happens.

Part of the poor fight mechanics is the design, but part of it is the game itself. With 17 million layers of visual clutter everywhere, it's pretty hard to even see what's going on sometimes. Complex boss fights try to create encounters the game engine and interface, quite frankly, cannot really handle well. This ain't Dark Souls 3. The Delirium league has made this even worse, adding a permanent layer of foggy BS to every map that obscures even more what's on the screen, to the point that I resort to navigate by minimap alone because the screen is an orgy of visual clutter that doesn't even show the terrain anymore.

And you know what the best part of having no clue what's happening on the screen is? When one of the instakill mechanics hits you, there's no way to see what happened. There's no log, there's no death summary, there's nothing. It's jaw-dropping, but it's true. No way to look back at what happened. The cynic in me thinks this is so that players don't have ready access to see the kind of ridiculous numbers the enemy attacks put out, but never attribute to malice what can easily be explained by incompetence. Apparently, the lack of log is officially due to performance reasons.

Which brings another point, the performance of this game is pretty bad, with the game often freezing for up to a second every time it has to load some fresh visual effect (out of a 960 Pro NVMe, I might add; pre-cache seems to be an alien concept to these guys), and with an ATROCIOUS netcode, with constant desyncs and characters being rubberbanded to their doom. The default settings have dynamic resolution, where resolution goes down to keep the fps up, as a recommended ON setting. FYI: 6-core 8600K@4.8GHz, 1080ti, 960 Pro NVMe HDD, and fibre while living in the same friggin' country as the developers. Not good enough it seems!

Another hard minus for this game is how unbelievably BAD the loot is. You will never find a good item you can use. I can state that because it's so incredibly rare as to be a statistical error when it does happen. You will be showered with a veritable deluge of crap as you play, and nothing, nothing, will be good unless it's a brand-new character. The game itself comes with an option to use a ""Loot Filter"" which will prevent bad items from being highlighted. Play for a while without one, look at the tapestry of things that cover every square inch of the map when you play, then add a filter and watch 99.99% of all those items magically disappear. It defies logic, why the devs make the game server create, roll, and track hundreds upon hundreds of items on every level, knowing full well that the absolute, immense majority of them will never even be looked at, nevermind picked up.

So you end up running through maps, picking up nothing but currency, a few occasional items that invariably end up being useless, and then realize that you're playing an ARPG without even a hope of finding good items (the reason to clear in the first place) just farming so you can hand your crap over to some bot farmer owner for one of the few good items you can use. It really is quite demoralizing. An ARPG where you're supposed to kill things to get better gear, to be powerful enough to kill bigger things, so you can get better gear, and so on, and where, instead, you only get good items out of trading with farmers. There's a crafting system, too, so bad it's an insult to call it crafting. It uses the most expensive currency in the game for a CHANCE to get a good item. 

There's more stuff in there, there's definitely a lot of stuff in this game (a plus, I guess). There's Delving and Incursions, which are okay. There's Blight encounters and Blighted maps, which are catastrophically bad (imagine the worst tower defense game you've ever played, then make it worse; that's what Blighted maps are). There's poorly thought-out special loot items such as Talismans and Breach Rings, so bad that I don't think anyone bothers picking them up anymore.

On the plus side, the soundtrack is great. It truly is.

So, recommended? No. I mean, if you literally have nothing to do because you're in quarantine or something, sure, go ahead. Otherwise there's much better games out there, some of them even free. This one should be condemned to the dustbin of history. Maybe the sequel will fix some of the many issues it has, but I wouldn't hold my breath. I gave it a really good run, I really wanted to like it because I spent many, many hours enjoying Diablo 1&2, but the game failed to deliver.","Very Positive89% of the 227,830 user reviews for this game are positive.",preface saying following not_a bad not_it s_emphasizedimply outdated_emphasized design philosophy execution early 2000s hottest town today old tired far bad design choice capitalise nostalgia quotient appears surface built someone wanted diablo 2 usual normal followed harder followed harder consists fixed penalty damage resistance proper endgame grind repeating final bos freaking pindleskin easy dropped unusually high item blow blow definitely improvement credit offer illusion choice come build thanks massive passive skill web not_really tree eh illusion surface vast array possibility practice due balanced viable choice road nowhere online build guide surface look plenty variety compared potential number build kind open tree offer speaking balance downright abuse shitty uber damage spike instakill mechanic able challenge optimized build locked fight death hardcore optimizers leaving trail lesser build corps wake obvious stroll software fix bug balance add feature note curren league delirium weaken reduce effectiveness tweak delirium mechanic invariably to_emphasizedne instakill top damage b brings remember insta exploding bulb death no_lucky example sirus fight instadeath attack overlapping beam type damage effect literally final bos attack beam tantamount saying come encounter design big bos fight poorly design quote bragging good bos encounter laughable thing sirus catarina fight player spend wondering fighting bos fight change due outcry pretty damn terrible community nice serious blind spot issue usual response discussion s_emphasizedhortcomings git gud good response git gud mean simply git gud number e the_emphasized effective popular strategy character build uberbuilds gear video notice curious working mechanic big number ignore mechanic fight bruteforce encounter facetanking happens poor fight mechanic design 17 million layer visual clutter everywhere pretty hard complex bos fight encounter engine interface frankly cannot_really handle dark soul 3 delirium league worse adding permanent layer foggy b obscures screen resort navigate minimap alone screen orgy visual clutter terrain anymore best no_clue happening screen instakill mechanic hit no_way happened no_log no_death summary jaw dropping no_way happened cynic think player ready access kind ridiculous number enemy attack never_attribute malice easily explained incompetence apparently lack log officially due performance reason brings performance pretty bad freezing load fresh visual effect 960 highly skilled experienced nvme add pre cache alien concept guy atrocious netcode constant desyncs character rubberbanded doom default setting dynamic resolution resolution go shooter recommended setting fyi 6 core 8600k 4 8ghz 1080ti 960 highly skilled experienced nvme hdd fibre living friggin country developer not_good hard minus unbelievably bad item reward dropped defeated enemy never_find good state s_emphasizedo incredibly rare statistical error happen showered veritable deluge crap play nothing_emphasized good unless brand come item reward dropped defeated enemy filter prevent bad item highlighted play tapestry thing cover square inch play add filter watch 99_emphasized item magically disappear defies logic computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player roll track hundred hundred item knowing absolute immense majority never_even looked nevermind picked running map picking currency occasional item invariably useless realize arpg hope finding good item clear repeatedly defeating enemy completing task gain resource hand crap bot farmer owner good item demoralizing arpg supposed kill thing gear powerful kill bigger thing gear good item trading farmer crafting bad insult call crafting us expensive currency chance good stuff there_emphasized definitely stuff plus guess delving incursion okay blight encounter blighted map catastrophically bad imagine worst tower defense worse blighted map poorly thought special item reward dropped defeated enemy item talisman breach ring bad t_emphasizedhink bother picking anymore plus side soundtrack great truly recommended no_i literally quarantine ahead game condemned dustbin history maybe sequel fix issue hold breath gave good wanted spent many_emphasized hour enjoying diablo 1 2 failed deliver

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"This game is not a Dragon Age game, not in tone, and not in depth of writing. If you want a game that talks down to you and treats you like a child who cant pay attention to or keep track of a story, then this game is for you. This is not Dark Fantasy, there is no meaningful conflict between party members or Rook that leads to a satisfying resolution. This feels like a fan-fiction written by a high-schooler, with no respect to the original characters or story. You can feel throughout the game, a severe restriction on player agency. There is no ""choice"" available to you as the player, and there is no way to embody the type of Rook you want to be; outside of an ""acceptable and forced"" pre-set stereotypical children's show hero persona. 
Having the same dialogue repeated incessantly is the most irritating thing I have ever experienced in a game, and through this game, I have discovered it as a pet-peeve of mine. So thanks, I guess. 
I would also like to point out... my gripes with this game in this review are NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE DEI added in. I don't give a crap about DEI in games. What I can't handle, is bad writing. 
I played Origins, DA:II, and Inquisition. I have read all of the books and comic books. I tried to like this game, I really did. I thought that if I could push past the drastic art style, combat and UI style, and focus on the story and characters... I could get over my initial hesitation over change. I get that my initial reaction to the game was based on an adverse reaction to change. Change is hard to get past some times, especially with a franchise that is responsible for my interest in games in the first place. My dislike of this game goes past this, however. 
I feel I have wasted my money and I regret my purchase. 
I will complete the game regardless, in a vain effort to remain as loyal as I can to great legacy that came before Dragon Age The Veilguard.

216150,MapleStory,"I have played this game back in 2006 and I had a blast, everything was new to me, the settings, the people running around and killing snails on maple island then slimes and mushrooms in henesys hunting ground. Took many years of breaks in between, back and forth, but when they revamped the game and released big bang is when they started to lose the vast majority of players (slowly).
I know that change is needed for games to progress, but so many changes killed the game.

Pros:
- if you're a fan of mario style games or platformers and like to see big numbers when you hit monster, then try out this game
- it's not a grindy game anymore, *sadly* (at least not from lvl 1-200)
- amazing map BGM's
- a lot of friendly people still and so on

Cons:
- p2w
- bugs, bugs and yes, more bugs! ""yay!""
- gets a bit grindy past 200 and gets a lot grindy past 200 if you didn't pay a lot of real money into it
- the company NEXON America, doesn't care about their customers/players

I could go on forever with the cons and some more pros, but I'll stop here. If you're a new player, I suggest you try this game, but it won't feel ""magical"" anymore.

2139460,Once Human,"[i]Note, I did not try, nor will I ever try, the PvP elements of the game, so this review does not include any mention of that aspect.[/i]

Once Human has well designed environments, an interesting story, and satisfying combat and looting elements.   Basebuilding, crafting, weapon and armor modifications, and even 'pet' capture elements all combine to give you plenty to do and are all at least relatively well designed.  

Of games I've previously played, it reminds me most of State of Decay II, but with better base-building elements and the whole Deviation capture component of Once Human adds another enjoyable layer on top of the core game elements.

I'd definitely recommend the game to anyone who likes that sort of game design.  It is free-to-play after all.

All of that said, however, the game has some deep flaws (imo) that reduce it's overall quality/enjoyment:
[list][*]The seasonal element: 6 weeks, and servers reset.  While you do get to keep [i]some[/i] of your hard-earned work, you lose most and character progression is set back to 0 at the start of a new season.   Some people like that sort of thing....most people don't.
[*]The multiplayer aspect drags it down.   I'm not saying it's bad to have multiplayer, but in this particular game I think they would be better served to have smaller peer-to-peer servers rather than their current approach of larger public servers.   The route to every major story point and event looks like a refugee camp tent city and the housing of other players litters the landscape, literally everywhere.  That greatly takes away from the spooky, post-apocalyptic vibe of the narrative.
[*]Over-reliance on gatcha mechanics for aspects of the game which [b]are[/b] progression.   This right here combined with the 6 week reset will be the main reason I don't play this game long term.    
[*]Shop items are stupidly expensive.    Though it's all (mostly) cosmetics and the like, it's still ridiculous what they are charging for the stuff.
[/list]

tldnr: Overall, Once Human is a pretty decent PvE game, held back by it's MMO aspect and gatcha elements.  Worth playing, for a little while, just to enjoy it but perhaps not worth a long-term investment or any real-cash purchases until (if ever) they address those aspects of it which hold it back.","Mostly Positive71% of the 104,699 user reviews for this game are positive.",note not_try nor_will versus element not_include mention aspect designed environment interesting satisfying combat looting element basebuilding crafting weapon armor modification pet capture element combine plenty relatively designed game previously reminds state decay ii base building element deviation capture component add enjoyable layer top core element d_emphasizedefinitely recommend like sort design play all_emphasized deep flaw imo reduce quality enjoyment seasonal element 6 week server reset hard earned lose progression set 0 season sort t_emphasizedhe mode multiple player interact compete real aspect drag not_saying bad mode multiple player interact compete real particular be_emphasizedtter served smaller peer peer server rather approach larger public server route major event look refugee camp tent housing player litter landscape literally everywhere greatly take spooky post apocalyptic vibe narrative reliance gatcha mechanic aspect progression combined 6 week reset play long term shop item stupidly expensive mostly cosmetic s_emphasizedtill ridiculous charging stuff tldnr pretty decent versus environment held massively multiplayer online aspect gatcha element worth enjoy perhaps not_worth long term investment real cash purchase address aspect hold
1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"TL;DR: DAV has moments that shine, but ultimately feels like a disappointing addition to the Dragon Age series. Maybe worth a try on sale, but don’t expect it to live up to its predecessors.

Dragon Age has been my comfort franchise and obsession for over a decade, with Dragon Age 2 holding a particularly special place in my heart. I didn’t expect DAV to be a masterpiece, but I was still excited to play it.

As a standalone story about saving the world through the power of friendship in a Marvel-esque style, it could have worked. Nothing groundbreaking, but enjoyable enough when you're looking for something casual. The environments are actually beautiful, and I even got used to the new design direction to the point I started to like it (especially compared to the disappointing marketing materials). The game works on release day (which I know is the bare minimum), and you can pet cats, dogs, and Assan (and play with Manfred, I love my skelly son). There were definitely good moments in the story that made me cry, yell, or giggle, but unfortunately, there just weren’t enough of them to overshadow the flaws.

The first 20 hours were fun—somewhat clunky, but I kept playing, thinking it might just be a rough start. However, the longer I played, the more frustrated I became with almost every aspect of the game:

> The character creator is quite hard to navigate, though, to be fair, we finally got some cute long hairstyles and body shape options.
> Puzzles felt like time-wasters, and the companions felt like shallow, copy-paste personalities with no nuance or conflict (romances were definitely lacking content).
> There was an unnecessary amount of chests, statues (sorry, Hinterlands—you weren’t that bad in hindsight), and other collectibles that felt like a chore more than an adventure.
> Quests and plotlines were uninteresting and forgettable, though occasionally, a quest would capture the eerie, intense atmosphere reminiscent of DAO or DA2, which was refreshing.
> The dialogue was filled with cringe-worthy, toxic positivity (Rook sounded like a therapist at times).
> Voice acting often felt emotionless or didn’t fit the situation.
> There were no real moral dilemmas or impactful decisions (there’s maybe one near the end, but by then, I was so detached from the companions that it felt cosmetic).
> Some level designs were repetitive in a way that reminded me of DA2’s reused maps, but this time content was barricaded by frustratng invisible (or visible) walls.
> Music was underwhelming, often using unnecessary synth notes that clashed with the fantasy setting instead of enhancing it.
> The lore that makes Dragon Age so rich felt ignored or cut off entirely, with references feeling thin and disconnected from the heart of the series.

Honestly, it felt like I was witnessing a butchering. Or maybe I was put through the Harrowing myself. I need some time to mentally recover from this.

216150,MapleStory,"This is a game that SHOULD be fun. It really SHOULD be. It has everything it needs:
Awesome music, amazing graphics (You get used to the character sprites.) and lots of things to do, tons of classes that function very differently the farther you go along, but eases you into them at first.

So why am I not suggesting this game?

Nexon isn't the 'best' company when it comes down to it. 

They have a Cash Shop. You want a pet? Cash shop. You want nice looking armor to RENT to display over your current armor? Cash shop. Teleport wherever you want? Cash shop. EXP boost? Cash shop.
Literally anything and everything is a Cash Shop. Yes it's not the only MMO to have it, but it clearly abuses it so much and was (Likely) one of the first MMOs to truly abuse the heck out of the system. Don't worry if you forget about it, you'll get reminded with drops, quests, and so on that there is a way to buy your way out of everything.

The community itself? If you've played an MMO, you know what to expect. Generally this consists of people who speak nothing to you most of the time- except in a market, in which case you get spammed with lots of things you won't know what they mean.

The best way to compare the free market on channel one is like watching ants swarm a meal. It's fascinating and disgusting at the same time...and by the way, you're the meal.

You can use the forums to get in guilds which aren't bad, but even then most of the lingo is confusing- half because MS has a text limit shorter than a Twitter message, half because they have a filter that is so picky that I could never state my friend 'is' something because it gets filtered out, even if I wanted to say 'is great'

Another dislike about the game is the AI. 90% of the enemies you encounter outside of dungeons  (At least up to lvl 120) use the same pattern of ""I'm gonna run into you and damage you that way!"" which, yeah there's hundreds of enemies, but it's all just nothing short of a pallete swap if they all get the same functionality.

In the end, Maplestory has a lot of ingredients to be a great game, but too many spices put into the soup end up making a good soup turn rotten (But still look pretty). And that's the best way to describe it.","Mixed63% of the 13,193 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"The game is running surprisingly smoothly for an EA title, and the graphics are gorgeous, just like the very elaborate character creator with so many gender-affirming options that I really had high hopes for the game itself. 

It still looks pretty, it's still running smoothly after 10-11 hours, but this is 
a) not a Dragon Age game, but a (very much well-done) action RPG set in the world of Thedas, and 
b) the weakest writing I've ever seen in a video game of this caliber. 

It's absolutely astonishing to see one bland dialog scene after the other.

Addendum to original submission, due to outrage from Inquisitorial conclave.
-----------------------------------
Let us review the game as a whole (newest update included):
Story:  
Excellent, although it seems that some footage from several servo-skulls went missing.
Low initial mission count, supplemented by same number of operations (meant for multiplayer)
Score: 6/10

Visuals:
Relay congratulations to the Artists, Remeberancers and the Tech-Priests.
Score: 10/10

Lore:
As it should be. Personal note: Not sure why a race such as the *Redacted* would have a device that actively empowers warp rifts.
Score: 9/10

Connectivity:
Needs polish. It seems sudden and unpredictable Warp-storms are causing havoc with the Astropathic choir. Sometimes the Astronomican is barely visible.
Battle-Brothers are losing connection and are unable to join their squads, which is endangering mission continuity.
Score: 5/10

Multiplayer:
PvE element fun and satisfying. With several inconsistencies which currently appear to been worked on.
Score: 6/10

PvP element. Found an archeo-tech note which reads ""Not Great, Not Terrible""
Score: *Redacted*

Customization for Space Marines:
It would seem that members of *Redacted* have stolen most other Space Marine Chapters actual Gear. 
For now it seems that the Tech-Priests are repainting Ultramarine's armor and presenting it as other Chapters armor. Level of heresy is high, but acceptable until actual armor pieces are found.
Score: 4/10

Summation: Game is good and developers should be praised for what they have created.
With enough polish and additional work it would be an Excellent game. However there are several questionable decisions on release which probably are related to business decisions for content which require to be further scrutinized. 
Final score 6.5/10
Original recommendation: Yes

Post-Update Review
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is my take on the current situation of the game: 
- New Level - Very Good
Level design is great, new Bio-Titan is Awesome

- New Difficulty - Report to the Inquisition - 
New Enraged status for Majoris is good; 

Cohesion ""Leash"" - bordering on Heresy- Snipers, Heavies, Vanguards and especially Assault are getting penalized for their play style. The first too are supposed to be in the back providing fire support, the other two are supposed to be in the tick of it. - 
Recommendation: Rethink the design, perhaps based on what classes do best and how they can compliment each other. Positive reinforcement is better than negative.
Examples:
Knife in the Dark -

When the Sniper and the Vanguard are in Proximity range knife damage and/or speed and/or cleaving is increased

Overlapping fields of Fire -
When the Heavy and the Tactical are in close proximity, bolt weapons damage is increased for both Marines.

There! That one! -
When the Tactical and the Sniper are in close proximity Sniper Riles deals significantly more damage to Auxpex Scanned enemies

Thunder and Fury -
When the Assault and Bulwark are in close proximity power weapons deal more damage and/or have increased attack speed

Fangs of Fenris -
When two Marines are in close proximity Chain weapons have increased cleave and/or damage

Shield against the Filth -
When the heavy and the Bulwark are in close proximity the The Iron Halo becomes a sphere and has increased ranged 

Downtime after death - High Heresy - 
Recommendation: For an action pack game where every second counts 120 seconds should be the absolute maximum no matter what new difficulty is introduced. 


Balance changes - High Heresy -
Armor changes - Seems good.
Ammo changes - Seems good.
Recommendation: Reconsider some nerfs except the Tactical's scanner, buff the under-performing weapons instead.

Report submitted to Chief Interrogator. 
Until the Heresy Levels are lowered recommendation for the game is a NO.

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"Who the fuck cares about the queue times?

When you enter the game all you'll do is to press E on stone, on chests, on trees, on dead animals, on bushes, and even though you use the materials on crafting, it's usually for mundane things. You'll use 7 whole iron ingots for a boring wooden spear or a shoddy pickaxe.

You'll run in forests and on barren land with nothing worthwhile to see. Not even one inspired quest, not one interesting place to see, not a new enemy type for hours of gameplay. This game horridly lacks any sort of art or emotion, even 1 dollar broken games are at least kinda funny. Soulless game of a soulless corporation.

PVP is the most enjoyable aspect, which you can find in every other genre of game in a better condition, but an MMO, especially on this level of emptiness is not the right place for that.

Review by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34633003-Gaming-Masterpieces/lists/] Gaming Masterpieces [/url]  - The greatest games of all time on Steam. 
[/th][/table]

Is this game a masterpiece? It's really good! I haven't seen a survival game this good since the fantastic Valheim. You wake up in a tank (a cryo-capsule?) in a cave and a world that has seen its best days. Ruins, skeletons (that no longer move), dilapidated buildings, monsters and hungry animals roaming the area. And again and again areas covered in blue mist, in which a strange fungus is growing and disfigured creatures are lurking around. The fog is obviously not particularly healthy either; we take damage as soon as we spend more than five minutes in it. But we are something special - normal people die much faster in the fog. Maybe that's why we only meet so few survivors. But there are strange creatures in the fog... were they humans before? If so, they're pretty disfigured.

We create our character at the start of the game. The options are not that extensive and are mainly of a visual nature - upper body, gender, beard, hair and hair colour, plus there are several voices to choose from, there is not much more. At least we can give ourselves a name. We wake up wearing just a pair of pants (and a bra you cannot remove if we've created a woman) and immediately start exploring the surroundings and collecting resources. Stones, mushrooms, wood, meat, fruit, weapons, healing potions and whatever else is lying around. I don't know where we put it all, but we can carry a hell of a lot in our pants until we're overloaded. We kill the first enemies with a torch, or with our fists if necessary. As we explore the area, we regularly have flashes of inspiration and learn ways to use the resources we find for crafting. So we build a workbench, a new hammer and, first and foremost, an altar of flame as the centrepiece of our new camp.

We are not playing a normal human, but a ""Flameborn"", and our task is to free the land of Embervale from the terrible fog (Shroud) that has covered the land. The Shroud is obviously the result of the actions of our ancestors, who in their greed and stupidity brought about their own demise. So much for the background story. The gameplay itself is not overly innovative, but it is extremely well done. We can do everything we can do in many other survival games - run around, sneak, jump, strike, block, cast spells and collect things everywhere, which we can then use to make and build new, cool things. Dying is not so painful, you wake up at the last save point and can retrieve your inventory at the place of death. Our camp soon looks more like a castle, and we learn skills such as gliding through the air with small wings on our backs or swinging through the area with a climbing hook. The map is created automatically, the quests are noted by the game and can be viewed at any time. Character development is quite complex, with an extensive skill tree available. Double jump or a new spell? Do we want to become a ranged fighter, healer, wizard or rather an assassin? The choice is up to us. And what are we going to wear today? Helmet, gloves, trousers, shoes, a jacket, a shield...

[u][b] Conclusion:[/b][/u]
Enshrouded is a classic survival game that offers you great freedom of action. Gather resources, build a huge camp, construct useful items, improve your character, defeat huge boss enemies (or just small cannon fodder), explore new areas and learn more about the history of the land, all either alone or in co-operative multiplayer.","Very Positive85% of the 53,278 user reviews for this game are positive.",table th url http com curator 34633003 gaming masterpiece list gaming masterpiece url greatest game th table masterpiece good survival good fantastic valheim wake tank cryo capsule cave world best day ruin skeleton no_longer move dilapidated building monster hungry animal roaming area covered blue mist strange fungus growing disfigured creature lurking fog obviously not_particularly healthy damage soon spend five minute special normal die faster fog maybe meet survivor strange creature fog human pretty disfigured option not_that extensive mainly visual nature upper body gender beard hair hair colour plus voice choose not_much name wake wearing pair pant bra cannot_remove created woman immediately exploring surroundings collecting resource stone mushroom wood meat fruit weapon healing potion whatever else lying carry hell pant overloaded kill enemy torch fist necessary explore regularly flash inspiration learn way resource crafting build workbench hammer foremost altar flame centrepiece camp not_playing normal human flameborn task land embervale terrible fog shroud covered land shroud obviously result action ancestor greed stupidity brought demise background not_overly innovative extremely survival game sneak strike block cast spell collect thing everywhere build cool thing dying not_so painful wake last save retrieve inventory death camp soon look castle learn skill gliding air small wing back swinging climbing hook created automatically quest noted viewed development complex extensive skill tree available double spell ranged fighter healer wizard rather assassin choice wear today helmet glove trouser shoe jacket shield conclusion classic survival offer great freedom action gather resource build huge camp construct useful item improve defeat huge bos enemy small cannon fodder explore area learn history land alone co operative mode multiple player interact compete real
427520,Factorio,"Started playing [b]Factorio[/b] thinking ""cute little factory game"", now I'm calculating the bandwidth bottleneck of my local McDonalds drivethrough. 

My girlfriend dumped me for ""prioritizing belt throughput over our relationship."" Tried explaining that automated inputs are more reliable than manual insertion, but she said ""that's not how intimacy works.""
She left me but the joke's on her - that's one less resource drain on my mental CPU and I can finally focus on nuclear power optimization!

[b]Factorio[/b] really makes your brain overheat sometimes, but the process of working through the issues of your factory always ends up with a dopamine hit... then you run into new issues and the cycle starts again.

[b]Factorio[/b] is not listed as a survival game, but it teaches you various survival skills, like how to survive on 2 hours of sleep and barely any food in an environment not quite suitable for humans anymore. I don't need a circadian rhythm, I have circuit networks.
Since I started playing Factorio I noticed an increase in my problem solving skills in real life.
To optimize bathroom breaks I implemented a buffer system called ""empty bottles""

Even though I hesitated buying it (I refunded it twice), [b]Factorio[/b] is the most fun experience I've had playing a sandbox game since long ago, and it actually brought my fascination with engineering activities to the surface. 
It also ruined my life in the best possible way. 
Sure, I'm probably on several government watchlists for my concerning Google searches about optimizing nuclear missiles production - but my factory... my factory is beautiful.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"first thing, this is NOT a horror/slasher simulaton
dbd is a asyncronous multiplayer with a mix of lovecraftian mythos + slasher horror movies on top to give flavour
if you are here searching for a ""omg this gonna be so scary!"" type of game, dbd is not the game for you

now, if like me you are a horror fan, welcome
this game is one of a kind game, i'v always wanted a multiplayer horror experience but it looks like most ppl have this dumb notion that horror should always be about the boos and scares... anyways, how the game works:

killers: basically the killer role is a time menagement, he chases the survivors to hook and sacrifice then, the game have a very refined game design so is a little bit hard for untrained eyes to look in the ""in betweens"" thats why it frustrate most players that don't like to read info or hate to change their meta/perks. 
My tips to new killers: 
-don't camp the hooked survivor, it wastes your time and it may work with some survivors but it will not work with veteran players.
-put pressure on gens and use perks to counter gen rush
-pay attention to your add-ons and try to ""combo"" then with your perks
-don't be afraid of SWF(survive with friends) they play on a very autruistic way so they will try to make the 4 survive, unless you camp, then they will tell their mates and you will get 1~2 kills if you are lucky(or laggy)
-experiment with other perks combination, don't just watch you favorite dbd youtuber and say ""off course, this perks are so OP..."" and copy that loadout, pay attention to WHY is working and how the gameplay is unfolding
-if the chase is taking too long, find another survivor on the gens (remember, gens rush is your worst enemy)
-use headphones with a good audio
-play as survivor too, you need to think as your prey


Survivors: survivor role is a resource menagement, some may thing that survivor is easier to play than killer, but the team work factor is what acctually weights(matches with randoms have a very low chance of survival), if you play with good teamates the survival chance is high, but the killer can counter weight with memento moris(kill a survivor on the ground) and insta downs add-ons
My tips for new survivors:
-do gens
-open claudette perks, self care specially
-use at least one running perk(balanced landing or sprint burst)
-do gens
-pray for the killer not be the nurse
-stay calm and do gens
-have in mind that most of your actions make noise and alert the killer
-if you have less than 100h in this game, use claudette, she is the most stealth and hard to spot
-play as a killer, most good ""survivor main"" acctually play as killer too and this give you a great advantage of perspective over ppl who only play one role
-don't stay still on the same spot for too long or reavens will pocke you head

1938090,Call of Duty®,"Finally bought CoD after not playing it for 10 years. And wow, it's almost like they never do retrospectives on what worked and what didnt GAMEPLAY-wise. Monetization wise this game sure is modern, and by modern i mean bad.

This review does not take single player into account. However, if you pay 70 euro for a 4-6 hour single player campaign 1 dollar worth of weed keeps you more entertained for more hours.

The multiplayer is what I bought it for. While there are many good elements there are some serious issues.

Visibility when shooting is abysmal, the first 2 hours i spent on just learning how to see through all the smoke and camera recoil and headache inducing animations.

When aiming around your character take a few seconds to follow your crosshair, this is just visual but it makes it feel sluggish. Gunplay is fine if the above mentioned would be remedied.

Progression is stupid, play with this gun to unlock another class of gun which you have to level up in order to get another gun which you need to level  up in order to get what you want.

Which brings me to UI - I'm pretty sure the UI designer comes from hulu or netflix, what kind of interface is this for a game. Sub menus dont make sense and putting all buttons in the bottom of the screen but the back button in the top left is straight up stupid.

Character animations of allies and enemies are swaying like a flag in the wind, it's impossible to predict any kind of movement. Strafing left/right makes it look like they lean like in Tarkov or any tactical shooter.

Character movement. I have no idea how to unwrap my thoughts about the moving about in the world. I feel so floaty and unresponsive. Weird pauses between animations doesn't allow me to aim down sight, and when I aim down sight i move slower than a turtle.

And the biggest pain point for me, the maps. The maps ALL suck. Some are more bearable than others, but wow. I got a few hours of fun, but the maps makes me physically roll my eyes in frustration.

There are several other things that straight up shows how lazy, NOT THE DEVS, but the management is. In the start of the absolute worst trash map, Santa Sena Border Crossing, there is a cool ""cutscene"" with civilians running away, but they just phase through cars and walls - why even put it in if it is as broken as it currently is.

Atlus has done it again, and wow, they went all out with Metaphor: Re Fantazio. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece. They’ve taken everything we love about their RPGs and cranked it up to perfection. The gameplay? Smooth, addictive, and super satisfying. The story? Absolutely gripping once you dive into this fantasy world, you’re not going to want to leave.

Let’s start with the art direction. It’s straight-up stunning. The world feels like a living painting, every scene like a canvas full of detail and life. It’s got this beautiful, hand-drawn, storybook vibe that just pulls you in. It's basically like someone mixed Persona’s stylish flair with a high-fantasy dreamscape. 

And the characters? Top tier. Every character you meet feels unique and full of life. The way they develop over the course of the game just makes you care about them more. They’ve got that signature Atlus charm you know, where you can’t help but get attached, just like when you maxed out those social links in Persona. You’ll have a hard time picking a favorite!

Oh, and the soundtrack? Absolute fire. Whether you're in battle or chilling in town, the music sets the vibe perfectly. You’ll have those tracks stuck in your head long after you stop playing. I mean, it's Atlus, so you know they brought the heat, but this soundtrack is next-level. It gives me some serious Persona vibes, but with its own magical twist. 

The gameplay is a total blast. The combat system is deep but easy to get into, kind of like they took everything good about Persona’s combat and made it even better. It’s challenging without being frustrating, and every battle feels epic. The exploration is on point, too there’s always something cool to discover. The pacing is perfect, keeping you hooked from one quest to the next.

Atlus has truly outdone themselves with Metaphor: Re Fantazio. It’s everything you want from a JRPG: a killer story, awesome gameplay, and a world you can lose yourself in for hours. It’s like they took all the things that made Persona great and said, “Let’s take this fantasy world to the next level.”

So if you loved Persona and SMT, get ready to fall head over heels for this one. It’s a magical ride you won’t want to miss. Time to dive into the fantasy, because Metaphor: Re Fantazio is straight-up legendary.

Enjoy the game !!!! a GOTY contendor and a game you will never forget.","Very Positive91% of the 10,386 user reviews for this game are positive.",methaphor atlus wow metaphor fantazio short masterpiece taken love rpgs cranked perfection smooth addictive super satisfying gripping dive fantasy world not_going leave s_emphasizedtart art direction s_emphasizedtraight stunning world feel living painting scene canvas detail life beautiful hand drawn storybook vibe pull basically someone mixed persona s_emphasizedtylish flair high fantasy dreamscape character top tier meet feel unique life develop course make care signature atlus charm help attached maxed social link persona hard picking favorite oh soundtrack absolute fire battle chilling town music set vibe perfectly track stuck long atlus brought heat soundtrack next give serious persona vibe magical twist total blast combat deep easy kind took good persona combat challenging frustrating battle feel epic exploration cool discover pacing perfect keeping hooked task objective given non next atlus truly outdone metaphor fantazio jrpg killer awesome world lose hour took thing persona great fantasy world next loved persona smt ready fall heel magical ride miss dive fantasy metaphor fantazio straight legendary enjoy goty contendor never_forget
236390,War Thunder,"I had to write a review about this game because I have noticed the amount of shit this game has been getting lately, and with over 1,000 hours, I feel as if I am more than qualified to do so.

Yes, War Thunder is not a perfect game *gasp*, and I too have had my fair share of frustration at times. But when I sit back after a match and think about what I did wrong after being completely shit on, nine times out of ten it was my fault. Not angling my armor properly, being impatient and pushing so far up I get surrounded, etc. Thats what I love about this game. When you screw up, it's on you.

People are quick to cry wolf on the russian bias. Those people are also the ones who don't angle, flank, and mindlessly take on a heavy tank from the front. This game requires a plethora of skill which you will eventually require through practice and perserverance. Learn your tank/plane! Know your weaknesses and your strengths! This will help you tramendously in any situation. If instant gratification is something you are looking for, there's always COD.

Gaijin does a wonderful job updating the game fairly fast, and you can see they really do care about their community. They keep us updated and add new content almost every other month. They also do an excellent job hyping the following updates, giving players something to look forward to in the near future *COUGH COUGH BOATS*

Basically if you want me to cut the shit and get straight to the point of this review...

*Do not play this game if you are easily angered or impatient. YOU WILL NOT SURVIVE.

*If you are new to WT, give it a try for yourself instead of looking at the comments. This community really likes to whine. Don't let the comments plague your experience.

Most importantly, have fun, try not to think too much, and I'll see you in the skies!! o7","Mostly Positive72% of the 561,252 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I can't call it the best MMO ever because that depends on the style of gameplay you enjoy in an MMO.

What I will say is that this dev-team understands not only the game, but the customers better than any other dev-team in the MMO world. I've been playing MMOs since 1996 with a game called The Grand Realm and in all those years FFXIV is the only game that gets better every xpac. If it's not broken, don't change it and if it works add more seems to be the motto. They continually learn from their mistakes and care about the community unlike certain other ice cold dev teams that feel the community is beneath them.

The story is probably the best story I've seen in a JRPG since Chrono Trigger. It blows stories like Skyrim, Witcher, and others out of the water. It is a very slow burn due to the fact it's a 600+ hour MMO but the journey pays off the entire way and those who pay attention to the characters, the lore and to all the details won't be disappointed as they advance through the xpacs and see things reference and used that they had forgotten about. The dev team actually cares about the lore and the world, characters have real progression and make logical choices based on what you know about them and the story builds the entire way without feeling like a tropey nightmare. It's fresh, unique, and probably won't happen again in another MMO for a very long time. This game oozes love from all of those who have helped craft it and the player base reflects that, you will not find a nicer community anywhere.

End Walker is a master piece and if you take the time to enjoy and savor all of the story that it is built on along the way instead of rushing through it at breakneck speed you will walk away feeling the same. Make some friends, socialize, feel connected to the world.

216150,MapleStory,"This game has the potential to be great. The concept of a 2D MMORPG that's all animated is pretty cool, and there's a lot of charm in this game. I currently have a level 230 Kinesis in Reboot (I use nexon launcher instead of steam) and I've (somewhat) enjoyed the grind up to that point. The community at least in the server I play in is large and thriving. However, this game has major problems that's been in the game for as long as I can remember.

Pros:
- Tons of options in terms of which class/job you want to play with + no big loss of time if you change your main (passive benefits for each char you play)
- Great and flashy animation for a lot of moves, some of the characters you can play can feel extremely fluid
- Customization options are massive (comes with a catch mentioned in cons)
- Large community
- Constant updates and events are happening 

Cons:
- Tons and tons and tons of bugs (I cannot stress this enough), includes: buggy bossfights, broken UI, frequent game crashes, possible false ban, very laggy servers (in reboot, idk how it is in other servers)
- Non-reboot servers: very p2w, Reboot servers: overwhelmingly grindy
- Cosmetics is expensive/not worth the price: getting the look you want is based on rng a lot of times or it's time limited
- Nexon
Let me elaborate on the last point in the cons section. This company has been overwhelmingly incompetent when it comes to developing Maplestory. The company has been making extremely controversial balancing decisions for the game, as if they are purposely trying to slow down progression so as to increase the amount of money players have to put in this game. They have no transparency whatsoever. They often change the game without mentioning it in patch notes. They have also done nothing to fix the known problems of the game that has been here for the longest time. 

My main point of this review is, if you want to play for nostalgia's sake or just to try it out as a completely new player, go for it. It's a nice experience to try this game (if you get lucky and don't get bugged out), and you can clearly see the charm this game has. However, I would STRONGLY recommend NOT to play this game if you are looking for a game to spend a lot of time in. Nexon has shown little to no interest in listening to the community and they probably never will. You would be better off playing in a different game where the company actually cares about their community and things are hell of a lot more polished than this game is.","Mixed63% of the 13,193 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Until the last update, I would have highly recommended this game, but sadly I would advise everyone to steer away from this game and any other future Take-Two/Rockstar game. I think theifs is the best way to describe these companies. I can confirm to those of you reading these reviews saying ""surely they wouldn't be removing in game funds that people pay $80/£60+ for?"" that it is really happening. I will split this review into two parts; Single Player and Multiplayer.

[u] Singleplayer	[/u]
The story and how it plays out for single player is possibly the best out there. The story is fantasic, and there are very few missions that aren't fun to play. Also, the implementation of an in-game stock market (although not the best thing ever) is really cool to me. Pairing this with missions that allow you to manipulate this stock market, you can earn millions, even billions. But this leads to the issue of there being nothing to spend it on. Singleplayer mode for some reason does not get content from Rockstar's updates. The only way you can access them is by grinding multiplayer for days to afford the likes of one car, however we will get to that. 
Overall, Singleplayer is absolutely fantastic, except from the fact that after the story there is little to do unless you are interested in mods, in which case you will probably love this game for that.

[u] Multiplayer	[/u]

Oh yay, this train wreck. Okay, so I have 1,151 hours on Steam for GTA V, with around 1,000 being for multiplayer. I converted my stats from PS3 so likely have around double that. I know what I am talking about with this game. The multiplayer in this game is absolutely trash now. I was always able to look past the grind in this game, but it has gotten to the point now where money is so hard to make, and things are so expensive that it is no longer fun. At all. Rockstar and Take-Two have become money whores, so much so that they are taking purchased in-funds away for NO REASON and will accuse you of hacking the game. If you refuse to purchase the in-game currency (like me), then you will have to grind. Now, at least in my ways, around 1 hour of in game grinding will bring in, at most, around $300,000, and that's if youre grinding really hard, non stop, and have the most lucrative in game businesses in the game. When starting out, you will be lucky to bring in $100,000 per hour, so as you can see, it's a pretty tough grind anyway. The last update called ""Smuggler's Run"" brought some of the most expensive content in GTA Online to date, with things costing $1,500,000 upwards. I had 2.6 million removed from an in-game challenge called Criminal Mastermind that took me months to complete, getting $10,000,000 from. This was removed because it was ""modded or cheated money"". So, 6 tickets to Rockstar later, I have quite rudely been told by a robot to go fuck myself and that I'm not getting it back, and that's why I've finally decided that enough is enough with this game.
Something that I have always found interesting in GTA Online is that you can buy a yacht - a real calling card, with the most expensive one sitting at $10,000,000. The highest in-game currency you can purchase is $8,000,000, sitting at $100 real money. That to me has always seemed ridiculous for what is already a fairly expensive game.
Also, if you want to mod singleplayer, thats fine in their eyes (not really since they shut down OpenIV, a company they supported but hey let's let bygones be bygones), but if you DARE go near their money making method and try to make things fun, you will be banned and stripped of everything you have online.

[u] Overall	[/u]
This review could go on forever, about a game/company that steals from their fans and shuts down companies who they once directed their fans to, but I think it's time to sum it up. For what was for a very long time my favourite game ever, I would highly recommend that you never go near this game, even if you recieve it for free. I will never touch another Rockstar or Take-Two game, and hope that their next game flops and they learn no treat their fans better, however, if you're not giving them money, they hope you fuck yourself.

Update: Went on today to see if I had been refunded yet, and guess what!! I haven't.

Update 2: Left another ticket  to Rockstar asking HOW my money was illegitamate, stating several times that I know that it, according to them, is illegitimate but after my ticket making it to support stage 3 (presumably the highest? Has been in all support companies I know.), guess what happened? I got the same copied and pasted god damn response AGAIN.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"[h1]To preface this review: No, I do not recommend purchasing this game.[/h1]
I've worked in IT for 15+ years performing a variety of roles - networking, systems engineering, etc. So when I say yikes, I mean [i]yikes[/i] - if my company purchased and relied on a product made by this development team, they'd have violated their SLA so many times over they'd be sued out of existence, not to mention the ridiculous amounts of money they'd have to pay out for failure to comply with contractual obligations. If this review steers even one person away from purchasing this game, it was worth writing.

Dead by Daylight ranges from roaring fun to wanting to stab yourself in the eye with a fork. 

Why?

Oof. That might take a minute to answer. Or ten.

[b]..Let's get started.[/b]

[h1]1) Core game mechanics are regularly and consistently plagued with bugs.[/h1]
This is, by far, the most egregious issue I have with this game: almost every single patch contains some sort of significant bug or exploit unknowingly released along with it. The best part? Many bugs or exploits have no relation to any of the modifications or changes listed in the official patch notes. Releasing a patch to fix Trapper shouldn't cause the Huntress to break, as their assets should have zero relationship between one another. Such bugs can range from inaccurate hitboxes, killer-sided hit correction, network lag, broken perks, dedicated server disconnections despite completely functional network connections (meaning it's the game, not the player's fucking internet), disabled maps due to broken object interactions (generators, totems, etc.), and that's just the list I can think of off the top of my head. BHVR either doesn't have a single QA tester for their primary game, or they completely ignore feedback from their QA team (though that would at least make them consistent, since they ignore their game's community feedback entirely).

It doesn't seem to matter which side you play: killer or survivor, as each side has its own issues. As a survivor, killer projectiles will regularly hit through solid objects, as if rocks, walls, etc., are not properly coded into the game to deliver collision. If you throw a pallet and stun the killer successfully in a chase, somehow they are still able to successfully melee strike you at the same time, despite being stunned. As a killer, survivors will somehow dodge attacks that go directly through their character models. I cannot stress enough just how often the most basic parts of this game simply do not work - all of this results in obscenely frustrating and unfair gameplay.

[h1]2) BHVR takes a ludicrous amount of time to fix bugs.[/h1]
BHVR will take weeks or months (usually the latter) to successfully patch something. The best example I can think of? They introduced an offering that would give +104% bonus bloodpoints as part of their 4 year release anniversary. It didn't work. To add insult to injury, they had an offering from the previous year that gave +103% bonus bloodpoints. To summarize, the developers had to do three simple things:

- Reuse a working asset.
- Increase the value from 103% to 104%.
- Update/change the associated .jpg/.png file.

Somehow, someway, somewhere, they fucked it up. It was broken for over a [b][u]month[/u][/b]. There was another major bug a couple years back where pallets would simply not stun the killer after an update, and it took around six months for a fix to be released. [b]Six. Effing. Months.[/b] All to fix a core game mechanic. It's incompetence at its finest.

[b]UPDATE AS OF PATCH 7.7.0[/b] - BHVR [b]still[/b] cannot release a patch that doesn't fuck up the game. From seizure-inducing graphical glitches, stuttering, network lag, etc., it's impressive how badly they can wreck their primary moneymaker.

[h1]3) The balance team (if there is one) cannot perform their one, singular job: balance the game.[/h1]
BHVR has some of the most uneducated, delusional (or flat out stupid, I still can't decide which is worse) game developers I have seen to date. Patrick Harris, one of their lead game designers, is on record stating, ""There's a common misconception that by using just kills and escapes to adjust your MMR, it's 'ignoring' skill in the game - uh, this isn't the truth, this is false."" That's right: kills and escapes are the ONLY things the big brain lead game designer at BHVR thinks matters in regards to your MMR - not totems cleansed, not unhooks, not healing, not successfully downing and hooking a survivor (which, you know - are all legitimate factors in the game). In layman's terms, if one single survivor runs the killer for 5 generators and ends up dying because of shit teammates, it's not considered ""skilled play"". As a result, your MMR only increases for fully sacrificing survivors (meaning hook each survivor 3 times) or escaping the match. For someone to have 10+ years of game design and [b]still[/b] be this mindbogglingly out of touch with reality is impressive.

In addition, BHVR has no idea how to properly handle the game's meta. Of all the perks (skills) available in the game:

- 70% are underwhelming.
- 25% are mid.
- 5% are actually good.

How does BHVR tackle this imbalance? By nerfing the [b]good[/b] perks, duh! Instead of buffing weak perks so they're worth using, they nerf the good perks into the dirt. The result? Everything eventually becomes mid or weak, which makes overall gameplay feel like shit.

[h1]4) The community is horrendous.[/h1]
The community is filled with toxicity, worse than old League of Legends. Survivors and killers can be assholes, but killers especially run with the mindset of ""your fun is not my responsibility."" Camping, tunneling, slugging, griefing, BM'ing - it's all fair game. They will go out of their way to make your gameplay experience as miserable as possible, simply because they can.

[h1]5) Cheating. It's everywhere.[/h1]
There is so much subtle cheating in this game that it blows my 3 remaining brain cells away (I had to scrub them together fiercely to write this review). Cheating is rampant, and I would say 10-15% of your matches involve a hacker/cheater on either the killer or survivor side. EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) is junk, and doesn't stop hacking.

[h1]6) Pathetic developers.[/h1]
BHVR, in addition to their incompetence as a game developer, is filled with narcissism and spite for their own community. While examples are plentiful, the one below is truly the icing on the proverbial cake:

Dead by Daylight was submitted for Steam's ""Labor of Love"" game award through a poll-style voting system last year. Funny enough, the recent chapter release contained the Skull Merchant, one of the most toxic, broken killers they have ever designed. The community unanimously dragged them on the DBD forums and official subreddit, telling them to disable and rework the entire killer because of the sheer level of frustration caused (seasoned players were simply DC'ing due to matches taking up to 2 hours). So, what did they do?

[b][u]Instead of listening, BHVR completely disabled commenting less than 2 hours after the voting was turned on, all because the page was filled to the brim with negative comments from frustrated players. This back-asswards as fuck mentality is exactly why their community dislikes them with such fervor: they are physically and mentally incapable of handling any form of criticism.[/u][/b]

----------

Now, obviously you'll look at my gametime and say, ""Bro, you're still playing even though you hate it and spent all this time on a review? BRUH"" - You, my good reader, have a point. So, why DO I still play?

Simply put: I have a lot of IRL friends that play this as one of their primary games. I enjoy spending time amongst friends, even if it's in this shitty game. It's not that deep.

Don't try to rush it all at once, like you really have to just take your time and enjoy the little bits it provides.

At 100+ hours I have completed all there is to do and at first it is overwhelming, but I stress to take it a quest at a time and ease into it.

I would suggest buying just the base game rather than the Editions as the items provided are all cosmetic and honestly there's better items in game to work towards. There are some weird bugs that will pop up here and there, but save+quit+reload seems to take care of most of them.

216150,MapleStory,"I honestly enjoyed this game ever since I started this game as a kid back when it first came out like in 2007 or so on global. I used the same account, linked it to Steam, and returned occasionally to play whenever a big event is being held like Hyper Burning. But now my yearly routine ended after getting a random auto ban for ""suspicious activity for hacking and botting."" 

All I do is dailies and weekly bosses on my burning character. And right now they have some star event where you just sit on the chair and AFK for 30 minutes. Which I did, while alt-tabbed playing a different game or browse the web only to get auto banned. I tried to appeal and their senior GM said i violated their Terms of Use. I kept trying to get it sorted out but all the junior GMs refused to help and said their senior GM already checked my ticket and denied me. Absolutely no help in proving my innocence because my character just leveled off of dailies and only used event rewards.

It was the best game of my life

The beautiful world of the game is literally dying

The voice acting of the game is wonderful

The story of the game is unique

The NPC characters of the game are absolutely perfect

The game world is very big and you can see new things at every point of the map

The boss fights of the game make the game beautiful with their sound and perfect design, and each of them has a beautiful and scary story, and this is really the best point.

The game's NPCs and the sub-stages of the game are really interesting, it will keep you busy for a while and you will see several sub-stages that can have a great impact on the end of the game.

The game has no bugs at all, you don't see any problems in the game and that's great

2933620,Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6,"Four years to butcher a beloved COD franchise is unacceptable. Black Ops was their last redeeming franchise.

Multiplayer is just hell simulator. You're stuck in a perpetual loop of playing the same, shipment-lite map, with the same sweaty CDL wannabes. I literally cannot play multiplayer for longer than 30 minutes. It gives me a headache. 'Skill Based Match Making' is the worst thing that has ever happened. Its almost like the corpos behind this soulless slop don't care about your 'fun'. they just want to use your 'data' to feed it to an 'AI' to better keep you trapped in a downwards loop of suffering where getting better at the game makes you suffer more. Myself and many others have pointed out how you can shoot someone upwards of 8 times, and they can just turn around, tanking all the bullets and three shot you. Not to mention that playing on controller is like having aimbot. And there is NO option for PC users to opt out of playing with console / controller players. Its well hypothesized that they use adaptive damage on top of SBMM to try to keep everyone at a 1.0 K.D. This is beyond evil. Changing damage numbers based on performance or money spent or other metrics should result in this company being sued and going bankrupt. Games don't have to feel like this, there is no need to force yourself to get gaslit that you're bad, when the AI is using real-time tactics to manipulate and keep you playing for as long as possible, just so you can buy their newest $30 dollar Snoop Dogg skin pack. This is the most audacious shit I've ever seen. Making a consumer pay 70$ just to give them access to an AI powered store that exploits human nature, and a half finished game that took four fucking years to develop.

Zombies is fun at first and gets really annoying after you realize that the difficulty scaling is dogshit meant to shut the community up. When liberty falls was first showcased, it showed that even a non-zombies player could get to round 50 with no issues. Spawning in with plates, having a high ammo count, gobblegums, special powers, spawning with custom load-outs, and more, made this game seem extremely easy and furthermore, boring. The devs 'saw' this feedback and simply gave us bosses! A metric-fuck-ton of bosses. By round 32, you're already having to kill at LEAST 8 manglers at the start of the round. Enemies which stay in the back line, are extremely tanky, shoot projectiles that home on to you, knock enemies down, making it harder to kill them and easier to get trapped, push you into groups of zombies, take upwards of 10 shots with a triple pack-a-punched raygun, AND eat through your shields. Every other zombie is an armored zombie that takes half a mag just to pop their helmets off with deadshot AND a maxed weapon. And the abominations. I could write a whole review just about these horribly designed, buggy pieces of shit. Who decided it would be a good idea to add BOSS BATTLES every three to five rounds? Full fledged boss battles in the middle of an arcadey zombies mode? What the fuck were you thinking? These abominations can sit in the back of a train, laser your shields off, run into you, stunning you, and the only way for it not to have 99% damage mitigation is to shoot its open eyes. The animation for it opening its eye only happens when its shooting lasers at you, trying to shoot its open eye as it runs towards you nets you nothing as the game does not register it as a headshot for whatever reason even when shooting its clearly open eye. These battles can take upwards of 3 minutes at high rounds, with 'wonder-weapons' making you wonder why the fuck you ever hit the box in the first place. Nothing does any damage to these things, and they SPAM you with them. Popping a top tier scorestreak is the only way to kill them without being swarmed by zombies or wranglers. All of this makes zombies UNBEARABLE at high rounds, its just a plating up / buying ammo simulator and a hold left click until something hopefully dies before your ammo reserves run out again simulator.

Even Twitch streamers are playing other games, because their revenue is shrinking due to the lack of interest from the players.

AGS does not know how to manage an MMO.
1 - constructive criticism in the NW forums equals a ban. Happened to me, when I mentioned that the constant delays stem from a lack of product and program management, and no good QA is happening in the PTR.
2 - Servers keep getting merged to try and deal with abandoned servers and low userbase, while the ""fresh start"" servers are still empty. I have been merged 4 times, and the timezone I picked on my initial character (GMT) is now GMT+1, which means I can't do many ingame activities like invasions, because AGS tried to force me to play at a different time. As I'm genX, my family time comes first, and no one forces me to play on THEIR timezone.
3 - The dev videos are just silly and many people make fun of them. Vlogs about skins, spoken ingame language - which no one cares about. It's a known fact all skins are fugly, even most of the paid ones.
4 - No decent support. My game has been CTDing for over 2 months now. Got an ongoing ticket with AGS, and even after sending 12+ crash logs and 2 videos (yeh, they asked for it.. silly), it's still not fixed. Now they stopped replying. As in, they can't fix it.

Real time setting - if you can only play in the evening, you’ll only hear evening greetings, and you’ll only see a dark and gloomy valley. 

the real time linked quests.  if you have a real life and can't check in at all times of day. Or wait around waiting for it to rain in the game.

The broken quests.   Don't you dare actually play the game and harvest things ahead of time.  you'll get a quest to go flower picking with someone, and be stuck forever.  rather than fix the quests (Scrooge crafting) to give you one step at a time, or to register both steps you were just told about, they just flung in a pile of extra crafting material.  um, that's the hardest way to do that.  but actually fixing the quest would mean admitting they made a mistake.    

Currently I can't water 20 of my farm plots, nor dig them up, or destroy them.  why?  bugs.  but the microtransaction system is A+ working on target.

[b]accessibility.  flashing bubbles when fishing.  Lighting.  bright glare off the sea.  no settings whatsoever.  Do they want to give people migraines and seizures?  seems like they don't give a damn. [/b]

Grinding for cash.  All the cute disney stuff costs a whole lot of money from scrooge, and the updates to places get more and more expensive. 

Chasing Ursula and Ariel around to talk to them is a pain.  You can zoom out the map, but not enough to figure out where everyone is.  

Pros:
You can wander and talk to Disney characters.  17 of them at most, currently.

The unlocking via upgrading tools is a nice in character method.

1401590,Disney Dreamlight Valley,"Funny enough I've had the game since the early days in early access. Purchased the ultimate edition because i was enjoying the game and story.

Most everything positive I've had to say about the game has been slowly eaten away by the negative. 

Putting the whole ""Lets ditch the f2p idea"" didn't really bug me until they also decided that people who had purchased the early access ultimate editions didn't get their 30 dollar dlc. So yeah it kinda stung to have to spend even more money on the dlc but I did it. Gave them the benefit of the doubt.  I was also enjoying the DLC area and story so I kept on playing.

Guess how that's turned out for me?

Setting everything else aside what's destroyed this game in my eyes is the complete and total lack of bug fixes. Any and all bug patches are so few and far between it's a disgrace. 

There are issues that have been reported and known since early access that still haven't been addressed.
If you want something more recent, their newest update with Mulan has given me the first game-breaking issue that's stopped all progress. The frame drops are so terrible it's impossible to progress past the entry area.  So I waited a bit and figured I'd get back to it when they patched it.

...and I waited
and waited
and waited

...and here I am, finally uninstalling and washing my hands of this game.
They would rather push out half-baked content via their failure of a cash shop than fix the issues plaguing their game.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"[h1] ♦️ Cyberpunk 2077 [/h1]
[b] Cyberpunk 2077 [/b] has finally released through numerous delays and a pandemic, does it live up to the hype? In Cyberpunk we get a glimpse into a not so distant future that revolves around technology and tells a bleak but believable story.

[h1] Story & Characters [/h1]
[h3] Narrative [/h3]
→ The narrative in Cyberpunk is the focal point of this game CD Projekt Red has crafted. It tells a tale of V’s journey from the bottom of the barrel all the way to the top. You are able to select three origin stories that really only affect the first hour of gameplay then all the origins are on the same track. The story of Cyberpunk is a thrilling one from start to finish, with many complications that you will encounter along the way. V has found himself in a heap of trouble, and has to find the right connections in order to solve his problem. In Cyberpunk there is never a dull moment, from ASMR brothels to Metal Gear Solid like infiltration missions you will always be on the edge of your seat!

[h3] Characters [/h3]
→ The characters in Cyberpunk are what really sells the narrative, they are every bit as interesting and convoluted as the plot itself. I don’t believe I have come across many games that are able to give such believable and memorable characters. Each and every ‘main’ character you will come across have their own personal challenges, history, personal goals, and secrets that have you really form a bond with who they are. Untangling their inner motives and getting a deeper look at each character is a joy. Many characters have side missions that only further strengthen their personalities. 

→ While there are many characters that come across as my favorite only one man can truly live up to that title, and that is Johnny Silverhand. Love him or hate him, he will grow and open up to V as you near the end of the story. At first he may seem like a selfish rockstar who has no regard for consequences but like most characters there is more than meets the eye. Learning his background and struggles, you will grow to realizing why Johnny is the way he is. Every other side character is just as fleshed out as him and it really sells the real world of Cyberpunk
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2317600435

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
[h3] Combat [/h3]
→ While the combat initially turned me off it eventually grew on me as I unlocked more perks to play around with. The combat is actually quite enjoyable when everything is working as intended. The guns feel meaty, the perks feel impactful, quick hacking is satisfying everything is headed on track. But then we get to the roadblock that is enemy AI. We have been spoiled by how far enemy AI has progressed over the years, and in this case it sure is a step back. From not reacting to the player to shooting through walls, there are all sorts of issues here.

[h3] Weapons [/h3]
→ Throughout your journey you will come across many different kinds of weapons, but only a limited amount of weapon classes. While it sure was fun for the first twenty hours to get any minor DPS increase, eventually I realized most of the guns are copy and paste with minor stat increases as you level. While weapon variety may be lacking, that doesn’t mean what is available isn’t enjoyable. Depending on your build any weapon class is a viable option, whether you choose to spec into pistols or shotguns you will wreak havoc regardless. 

[h3] Attributes & Perks [/h3]
→ As you level you will receive points to pick into your favorite attributes and perk points to further solidify your playstyle of choice. This was one of the more enjoyable aspects of building V, as with each level you really feel the power increase. One other aspect of leveling I loved was that as you used pistols your actual sub-tree in each attribute increased in levels. It's almost the Skyrim system where you define your playstyle as your progress overtime. 

[h3] Weapon & Character Mods [/h3]
→ Now what fun is a futuristic cyberpunk game that doesn’t involve robotic enhancements to your player. Thankfully this game delivers on allowing you to build your own super human of destruction. There are many implants that give you the ability to double jump or even turn getting poisoned into healing. Not only are you building the perfect cyber-human you are also able to modify your weapons to your liking. While Cyberpunk might not let you build the deepest backstory, it does offer various ways to define your playstyle to your choosing. 

[h3] Side Content [/h3]
→ I dislike doing side content especially in ‘open world’ RPGs, they are usually half-baked content that is solely there for the purpose of inflating playtime. But Cyberpunk does it differently, many of the side quests have as important reveals and choices as the main plot. It has everything you could want in side quests, from street racing all the way to chasing down a taxis alternate personalities. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2317598759

[h3] The World of Night City [/h3]
→ Now we can talk about Cyberpunk without mentioning one of the biggest characters next to Johnny, and that is Night City. CD Projekt Red has failed to deliver on some promises regarding content in the game, but what it wholeheartedly succeeds at is creating a believable and lived in world. The city is cramp packed with details that most players will never get to see, taking the time to wander around and explore is one of my favorite past times!

[h1] Visuals & Sound [/h1]
[h3] Visuals [/h3]
→ This is the first truly ‘next-gen’ game I have experience in the visual department. Cyberpunk includes many of the latest features including RTX, DLSS, and more. They all come together in tandem to bring Night City to life. The textures are all incredibly detailed from V’s clothes all the way to the vendor's noodle stand, everything is realistic and beautiful. Lighting plays the prominent role in creating such a photo realistic environment. Every shadow is realistic and calculated by CD Projekt Red’s engine and only further enhanced with RTX on. The neon lights of Night City are jaw dropping and realistically disperse light across different textures. The textures, shadows, lighting, and more all come to bring such graphical fidelity.

→ Now performance on the other hand is another issue, without DLSS this game would be unplayable on the highest graphical settings. I ran this with a 5600x and a RTX 3080 and I was getting 45-80 FPS throughout the game, this is with every setting to the max. While I did certainly get playable frame rates, keep in mind the power needed to run this game at high fidelity. 
[h3] Sound [/h3]
→ Sound is also extremely well done in this game, gunshots in the distance or densely packed markets are all realistically recreated in Cyberpunk. The voice acting done is top notch, they help sell the characters with such greatly delivered lines. And it is all tied together by a licensed soundtrack that only further enhances the atmosphere. With heavy metal to heavy dubstep you have everything you could imagine to listen to in a Cyber like future.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2317601271

[h1] ♦️ Conclusion [/h1]
Let's be honest no game could live up to the hype created by Cyberpunk 2077, even though that CD Projekt Red delivers a fantastic RPG set in a Cyber realistic future with a thrilling narrative. But what is stopping me from rating Cyberpunk at the range it could be are the bugs, quality features, and horrible AI bringing it back down to Earth. 

[h3] Disclaimer [/h3]
Lastly, the game is a bugfest at the moment, I won't go into detail as I am sure you have heard a lot about Cyberpunk and bugs these past couple weeks.

[h3] Overall Score 8.5/10 [/h3]

2429640,THRONE AND LIBERTY,"It's pretty pay to win, but at the same time it kinda isn't.

There's a basically a cap that you can get to in terms of power. For the most part, you can get to that cap as a F2P player. It may take you a few weeks to maybe a month of consistent playing while the whales can do it in 20 minutes of swiping, but you can get there.

Once you DO get there, you're even with them. It's not like they can $$$$$ into infinity so you can never catch them, it just takes time playing the game. In my opinion playing the game because it's fun to do is the whole point, so don't worry about when you get there.

Also side note; You can get the in game currency without too much issue as a F2P once you hit endgame, which will also help you gear faster.

I say give the game a try if everything else looks good to you, I think it's great.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Now, there sure are many good sides to GTA V and it's definitely a fun game to play.
But there's also soemthing that's very problematic.

1. Cheaters
2. Duping
3. Hoverbike (Opressor), an impossible-to-kill air scooter with homing missles.
4. Modded accounts
5.Banning both cheaters and innocent people.
6. Botters / idlers / leechers.

[ Cheaters ]
[spoiler]When a cheater enters a lobby of 20 people, expect this:
- You will get kicked out of your vehicle
- Weather might be changing any time
- Not very smart players will ask them for money and get banned if they will get any.
- You can even get banned if you meet a toxic one, just prepare for anything[/spoiler]

[ Duping ]
[spoiler]This one is an actual hot topic.
Rockstar sure tries to fight it but there's just too much work to do to keep people from discovering new ways of glitching / duping every day / week.[/spoiler]

[ The air-scooter with homing missles ]
[spoiler]It's fast & wrecks cars, helicopters and fast planes due to it's high mobility.
RPG rockets are almost useless against it.[/spoiler]

[ Modded accounts ]
[spoiler]You find a bossting service for GTA V, you pay them money, they give you modified account They are mostly non-steam ones.
By doing so you will get any amount of money, level, your car / character could be a big hamburger ( a prop ) etc.[/spoiler]

[ Banning ]
[spoiler]Ban appeals won't work.
If a cheater modified your account or you picked up money he dropped - you can say your last goodbies.
There are so many cheaters, glitchers, dupers that Rockstar won't even bother reading your ticket.[/spoiler]

[ Boters / idlers / leechers]
[spoiler]Every time you'll try to do one of these ""quick"" missions through your mobile phone - there will be a chance that you'll get in a lobby with one of these.
Leechers are basically people that choose the map manually or via 3rd party software and just IDLE for the rest of the game from the very beginning.
There's no kick option so they just stay in the lobby dead or alive until the mission is completed by other players.

At this point you've got 3 options:
1. Wait for an AFK player to get killed by cops
2. Do the missions yourselves
3. Leave. There's nothing wrong with leaving and screwing up other people in the middle / end of the mission [b]IF[/b] it seems impossible / too slow and/or frustrating.
Your time is the only thing you should value and Rockstar should take actions against botters / leechers / hackers etc.
[b]Value your time and yourself, that's all that matters.[/b][/spoiler]

So many micro transactions & paywalls now, it's disgusting. The last straw for me was this new DLC of storybook vale, wtf?

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"The single best game of 2024 Q1/Q2 (probably the whole year) and a very capable winner for game of the year. Hands down a top recommendation, you'd be a fool not to. This game is now a staple hallmark of the modern gamer.

There's a lot to speak on about this game, the pros and cons and so because there are so few I will start with the cons,


Cons;

Early on there were issues with the code/servers with players not able to get in, however the issues were solved and the game is in a perfect state now. Most of the negative reviews are in relation to the early days when the servers that were expecting a tops of 200k players were soon hitting 500k with steam players alone, add in cross play from playstation the numbers supposedly went close to a million, a feat very rarely obtained. 

Additional negative reviews are in junction with recent re-balances for weapons, many were buffed, a few were nerfed which in the grand scope of the game make perfect sense and I for one applaud the needed changes. People who are greatly upset are few but the loudest crybabies that need to just deal with it.

Some devs additionally trolled people on some reddit posts but I find those unrelated to the finished product here but its worth to note as the whiners have taken to trying to review bomb the game. despicable traitors. 


Pros; 

Well polished and a proper full game all for $40. This is the first game in recent memory were I WANTED to spend more money on the game, rather then wishing for less. In the current world were game companies are trying to stuff out triple A title games as a ""always online service"" as a excuse to charge more, this game doesn't do ANY of that. Though the game is always online and you partake in a ever going on war on multiple fronts, the developers don't use that as a excuse to get more money.

You fight to defend Earth and managed democracy to a huge arsenal of weapons in a uncomplicated progression system, having huge tools of destruction at your finger tips. The game is a mile wide and NOT a inch deep, it has warbond books that you progress through to get new gear, weapons and cosmetics, not only are there several books now but more are soon to come every second Thursday of each month centered around a theme.

The war is live and ongoing, there are youtube and social media channels to watch and progress with the war, a constant feature. On the developer side a individual named Joel is running the war like a dungeons and dragons Game Master to ensure the war stays hot and spicy.

Replay-ability is immense, if and when the war ends a new cycle is noted by the devs to kick up, very much like Helldivers 1 but that's a long LONG ways from happening as of now. 

This game is centered around playing with 3 others (4 max) and while it is more fun playing with friends, playing with randos or even just going solo is possible.

While the engine has been around in development since 2009, released in Hamiltons Great Adventure in 2011 as the Bitsquid engine, its was soon sold off and repackaged as the Stringray Autodesk Engine in 2014 were soon after it was use in Helldivers 1. In 2018 support for the engine stopped. The developers decided on this outdated engine and yet it presents some of the best, cleanest, explosive awesome graphics today beating modern games that use cutting edge engines. Just goes to show the in-depth work and love the few developers have for this.

The developers, numbering less then 100 at Arrowhead studios worked hard and surprised us with this creation and are continuing to bring in more, leaks and showcases present more mechs, trucks, apcs, weapons, armor, customization are on the way and in plenty, all being brought in usually via story telling ways. Recently the mechs have been added with the EXO-Patriot suit, players needed to rescue and defend the factory's that made them when the commie-bots attacked the planet, in less then 20 hours the attack was repelled and the mechs were made safe and soon deployed to all.

For story its not direct and in your face, you do have to look and find clues, hints and not just in game but also on social media, youtube and so on. Its fun and exciting, you go through a series of emotions and mind sets from baby faced new fanatical to realization that the other 3rd faction is watching and that Earth....maybe the bad guy? time will tell as the war and story progress.


Conclusion,

This game is a must buy, a staple of the modern gamer and a clear picture of what a game should be. Look at this (and baldur's gate 3), then look at the garbage of call of duty, skull and bones, battlefield and any other game a big corporation company is pumping out. This game is crafted with love, ""love for the craft puts perfection in the work"", this game (and baldur's gate 3) is material form of that saying, and all for a un-greedy low price of $40, you'd be a fool not to get this game.

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"I believe this is a better version of Duels in many aspects. I've played hundreds of hours of duels and, from what I remember, the play modes were very limited and the rewards almost nonexistent. Even if it wasn't as buggy as Arena and the AI was much better. I'm annoyed because sometimes I lose matches in Arena due to the game freezing, loading infinitely and not allowing me to continue playing the match. And it happens with many other players, so not a problem in my end. I really wish they would fix that.

But despite that I still think Magic is one of the best card games you can find, if not the very best. I do not recommend spending any money in it tho, since the cards are very overpriced (specially because they are in dollar and the currency of my country makes everything 5X more expensive than it is for someone in the US).

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"I've played ""paper"" magic for over 10 years and any video game that stays true to the card game will have its limitations. This game is great for 1v1 play or just staying up to date with new sets and mechanics. 

I feel that WOTC is pushing a little too far into digital with some of the card mechanics they are releasing that focus more on digital play keeping track of every interaction and are making the ""paper"" version more complex (maybe too complex... try keeping track of some of these mechanics with pen/paper in person, would make anyone's head spin). 

All that being said, this game gives a general idea of the TCG, but leaves out some major staples. It needs more cards/sets from MTG's history, 4 player tables for group play and to bring in some of the classic game modes (Planechase/Archenemy/Commander/EDH... screw Brawl) that made it worthwhile to have a larger group in non-competitive play.

I hope that WOTC delivers better on the next MTG game and expands on Arena which sets a great baseline for an MTG game. If they add more content, more players in matches and a better way of communicating between players in-game, this could be the Go-To MTG experience and bring a lot more players together when they can't play in-person. Until then, this is the closest if not best digital MTG experience available to a majority of the community.","Mixed64% of the 14,968 user reviews for this game are positive.",paper magic 10 year video stay card limitation great 1v1 play staying set mechanic wotc pushing far digital card mechanic releasing focus digital play keeping track interaction paper version complex maybe complex keeping track mechanic pen paper spin give general idea tcg leaf major staple need card set mtg history 4 table group play bring classic mode planechase archenemy commander edh screw brawl worthwhile larger group non competitive play hope wotc delivers next mtg expands set great baseline mtg add player match communicating player mtg bring player play closest not_best digital mtg available majority community
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.

What I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.

First, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*
- What does this mean?
If you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.

Second, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different
- What does this mean?
There are two types of subscriptions. 
The first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.
The second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. 
There are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. 

Third, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character
- What does this mean?
Every character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.

Overall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out.","Very Positive87% of the 71,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",it_emphasized good great trial play probably heard word mouth not_going good thing telling player maybe important version major addition add feature mechanic ffxiv square enix directly future expansion mean sale major addition add feature mechanic cannot_participate go future expansion not_square frustrating wrong waste double check bought mogstation seeing version type subscription entry standard subscription different type subscription entry subscription 12 99 usd 30 day long get per sever total 8 character subscribing move standard subscription standard subscription starting 14 99 usd 8 charcters per sever total 40 standard subscription purchase multiple month save long especially addition extra retainer fee completely optional form inventory management third wow play class on_emphasizede swap class changing weapon meaning play class come class requires big draw swapping character real pain yes s_emphasizedtill repeatedly performing action gain resource involved class square play wow reading name change race change cheaper remember wow name 10 usd fantasia completely makeover changing race gender nearly else save name 10 usd bought pack 3 5 save good thing top help re_emphasizedading hope fun trying

Shame on you, GSC. Alife was a heart of Stalker, and Stalker 2 doesn't have a heart.

Forget poor perfomance - they can fix it in future, but lack of life in gameworld they won't fix.

238960,Path of Exile,"First of all i am a new player in PoE. This review comes from the perspective of a player that has literally decided to commit to this game 2 weeks ago. I did not know about the games state before now but i do know there is drama surrounding the development of this game. 

So far i have really been enjoying the game. Starting effectively completely fresh the game is very overwhelming. I did the classic ""oh this skill looks cool"" and ""ooo this weapon is nice"" until i get one shot by Dominus and give up, rinse and repeat a few times before giving up and looking up a guide. I think making the game so overwhelming with this gigantic skill tree and elemental resistances getting cut (multiple times without knowing), which is enough for new players to require guides and third party programs is not ideal for the overall experience. During 20+ hours climbing the cliff of learning the core systems of PoE, on the 10th attempt at not making a stupidly weak character, i realised i didn't mind restarting. The game felt fresh every time. Every time there were new map layouts, different league mechanics, different rares and drops. This is something the game is GREAT at and it is clear why people are keen for a fresh new league so they can restart and play something new. 

So i finished the campaign, decent story, super cool themes and maps and i'm loving my boneshatter build. And holy crap its like climbing one cliff to then be faced by another twice the size. The game has so much depth unlike any other I've seen that not even an hour video could make it clear on what i should do to progress. (note: I've still barely scratched the surface of the end game). Taking the approach of learning one system at a time I have found most effective for learning the end game. The sheer depth of this game shows that this game will stick for me for a long time.

This game is free to play yes however, by the end game I found myself really struggling to manage my inventory and stash. I have heard many players rave about how important stash tabs are and i regret not believing them. They are a MUST if you plan to take the game seriously, they save so much hassle and time wasting when you forget where you put your chaos orbs. Some weekends they have sales on the tabs so it is worth dropping £20 to get a few tabs.

Over all, PoE is a very overwhelming game and I think there is a cost to the game if you decide to commit. It would definitely benefit from a much better tutorial especially when introducing new systems. However, this game is FANTASTIC at its core. It is super satisfying to clear a screen with a few clicks and zoom through maps while improving your efficiency and skill. The boss fights are really memorable and oh my the depth of this game is unparalleled.","Very Positive89% of the 227,830 user reviews for this game are positive.",poe come perspective literally decided commit 2 week ago not_know game state drama surrounding development far enjoying starting effectively completely fresh overwhelming classic oh skill look cool ooo weapon nice shot dominus rinse repeat time giving guide overwhelming gigantic skill tree elemental resistance cut multiple time knowing player require guide third party program not_ideal 20 hour climbing cliff learning core system poe 10th attempt not_making stupidly weak realised mind restarting fresh layout different league mechanic different rares drop great clear keen fresh league restart play finished series connected mission level form storyline decent super cool theme map loving boneshatter build holy crap climbing cliff faced twice size depth unlike not_even video clear progress note barely scratched surface taking approach learning found effective learning sheer depth show stick long play yes found struggling manage inventory stash heard player rave important stash tab regret not_believing plan seriously save hassle wasting forget chaos orb weekend sale tab worth dropping 20 tab poe overwhelming cost decide commit definitely benefit tutorial especially introducing system fantastic core super satisfying clear screen click zoom map improving efficiency skill bos fight memorable oh depth unparalleled

216150,MapleStory,"I have no idea if Steam will say at all if I've played Maplestory but I promise you all I have put a lot of time into this game and absolutely loved every minute. Unfortunately Maplestory just became completely uninteresting since I've tried to relive it. And it makes me really sad. Maplestory originally had the classes we all see in every MMO (no matter how hard other MMO's try to make it different) and of course also like every MMO it started off simple. One big difference of course was the fact that it was a 2D sidescrolling MMOPRG and it's done so beautifully. You can make different faces at people depending on how you feel which was really fun before the cliche ""lol"" and ""lmao"" texts we all now universally know. Getting weapons was also a little more unique since most MMO's just milk weapons. Now a lot of MMORPG's have bows with unlimited arrows and guns with unlimited bullets. Maplestory made you buy arrows and throwing stars/shuriken if you wanted to be a ranged class. And Mesos (Maplestory currency) was hard to come by at low levels making it even more challenging since you had to actually ask for money from time to time.

When I originally loved this amazing piece of gaming art you had to use a taxi to get to different cities (which you still do at least) and use flying boats to get to different continents. This was a huge deal because it allowed you to just settle down for a short time and actually talk to people; and listen to music along the way. Now this is not the case. There were no overpowered and annoyingly voice acted 'Hero' classes that literally kill everything in their paths with ease. You really had to work to get more powerful back then and you also needed to manually know what your stats needed to be for your class. Maplestory added more powerful classes over time but they were never 'Hero' status. Yes they got more powerful due to their unique skills compared to the default classes; however you still needed to start off as a default class and work your way into the more unique class you selected and leveling was still just as hard for you as the rest. 

The music is still the same Maplestory anime music I know and love. I just wish it could be heard with the game I knew and loved. For all you new players out there reading this review it'll mean close to nothing probably. To shorten what I just said: Maplestory used to be a surprisingly vast game filled with lots of social opportunity and hours upon hours of questing and leveling. It's a shell of its former self now. This does not mean I say it's a bad game. It's still good and worth the try. But unfortunately you have missed the golden age that was Maplestory. It's all milked down and I can't recommend it in its state now. What used to take a couple weeks to a month takes less than a day now. Bosses that originally required a full team can easily be defeated solo and the monsters that were originally intimidating and powerful are powerless. The challenge is gone. I will miss you Maplestory.","Mixed63% of the 13,193 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Welp, after 963 hours in this game i can affirmatively say that GTA V has been the single-handed biggest waste of my time in my life. And this is also factoring in my 5,000+ hours in CS:GO. The reason for this? its not that i didn't have fun in GTA Online, especially when you add your friends into the mix the online portion in this game is great. Single player was enjoyable as well, with a decent story and several laughs id say the 80 hours of single player was worth it. My problem with this game is the company behind it, Rockstar. As a company that has such a lucrative franchise as GTA how could someone spoil it? Well let me tell you.

GTA Online is driven by having fancy cars and the latest in OP military hardware to absolutely shred people that don't have something worthwhile to defend themselves. To obtain these vehicles you need BANK, and im talkin bags on bags on bags of money. Multi million dollar equipment, that would take HOURS of in-game grinding to be able to obtain. Thats where the flaw is. Having to put SOOOO much time into a game to get basic stuff, to actually have fun even. Just with high end sports cars that ALSO cost millions. A way around this? Buy shark cards... Rockstars very own cash cow. To get the best vehicle in the game (At time of review) which is the Oppressor MK II, you need a terrorbyte and a nightclub as well. All in all, about $5,680,000 in game money. To buy a shark card for that? You'd need a Megladon Shark Card, worth $100 USD. That right there sums it up.

Glitching is something that Rockstar hates with a passion, because it eats into their precious shark card sales obviously. I (like many others) took part in a property trade-in glitch to get 10's of millions of dollars. Why? to buy all the military style vehicles and pretty sports cars my heart could desire, without having to put hundreds of hours into the game further. At that point i had about 900 hours into the game. Of which i didnt have very much to show for it, compared to after doing the glitching of course. Now, since Rockstar doesn't like a loop hole in the game they made allowing me to get 10's of millions with NO THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, i get a character reset. Now why on earth would i sit back and think ""fair enough"" after i put 900+ hours into the game. This game as it sits is dead to me, if i ever play this game again i will be using a mod menu to give me in-game cash. The game is the biggest time waster to date, and i wont put anymore ""legit"" hours into this game. Years of playing online, gone in 1 second. Thanks Rockstar, for encouraging your fanbase to download mod menus... the very thing you hate ;)","Very Positive87% of the 1,741,767 user reviews for this game are positive.",welp 963 hour affirmatively gta single handed biggest waste life factoring 5 000 hour c not_that fun gta online especially add friend mix online portion great single enjoyable decent laugh id 80 hour single worth problem company rockstar company lucrative franchise gta someone spoil gta online driven fancy car latest op military hardware shred worthwhile defend obtain vehicle bank im talkin bag bag bag multi million dollar equipment hour repeatedly performing action gain resource able obtain thats flaw soooo basic stuff fun high sport car cost million shark card rockstars cash cow best vehicle oppressor mk ii terrorbyte nightclub 5 680 000 shark card megladon shark card worth 100 usd sum glitching rockstar hate passion eats precious shark card sale obviously others took property trade software programming error cause unexpected behavior 10 million dollar military style vehicle pretty sport car heart desire hundred hour 900 hour didnt compared glitching course rockstar loop hole allowing 10 million no_third party software reset earth sit fair 900 hour sits dead play a_emphasized modification alteration player fan menu cash biggest waster wont anymore legit hour year online 1 thanks rockstar encouraging fanbase download modification alteration player fan menu hate
1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"The game isn't perfect. The game isn't majorly groundbreaking. However this game has a beautiful open world with a ton of fun stuff to do. Most of the characters are compelling and I instantly connected with many of them. The map at the start was overwhelming with new activities to complete and I gained a ton of satisfaction slowly chipping them off of my map. There are a handful of annoyances. These include graphical glitches, missing QoL features, clipping issues, loot stuck in the ground, some NPC's have canned dialog that repeats over and over again. These issues are not prevalent all the time. Many of the negative reviews are upset that the game has bugs or that it is not perfectly optimized for their system. Others are upset because they thought that the game would break the mold. Whenever you have a huge release like this, people rate the game as a Zero with no context.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Yes. I would recommend this game for the Singleplayer mode.
The muliplayer however.. 

When I first bought this game I didn't even care for the multiplayer. I spend over 350+ hours in the singleplayer alone and it was great. Plenty of stuff to do, plenty of fun to be had with some minor problems here and there. But nothing to be worried about.
When I started the multiplayer, everything appeared to work just fine. It looks more like a loadingscreen simulator but there is still plenty of fun to be had. The sheer amount of stuff to do is amazing and with some friends you can have hundreds of hours of fun. But then everything changed when Rockstar attacked..

Now I cannot find a single game without hackers, modders or whatever the fuck you call them. When I still had a low-level character, I met a few hackers and they were generally nice people. They played along in heists and missions and just did their own thing and had fun by themselves without bothering the other players.
But now it seems they have turned extremely hostile. Blowing up your vehicles, dropping you from high altitudes, spawning a tsunami of cars on your head, putting people in lift cabins, going on a rampage while being invulnerable to attacks.. It's just ridiculous, unfair and extremely childish. 
Rockstar has failed miserably in removing these hackers from their game. They are banning more innocent players than hackers with their new automated system.

Yesterday (7th of May, 2017), for example, out of the blue a hacker gave me 17 million dollars. You may think 'Allright! More money to spend! finally I can buy that Yacht and modified car I've been working my ass off to obtain!'
But you'd be wrong. I IMMEDIATELY left that game so the amount I got wouldn't be rising even further. 
Why? Because Rockstar is now also punishing players who OBTAIN money from hackers, whether it was obtained voluntarily or not. Now I am terrified of Rockstar's ""Banning machine of Death"" and affraid to play the game again for fear that my level 112 character will be reset and all of my work will be gone without any hope of getting it back.

Hackers, you're not trolls. You're not funny. You're not clever. 
Call me old-fashioned or a big soft pussy, but in my book, you're all a bunch of assholes whose parents did a lousy job teaching you the value of respect. Just because you're anonymous on the internet doesn't give you the right to be a dick, nor does it justify your actions.
And Rockstar, get your shit in order and make sure these people stop terrorizing your game.
I'll change my recommendation of the multiplayer to positive when they start to put more effort into the anti-cheat.
For now, buy this game if you want to play the single player. If you only want to play the multiplayer, I strongly recommend you wait until this problem has been fixed.","Very Positive87% of the 1,741,767 user reviews for this game are positive.",yes recommend mode alone interaction player mode muliplayer bought care mode multiple player interact compete real spend 350 hour mode alone interaction player alone great plenty stuff plenty fun minor problem worried started mode multiple player interact compete real appeared fine look loadingscreen simulator plenty fun sheer stuff amazing friend hundred hour fun changed rockstar attacked cannot_find single hacker modders whatever fuck call low met hacker generally nice along heist mission fun bothering player turned extremely hostile blowing vehicle dropping high altitude spawning tsunami car putting lift cabin rampage invulnerable attack ridiculous unfair extremely childish rockstar failed miserably removing hacker banning innocent player hacker automated yesterday 7th 2017 example blue a_emphasized us unauthorized illegal method gain advantage gave 17 million dollar allright spend finally yacht modified car working as obtain wrong i_emphasizedmmediately left rising rockstar punishing player obtain hacker obtained voluntarily not_now terrified rockstar banning machine death affraid play fear 112 reset hope hacker not_trolls not_funny not_clever call old fashioned big soft pussy book bunch asshole parent lousy teaching value respect anonymous internet dick nor_does justify action rockstar shit order terrorizing recommendation mode multiple player interact compete real positive effort anti cheat play single play mode multiple player interact compete real strongly recommend wait problem fixed

It's a nice, pretty casual take on the social deduction game genre which I'd happily buy more copies of for friends given its low price point. The issue mainly arises with the voice acting and the performance issues. The dialogue sounds AI generated at times, and it's a bit janky with all the stitching that has to be done to relay game info, and when I played it this game took up ALL of my GPU's spare resources. Given how genuinely fun the game is and how well it runs I'm hesitant to say this is by any ill will on the dev's part (I looked into it a bit, they're animators first and game devs second) but it's something to keep in mind nonetheless.

Recommended with a word of caution, it's certainly a little rough and playing with randoms is (as always) a risk I'm sure, but the foundation is good fun and they're adding more soon!","Very Positive86% of the 14,683 user reviews for this game are positive.",liar not_because not_fun nice pretty casual social deduction genre happily copy friend given low price issue mainly arises voice acting performance issue dialogue sound ai generated time bit janky stitching relay info took gpu s_emphasizedpare resource given genuinely fun run hesitant ill looked bit animator s_emphasizedomething mind recommended word caution certainly rough randoms risk foundation good fun adding soon
2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"After waiting for this game since it's teaser trailer, and now finally completing the game (and most side quests), I am ready give my opinion on it.

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.

BMW is a difficult boss rush game with a fantastic story and minor RPG elements. Many people have already brought up the minor points of the game so I am gong straight to the main point. The combat is pretty much the whole of the game, going from boss to boss with minor fights in-between. The fights are incredibly punishing but feel so because the bosses are artificially difficult. I can only explain it through an example: After encountering a boss and dying multiple times you learn the bosses move sets and are able to dodge their moves and time your attacks. However, even after you do so, you realize that the boss still has 2/3rds of their health left and you have to battle perfectly...5 MORE TIMES. 
It really becomes a test of endurance rather than skill or reflexes. This becomes even more apparent after you utilize all of your spells and skills and are now left to slog through the battle with two incredibly repetitive moves (light and heavy attack). I found myself fairly bored with many battles, despite still dying repeatedly, because the enemies just last way too long because of their artificially inflated health bars. I have never played dark souls so I cannot compare it to BMW. To compare it to other games it feels like any other action adventure game just played on the highest difficulty. And that's the biggest problem I have with this game: why would it have been so hard to put in a difficulty option and simply reduce or increase the bosses health for each level you choose?

The lack of difficulty options bothers me so much because it just makes me think of all of the people who gave up on this game, never even tried it, or just sped through it and missed so much side content and deep lore. Because that is where this game shines: the story is the reason I pushed through to the end. It is a ""sequel"", of sorts, to Journey to the West. The love the devs have of the source material is apparent in the beautifully crafted world, uniquely designed enemies and characters, and, most important, the masterfully told stories in the journal entries. Seriously, if you play this game: read the journal entries! They could be sold as a book on their own. If you really want to understand the story you must read the journal entries.

With so much love put into the story you would think they want people to experience it. Instead the artificially difficult bosses and slightly boring combat blocks many people from fully enjoying it or even being able to see it in the first place.

I understand this game is meant to be difficult but it still baffles me that the devs put so much into a story that so many people will not see or fully appreciate. It is because of this that I cannot recommend Black Myth: Wukong until a difficulty option is implemented (which will never happen).

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I could talk for hours and hours about this game, but I'll try to be brief.

It’s been over a decade since Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn graced our screens, and I can confidently say it’s still one of the most captivating MMORPGs out there. With each expansion, Square Enix has crafted a world so rich in story, gameplay, and community that it feels like coming home every time you log in.

The brilliance of this game lies in its balance: whether you're a casual player with only an hour to spare or a hardcore raider, the game welcomes you. Shadowbringers and Endwalker alone stand out as storytelling masterpieces, the former introducing the best villain and the most unforgettable character of the entire franchise, and the latter tying up loose ends in ways that are both emotionally satisfying and epic in scale.

Ever since FFXIV was turned into a ""theme park""-type of game, it amazes me on how approachable it has become. Once intimidating, the game now guides you through its vast content without overwhelming, thanks to user-friendly mechanics and an accessible level-up system. Whether you're into crafting, housing, or intense PvE challenges, FFXIV has evolved to accommodate every playstyle. You can even decide if to play solo with a party of NPCs, or with a group of friends, or other players. But the best part is that you don't even need to create alts as you can play every single job on a single character!

To those who might wonder if it's worth starting this long after launch—the answer is an unequivocal yes! The journey through Eorzea is one you'll never forget, and there’s never been a better time to join, since Dawntrail is the beginning of a new arc that promises another decade worth of adventures, laughters and tears.

Final Fantasy XIV doesn’t just age well; it gets better with time, and for me, it's definitely been a journey worth every hour spent in it.","Very Positive87% of the 71,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",talk hour hour brief decade fantasy realm reborn graced screen confidently s_emphasizedtill captivating mmorpgs major addition add feature mechanic square enix crafted world rich community feel home log brilliance lie balance casual spare hardcore raider welcome shadowbringers endwalker alone stand storytelling masterpiece former introducing best villain unforgettable franchise latter tying loose end way emotionally satisfying epic scale ffxiv turned theme park type amazes approachable intimidating guide vast overwhelming thanks user friendly mechanic accessible crafting housing intense versus environment challenge ffxiv evolved accommodate playstyle decide play solo party npc group friend player best alt play single single wonder worth starting long launch answer unequivocal yes journey eorzea never_forget never_been join dawntrail beginning arc promise decade worth adventure laughter tear fantasy age get definitely journey worth spent
2139460,Once Human,"So, first off. I loved the game at launch. I played it too the max, maxing out my memetics tree and level. I knew the restart was coming and I was ready. But they failed to mention several things. For one they said we'd be able to bring over gear and weapons but with the limited points you can only manage two and then you can't bring over any resources. It annoyed me but I pressed on into the new server. Imagine my surprise when I realized nothing new. I was under the impression that our blueprints would transfer over, and I thought the memetics tree would be filled with new blueprints but it's all the same and we have to unlock our blueprints all over again. The map is identical with no changes and the storyline is too. So what is the point of forcing us to start over? It'll literally be a repeat of everything we've done since the start. This whole concept makes no sense.

2300320,Farming Simulator 25,"TL;DR
I recommend you give the game a try before being swayed by the negative reviews of people complaining about the lack of mods. 
I am having a hard time putting this game down due to the immense amount of fun I am having. If you are waiting for patches to fix the graphical flickering, they aren't that distracting and immersion breaking. I say give it a go and support the  devs.

I find this game much better than the vanilla experience that you got in FS22, yeah a lot has changed with the store page; but I think it's easier to navigate than the previous ones. I haven't had any major bugs other than the graphical flickering that others have talked about before. I also find the graphics to be much more refined and detailed than previous Farming Simulators.
As for many saying it is just a re-skin of FS22 with mods, that may be true; but it's better than downloading a bunch of mods and hoping your game doesn't crash due to incompatibility or instability.  
The ground deformation (while not snowrunner levels of detail) is surprisingly accurate and truly impressive. I can attest that the tracks stayed on a 10 hour session and didn't disappear. Dirt, and mud buildup is a nice touch as well. 
There are a few things that could be fixed, such as the hyper reactive steering and a few little inconvenient, but not game breaking UI bugs that are common on nearly every game release (unacceptable from yesteryear's standards but commonplace nowadays) 
Regrettably, I have not tried the multiplayer features because that requires friends. Which if you are playing this as much as I am, you have none.
I haven't hooked up my wheel yet to comment on the physics as I am just using a controller right now.
The AI is much better and actually does what you tell it to do. I love the new steering assist mode and use that more than I thought I would initially.

Overall, I recommend this game to any Farming Simulator fanatic.

238960,Path of Exile,"This game is good for two kind of people: complete beginners, who just want to pick it up because it's free, and that will get through the campaign more or less casually. You might end up focusing too much on damage, and the game will tell you that defences are important too, which is fine. The other type that does well are the hardcore gamers, that still keep grinding 10+ years after initial release, and obviously have their fun. However, where it doesn't work so well, is when you are in the middle. With my main character I played through all 10 acts, and after getting killed a lot inbetween, I made my research, to see what defences I lacked, finding a way for me that somehow worked (getting HP up and elemental resistances in check). Now I am at the endgame map system, and although I really wanted to keep playing and exploring, I am not going to do it. The game has massive technical issues, with framerates dropping to a stutter show, as soon as too many enemies and too many spells are on the screen. Having turned down everything to the lowest possible settings, has helped a bit, but not fixed it. And in these situations especially it's critical that you are able to maneuver around, react to incoming damage, but sadly the game prevents exactly that when it's needed. The result is that you just keep dying, often in a one-shot-fashion. You look online again for answers, but end up seeing that you have to follow a specific build, need specific items, and that's where the fun stops for me. So, to play this game, either take it easy, or really go ""all in"".

Graphics: 2/2, looks perfect even after you tuned down everything to help with the stuttering. Nice variety in level designs, nice dark fantasy vibes inbetween with a LOT of gore.
Story: 1/2, tons of lore that doesn't lack complexity, but nothing gripping that would really pull you in. It's obviously not a story-based game.
Performance/Enjoyability: 0/2, due to the frequent framerate drops and one-shot-kills.

216150,MapleStory,"    After I have experienced SO much about Maplestory, from playing it since 9 years ago plus on various private servers, I think it is time to hit delete key and post a caveat for curious 12-year-old like you to see. This game does not hurt if you play with some friends. Honestly, being playing with friends is the only good way to play this game since they serve as a reminder that you still have a real life. Without such link to the reality, it is too easy to be sucked into the scheme of Maplestory that is deliberately, fundamentally created to exhaust both your mind and wallet
    Because remember: the philosophy of any MMORPG is to encourage competition between players strictly on the level of vanity and facile values, being how beautiful you look, how much money you have, how high damage can you hit...... Especially when you are lonely in the game, this emotion is easily ellicited because the game encourages so in any aspect. But the trick is, we all understand there is no ending to beautiful cash shop items and the amount of currency you possess, why can't we/I keep from not coming back to torture ourselves in the grinding and trading that ultimately lead to no real satisfaction?
    Because those game developers(e.g. Nexon) understand how pleasure works in us. What human desires is not a specific, final object, but a differential value through a growing experience. That is to say, pleasure is only gained through change; and after you arrive at a threshold, being it posed by the game or your brain, you are only left with emptiness. And this is when you want to start the loop again, again, and again. This is precisely why we only want to make MORE money, why we want to spend MORE cash items, and get MORE levels/damage without it ending at a specific number. This is why Nexon created so many new types of characters and jobs: they want to give you the pseudo-novel feeling each time you restart the experience, while in fact, nothing has changed about how your pleasure works. It's an everlasting loop.
    So instead of clicking the ""Play Game"" button. Why not think about something more valuable in your life? Whether or not you are willing to participate in this collective subconscious hell of pleasure looping is your own choice. If you really want to play, play it with friends. I am lonely, I don't have friends. Since I understand all these, I decide to quit.","Mixed63% of the 13,193 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"For all the hype around this game...It isn't all that great...
It's actually kinda crazy how much bias there seems to be in the reviews and the invisible walls are cancerous. This is a problem that's been solved for decades now. I know it's their first game, but I'm sure it's not the first game they've played. How they could test this and just think it was okay as is, is absurd to me. 
When I see a 96% review score on Steam, this is NOT what I'm expecting to play. Goes to show just how much bias reviews can have especially when it's it's a huge region of people who've really been wanting a break out success game. And the game still is pretty decent, but I personally wouldn't put it anywhere near the 96% score it's got on Steam. It's a solid 6-7.
And if you have a lower end GPU the score drops even further. First 2 chapters won't be much of an issue but upon hitting the 3rd, the already shakey FPS drops further. The problem isn't even the FPS because at times it can be great, it's the timing. Whenever it's having issues it stutters along and makes the overall movement feel terrible. 
I won't be refunding it YET, until I see what the first patch will look like. Hoping for some decent performance improvements and for something to be done about the horrid invisible wall situation. I love exploring, but I DO NOT like exploring when it means just dry humping everything hoping it's an actual path. For now I'm already at my 2 hour limit so won't be playing it at all until the patch and only if it has something of value.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Many of you may be determining if you are going to buy Nightingale or Enshrouded. Comparing the two may shed some light even for those who are not considering this. Check out my Nightingale review as well. 

Character creation for Enshrouded is quicker due to limited options. Choose a face and go, pretty much. Nightingale's may be more detailed but the faces are extreme; it's hard to get a look you like. Enshrouded also has a smooth start; you get right to fighting and base building is fast; like Nightingale, you can place blocks or walls, roofs, and floors, but you have way more options and even after placing you can alter a placed object block by block. However, Enshrouded's story is just lost. Mostly is learned through reading books as you go. I'm sorry, but this is just not immersive. 

What Enshrouded does right is crafting and base-building. Yes you can spend time on it, but its quick, fun and lets you get right back to exploring, questing, and fighting. New crafting stations are staggered, coming after you find a new NPC for your base. Nightingales is one crafting station after another (I'm at seven stations in my little stick house and this is my first day playing that game). 

Calling Enshrouded's combat soulslike is an insult to souls fans, but it is fun and engaging. I would say the worst part is that in the end, you will all worship the wand and leave behind your swords and bows. I find this sad. I can explain the 'why' of this, but it doesn't matter. Hopefully they will balance this. Nightingale's combat so far only requires getting the mob to lunge at you and side step, then wack a few times and repeat. Maybe it gets better but Enshrouded's doesn't have the same cumbersome feel as Nightingale's does so far.  

Consider this when choosing between these games, I spent the first few hours fighting and exploring in Enshrouded. I've spend the first few hours gathering resources and unlocking stuff in my stick house in Nightingale. However, Nightingale is stunning in its beauty and Puck pulls me in with constant narration. Enshrouded needs to fix its story telling and Nightingale needs to fix everything but its story telling. That said content is king. Neither game seems as replayable as I would like. So these guys have their work cut out, fix these problems, but keep that content coming, or you will lose that player base.","Very Positive85% of the 53,278 user reviews for this game are positive.",determining nightingale comparing shed light not_considering check nightingale creation quicker due limited option choose face pretty nightingale detailed face extreme hard smooth fighting base building fast nightingale block wall roof floor option placing alter placed object block block s_emphasizedtory lost mostly learned reading book not_immersive crafting base building yes spend quick fun let exploring questing fighting crafting station staggered non controlled artificial base nightingale crafting station seven station stick house calling combat soulslike insult soul fan fun engaging worst worship wand leave sword bow sad explain matter hopefully balance nightingale combat far requires monster enemy lunge side wack time repeat maybe get cumbersome nightingale far consider choosing game spent hour fighting exploring spend hour gathering resource unlocking stuff stick house nightingale nightingale stunning beauty puck pull constant narration need fix telling nightingale need fix telling king neither_game replayable guy cut fix problem lose base
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I have such fond memories of this game - playing through it was one of the very few bright spots to my 2020.  I anticipate returning to it at least every major patch / expansion to follow the story and experience the new content.

Pluses:
+ Great soundtrack
+ Story and characters will pull you in if you give it a chance
+ Class system is very flexible (just click a button to change class)
+ Combat is very ""active"" and feels fair even when attempting fights blind (outside of the hardest content)
+ Good amount of both combat and non-combat side content
+ Tons of cosmetic customization options
+ Personally ran into very few ""toxic"" players
+ Crafting is actually a pretty satisfying little mini-game

Depends:
+/- Basically zero class customization - my monk and your monk have the exact same abilities, passives, etc.
+/- Forced social interaction for dungeons, encounters, etc. to progress the story

Minuses:
- A Realm Reborn content (levels 1-50) is a bit lacking on the story front, and combat is pretty boring at low levels (starts getting more interesting around mid 20s)
- Sometimes the forced social interaction can ruin the magic for a new player when grouped with a jaded person who's seen this dungeon 50 times and just wants to get it over with
- It has a monthly fee?
- If you only play DPS and you don't have a tank/healer friend to queue with, you'll likely be waiting ~10-15 minutes to do dungeons etc.
- There's a nonsense system that distinguishes between classes and jobs that I believe is a relic of years gone by.  For example, you could start the game as a pugilist, then you eventually unlock the monk and you never play pugilist again since monk has all of the same abilities + more.

2582560,EA SPORTS™ Madden NFL 25,"DO NOT buy this game. I bought Madden 25 after not playing Madden for about 8 years. After 8 years I expected to see improvements in Madden's game play. I was wrong.The truth is that this franchise has gone completely downhill ever since it's glory days in the early 2000's. Madden 25 continues to feel like a beta version of what the game is supposed to be even 2 months into release. As it currently stands, the game is in a terrible state and the game feels absolutely unplayable at times. There have been many core game play issues that have needed to be addressed since release, but instead of fixing these issues EA spends all their time trying to sell ultimate team content. At this point, Madden isn't really a game, it's just a money pig for EA. Here are my biggest concerns with Madden 25:


(1) The AI Are Extremely Bad

AI blocking logic is horrendous and has been a serious issue since the game's release, yet EA has done basically nothing to fix it. Blocking logic is the number one issue with the game right now and absolutely needs to be addressed and improved. Additionally, AI defenders need to be VASTLY improved. 

i. AI simply do not block correctly in this game, especially offensive linemen (probably the most important people you want blocking). I have experienced many instances where offensive linemen simply do not even try to block a defensive tackle or defensive end. It is one thing to have a defensive lineman make a good move on your offensive lineman to get by. That I can understand. But, when a defensive lineman just walks right past your offensive lineman that I cannot understand. Part of the issue seems to be that sometimes offensive linemen will purposely and unnecessarily fail to block defensive AI/players when you have a running back set to pass block. Instead of blocking these defensive AI/players, offensive linemen will consistently choose to double team a defender even when doing so is clearly the wrong choice. Sometimes offensive linemen won't even double team a defender and will still let a defender run right through. Basically, offensive linemen's blocking logic overly-relies on your running back to block when it's not necessary. This should only happen when there are more blitzing defenders than there are offensive linemen. Needless to say running backs usually don't block as well as offensive linemen and don't last for more than a split second (unless you're lucky and your running back pancakes the blitzing defender). The result of the terrible blocking logic is that you will consistently experience unnecessary sacks and be unable to step up in the pocket to make throws.

Additionally, fullbacks and tight ends running in front of you on run plays will simply let linebackers run right past them and instead will focus on blocking someone in the secondary level rather than the immediate threat. This used to be worse but seems to have improved lately.

The quality of blocking also needs to be improved. Offensive lineman blocking quality is so bad that running the ball is overly-difficult even against a 3-man rush. Running the ball against a dime formation cover 4 drop when you have multiple tightends and a fullback on the field feels like trying to climb Mount Everest when it shouldn't. It's frustrating watching offensive linemen consistently struggle to block even small cornerbacks. If a cornerback comes into contact with offensive linemen who is run blocking I would expect the offensive linemen to push that cornerback onto the ground. Instead they get into a stalemate or the cornerback sheds the block. Never do offensive linemen actually win. Offensive linemen are just incapable of pushing forward on run plays. 

ii. Cornerbacks in man coverage need to be improved. To illustrate, know that I mostly play ultimate team. Thanks to a lot of luck and a lot of grinding, I have been able to accumulate all the best cornerbacks you can currently have in the game (Joey Porter Jr., Charles Woodson, Nate Wiggins, Night Train Lane). I also have a coach and strategy item which boosts the man coverage stats of my cornerbacks even higher. But even with all that, cornerbacks in man coverage are simply horrendous. There are two routes that are the core of this issue: zig/whip routes and corner routes. For some reason, zig/whip routes get open 100% of the time. It's even worse against man coverage. In my almost 1000 games of online play only once have I seen a defender successfully defend a zig route. Corner routes are not as bad but are still open basically 100% of the time against man coverage.

iii. AI defenders will walk instead of run when a defensive audible is made or an offensive player starts to motion. This leads to defenders blowing their assignments because they are not in the correct position when the ball is snapped. This is especially frustrating when a receiver motions and you watch your defender follow them, but your defender is walking at a snails pace. Sometimes defenders don't follow at all. If you're not manually using the defender assigned to cover that receiver you basically have to blow your own man/zone assignment to cover the motioning receiver. If AI defenders had a little bit more hustle when adjusting their position this wouldn't be as big of a problem as it is.

iv. Sometimes AI defenders won't react to balls thrown in the air. Sometimes a pass will fly right by a defender's face and the AI will just stand there and/or do nothing. This is especially true in man coverage. When a ball is thrown in the air against man coverage defense, the only AI defender who will ever react to the ball being thrown is the AI defender assigned to the targeted receiver. I understand that sometimes this should be the case as no defender should be 100% perfect. But, there are times where it should be completely obvious for an AI defender assigned to another receiver in man coverage to react to the ball. This allows players who make bad throws/decisions to essentially get away with doing so when they actually should be getting punished by having the ball swatted or intercepted. 

v. If you ever plan on using a defensive audible then you can also expect AI defenders to start spinning in circles when given a command. This is especially true when it comes to cornerbacks. If you ever tell your corners to give more cushion on their coverage assignment for example, they will back up and start spinning in circles trying to figure out where exactly to stand. This leads to corners getting smoked by their assigned receiver. It also means that if you try to press your corners sometimes they will begin walking in circles and cross the line of scrimmage which causes you to get an offsides penalty.

vi. Sometimes AI defenders do not line up correctly. Sometimes AI corners in man coverage will line up and shade to the outside/inside in violation of the play-call and when I never adjusted my coverage to do so. I've given up too many touchdowns because my AI cornerbacks randomly decided to shade outside or inside and I didn't notice until watching the replay. Fix it please.

(2) Glitches/Bugs

There are many bugs in this game but I will only cover the few I feel are important 

i. You can expect your camera/view to act extremely wonky. First of all, if you set a specific camera/viewing angle in your settings it will not actually save or apply in game. This is annoying because you cannot lock your preferred viewing angle and therefore cannot access the additional commands available to you when having your camera locked on a specific view. The camera also makes audibles a nightmare on offense. I play on wide view and almost every time I make an audible the camera zooms out so much that I cannot see the immediate area in front of me. Needless to say it is hard to play when I basically cannot see. It would be fine if the camera zoomed back into the current viewing angle but it gets stuck in this zoomed out state and there isn't anything you can do to fix it.","Mixed52% of the 1,549 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_buy bought not_playing 8 year 8 year expected improvement play wrong truth franchise completely downhill glory day early 2000 continues a_emphasized pre release version available testing version supposed 2 month release currently stand terrible state feel unplayable time core play issue needed addressed release fixing issue spends trying ultimate pig biggest concern 1 ai extremely bad ai blocking logic horrendous serious issue release basically fix blocking logic number issue need addressed improved ai defender vastly improved ai simply not_block correctly especially offensive linemen probably important blocking experienced instance offensive linemen simply not_even block defensive tackle defensive defensive lineman good move offensive lineman understand defensive lineman walk past offensive lineman cannot_understand issue offensive linemen purposely unnecessarily fail block defensive ai player running set pas block blocking defensive ai player offensive linemen consistently choose double defender clearly wrong choice offensive linemen double defender defender basically offensive linemen blocking logic overly relies running block not_necessary happen blitzing defender offensive linemen needle running back usually block offensive linemen last split unless lucky running pancake blitzing defender result terrible blocking logic consistently unnecessary sack unable pocket throw fullback tight end running front play simply linebacker past focus blocking someone secondary rather immediate threat worse improved lately quality blocking need improved offensive lineman blocking quality bad running ball overly difficult 3 man rush running ball dime formation cover 4 drop multiple tightends fullback field feel trying climb mount everest frustrating watching offensive linemen consistently struggle block small cornerback cornerback come contact offensive linemen blocking expect offensive linemen push cornerback onto ground stalemate cornerback shed block never_do offensive linemen win offensive linemen incapable pushing forward play ii cornerback man coverage improved illustrate mostly play ultimate thanks luck repeatedly performing action gain resource able accumulate best cornerback currently joey porter jr charles woodson nate wiggins night train lane coach strategy boost man coverage stats cornerback higher cornerback man coverage simply horrendous route core issue zig whip route corner route zig whip route open 100 worse man coverage 1000 game online play defender successfully defend zig route corner route not_as bad open basically 100 man coverage iii ai defender walk defensive audible offensive start motion lead defender blowing assignment not_in correct position ball snapped especially frustrating receiver motion watch defender follow defender walking snail pace defender follow not_manually defender assigned cover receiver basically blow man zone assignment cover motioning receiver ai defender bit hustle adjusting position big problem iv ai defender react ball thrown air pas fly defender face ai stand especially man coverage ball thrown air man coverage defense ai defender react ball thrown ai defender assigned targeted receiver understand no_defender 100 perfect time completely obvious ai defender assigned receiver man coverage react ball allows player bad throw decision essentially punished ball swatted intercepted v plan defensive audible expect ai defender spinning circle given command especially come cornerback corner cushion coverage assignment example spinning circle trying figure exactly stand lead corner smoked assigned receiver mean press corner walking circle cross line scrimmage cause offside penalty vi ai defender not_line correctly ai corner man coverage line shade inside violation play call never_adjusted coverage given touchdown ai cornerback randomly decided shade inside notice watching replay fix please 2 glitch bug bug cover important expect camera view act extremely wonky set specific camera viewing angle setting not_actually save apply annoying cannot_lock preferred viewing angle cannot_access additional command available camera locked specific view camera make audible nightmare offense play wide view audible camera zoom cannot_see immediate front needle hard play basically cannot_see fine camera zoomed viewing angle get stuck zoomed state fix

I don't blame them. This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that.
Take it from someone who 100% DbD twice. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.

Hell, let me teach you how:

You'll need:
-1 lb Bucatini pasta
-1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed
-8 oz sliced mushrooms
-1/2 onion, chopped
-2 cloves garlic, minced
-1/2 cup dry white wine
-1 cup chicken or vegetable broth
-1/2 cup heavy cream
-1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
-2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
-2 tbsp olive oil
-Salt and pepper, to taste

1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.

2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.

3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.

3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.

4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.

5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.

6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.

7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.

230410,Warframe,"Eh, it's ok. Gets a bit repetitive after some hours, and content recently either takes too damn long to be pushed out, or does not really meet players expectations. That being said, it's a solid hour dump and you'll find plenty of things to do as a new player. 

Warning, though. For the new players, the UI can be really confusing and some market stuff might make you falsely believe that you need to dump real money to get things like warframes and guns in the game, which couldn't be further from the truth. You can easily get blueprints for all weapons in clan dojos and craft them easily with materials you get from playing, and as for cosmetics, prime warframe and weapons, you can easily earn Platinum (premium in-game currency used in the marketplace and to rush stuff you craft) by either opening relics for prime parts which you use to craft said prime warframes or weapons, or outright selling it to other players for platinum which you can use for whatever you want, such as marketplace cosmetics, warframe and weapon slots, etc. The only exception is community made tennogen cosmetics which you can only get with real money. Trust me, first impressions can be misleading, but this is honestly one of the most fair f2p games in the market. Wouldn't waste my time with it otherwise.

And a little advice, don't blow that platinum as a new player on weapons and warframes, it's a ripoff because you can easily craft it yourself. And don't immediately blow it on cosmetics either. Keep it for weapon and warframe slots, you will need it.","Very Positive87% of the 598,811 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"The game is a real buy recommendation. I have to be honest, I would never have thought CD Projekt RED would release such a killer title. The large number of mods will make the game legendary for a long time to come, similar to GTA5.

Anyone who has played Deux Ex will love it. The world literally swallows you up and you just want to do that one quest or knock down the evil gang members on the street. Over time you notice how you get stronger and specialization gradually pays off more and more through super-powerful cyberware. The story is of course very well done and different possible answers produce different results, so there are multiple outcomes, violence is not always the solution. The graphics are of course an insanely massive smash hit, the different weather effects combined with the immersive world are a real feast for the eyes. Good gaming hardware is of course required.

In terms of gameplay, the open world feels like GTA5, the stealth factor like Hitman, the cyberware augmentations are very reminiscent of the game Restricted Area (2004), which you should also try out, it's really good. The perks and the general world setting are like Deux Ex Human Revolution.

Looting fun is of course not neglected either, but some enemies cannot be looted, no matter what angle you are standing at, the game crashed once, but that was it. It has been heavily optimized and is no longer as buggy as it was at release.

All in all, a very good game that I can only recommend. The game will give me many more hours of entertainment, because there is a lot to do and discover. The DLC: Phantom Liberty is also a must-buy, then the fun continues straight into the next round.","Very Positive84% of the 693,658 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

236390,War Thunder,"[h1]My History with War Thunder[/h1]
I've been playing War Thunder for about 4 years now (on and off due to not having a powerful enough PC) mainly before War Thunder came to Steam but steadily tracking the growth of the game. Back in the Golden Age of War Thunder, there was only air battles, no tanks, no helicopters, and no ships. Of course there were flaws with the game like the economy, RP (""research points"" to unlock new vehicles) gain and Silver Lion (main currency to purchase vehicles) gain, but despite these problems War Thunder was incredibly fun. Then Ground Forces were introduced to the game, grab a tank, queue up and duke it out. I was completely open to the idea of tanks being added to the game as long as it was done properly.

[h1]How I Feel About War Thunder Now[/h1]
Personally I believe this game is slowly being killed by Gaijin Entertainment, a few months ago we had a major update, Update 1.81 “The Valkyries” which adding many new helicopters, some top tier tanks which most people won't play unless they open the wallet, and 2 new planes for pilots, one of them just being nothing but a reskin. This is the first real bit of content plane pilots in the game have seen in a while. Air realistic battles or Air RB is probably the most popular game mode for planes which has been simply abandoned. There are flaws with it and many people try to let Gaijin know about these problems but they respond with an update releasing new premium tanks, and more top tier tanks which will take a new player an unbelievable amount of time to grind out. I like to think of Air RB as a former War Thunder YouTuber (theOrangeDoom) said is ""Gaijin's bastard child"", it has been forgotten. The game is unbelievably and unreasonably grindy without having to pay. If your response is ""well Gaijin's a company and they have to make money somehow"" your opinion just isn't wanted. There is a line that you don't cross where you're trying to make money to where you're trying to milk new players by keeping the hype train going and Gaijin have crossed it. A few days ago update 1.83 ""Masters of the Sea"" was released where ships and helicopters were put on the live server when a couple months ago they already released a major update. In my eyes Gaijin is just rushing updates to keep the hype train of more, and more, and more new content being released to drain new players of their money. Instead of fixing the problems they have they add more stuff, new tanks that you'll never be able to drive, ships that are just an absolute mess, and helicopters to go with that wonderful Challenger 2 or M1 Abrams that you'll never get unless you start filling their pockets while emptying yours.

[h1]My Conclusion[/h1]
War Thunder, once a game full of youthful energy and passion, has become a destitute husk of what it once was. With horrifically rushed updates that milk both new and old players of their money and flashy trailers of content only few will ever obtain (without a credit card) it has twisted what was once a wonderful game, into a stagnant pay to progess more than it has ever been, shitpile masked with the face of a shiny modern vehicle.

[h1]Update 1 - 2/16/2019[/h1]
Yesterday Gaijin released a development blog announcing Tier 7 and the Challenger 2. The problem with this is, there are an insane amount of holes in Tier 6 tanks, Tier 6 planes only came out a few months ago and Germany, Japan, Italy, and France are missing these aircraft. Not to mention the naval isn't finished due to Japan, Italy, and France not having these ships, also these four nations are lacking helicopters. It's like Gaijin is [b]trying[/b] to kill the game.

[h1]Update 2 - 2/19/2019[/h1]
Once again as Gaijin does they rush content and already announced a new jet. Although aircraft are widely requested due to Gaijin barely giving any attention to pilots, maybe fixing the game and all of its glaring issues is more important at the moment.

[h1]Update 3 - 5/16/2019[/h1]
I would like to comeback to this game eventually but even with all the criticism Gaijin gets about the game they fix none of the problems. Like the Leclerc they're working on now, no economy changes, no map changes, just wallet milking.","Mostly Positive72% of the 561,252 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I was a WoW player. I played every expansion, I did HC/Mythic raiding, I spent thousands of hours playing it. If I could go back and get this on launch day instead, I would do it in a heart beat.

If you are an MMO players, this  is hands down the best MMO on the market.  I've played every major MMO since Ultima Online back in the 90s. FFXIV has every element you could want in an MMO and executes them extremely well.

The class system, all classes being available on a single character, is amazing. No alts, not that you can't have them, you just don't need them.

The story is captivating, you actually want to read the quests and see what happens rather than just click through to get the objectives.

Speak of quests, there are a ton, even without the myriad of side quests, and only completeing the main story, you can reach level cap on a class. Then roll in dungeons, raids, leves, hunting logs, challenge log, etc etc etc there is never a shortage of things to do, and they have made all of them entertaining.

2300320,Farming Simulator 25,"Ouch!  I believed the fanboy hype and bought the game with a season pass. If you haven't bought it yet, I suggest waiting for Giants patches and more community content.  Currently, FS22 is more fun to play.

- Graphics problems persist.  They don't go away with time as suggested in some reviewers.  After a couple hours of trying different settings (PC with NVIDEA 3080) I still get flashes and rendering glitches. 
- Lack of content from FS22.  Many of the vehicles and functions (e.g. precision farming) are missing.
- Map issues on Hutan Pantai.  I've found more than a dozen large rocks with no collision.  If you fell trees in the area, they fall through the terrain.
- Odd economics.  The cost of constructing a structure from purchased materials is far more than just placing a similar completed structure.
- New NPCs are an experiment gone wrong.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"GTA Online, the jack of all trades game which does everything quite well while staying a safe distance away from all forms of perfection.  I currently have 4,617 hours of playtime logged in this game, most of it online or in the creator.  Once this game made it out on PC, complete with a first person viewpoint, I felt as though my lifelong journey of discovering an entire world which I could live in and do whatever I desired was finally becoming a reality.

I loved this game.  LOVED this game.  I've been playing since the top-down days of GTA 1, always dreaming of the time when I could experience this crazy alternate world 'from my own eyes.'

However, having spent this much time in the game leaves me with one conclusion:  I simply cannot recommend this game.  Not to anyone, not for any reason.  Not ever.

See, in a game which revolves around drugs, money, murder, and any manner of illegal activities, I kind of expect to be treated like a criminal inside of the game.

I do not expect to be treated like a crimial outside of the game by the sorry excuse they have for tech support.

On 08/29/17, well into week 3 of some amazing double payout bonuses and mere days away from the Smuggler's Run DLC, my few friends and I were spending many long hours playing away and racking up some serious money through all of our hard work.  However, Rockstar decided that it was time to run another sweep looking for people who mod, glitch, cheat, hack, or exploit their game.

Apparently it found very few of these people.  Instead, it found a whole bunch of us legitimate players.  Then it decided to punish us all wholesale, never once telling us why or how it came to this conclusion.  Better still, many of these people with modded money didn't get affected at all!

First we are met with a screen during the game's loading cycle stating 'we have determined that GTA$ and/or RP details on your account were adjusted by something out of your control and we have taken action to fix it.  No additional action is required from you at this time.'

Now, a lot of people will try to argue that they are completely legit 'except for that one time when...'  I am not one of these people.  I know what the public sessions are like in this game.  It's because of this that I had only ever played in closed or solo sessions until very recently, with the same one or two known and trusted friends, for most of my online time.  I had never played online on a console and had never transferred an online character.  I routinely took screenshots of my online bank account just in case some modder somehow managed to get through to me and mess with my hard-earned cash.

To this day I have yet to see a single glitched or modded GTA dollar go into my account.  I would know if it went there.  I do not place myself into situations where such a thing could happen and I keep a very close eye on what happens to my game.  In addition I've never modded nor glitched GTA money, myself.  I've never even duped a car.  Honestly, I don't even know how to do any of this stuff!

Rockstar apparently could not care any less about this as they had decided to 'take action' and steal $28,553,333 of my legitimate, hard-earned money.  Right out of the blue, no explanation given.  'Okay,' I think, 'their anti-cheat is confused with the double payouts we've gotten over these last few weeks.  They'll figure it out, this'll get sorted out, everyone who had their legit cash removed will get it back.'  There's quite a lot of us, too.  Look around the forums and message boards.  Tons of us.  Including about ten people whom I've just stared playing with mere days ago, which happens to be most of the people that I know in this game.

Sadly, this does not appear to be the case.  Rockstar's support number has a doofy automated thing saying to use their support website (which many of us have already attempted to use.)  Any attempt to mention this stolen money on said website will soon see the issue being flagged as being a 'cheat/exploit or banning issue.'  It may or may not also have an automated response from some soulless bot stating that ""Your shared bank account in GTA Online was adjusted to remove illegitimately gained in-game money.""  Then the trouble ticket will be closed.  End of story, slap across the face.  'You cheated, we corrected it, get lost.'

Like Hell!  Not ONCE have I EVER done anything in this game to cheat.  I HATE cheating.  Had any modded money been dropped onto me I would have told them about it in a heartbeat.  But Rockstar simply does not care about how legitimate we are.  They are always in the right, we as players are always in the wrong.  I'll probably never see that money back but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop sending them trouble tickets about it.  I'm currently sitting at number four.  They will keep hearing from me until they either fix their error or ban me.

Nowhere has there been any official word from them about this.  No 'we recognize that there was an issue' or 'we are currently looking into the matter.'  Nope, we're all dirty cheaters, go screw off somewhere else.  As if it wasn't bad enough that they find any way they can to deplete our online bank accounts through normal play, now they're outright stealing it from a lot of us!

All of the other rampant bugs in this game, both new and old, I could come to overlook (and there are quite a few of them!)  The increasingly forced public session play, the psychotic AI drivers, the ridiculous AI buffs, being called a 'cocksucker' by the NPC's hundreds of times during play (Rockstar must have a fascination with this word combination,) the list goes on.  I won't even get into the mess that is story mode.

This matter, however...  Now that I know who I am dealing with I am done purchasing anything with Rockstar's name on it.  Take 2 is in significant danger as well since their name is now associated with this title.  This kind of treatment of their playerbase is beyond unacceptable.  I can't even fathom how much of my time had been lost due to this, though if you consider that their most expensive Shark Card weighs in at $100 USD and gives you 8 million credits then they just stole nearly $357 USD from me because of this nonsense and there isn't anything in the world I can do about it.  (Except for sending them a bunch of trouble tickets and writing a negative review on Steam.  Power to the consumer, gorramit.)

I had worked my butt off in this game for every dollar which I had saved and spent.  I played it smart, made intelligent purchases, played the game the way it was meant to be played and did everything that I could do to protect myself and my belongings.  As it turns out someone did manage to mess up my account in the end, just not how I would have expected.

Grand Theft Auto receives two middle fingers way, way up.  If you've managed to avoid purchasing this game so far, congratulations!  Stay far, far away from it and its rampant toxicity.  If you already have purchased this and happened to experience a similar situation then I strongly encourage you all to join me in avoiding any of their games from this point forward while continuing to contact them through any means possible until they fix their broken crap and give us back our hard-earned money.

236390,War Thunder,"I have been an adamant supporter of Wargaming.net for several, several years. For the longest time I had this bias that War Thunder was a simple knock-off not worth my attention. In that time, I paid out to Wargaming in support of their efforts. Something changed recently that made me look into War Thunder, a change in Wargamings customer support policies that made me rethink my proposition of supporting that company. Not mentioning the issue here, I came over - very distraut mind you - to expect a horrible experience after many off-steam reviews that I read. Surprisingly, the steam reviews seemed to alter the opinion some.

Then, after downloading, I played the game. I was floored at how easy it was to get into, how much detail was spent on how an aircraft flies or a tank is destroyed. In World of Tanks, you have a typical health bar that dictates how much you can hit and what you can kill. Typically, people who fork out tons of money can get ""golden shells"" that help enhance that experience and one-shot players. In this game, however, I found that I - a regular, average joe - could one shot players. I found that I could actually get back into the game. I fell in love with it.

I admit that while players one shotted me - and often - that I felt somewhat iffed. Unlike World of Tanks, however, this game shows you *why* you were killed off. A detailed scene plays out showing how the shell penetrated your tank and the damaged it caused. Realistically you understand why you died, like I did. I'm not familiar with how real-life tank battles work - only theory - so based on that I understand the experience to be similar. To put it bluntly, I didn't feel *cheated* by the game when I died. The game told me *why* I died, *how* I died, and in some way even demonstrated *what I could do better* by the death scene as it played out. You watch it and literally go, ""Next time I should try this"", instead of in World of Tanks how I'd go, ""what happened?!"". 

In air combat mode, unlike World of Warplanes, you actually feel like you can shoot down planes two-times your better. There's even a reward for that in land combat mode! Everything feels fleshed out, and while they don't have a ""death scene"" for air combat mode (obvious reasons I'd say), you do get to see yourself shot down. There's a detailed, brief message on why you lost control of your plane. The reasons can reach from ""Pilot knocked out"", to watching a wing fall off and your crew whose still in full control as you press the fire button crash to their death. You *understand* why you died; to me, understanding why I died means a whole world of difference!

In conclusion, I feel that War Thunder has demonstrated itself to me in a way that feels familiar (World of Tanks) yet completely different. Instead of feeling in the dark when I'm shot down in air combat mode, I see explanations. Instead of feeling like I'm some piece of trash to be chewed and spit out in land combat mode, the game shows how I died and by contrast demonstrates what I could do better. I feel there's been a lot of attention to detaul placed into War Thunder that Wargaming seriously lacks in most of their games. I feel that, having played Warthunder in this short amount of time on Steam, I'm in love with it. No doubt that may change, but the feeling that the game isn't cheating me being gone plays a huge part in my new honeymoon phase.","Mostly Positive72% of the 561,252 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Didn't finish the game yet, but after 17h I can say for sure this one is already a cult classic, and just like with other classics, no one will be talking of the bugs and small discrepancies in 10 years, only of how you should have been there to see it, play it. Yes, it's just a game, there's so many things we could imagine and maybe one day get to play in a better way, but altogether it's not even close to bad like some people are screaming and atmosphere you get when you scratch the surface a bit deeper is amazing. Reminds me, in a way, of VtM: Bloodlines... and that's a good thing, even if it took mods and community patches to get that one into shape.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"Update 12/15/2022
A big season update hit, maybe it fixed things, I'll have a go at it again, they have to had fixed it right? Right? Of course not, I have done everything I can possibly think of, delete the game, redownload it, run as administrator, go into my BIOS and turn off XMP, run in safemode, scan and repair and nothing works, every time i scan this game it always says I am missing 28 files and will be ""reacquired"". I was actually enjoying 3rd person mode and I do want to play since there's nothing on the market that scratches the multiplayer itch quite like CoD does, I have seen that this is a problem that other people are having so I am not alone, I guess the only thing I can do is just wait for Infinity Ward to finish making this game, this beta is in a sad state...
Embarrassing is the best word to describe 2022 MW2. The rest of this review is what I published on launch day.

First and foremost the game is a technical mess, constant crashing and frame drops is a very common occurance. 

Single player campaign
Trash, just straight up trash, this is a stain upon the modnern warfare name. Everything that you loved about the 2009 MW2s campaign is gone and what is left has been replaced with soul-less boring drivel. I have seen the mission objective break multiple times so the only thing I can do is either wait and hope the engine corrects is self (dont hold your breath for that to happen) or to restart at a checkpoint. Do you remember in 2007 Modern Warfare's mission ""All ghillied up""? Remember where you have to crawl through the grass as enemies walk past you unaware of your presence? They brought that back multiple times and guess what, the enemes that walk by you can have this funny feature where they dont walk past you and instead just stare at you. Unmoving. Still. No animations, just looking at the patch of tall grass you reside in, which you will either need to jump up and try to kill all the enemies or just restart from checkpoint. I have seen enemies walk through walls, shoot through barricades and throw grenades that will no clip through the roofs of buildings. But Dyl, I can hear you think, how is the characters? Well you remember Commander Shepard? Yeah hes completely dull and uninteresting, you dont fight him at all, he isnt on the field like he was in 2009 grabbing Allen and throwing him into the fight screaming ""RANGERS LEAD THE WAY"", he is just a generic, dull NPC that monologues at you and midway through the story he just betrays you for no reason. Who wrote this? 


Multiplayer
God damn it, this is why we cant have nice things. Infinity Ward took what was improved upon in 2019 MW and threw it out the window. 

Perks? Wack. Now instead of the normal 3 perk you have a perk package where you have 2 perks that are on all the time like normal but the last 2 perks will unlock as you play in the match. Does that sound stupid? Of course it does, did the enemy get a UAV early in the game well thats OK because you have ghost on- oh wait since the game just started it isnt active and you show on enemies radars. Even the act of changing the perks is a chore because there is no drop down menu to change individual perks, want to change lets say scavenger to EOD? well you will need to select the class you want, go into perk package and change it from there and congratulations, now any custom class you had using that package no longer has scavenger. This is a completely unneeded change. 

Weapon progression? Wack. Lets take a fan favorite weapon, the MP5, what level do you unlock the MP5 at? You dont, you have to unlock it through one of the stupidest systems I have ever seen. Aight so follow me on this one, to get the MP5 you first need to get to level 16 to unlock the Lachmann-762 (the G3) and use it until the gun is level 13, this will unlock the Lachmann-556, using this, you need to get that gun to level 12 and now you have the Lachmann sub (the MP5). Do you want to use the M16? Oh boy the M4 is a starting weapon, so just use that until you get it to level 18 where you unlock the 556 Icarus which is an LMG and plays completely different, get that LMG to level 13 and then you can play with the M16. Why? Who thought that unlocking weapons was just too streamlined and easy that they needed to screw it all up? Why? This is completely unnecessary.

Weapon attachments? Wack. Pst, hey you, yeah you. Want to use a specific attachment and a max level M4? Well get bent lmao, because specific attachments are tied to specific weapons. An example: lets take the Vel 46 (the MP7) and lets say you want to throw a Cronen Mini Pro red dot sight on there, thats a pretty good sight. Well you cant use it on anything until you get the expedite 12 (M4 shotgun) to level 7. And this is the way you unlock weapon attachments, why? Hell if I know, but this is mind numbingly tedious to do.

Menus? Wack. This game was designed to look like a cheap mobile game and its just sad it in a AAA development game, come on, you can do better than this. 

Maps? Not exactly very good, the majority of them are just ok where as there are 2 specific maps I straight out refuse to play and those are the border crossing map and Taraq, those 2 dumpster fires need to be deleted and never spoken of ever again. 

Edit: I forgot to mention Spec Ops. Uh... well theres only 3 of them so... they're ok, but they're a play once, get 3 stars and forget they exist type deal.


TL;DR do I recommend this game? No, but seeing as im past the 2 hours for a refund, I might as well get what I paid for and play it. I aint gonna enjoy it that much, but theres nothing I can do about it. This game simply isnt finished, i can only hope that its a better game eventually. This game certainly is not worth 70 to 100 bucks.

Update: 11/26/2022
I upgraded my PC to better smoothly run this game, now it doesn't even launch and forces my PC to restart every time I run this without an error messages, no other game does this to me. This is sad.

2139460,Once Human,"I ignored a lot of the negative reviews here assuming that they were just fearmongering, however, since installing this game, I've noticed 2 new mysterious apps in my startup programs (Which have been disabled now) that have no file location. So this game gets a negative review for making me fear now for my PC's security after installing it (It has been henceforth uninstalled).

EDIT: I've received comments on my profile asking what these files are and how to remove them. The startup files are a single digit number, and a string of hexadecimal numbers/letters.

Now apparently these are non-malicious are are just it keeping track of your installs of their programs and your ID on their systems, but it's done in a super suspicious way so, for people like me who are worried about having this stuff on your computer, I got rid of it by doing a full system restore of my computer to before I'd installed Once Human.

You can apparently also get rid of it at in file explorer at Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
by deleting the AF_Counter and AF_uuid, but that path didn't lead anyway for me when I tried it, but if it works for you, great, and apologies for not adding this addendum sooner.","Mostly Positive71% of the 104,699 user reviews for this game are positive.",i_emphasizedgnored negative review assuming fearmongering installing noticed 2 mysterious apps startup program disabled no_file location get negative fear pc s_emphasizedecurity installing it_emphasized henceforth uninstalled received comment profile asking file remove startup file single digit number string hexadecimal number letter apparently non malicious are_emphasized keeping track installs program id system super suspicious worried stuff computer rid restore computer installed apparently rid file explorer computer hkey_current_user software microsoft window currentversion deleting af_counter af_uuid path lead anyway tried work great apology not_adding addendum sooner
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"OpenIV fiasco aside...modding aside... cause we all know you guys f***ed up with that..

But, what really bothers me and alot of people is the unrealistic and downright criminal prices you expect people to pay for your Shark Cards. $100 real money for $8Million in-game cash.

When every new DLC costs $25Million-$40Million if you want all the vehicles, upgrades, unlocks..etc..etc WTF good is $8Million?? Your price structure on everything from Shark Cards to Merch is bizarre and unbalanced - if you wonder why people mod and manipulate your game, its because nobody enjoys being blatantly ripped off.

Irony here, when the 'ripping off' got to much for you guys, you threatened the very same people that mod your game to enhance it and who, at the same time, put food on your table and keep you with a job.

STOP ripping off your customers and instead of fighting, why not listen to the community - expand the single player experience with some kind of worthwhile DLC, like people have been begging for. Why not make servers that welcome modders and people that enjoy enhancing the game and getting even more value for money.

and..for gods sake..STOP charging criminal-esqe, exorbitant prices for your poor value Shark Cards... ugh.. just STOP, we are all embarrassed for you over the shameful greed you've shown...and continue to show~

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I am not sure where to begin. So heres my review for the game. 
This has been by and large the best story game experience and community experience and mmo experience of my life.
I grew up on world of warcraft. Got married and tried to get the misses into gaming. We played around on a few new mmos and what not. 
But we settled on WoW. And let me tell you i regret it. Game is not made for the players or player base, community is toxic in my experience, it was different. 

Now me being a long time FF fan, i felt pulled to this game and as many experienced players will say it is a drag at the start. 
But thats just it...its just the start. The game itself is indescribable, how i felt attached to it, the world, the characters. 
The game play feels slow at first but absolutely picks up later in. Its massive, MASSIVE! so much to do and see. easily hundreds of hours can be to exploration, crafting, side quests, events for holidays. Did i mention the story? It is not something you skip! It is all entirely relevant and is such an experience to behold. This game on first release was a bust but has since come back...the game even has in its story the fall of the first game and resurgence or the realm being reborn. I laughed many times, i cried, i felt.

Graphics: 7/10 Its not ugly but its not triple A, easy enough to find ways to ""help"" it online
Game play: perfectly balanced, every class is relevant, every crafting is fun. love it 10/10
World building 100/10 Its the single best story i have experienced in my life
music: 10/10 Some absolutly beautiful peieces
Character development: 9/10 some things are predictable but overall every thing is relevant. 


I cant praise this game enough. And the fact that the first 2 expansions are free, entirely free to try. 

If you haven't give this game a go. Find friends, Join a free company and just play music, exchange stories around the hearth and fire, defeat gods or go fishing. 

10/10 reccomend


Edit: if you have ever played an mmo and feel like your behind and your not current and missing out. This is for you. You are never truly pressured to rush to end game, you will experience everything, the game ties all old content in to still be playable, you dont struggle to find parties in the game. Everything is relevant so take your time, take breaks and come back when you want to.","Very Positive87% of the 71,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_sure here large best community massively multiplayer life grew world warcraft married tried miss gaming mmos not_but settled wow regret not_made player base community behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner different long ff fan pulled experienced player drag thats it_emphasizeds indescribable attached world character play feel slow pick massive_emphasized easily hundred hour exploration crafting side quest event holiday mention not_something skip entirely relevant behold release bust fall resurgence realm reborn laughed time cried graphic 7 10 not_ugly not_triple easy way help play perfectly balanced class relevant crafting fun love 10_emphasized world building 100 10 single best experienced life music 10_emphasized absolutly beautiful peieces development 9 10 thing predictable relevant cant praise 2 expansion entirely friend join company play music exchange story hearth fire defeat god fishing 10_emphasized reccomend massively multiplayer not_current missing you_emphasized never_truly pressured rush tie old playable dont struggle party relevant break

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"I think that the best way to describe this game is by saying that it gave me the feeling I've been wanting Final Fantasy to give me for the past years. Before Metaphor I didn't remember how badly I craved a game that had so much of the JRPG soul presented in an interesting and fresh way. 

Pros:
- Fun turn-based combat
- Archetype (job) system which is very flexible and feels fun to play with
- Very interesting worldbuilding with lots to see
- Diverse and endearing cast of playable characters
- Visual presentation is great
- Has incredible pacing with essentially no bloat or filler content, which is rare for a JRPG these days unfortunately
- Fast-moving storyline that keeps you wanting more at every moment
- Progression (both combat-wise and story-wise) feels really smooth and satisfying, not much of a grindfest
- Perhaps the most detailed and impressive menu interface I have ever seen in a game
- Overall a breath of fresh air amongst modern JRPG releases

Cons:
- Only has partial voice acting, doesn't bother me much but it could definitely be fully voiced
- While the story is good and enjoyable, it isn't the most original story ever, relies on some familiar JRPG clichés. This doesn't take from the enjoyment of the game though as none of the plotpoints are badly executed.
- Side dungeons are fun at first but end up feeling quite sameish by the end of the game.
- As much as I love the game, it definitely is not worth 70€

I say that the game is not worth it's full price from an objective standpoint, but at the end of the day we play videogames for fun. And quite honestly, Metaphor: ReFantazio is bound to be a lot of fun for anyone who resonates with the points I detailed. Play the demo, and if you like it, I'd say get the game! Because it definitely gets even better after the point the demo locks you out at :)

As someone who wasn't too impressed by FF16, Metaphor really did hit the mark on everything I hoped that game would be. A fun and compelling game will always feel better to play than a visually impressive game, because personally that is not what I am looking for in video games.","Very Positive91% of the 10,386 user reviews for this game are positive.",best describe saying gave feeling wanting final fantasy past year metaphor remember badly craved jrpg soul presented interesting fresh pro fun turn based combat archetype flexible feel fun play interesting worldbuilding lot diverse endearing cast playable character visual presentation great incredible pacing essentially no_bloat filler rare jrpg day unfortunately fast moving storyline keep wanting moment progression combat wise wise feel smooth satisfying not_much grindfest perhaps detailed impressive menu interface breath fresh air amongst modern jrpg release con partial voice acting bother definitely voiced good enjoyable t_emphasizedhe original relies familiar jrpg clichés t_emphasizedake enjoyment plotpoints badly executed side dungeon fun feeling sameish love definitely not_worth 70 not_worth price objective standpoint play videogames fun honestly metaphor bound fun resonates point detailed play demo definitely get demo lock someone t_emphasizedoo impressed ff16 metaphor mark hoped fun compelling play visually impressive personally not_what video game

Hi, I'm XTS and my best attempt at a review is this:


I love it. It is adorable to look at. The characters are adorable. You can quickly gather things and change your hand held tool quickly. Cooking is a bit wonky but it could always be worse. 

You get rewarded for doing things you enjoy doing. You like to farm? There's farming.
You like to gather, there's that. Cooking is also there but you're auto picker isn't best so it's a lot of single  manual made dishes. I wish I could click and say ""make 5 of these"" but I can't. So far it's one at a time.

The characters may stand on top of each other when you exit a building. 

They love to watch you fish and if you ever wondered the definition of a photo bomber, just pull out your camera.  You can hit T to get a bigger picture (full screen picture).

The game is kinda magical, imho.

This game was gifted to me because I really wanted it and this sweet soul got it for me (and it wasn't even on sale & I'm big on sales. I am so thankful~!) 
You can customize some things about your clothing, like patterns on your Mickey Ears. Pattern on your shirt. I'm still early on and am taking my time but there's so much about this game that is therapeutic and relaxing and encouraging that I can't recommend it enough.  There's some guides online and better reviews than this.

2429640,THRONE AND LIBERTY,"TL is a decent MMO, but it has quite a lot of problems.

The character customization is in-depth, and you can create some unique-looking characters (I wish there was also a voice slider, as your character sounds like a generic K-pop star). 

The leveling is pretty fast, you get to the level cap in a couple of hours just following the main story quests and doing some side-quests at certain levels (which is a bit of a shame, as the game rushes you to the end-game, which for PvE isn't all that compelling). The main story is by the numbers, doesn't make sense, and the voice acting is hit-and-miss (some VAs are ok, others are pretty bad, but the biggest problem is there was no directing as some actors just read the lines without the proper intonation). Visually speaking, the cutscenes are well crafted and look high quality (plus, after you get your room at the inn, you can replay all of them from a book). The side-quests are generic for the most part—kill X, collect Y—but at least they don't overstay their welcome.

The combat system feels a bit clunky/not very responsive, and it is annoying at times as it's hard to make your character attack the desired mob (the action combat system is poorly implemented and not very well thought-out). Also, traversing the world can be annoying, as sometimes your character just doesn't use the grappling mechanic in time, and you end up falling, needing to redo some sections. Your character also uses the vault animation for anything that's not at ground level, even small rocks, and you are not invulnerable, meaning you can get hit. Plus, it's a bit time-consuming, and changing form is also not very responsive, especially gliding. You have 3 travel forms, and you can unlock different skins for them through gameplay, but there are also some bought from the cash shop. There are also morphs (shapeshifts) unlocked in certain zones after completing quests in those zones that make you neutral to the mobs there, making exploring a bit less of a hassle.

It's a shame that changing gear and skills is not very easy, as you need to decide on what build you want to use before starting the game. The skill books and upgrade materials are not as plentiful after using those you get from completing the story. Still, for now, you get books that can be used to transfer skill levels.

The dungeons are somewhat challenging at max level, but the most challenging aspect is the other players. Some are plain and simple cunts, they just don't want to do all the mechanics and try to cheese most fights (which would be great if cheesing would save you time), but for the most part, the boss fights just take longer, and making mistakes while cheesing is a lot more punishing than actually doing all the mechanics correctly (also, never use Party Matchmaking as there are no restrictions put in place, and you can queue for any role with any gear, meaning you can get tanks that can't hold aggro or healers that have no healing skills). Another method of getting into a dungeon would be using the Party Board, but it's poorly implemented as the results are not updated in real time and you could apply to a party that has already been delisted or had the requirements modified, so it can take some time before entering a dungeon.

Getting gear is based on RNG, which was somewhat expected, but you also have a limit on how many dungeon chests you can open per day (you get 900 Dimensional Contract Tokes daily, and you need 300 per dungeon chest at level 50, and they stack for a maximum of 4500). You can also run public dungeons (you spend Abyssal Contract Tokens to get better gear and EXP) and events that also have a rare chance of dropping some purple gear, but it's still based on luck. You also have daily quests to earn money and crafting/upgrading materials. Furthermore, you have some companions you can send on missions to farm crafting reagents for you. You can also buy the gear from the cash shop by using real-life money (Lucent), so the game's a bit P2W/pay to progress a lot faster (also, buying a piece of gear can cost anywhere from 1000 to 7000 Lucent, which is insane). Lucent can also be earned by selling your gear at the Auction House, but only purple gear has true value. There are also Precious Blessing Pouches that can be bought with Ornate Coins (obtained through world exploration and various events), but the RNG is again involved, meaning there's a high chance you won't get the desired items from them.

The open world is seamless as there are no loading screens and teleports are almost instantaneous (loading screens are masked by some transitions, like opening a door, but are not noticeable). The open-world events come in 2 varieties, either PvE or PvP, For now, I've only opted for the PvE events, as I don't have all the gear pieces I want, but the level 50 bosses are getting obliterated in a matter of seconds, so there's no real challenge, it's mostly a waiting game as they spawn at certain hours. The collecting events scale your stats down if you are at the max level, which makes things a bit fairer. Also, the open-world dungeons have PvP enabled at night, if you want an extra challenge.

The guilds are one of the most important parts of the game. It's useful to join one, as most of the end-game PvP is centered around guild sieges, plus you also earn rewards by doing guild activities and donating gold/materials to the guild. For now, I haven't participated in any guild fights, so I can't comment on that.

The cash shop has some ridiculously priced costumes (almost 25 EUR), buying 500 Lucent is 10 EUR, so not very cheap. There's also a battle pass, with a free track that offers some free upgrade materials and whatnot, and a premium 10 EUR track that offers much more valuable upgrade materials. The Lucent packs also come in sizes that encourage you to overspend, as the coins you get are not enough to get what you want.

The performance is OK for the most part, there's some lag when a high number of players are present and there are a lot of skill effects on the screen (but the requirements present on game's page are kinda misleading, I feel you need a beefier rig to run the game smoothly). Also sometimes opening the map (or any other menu for that matter) takes a second or two, and feels unresponsive.

Overall, it was a fairly enjoyable experience, but I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. It can be fun for a dozen hours or so, but it becomes a bit stale after a while, and running the same dungeons and events or doing all your dailies isn't very rewarding. Hopefully, they'll add more fun stuff to the game in the future and maybe ease up on changing gear restrictions (maybe implement a system where you level up your skills and weapons by using them like in other MMOs, as there are already enough ways to spend real-life money on this game).","Mixed68% of the 51,674 user reviews for this game are positive.",tl decent massively multiplayer online problem customization depth unique character wish voice slider sound generic k pop star leveling pretty fast cap couple hour following quest side quest certain level bit shame rush versus environment compelling number sense voice acting miss va ok others pretty bad biggest problem no_directing actor read line proper intonation visually speaking cutscenes crafted high quality plus room inn replay book side quest generic kill x collect overstay welcome combat feel bit clunky not_very responsive annoying time hard attack desired monster enemy action combat poorly implemented not_very thought traversing world annoying grappling mechanic falling needing redo section us vault animation not_at ground small rock not_invulnerable meaning plus bit consuming changing form not_very responsive especially gliding 3 travel form unlock different skin bought cash shop morphs shapeshifts unlocked certain zone completing quest zone neutral mob exploring bit hassle shame changing gear skill not_very easy decide build starting skill book upgrade material not_as plentiful completing book transfer skill level dungeon somewhat challenging max challenging aspect player plain simple cunt mechanic exploiting mechanic strategy gain unfair advantage fight great cheesing save bos fight longer mistake cheesing punishing mechanic correctly never_use party matchmaking no_restrictions queue role gear meaning tank hold aggression aggressiveness healer no_healing skill method dungeon party board poorly implemented result not_updated real apply party already delisted requirement modified entering dungeon gear based rng somewhat expected limit dungeon chest open per 900 dimensional contract toke daily 300 per dungeon chest 50 stack maximum 4500 public dungeon spend abyssal contract token gear exp event rare chance dropping purple gear s_emphasizedtill based luck daily quest earn crafting upgrading material companion send mission farm crafting reagent you_emphasized gear cash shop real life lucent bit p2w pay progress faster buying piece gear cost anywhere 1000 7000 lucent insane lucent earned selling gear auction house purple gear value precious blessing pouch bought ornate coin obtained world exploration event rng involved meaning high chance desired item open world seamless no_loading screen teleports instantaneous loading screen masked transition opening door not_noticeable open world event 2 variety versus environment versus opted versus environment event gear piece 50 boss obliterated matter second no_real challenge mostly waiting player enemy enter world certain hour collecting event scale stats max make thing bit fairer open world dungeon versus enabled night extra challenge guild important part useful join versus centered guild siege plus earn reward guild activity donating gold material guild participated guild fight comment cash shop ridiculously priced costume 25 eur buying 500 lucent 10 eur not_very cheap battle pas track offer upgrade material whatnot premium 10 eur track offer valuable upgrade material lucent pack size encourage overspend coin not_enough performance ok s_emphasizedome delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection high number player present skill effect screen requirement present page kinda misleading beefier rig smoothly opening menu matter take feel unresponsive fairly enjoyable wholeheartedly recommend it_emphasized fun dozen hour bit stale running dungeon event daily rewarding hopefully add fun stuff future maybe ease changing gear restriction maybe implement skill weapon mmos already way spend real life

1790600,DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO,"This game is an unbalanced mess, and i'm not talking about the characters. Where BT3 managed to find A way to balance the broken characters with good/fair system mechanics, Sparking Zero fails to do so. The core issues with them currently are:
-Lack of Ki Sickness (Why was this removed???)
-Super Counters being TOO easy to perform. They're incredibly easy in this game compared to BT3. This kills any reward you get from winning neutral and opening your opponent up as majority of combo's will quickly lead into A super counter by the opponent and then A vanish battle.
-Vanish battles are incredibly easy with laughable timing making them just A ki check. I don't understand why the Vanishes don't even get harder to do the more they go on, and they last so long its just boring to deal with. Why did they not do what the BTdid and increase the speed of each vanish? The BT4 mod even expanded on this by having A quick QTE mini game after 5-6 Vanishes to not kill the momentum of the match.
-Blast stocks fill up ridiculously fast allowing moves that give you instant sparking or evasive moves like Afterimage Strike (This move is not hard to beat, the system mechanics just make it annoying to deal with) to practically always be active.
-Dragon Dash homing being instant instead of having A delay like in BT3. While this move is not hard to beat it is incredibly obnoxious and kills A good portion of the neutral play in this game
-Special inputs refusing to come out after grabs, super counters, ect ect despite having the specials menu open and instead performs A vanish (this was not an issue in BT3)
-Sparking Ki blast spam. It quite literally makes you unable to play the game once locked down and has very minimal counterplay, some characters outright can not do anything about it depending on who they are fighting against.
-The garbage lock on system that forces you to lock off whenever an enemy hits you with an ult and then refuses to lock back on for atleast 10 seconds no matter how close the enemy is to you.

And that's not even mentioning the lackluster story mode, the lack of rage quit penaltys in ranked, the no ""accept opponent"" button for matchmaking which sometimes keeps you in A loop against laggy players, Save data randomly being deleted, the input issues such as ki continuously charging, and the random blur that will happen on screen. Heck, sometimes the game will play the anime music even when you have it disabled lol

This game is fun with friends and it looks great for sure, but for A product meant to be the successor to BT3 it fails hard. It feels like an open beta, and the price tag is ridiculous considering the amount of issues it has.

But they refused to compensate me, saying they couldn't find anything strange in their logs. Rather, they said that if you keep providing false information, you'll be punished strongly. Then, they closed the agenda obstinately. I really loved this game, but now I feel betrayed. I would never recommend it. There are so many bugs in this game and no compensation for the victim.

The game is super choppy and everything is part of dlcs which cost an arm and a leg. Half of the game is locked until you spend 500 dollars on dlcs. Also there is no autosaving and to play you have to download other software. The game is prone to random crashes and since there is no autosaving if you dont constantly save you can lose hours of work. I played the game for 2 hours and then a random crash made me restart at square 1. Was fun the 1st time but definetly wont be fun the second time.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"Dragon Age have always suffered from a lack of consistency between installments in the series. DA2 was not a continuation o DAO, and DAI was not a continuation of DA2. At this point, it is more so an anthology of vaguely connected stories with very different genres and mechanics. I only played for about an hour and a half, so I can not speak on the overall story. 

However, I can talk about the writing in dialogues, which was atrocious. There is a lot of talking without saying anything or reaching a point (other than chasing line numbers?), and hand-holding. The visual style is my biggest gripe - the characters look cartoonish, the environments like low-budget sci-fi animations, and the combat like a rave.

What I did like was character creator, where I saw a lot of improvements, and that one scene just before the opening credits when [spoiler]Solas is facing off the other two gods[/spoiler]. But that's not enough to make me force myself to endure the boredom further. 

In short, this feels like playing a fairytale retelling for children, rather than the adult fantasy game that DAO, ergo the best received game of the series, was.","Mostly Positive71% of the 24,035 user reviews for this game are positive.",age suffered lack consistency installment series da2 not_a continuation dao dai not_a continuation da2 an_emphasizedthology vaguely connected story different genre mechanic half not_speak talk writing dialogue atrocious talking saying reaching chasing line number hand holding visual style biggest gripe character cartoonish environment low budget sci fi animation combat rave creator saw improvement scene opening credit spoiler solas facing god spoiler not_enough force endure boredom short feel fairytale retelling child rather adult fantasy dao ergo best received series

1085660,Destiny 2,"Fun shooter especially with friends, but the developers clearly do not understand how to get new players to stay. 
There are so many paywalls and the story is really hard to make sense of since you're thrown around to completely different campaigns randomly when starting the game. A lot of the story is hidden behind season (passes) so you also miss extra information that is quite relevant to the story, so next update comes and you're left wondering what the heck is going on. You can't just proceed through the timeline as it is and instead get spoilers about the story in every possible way. 

How about an option to force the game to follow the main storyline in order?

They release new content and then they make old content useless. My inventory is filled with items that say they're completely safe to delete, so all that hard work to gather them is rendered useless. They don't want you to progress too fast.

Never buy the DLC for full price. It's just not worth it. This has been an issue since Destiny 1. They originally cut off a lot of main story content and sold it off in DLC's. Actually, long before the DLC's were made available people were able to glitch into the DLC areas that were fully available in the base game, but were activated when you bought DLC. They then released Taken King and forced you to buy the whole game + DLC's again for full game price rather than allowing old players to buy just the DLC for cheaper. They then released the game currency and now you can spend at least 20€ to buy single armor skins or even more to unlock seasonal content during the year.

To fully enjoy the game you'll have to be prepared to spend hundreds on this game each year.

427520,Factorio,"Probably my favorite game of all time.

Factorio is the closest video-game approximation for real-world engineering I've ever seen.

Build a small factory to produce something useful.
Let part of it get eaten by aliens.
Build a second factory to produce something else.
Realize you've outgrown your first factory so rebuild it.
Get killed by aliens again.
Build a second base, this time with turrets.
Build some train tracks to connect them.
Spend half-an-hour figuring out why your factory isn't producing anything.
Build some robots to do your bidding.
Realize that robots are way faster than conveyor belts.
Rebuild your base to maximally rely on robots.
Realize that robots aren't actually faster than conveyor belts.
Rebuild your base again.

2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"I just finished the game and it's a solid 9/10! I had a great experience!

I never thought I would enjoy what seemed to be like a souls-like combatwise, but the game was much more than that. Rather than the sluggish, slow pace of souls-likes, Wukong is fast-paced, dynamic and fun from the go. As you advance, you get more tools in the form of spells, transformations, items, etc. to tackle the hardest of opponents. The gameplay is an immense joy from start to finish.

I had some issues following the story, as I know next to nothing about the legend of Sun Wukong. The game is an imagined sequal to Sun Wukongs legacy, so I would say knowing about it beforehand will elevate the story for you. That being said, the chapter stories are well told and executed and carried some emotional weight as well. 

World and feeling is amazing. The game looks beautiful and it ran well on my four year old rig. I had to tune some settings, but the game ran at 80-100+ fps at all times - and looked stunning, even with some settings turned way down. A downside about the game world is first of all a lack of a map - there are so many areas, secret ones included (I managed to finish them all with A LOT of backtracking). The areas have lots of invisible walls and it's not always clear where you are ""allowed"" to go or not. Other games border the play area a lot better and more clearly. 

The game (side content included) was just shy of 50 hours, which is absolutely worth the money imo. I've yet to go New Game+, but I know that it has more (new) items, spells, etc. and could be a fun romp. 

I highly recommend this game :-)

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"8/10 Rainbow six siege is a damn fine shooter 

BUT that doesn't mean its perfect so im gonna explain whats good & whats not 

-whats good? 

Most of the time shooting in this game seems very fun and balanced unless its a relatively new operator that was just added (more on that topic soon) 

the game rewards map familiarity, some maps can have destructible floors, walls and ceilings which makes it highly rewarding to go into custom games and learn them on your own.....speaking of which 

custom games! this is such a blessing to have if you really want to take your skills to the next level, also it may help you study any new dlc maps so you can at least know what you're about to get yourself into this season 

Free dlc!!!! finally a decent shooter that doesn't seem like all the devs want is money. yes there is cosmetics in game but nothing like ""pay to win"" but most members of the siege community may disagree with me due in part with the events that happen usually half way through the season (there are 4 season through the year, so you get 8 new ops per year and usually a new map and possibly a new rework on older maps to make them ""better"") each event is different than the last one minute you are carebears shooting each other the next you are rootin tootin shootin cowboys (at least from what the data miners have found) but they have loot boxes that you must buy at least 50 dollars of if you want All the cosmetic for the event in question 

this game heavily requires communication and strategy. Every single operator on the rainbow six team differs from the others, one places bear traps that downs enemies, another has a infra-red sniper scope that can pierce through thick smoke and highlights enemies making it much easier to get distance kills but with that there is weaknesses. the bear traps can be shot to be destroyed and are fairly easy to spot due to how massive they are. the sniper glaz is a powerhouse but when you take a slow sniper against smgs that can shoot faster than you can make a bowl of popcorn, you need to make sure you keep a distance and use recoil against them but also make every shot count one miss could mean it all. 

there is an operator for everyone.
you like being slow and able to take some damage? we have that. you can play as fuze who releases a cluster bomb of grenades in a small area that can pinch off the enemy team if placed right. or as doc who heals your team with stimulant shots. 

you like being faster than god itself? play ash shes a fast operator that rewards the run and gun style plus her ""gadget"" is a grenade launcher that allows you to blow away any soft walls that lay in your wake. or as bandit whos able to place car batteries on barbed wire making them electrocute anything that may cross as well as add electricity to any reinforced walls. 

or how about a nice mix? you have twitch who can take her drone around and remove enemy's gadgets, cameras and can even inflict damage on the enemy team. or you may play as frost (the bear trap operator). 

there is pve as well but its very lacking but it does exist 

the devs are also very quick to fix MAJOR bugs in game.

but my favorite thing about this game is the content creators, they all are very fun loving guys and gals and they help support this amazing community. 

-whats bad? 

there is moments when ranked play can just feel like udder crap, toxicity is very common in this game most time its just bland dry sarcasm or humor that can be taken the wrong way. 

new operators are kinda always broke when they first release but are usually fixed not too long later but other times its too long 

this game has a high learning curve 

headshots are instakills! sometimes it will feel unfair because you will turn a corner and get domed seemingly out of nowhere. so get that aim up dude. 

this game has frequent updates to fix a bug or issue but sometimes that just creates more bugs

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"[h1] “Crush your enemies. See them driven before you. And to hear the lamentation of the tieflings!” [/h1]

Baldur's Gate 3 (2023) represents a round-based role-playing game (RPG), developed and published by the company Larian Studios. Further notable titles of that development studio are Divinity: Original Sin (2014) and Divinity: Original Sin 2 (2017). 
BioWare and Black Isle Studios were responsible for the first two games of the series, namely Baldur’s Gate (1998) and Baldur’s Gate 2: Shadows of Amn (2000).

[i] Pros & cons: [/i]

++ Solve problems however you see fit. Shove them down cliffs. Talk your way out of most conflicts and situations. Do a pacifist run while hugging trees. Speak with animals and let them lead you to untold riches. Abuse your absurd mental powers to break and command friend or foe. Hire a lich to resurrect your companions, or buy possessed mercenaries from him. Witness an unholy union between a bugbear and ogre. Pick up every explosive barrel you come across, then place all of 'em next to a dragon, and watch an ocean of blood & fire unfold before you!

++ Each time you sit down with your companions at the camp fire, where the ballet of flames invites reflection, one will be rewarded with excellent characterization and storytelling. My love goes out to the character of Lae’zel; her arrogance and hubris equals that of an klingon warrior. But, once you crack that shell, she will throw you around the bed and break some of your ribs. A woman after my own taste!

++ Playing in co-op with my siblings brings forth tragic differences in our characters. I want to conquer the Sword Coasts with an iron fist. The middle one demands a peaceful solution to every humanitarian crisis we encounter, while starving for attention from his weak goddess. And the youngest converses with animals and steals everything that is not nailed down.

o Maybe I am used to that kind of masochistic torture, but the Tactician difficulty lacks some punch. I have experienced little resistance so far. And what happened to my Ironman mode, why are you hiding it from me? Come on devs, give me a real challenge. Show me you can make The Ultimate bleed!

- Took me some time to understand what kind of gameplay aspect I am missing the most. It is the character progression in the style of Baldur’s Gate 2. And by that I mean the level of escalation, where the skill Improved Whirlwind or spells like Improved Alacrity in combination with Time Stop depict the epitome of absolute power. Some would even describe them as game-breaking. Well, except for the Demorgorgon.
If you have not experienced the first two Baldur’s Gate titles, you most likely will be unable to understand the sentiment I am contemplating here. For the older generation, that little piece is missing… to make it whole again.

[i] Summary: [/i]

Hands down, this game marks Larian Studios’ magnum opus. I can see the continuous development and lessons learned from the last two instalments have come to fruition. And they deliver on what are the most important features in the genre: great writing and creative space to role-play while drowning one in insane amount of details. Once more, the new reference for future RPGs. 

On the other hand, the game lacks the crucial component of the power fantasy that made Throne of Bhaal (2001) the perfect storm. I consider it an Original Sin sequel set on the continent of Faerûn, but not my hoped for Baldur’s Gate 3.

It turned out the game has region lock by IP (which is definitely wrong at all, we live in 2024, games should consider geographical proximity to nearest servers). And more, they deleted opportunity to cross play between different regions, so you cannot play with your friends from another regions. Developers trying to force people to create 2 or more accounts with different regions and donate to all (no refund system btw). Tech support seems like Ctrl-C Ctrl-V and doesnt want to solve ping problems. Funny thing is in CN version of this game i have 90-120 ping, still lower than global.

230410,Warframe,"When so many of the reviews are from people with 1000+ hours and they are positive, what is there even to argue about?
Just download it and play already!

Yeah its F2P, but man, this is just F2P done right, no hungry money grab, no totally overprice items, like other games. (PoE I'm looking at you...)

The only dev's I've encountered so far, that actually seem to want to do it right and fair, and who's biweekly devstream is well done too, so many could learn from it!

I'd say 400-1000 hours and you'll be near the ""I tried it all, and beat it senseless"" time to take a break.. Then 6 months go by and some new stuff comes out and before you know it, you've just spend another 100-200 hours milking that content.. for free... then some other big game comes out, you leave WF behind for a bit.

Then 6 months down the line, WAMBAM - new stuff to dig into.. but wait, its a giant open world planet... ""sigh.."" bye bye life... 

Best part, its free... no pay to win, no I have to open my wallet.
In time you slowly will, because you'll find a favorite frame, a favorite sword and some new skin comes out and you'll start to drool over it and just go ""I must have!"" and throw that 6-7 usd after it, or they'll release a delux skin you'll be able to just buy for some of the plat you've earned from selling items you gathered for free..

It's a must try and a a game model the entire F2P industry really should copy. Because loot crates and 20 dollar cosmetic items is just a joke that gone on for far too long.

2537590,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024,"I own all Flight Simulator version ever release, which means that I have been around the block for a while now when it comes to software and games.
So, of course, I also buy the newest flight simulator version. Great.
Having said that, after nearly two days of anguish I decided to write a review of my experience with the Flight Simulator 2024. I got enough time for this on my hands as the installation process is still not finished after two days of trying.
There are voices that demand/request not to post negative reviews if one has technical problems connected to downloading and running this game.
Sorry, but downloading and running the game is about the most elementary part of any game. If I can not download it, If I can not run it, then it deserves to be regarded to be at the bottom of the pile. Technical problems may not always be worthy of determining how good a game is but if it prevents you from running it in the first place then it is definitely fair to call it out and make a recommendation based on the fact that one can not run it.
On launch day I was not even able to get into the downloading queue.
So today I try again and manage to advance to the downloading phase.
Over a period of several hours waiting it reached 97%, hurrah. There it stays though...while time passes, no movement. I then made the unforgivable mistake of daring to click on my taskbar, ie taking the focus away from the flight simulator loading window. The flight simulator installation window seems to be miffed that I decided to ""focus"" on something else then the ever-turning timer icon and just closes the window down, crashes. Gone.
So I restart the game and and what do you know... I have to download everything AGAIN from the start. It seems the installation system does not remember what it already downloaded. Or it at least appears so as the process never really tells you what it is up to... great...well done whoever designed this bit of the software.
A few hours later I manage to get to the Setup Screen. Now I am stuck on ""Customize Identity"" (what ever that is suppose to be). This seems to be it for today. No movement anymore, no progress counter just a turning icon again indicating that the system is waiting... for something... what I do not know...I assume whoever designed and coded this section did know...at least at some point. In the back of my mind, always, the experience of yesterday...dare I click on my taskbar again and invite the wrath of the Flight Simulator installation window...
Now the Shakespearean question: Shall I restart or wait a bit longer? 
After a couple of antagonising hours I make the call to restart. Darn, same result, re-download everything and then stuck again on ""Customize Identity"". So how long do I wait this time ? Rest of the day, over night or until the next version of the Flight Simulator is available, FS 2028 maybe ?
Let me introduce some perspective here. I am also a software developer and quite frankly if I would have presented my manager, at any point of my career, with an installation process of this quality, that would have been the moment I would have stood with my little cardboard box at the bus stop in front of our office waiting for the next bus....period... and deservingly so.
For an entity like microsoft to get it so wrong on so many levels is just plainly unacceptable. 
We are not talking about the one man band, single developer, in a basement, who does not have the resources for extensive testing or the knowledge to calculate the technical requirements needed to accommodate thousands of users to connect at the same time. This is one of the largest software companies on earth, they should have the know how and also the possibility to support Asobo accordingly and/or keep an eye on them that they design and code something that actually works. I know and accept that no software in the world is bug free. But so many failures, one after the other. No mouse pointer, no progress indicators, crashing applications when they loose focus, not logging what has been already downloaded... It is just a list of failings which individually should never happen, never-mind all of them.
Anyway should I ever get to the point of actually running the simulator I will change my review accordingly. I truly hope I can get to the point of recommending it.

1401590,Disney Dreamlight Valley,"You can read this without getting spoiled but feeling my very intense wrath. With 200+ hours of the time of writing you'd think I would recommend this game and you'd think I would have finished everything there was to finish in this game but for some reason Devs of indie games are much faster and better in fixing mayor bugs than whatever this misery this is supposed to be. For over 2 months I've been waiting for them to fix issues with the main quests that stops me (and a lot of others) from progressing and at this point it's getting ridic. I love Disney but obviously with 200+ hours I have nothing left to do other than check the shop once a day and hope for updates. That I can't even finish the main quest line is an absolute bummer, considering I was one of the nutjobs who bought the ultimate Edition but I guess that's on me. While the characters are absolutely lovely and the graphics are great, there's not a lot of love or passion put into the game and it just feels like something they pulled out to just milk the Disney title for cash. For example, when you finish a quest line with a Character like putting up a stage for a certain character and you run around preparing everything for it and talking to the other characters just to put the crafted stage down and then straight jump to short black screen and then instantly to the take a picture screen while everyone around is happy, quest line character talks about how great it all was but YOU. DON'T. ACTUALLY. GET. TO. SEE. ANY. OF. IT. Wheres the magic? All of the prepping and running around for nothing. It feels so unrewarding and loveless. Ever heard of cut scenes? (Oh wait. Right. Not your forte as it seems, since a cut scene is what broke my main quest.) Maybe they will add this in the future but we should soon reach the end of Early Access so I highly doubt it will be added and what will be the point for people like me who already finished every Character possible. We'd never get to experience it unless we decide to trash our game. (And why would we do that?) Time Traveling is a possibility but bugs your whole game apparently, I've seen the threads and it scared me into not doing it. If it's possible and therefore allowed (?) why does it mess up the whole game? But talking about bugs.. Let's not speak about the other hundreds of bugs that seemingly never go away. Like normal things that freeze the game or makes stuff impossible to pick up like it doesn't exist but is there and is clearly in the way. Scrooges Dress/Outfit options are a huge bummer too. (I mean those displayed in the window) It's just the same stuff over and over again, just recolored and it's really not a lot of options either. For me he has not been displaying a new Outfit there in forever. Dreamsnaps is a nice little addition for people done with the game but it keeps you busy for like 20 minutes every once a week and that's about it. Whats highly bothersome about Dreamsnaps is that when it's an Outfit challenge, why in the cursed Te Fiti is there still not an Option to create different styles, name them, and save them. Because sometimes I don't want to change my damn Outfit or would like to get at least back to it without having to look forever for what I was originally wearing. That this still not a feature in a game like this where customization is such a big deal, is really baffling to me. Lastly, I'd like to address the 'nothing to do' sadness on this game. If the Character had needs (like in Sims for example) at least there would be something to do, though I'm not sure if it would be enough at this point to actually interest me anymore. Or events other than those that are Real-Life related. Characters wanting to hang out and do something together. Mini games with the other Characters. And for that one, there's so many options... Hide and seek, stargazing, picnics, who catches most fish, cooking the best dish, themed crafting and so on. (If any of this makes it into the game, you're welcome and I expect my cut or hire me because my brain is an idea factory.) Because right now I'm living in a village with repetitive Ghosts. And now to wrap it up.. Why is the only thing you can do with most items is to turn them on and off (when there's a light or Screen involved). It would be great if the arcades actually had playable mini games on them and other items/furniture would be more interactive like Spin the Globe, pop out Toast of the Toaster, turntables/DJ booth with actual playlists and.. no never mind. I ain't getting paid for this, the Idea Factory is closed now and I ranted enough. But lastly, while talking about items and furniture.. Why can't we put items on just all the surfaces. Look at the newly released open Beta and f2p game ""Palia"" for example. I don't wanna be sitting here advertising for another game... BUT they have done decorating possible like champs, anything that has a surface, you can put items on, even on chairs and sofas! And not just ONE item on one surface but many items on one surface, depending on the size. (Already have nothing to do on that game either - for now. So don't want to praise them too much but you get the idea). And with this, I'm done here now. I held back on writing this review in hope the main quest would be fixed by now but waiting 2 months + with them being well aware of the issue, is my limit at this point.","Very Positive91% of the 16,111 user reviews for this game are positive.",read spoiled feeling intense wrath 200 hour writing recommend finished finish indie game faster fixing mayor bug whatever misery supposed 2 month waiting fix issue quest stop others progressing ridic love obviously 200 hour left check shop hope update finish task objective given non line absolute bummer considering nutjobs bought ultimate edition guess character lovely graphic great not_a love passion feel pulled milk title cash example finish a_emphasized task objective given non line putting stage certain preparing talking character crafted stage straight short black screen instantly picture screen happy task objective given non line talk great wheres magic prepping running feel unrewarding loveless heard cut scene oh wait not_your forte cut scene broke task objective given non maybe add future soon reach player purchase play official release highly doubt already finished possible never_get unless decide trash traveling possibility bug apparently thread scared not_doing possible allowed mess talking bug not_speak hundred bug seemingly never_go normal thing freeze make stuff impossible pick exist clearly scrooge dress outfit option huge bummer displayed window stuff recolored not_a option not_been displaying outfit forever dreamsnaps nice addition keep busy 20 minute week whats highly bothersome dreamsnaps outfit challenge cursed te fiti not_an different style name save damn outfit forever originally wearing not_a customization big deal baffling lastly address sadness need sims example not_sure interest anymore event real life related character wanting hang mini game character s_emphasizedo option hide seek stargazing picnic catch fish cooking best dish themed crafting make welcome expect cut hire brain idea factory living village repetitive ghost wrap item turn light screen involved great arcade playable mini game item furniture interactive spin globe pop toast toaster turntable dj booth actual playlist no_never mind paid idea factory closed ranted lastly talking item furniture item surface newly released open pre release version available testing play palia example wan na sitting advertising decorating possible champ surface item chair sofa not_just on_emphasizede surface item on_emphasizede surface depending size already praise idea held writing hope task objective given non fixed waiting 2 month aware issue limit

394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"This is a bit hard to reccomend. The AI is a bit dumb, and will regularly leave it's front undefended, and when fighting alongside you, will never move thier units into a coherent fighting force. I played France in my own alliance, and after wiping Germany and the rest of the Axis, we warred with the Soviets, with America joining in. America kept most of it's units off the front, forcing my military to bear the brunt of a full soviet assault, which was very taxing on my manpower. Eventually won, but I'll be damned if America didn't have 10x my unit count, with most of them in my territory, and only about 10 divisions on the front. On the other hand, I find it fun. It's fun designing units, and devising strategies, and picking the right time to strike, and the right things to build at the right time. 

That aside, Paradox has been very poor in it's decision making for the DLCs. The most recent, death or dishonor, honestly should've been a patch. They do the same thing for Stellaris, where MAJOR GAME CHANGES are kept behind a paywall. But, if Paradox pulls it's head out of it's butt, like many companies are doing slowly, than this may be one of the best grand strategy games ever. So I do recomend.  Just expect to pay about $70 for the final product.

EDIT: The cornflakes free update has fixed many of the AI problems that where present. it still isn't the best at making intelligent decisions (such as communist China going to war with China AND Manchukuo after Japan had a civil war and went democratic), but it can at least wage war now. Front lines shift realistically, units get cut off, and will attempt to re-establish supply lines, and when backed into a corner, the AI won't just stuff 100 undersupllied units into 5 districts to try to keep it.","Very Positive91% of the 223,776 user reviews for this game are positive.",bit hard reccomend ai bit dumb regularly leave front undefended fighting alongside never_move thier unit coherent fighting force france alliance wiping germany rest axis warred soviet america joining america unit front forcing military bear brunt soviet assault taxing manpower eventually damned america 10x unit count territory 10 division front hand fun fun designing unit devising strategy picking strike thing build aside paradox poor decision dlcs recent death dishonor honestly a_emphasized software fix bug balance add feature stellaris major change paywall paradox pull butt company slowly best grand strategy game recomend expect pay 70 final product cornflakes fixed ai problem present t_emphasizedhe best intelligent decision communist china war china manchukuo japan civil war democratic wage war front line shift realistically unit cut attempt establish supply line backed corner ai stuff 100 undersupllied unit 5 district

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"If you want to play the game right now, sorry, you missed when the game was actually enjoyable.
I've tried to be supportive, playing the game religiously for personal orders and majors orders, went over the 3rd party very questionable anticheat, barely went over the PSN debacle (because they step back from this decision)... and yet here we are with my review after the Escalation of Freedom update which made **poof** after a lot of marketing and promises around it. I'm stopping to play this game. So much potential wasted.

6 months after its launch, ArrowHead Game Studios seems to freaking out at letting any META installed in their game. Whether you think it is good thing for the game or not, the problem is AH has only one answer to that: nerfing the player equipment. Rather to trying to understand why playerbase is favouring this weapon, and why it never uses those other ones, AH only check datasheets for the most used, declares it ""very much META. Is it a problem? Yes."" and nerf the weapon to make it useless or barely usable, without giving something else to the players. So instead of fixing the META, they install in contrary a ""toxic"" META, where players whine and are FORCED to check a new, more efficient, way to play. Then you can guess what happens the next update...

And unfortunately, this is not the only issue with this game. Like new enemy units are getting stronger, more deadly, with less and less tools at players' disposal: on this EoF update, new units are now ragdolling you or shooting rockets at you (which either insta-kill you or making you ragdolling to oblivion). Or fixing bugs from day one being slower than new bugs introduced at each patch: from minor glitches like missing 3D objects giving you a ""?"" instead, to objective's terminal not responding or Pelican's bug at the extraction, both preventing you to finish the mission wasting 40mn of play, with of course infinite drop loading screen, which, AH promises, is fixed this time (it is not). I could also talk about the balancing of resources like the rare samples, which make no sense when compared to common and super samples... Ho but don't worry: they made a new Mega Nests and Fortresses to help you, where you can get ""GREAT REWARDS"" like **check notes** 6 samples.


Granted, I can understand AH Game Studios is a AA studio, and doesn't have the firepower nor the reactivity of an AAA(A) studio like  ActiBli/EA/2k/Ubisoft for a GaaS. But then why are they pushing very questionable warbonds with useless weapons (AR guns are still not viable in this game, yet, we got still multiple variations, drop-pod skin which you won't see since the only time you do they are engulfed in atmospheric entry flames, etc....) or  why are they ""fixing"" stuff nobody asked for (patrol system was fine, but AH found ""it was sometimes a bit empty between objectives"" and now since may it is a constant flow of enemies with abusive spawn always in your direction) while others, more important issues are still here from Day 1 (still a mess to join a friend, don't even bother with crossplay).

It feels AH doesn't know how to handle their game, doesn't seems to listen to its playerbase, which is getting tired and leaving the ship.

Goodbye HD2, it was fun while it last.

427520,Factorio,"I actually had this game pirated, but I enjoyed it so much that I decided to go ahead and buy it to support the creators. 

I recommend playing the tutorial first because the tech tree and the lack of instructions might get overwhelming. 

This game does a great job at continually increasing the difficulty. With every upgrade there is a new method of doing things, new fixes to be made and a more efficient way to run your factory. There is always something to do, which transalates to a fluid gameplay making you spend hours playing without even realizing it. But at the end of the day you are rewarded with an ever growing factory, which proves your (in)ability to plan a functioning system.

And if you ever get frustrated by the challenges you encounter, just remember: Factorio isn't a game of problems, it's a game of solutions.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 156,951 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"Dunno what else to say other than it's exactly what it seems, Fantasy Persona with actual evolution and iteration of the famous Atlus sauce and IMO that will help the next SMT and Persona games too.

Frankly though, Metaphor is now my favorite Atlus IP alongside Digital Devil Saga. It's such an interesting setting even without being a huge fantasy stan, and though their games have always been fantastical and crazy-leaning (Mind Palaces, a high school turning into Tartarus, demon multiverses,  uh... the secret of what the Digital Devil Saga world really is), with the leeway from no longer needing to pretend their game has a believable modern world tied to something insane, Atlus just went full rabid pycho in the best way possible.

And boy is some of the stuff just out there lol. Overall, a super fun and beautiful game with a IMO better use of the PErsona calendar systems. Using the not-persona Archetypes as a job system is also extremely cool and fun, as I feel job systems are dying out and I really, really love them. This basically lets you choose your favorite characters yet build them into your own preferred team.

A lot of the general production value is also amazing. Great voice acting, glorious music, awesome menu style.

Unfortunately, not everything is perfect. The game looks like a remastered PS3 game and graphical options are sparse. That's not a deal breaker for me--I play a ton of retro games today still and adore them--but it is a fair point to criticize. This isn't a $40 AA game, but a $70 AAA game that is also ripping you off on dlc and special editions.

Performance can also be a bit spotty and you don't have a whole lot of options to tune graphical settings. Overall, a fantasy game if you're into RPGs and especially if you enjoy JRPGs.

This is definitely going to be the highlight RPG of the year, and alongside Nine Sols, so far it's my favorite game experience.","Very Positive91% of the 10,386 user reviews for this game are positive.",dunno else exactly fantasy persona actual evolution iteration famous atlus sauce imo help next smt persona game frankly metaphor favorite atlus ip alongside digital devil saga s_emphasizeduch interesting setting huge fantasy stan game fantastical crazy leaning mind palace high school turning tartarus demon multiverses uh secret digital devil saga world leeway no_longer needing pretend believable modern world tied insane atlus rabid pycho best possible boy stuff lol super fun beautiful imo persona calendar system not_persona archetype extremely cool fun system dying really_emphasized love basically let choose favorite character build preferred general production value amazing great voice acting glorious music awesome menu style unfortunately not_everything perfect look remastered ps3 graphical option sparse not_a deal breaker play ton retro game today adore fair criticize 40 aa 70 aaa ripping downloadable additional released initial launch special edition performance bit spotty option tune graphical setting fantasy rpgs especially enjoy jrpgs definitely highlight role alongside nine sol far favorite
381210,Dead by Daylight,"I started playing this game about 6 years ago, mostly on Xbox and some on steam. The current state of the game is the worst it has ever been. ""Camping"" and ""Tunneling"" are two terms that everyone in the community should be very familiar with and it is also overwhelmingly present in matches lately. I read a comment once about this game and it still rings true to this day. ""The game is designed in a way that if one side is having fun, then the other side is not."" The developers at Behavior are some of the worst devs I have ever seen for a video game. Almost 8 years and their game only gets worse over time. Instead of fixing broken mechanics, they would rather release new skins and new characters. The devs are completely out of touch with the player base and rarely listen to complaints that need to be looked into. This game is no longer worth my time or your time until the current state gets some needed attention. Do not waste your money or your time. There are better games with better communities and better devs. THIS GAME SUCKS!

-New crop types are always welcome
-GPS steering integrated in the base game is very nice

The bad:

-I get constant screen flickering with every graphic setting I tried
-Most machine interiors still look like they came from Farm Sim 2015
-Most screens in the machines have static images

2139460,Once Human,"As someone who's put nearly 200 hours across the betas and tests. There's a severe abundance of misinformation being spread about the game so let's hit all the main points quickly, shall we?

- Within hours of launch, the team fixed the ability to create characters on other servers

- The terms of service and privacy policy issue: one guy read it and everyone else is vomiting that information based on that person's findings. These terms are no different from the majority of other modern games you accept today.

- The gacha ""Wish Machine"" is used to unlock blueprints of some powerful weapons and it is a gamble. THE ONLY TWO WAYS of receiving this currency is playing the game, and available in the FREE battle pass tiers. There's literally no way to exchange real money for this currency. You have to earn it.

- Spyware/cryptominer claims is just baffling

If you dislike the game because you don't find it fun, having performance issues, or connection problems. Then those are some valid reasons to dislike the game.

------------------------

A bit of an actual review of the game now

The game is mindless fun.

It's not a masterpiece by any means. The combat is slightly janky, and not very challenging. Base building has some slight jank to it. The enemies aren't very engaging most of the time.

But damn the game is fun

If you're looking for something you can turn your brain off to and not need to try very hard but you're looking for a sense of solid, consistent progression, you should give this game a try.

One thing I will glorify the game for however. Is the ability to craft from storage containers in your base. When you enter any building menu (base build menu, furnace, weapon workbench, etc.) it will automatically pull resources from all storage crates you have in your territory. No more forgetting where you put those copper bars, or metal scrap. It's all accessible to you at any time.

The game also does a really good job at drip feeding you enjoyable content. You play a little bit and get tired of running everywhere, hey here's a quest to unlock a motorcycle and fast travel. Getting tired of collecting wood for charcoal? Here's how to setup electricity and eliminate your need for charcoal for furnaces. You've been doing a lot of looting but want to spend a little more time in your base, here's a new system that you have to build defenses and waves of enemies try attacking your base for some nice rewards. Tired of collecting wood and ore and just want to shoot stuff? Here's how to unlock an auto logger and auto miner that will passively gather things for you while you're off exploring.

This is one of those things that gives me hope for the future of this game. There's a lot of attention to detail and innovative stuff when it comes to core survival game systems that we've seen unchanged for so many years.

The one criticism I've been seeing pop is the seasonal reset stuff. If that's a turn off for you that's totally fine, it's not for everyone. But people thinking it's the end of the world need to relax a little. Rust does this every month, and that game came out 10 years ago. But it still consistently remains in the top 10 most active players on Steam to this day. The devs have said for this game you'll keep your blueprints on reset, which is arguably way more time and effort to farm than chopping some trees and hitting some rocks to make the weapons/armor. On season resets your materials (wood, ores, etc.) will be moved to this thing called ""Eternaland"" which is basically a big private oasis you can invite friends that's separate from the main game. Personal player housing that won't reset.

Personally I'm using this two month period as a trial run. How bad will I feel during next reset when stuff gets wiped. Will I still be motivated to play? We'll find out in two months.

The combat isn't difficult, there can be some downtime, but damn the game is fun.

It's free, just try it and decide for yourself. Stop reading reviews. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, you don't, and that's okay <3","Mostly Positive71% of the 104,699 user reviews for this game are positive.",someone nearly 200 hour across beta test severe abundance misinformation spread point quickly shall hour launch fixed character server term service privacy policy issue read else vomiting information based finding term no_different majority modern game accept today gacha wish machine unlock blueprint powerful weapon gamble way receiving currency available battle pas tier literally no_way exchange real currency earn spyware cryptominer claim baffling dislike fun performance issue connection problem valid reason dislike bit actual mindless fun not_a masterpiece mean combat slightly janky not_very challenging base building slight jank enemy engaging damn fun turn brain not_need hard sense solid consistent progression glorify craft storage container base enter building menu base build menu furnace weapon workbench automatically pull resource storage crate territory no_more forgetting copper bar metal scrap accessible good drip feeding enjoyable play bit tired running everywhere hey a_emphasized task objective given non unlock motorcycle fast travel tired collecting wood charcoal setup electricity eliminate charcoal furnace looting spend base build defense wave enemy attacking base nice reward tired collecting wood ore shoot stuff unlock auto logger auto miner passively gather thing exploring thing give hope future attention detail innovative stuff come core survival system unchanged year criticism seeing pop seasonal reset stuff turn totally fine not_for world relax rust 10 year ago consistently remains top 10 active player blueprint reset arguably effort farm chopping tree hitting rock weapon armor season reset material wood ore moved called eternaland basically big private oasis invite friend s_emphasizedeparate personal housing reset personally period trial bad next reset stuff get wiped motivated play month combat difficult downtime damn fun decide reading review okay 3

427520,Factorio,"There is something inherently strange about this game. It plays nothing like it looks. It's the average person at the bar that you just can't get a good look at but every once in a while they turn around and your heart skips a beat. What is it about this person that is so enthralling? You have to go up and talk to them regardless of what your friends think. Turns out you have the most amazing conversation ever and watch the sun come up in the parking lot, not once making a single move on them. You go home happy, revitalized and content, patiently waiting for them to text you. 

On the surface it appears to be a management simulator, chock full of interesting things to do, with equally as many ways to do them. Beneath the surface lies something that I didn't expect, something that didn't quite sink its teeth into me until around 20 hours in; there is always a better way to do things and you will dream about them regardless of how often you play. Belt systems can be merged, split and re-routed in a million different ways, smelting grids can be reformatted to minimize their footprint but maximize their output. Electricity becomes an art as you weave power lines aesthetically around your base being extra careful not to create a criss-cross which, while functional, looks terrible and we can't have terrible looking things in our base...

You start to grow content with your output, making mental notes of how you would like to move things around to make room for future upgrades. You sit back and enjoy your creation and how well everything is running. Suddenly, a red exclamation point shows up next to your toolbelt...hmmm, what's that? Your map shows it as well. You mouse over it, thinking that maybe you ran out of power or something simple, then it happens...

The biters are ripping through your iron mining in the northwest corner of your base! They are shredding metal like hot butter. The miners are taken out and the biters turn their sights on you. With almost supernatural speed they race toward you, fangs wet with a taste for blood. You have only a pistol to protect you. 10 measily bullets because you didn't spend the research points to get weaponized. The screen goes red and your stats are shown. 

You vow to do things better. You will be ready the next time they attempt to breach your walls. Your factory will be stronger. You will be faster. They will be deader. This means war.

Updated: 2 and half years after my original review, I still continue to come back to this game religiously. Play time has slowed a bit as new updates are released but my overall opinion of this game hasn't changed.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Rainbow Six: Siege has surprised me in many positive ways. During it’s original announcement, I was still recovering from the disappointment that was Watch_Dogs, and actually refused to buy Ubisoft games for some time. I’m a huge fan of the older Vegas games, both of which had a strong single player component. So naturally I was even more disappointed when I heard that Siege would be exclusively multiplayer. Little did I know that their multiplayer would be some of the most satisfying I’ve ever played.

Siege has actually taken me away from my regular multiplayer shooter, the largely popular CS:GO of which I’ve been playing since it’s beta. I didn’t even think that was possible, but here I am playing Siege for 2 months with less than 2 hours of CS:GO during that time. 

The possibilities in Siege are what make it so addictive. It has destructibility on a more controlled scale than what you would see in the Battlefield games. You can break walls, build barricades, reinforce walls, etc. There are so many ways each round can play out, and so many different tactics you can use to win. The gunplay is highly satisfying, as is expected from the Rainbow Six games which have set a very high standard from the Vegas years. 

Rainbow Six Siege feels like the next gen shooter I’ve been waiting for. It’s smooth, elegant, and tons of fun to play for hours on end.","Very Positive84% of the 1,131,227 user reviews for this game are positive.",six surprised positive way original announcement recovering disappointment watch_dogs refused game huge fan older vega game strong single component naturally disappointed heard exclusively mode multiple player interact compete real mode multiple player interact compete real satisfying taken regular mode multiple player interact compete real shooter largely popular c pre release version available testing possible 2 month 2 hour c possibility addictive destructibility controlled scale battlefield game break wall build barricade reinforce wall way round play different tactic win gunplay highly satisfying expected six game set high standard vega year six feel next gen shooter waiting s_emphasizedmooth elegant ton fun play hour

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"So I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hours.
Update: 06/22/2017 accumulated about 235 hours and I have payed a month of my Subscription :). I am reupdating this for the Summer Sale for people who want to try this game and also for the StormBlood DLC update. 
Updated 5.5:  09/06/2021 up to date with Shadowbringers

Positive:
-Completly Noob Friendly
-Tons of Content with two DLC's (Heavensward 60)>(Stormblood 70)>(Shadowbringers 80)
-Chocobo,Chocobo and Chocobo racing.
-The brilliant soundtrack is very unique and captivating.
-Multiple classes that this MMO is unique with is having 1 character and being able to switch classes
- The one major thing that also makes this unique, is that in FFXIV, there is no rush in this game. You can be what you want to be and you are not forced to do anything else.

Community:The community is amazing in certain perspectives that is actually more better than most MMO's. What makes this community so unique is just the cycle of players that are willing to help new players. Yes this is normal in all MMO's but in FFXIV we aren't forced to help new players but instead we choose to. That;s what makes this community so nice. Not all Communities are perfect or imperfect but the majority of this one is decently kind.

Heavily Story Reliant: Most MMO's always fail to captivate the player of the story in general. FFXIV is very unique in it's own standpoint that the developers actually put so much development and depth into this story that just makes you enjoy it . Also being that this is probably the longest story in all Final Fantasy Genres. This is probably the only MMO that can potentially make you cry just from the story. That is how good it is.

Dungeons/Trials/24 man raid/ Hardcore raids:

Dungeons: Pretty generic even in this MMO that there isn't really much to say about honestly. Maps are very unique in it's own sense even the mobs and bosses with their unique skills. Though each map will have it's soundtrack included.
Trials: Trials are Bosses that you will face during the Main story or a side quest. You will be with a party of 8 facing this trial. Every Trial is unique with it's own soundtrack. Though trials are not difficult, there are Trials:Extreme which increases the difficulties making it twice as hard.
Alliance raids: 24 man raids are pretty much 24 players clearing a dungeon with multiple bosses. It's not difficult but you will die a lot. These 24 man raids also consists of the Nier raid in the most recent Shadowbringers update. 
Savage raids:These are your hardcore raids. They are about equivalent to Mythic raids in WoW. But, you are in a party of 8 of what you do is important. Everyone has to work together and synchronize too be able clear this content. The amount of time varies but in the most extreme hardcore raiders it can take them a 5-7 days to clear but for normal players it can take them 2-3 weeks.  There is also a 48 man savage content that released in the Eureka content.
Ultimate raids: Thought savage was hard? There are currently 3 Ultimate raids. Ultimate raids make's savage content look like a joke. These are for the hardcore players that want to take it too the next level. Ultimate fights can last for about 15-18 minutes. Each passing second or minute, there is always a new mechanic that is very unique. This type of content take up to possibly more than 60+ hours. Being it can take you more than 1-3 months just to clear 1 ultimate. Though yes it's hard. But that is what makes this so much fun. The reward is that you will get a ultimate title and a unique ultimate weapon. But it's worth it.

Graphics: Even with a Low end PC you can still run this game smoothly. For Medium-High End PC. A lot of people tend to not like this aesthetic of graphics because of the anime type graphics but it really seems to fit.

Free Companies: Aka guilds- Finding a very dedicated FC that is willing to work with their own community is fun. Being able to host events and sometimes do raids and obtaining benefits makes FC's worth going to. Joining a FC or getting into the community can help you not get bored but can significantly make your FFXIV experience better.

Enternal Bondings:  So this is basically a Marriage system that can help boost the XP gain of two of the couples are together in this game and a Chocobo and YES there are actual relationships between players but don't try to take it serious as a relationship game.

Housing: You can have you're own house or a FC house that are limited in each server.  There are even crafters that can craft housing items or just be able to have you're own garden. You have your own section of an area where you would run into other players that could be your neighbor or another FC.

Golden Saucer: Pretty much a land of Mini-games that has good decent amount of games to play like Chocobo Racing or Card games. People actually seem to enjoy this content that they sometimes live in it. They have unique glamours or mounts as rewards.

Gear: Gears can be obtained from doing raids, dungeons or crafting. Every gear in this game unique. There are people who actually farm gear just for glamour that just looks really cool too be being very gorgeous or just very funny.

Eureka: Pretty much Legendary weapons or armor that have their own signature look and stats that can be used for endgame content. This usually takes about 1-3 weeks to be able to obtain 1 weapon but can vary on the time.  They are very grindy content.

Classes: You will have a single character with multiple classes to change into.So this means you do not need to make another character. There are 10 DPS, 4 Tanks, 3Healers, 7 Crafters, and 3 Gathers. Each job is very unique in terms of playstyle. You can be good with a specific class. But you will see a huge difference in terms of skill of the class you play too someone who plays the same class as you. This means even though you know your class. You haven't mastered it being there are rotations.

Leveling: Leveling: Leveling can completely vary on the methods that players use. But it can probably take about 1- 3 weeks or maybe less to max a DPS/Healer/Tank class. For Crafters and Gathers it can take probably a few hours to 2 weeks that can vary. Leveling doesn't feel slow or fast. It's just very moderate.

Crafters/gathering: Probably the most unique and yet rewarding content. There are tons of crafting recipes and gathering. Compared to other MMO's where Crafting and gathering are just sub-classes. In this game they can be a main class for players. Each crafter's are unique. Culinarian makes food for buffs even raids. Carpenter's can make housing materials. These are classes that can make you money and gear and being a crafter and gather is like playing a different game too where you can put infinite hours into this.

Negatives:
Monthly Payment: This is a subscription based MMO. But one thing in mind is that, if you do buy the steam version, you can purchase subscription with steam credits But this is how the game is still alive and healthy.

The story length: You will feel beyond rushed. The story is good and it's amazing. But too other players they want to reach the endgame content. If you are the type of player that only wants to play endgame and do raids. Then this is probably the biggest.

Conclusion:
You are not forced to follow a linear path in this game. You can be what you want to be is what makes this game feel so alive. You can be a hardcore player or a casual but you are not forced. This game is started to become more mainstream now and it's always great to have new players. To be honest this game feels like WoW when it became popular when Wrath of the Litch King was released.(Not a hate rant). This game feels like it has more content than GW2 endgame. Both are amazing MMO's but, Final Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that filled the void of my heart from what an MMO should be.

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"In my opinion, Metaphor: ReFantazio in the end actually ended up being a ""fantasy Persona"", for all the good and bad that might entail. As someone who isn't a fan of the Persona formula, I'm mainly writing this review from that perspective. Which resulted in me tagging this review as negative, since I'll mostly be mentioning the reasons I didn't really enjoy the experience, and those originate from it being too much like Persona.

Even if I didn't have high expectations for this part, I was overall disappointed with the gameplay, talking mainly about the combat side of it. The Persona game that I actually finished was Persona 4 Golden, despite the fact that I kinda hated the combat system. And even though Metaphor has been released 16 years later, there is not much innovation in regards to the base formula. 

The combat to me still seems like a very basic ""weakness shopping list simulator"", where 95 % of the battle is simply preparing the correct builds before an encounter like going through a checklist, with very little actual strategy during the encounter itself. And if you build a party around implanting weaknesses, you just beat almost every single encounter in the game. I did that early game and every boss fight ended up being almost the exact same sequence of moves where the boss got annihilated, unless it had some extra gimmick that broke that setup.

Non-boss fights are even worse, as they mostly boil down to whether you ambush the enemy or they ambush you, either way the ambusing side facerolls the ambushed one. Every single encounter again ends up being the repetition of the same moves over and over, except this time you actually try to conserve your mana. I've come to loathe this type of combat system as you end up doing the same sequences of moves over and over for 70 hours. It's just simply too binary for me, based on your build you either obliterate the enemy, or the other way around, with no room for anything more interesting.

But like I said, I know Persona and its combat system, so I wasn't expecting a whole lot anyway from the gameplay.

The real disappointment for me however was the story side of the game.

The plot, while it introduces some unique concepts at the start, ends up being played pretty much by the book the further you progress. I can't say I found it boring, but even though it didn't disappoint me, I certainly won't remember it years, or even months down the line compared to my favorites in the genre.

The setting seems unique at first, but I think that's heavily carried by the art direction, both the visual and the audio parts. If you were to actually just write down the lore of Metaphor's world, you'd end up with a description of a pretty generic fantasy. There is at least one fun reveal thrown into the mix, but nothing you haven't seen before if you've experienced at least a few fantasy stories like this.

But I was still satisfied with the plot and setting. The actual major disappointment that single-handedly shaped my overall view of the game are the characters. For me they. Are. Just. So. Bland.

Starting with the protagonist being the biggest offender. I was happy to hear that finally a Persona like game is going to have a voiced protagonist, and we might get away from the bland voiceless self-inserts. Except it's still a bland self-insert, just voiced. The end. You might as well replace him with a mannequin. Or a wall.

The main party are mostly comprised of pretty stereotypical fantasy archetypes, especially the members that you get early and spend the most time with. Which wouldn't necessarily be that bad, if there were at least some quirks or significant developments sprinkled in there. But pretty much the peak of ""unique traits"" is that one of the characters is really into food. And the other characters comment on that, often. The end.

No problem, we can still salvage that with some fun dynamics. But there are none. The end. The main group barely feels like a group, as most of the times they interact with each other, they are just discussing the most recent plot point. Except for a few very specific instances that were perhaps my favorite moments of the whole experience. The reason for that is that most of their interactions are only one-on-one with the protagonist. Considering the MC is just a walking vegetable when it comes to personality, they might as well just be talking to a wall. So instead of a fun main group of characters, you end up with a bunch of individual archetypes talking to themselves with barely any fun dialogue among each other. So the dialogues, while extremely well localized, feel kinda empty and bland when you consider their subject matter.

TLDR: If you're a Persona fan, this review wasn't really for you, as you'll likely still enjoy Metaphor a lot, it might even become your favorite. But if you're not really into the Persona formula, I advise trying out the demo first or waiting for a significant sale. Because Metaphor, in my opinion, does absolutely nothing different enough to change your opinion.","Very Positive91% of the 10,386 user reviews for this game are positive.",metaphor ended fantasy persona good bad entail someone fan persona formula m_emphasizedainly writing perspective resulted tagging negative mostly mentioning reason enjoy originate persona high expectation disappointed talking mainly combat side persona finished persona 4 golden despite kinda hated combat metaphor released 16 year not_much innovation regard base formula combat basic weakness shopping simulator 95 battle simply preparing correct build encounter checklist actual strategy encounter build party implanting weakness beat single encounter early bos fight ended exact sequence move bos annihilated unless extra gimmick broke setup non bos fight worse mostly boil ambush enemy ambush ambusing side facerolls ambushed single encounter end repetition move except conserve mana loathe type combat sequence move 70 hour simply binary based build obliterate enemy no_room interesting persona combat expecting anyway real disappointment side plot introduces unique concept end pretty book progress found boring disappoint certainly remember year month line compared favorite genre setting unique heavily carried art direction visual audio part write lore metaphor world description pretty generic fantasy fun reveal thrown mix experienced fantasy story satisfied plot setting actual major disappointment single handedly shaped view character bland starting protagonist biggest offender happy hear finally persona voiced protagonist bland voiceless self insert except s_emphasizedtill bland self insert voiced replace mannequin wall party mostly comprised pretty stereotypical fantasy archetype especially member early spend necessarily bad quirk significant development sprinkled pretty peak unique trait character food character comment no_problem salvage fun dynamic group barely feel group time interact discussing recent plot except specific instance perhaps favorite moment interaction on_emphasizede protagonist considering mc walking vegetable come personality talking wall fun group character bunch individual archetype talking barely fun dialogue dialogue extremely localized kinda empty bland consider subject matter persona fan enjoy metaphor favorite not_really persona formula advise trying demo waiting significant sale metaphor different
2344520,Diablo® IV,"The game has officially been out for five days now and Steam reviews are mixed. In an act of desperation, the game is already 25% off.  I absolutely loved all the diablo games but Blizzard has completely changed from its roots. This game is garbage on release, barely any incentive to play after story and the nerfs to leveling progression are disgusting. 

Not to mention the disconnection between the story it's trying to tell and the one laid down by Diablo 3. The story takes place 50 years after D3 but it all seems like Blizzard retconned ALL of the events of D3 out of existence. What happened to all the nephalem heroes in D3? By the end of Reaper of Souls, it's implied by Tyrael that they've become so powerful that even the angels and demons are starting to fear them. But in D4 not only is there no any mention of them, but one of the nephalem heroes (the Crusader Johanna) died unceremoniously. You mean to tell me that this powerful hero, who has ascended to Nephalemhood, who slaughtered literally hundreds and thousands of angels and demons, went to heaven and fought the most powerful demon to have ever been conceived, went to hell and to the pandemonium fortress to fight the most powerful angel to have ever been conceived, was implied by Tyrael to be the most powerful being to ever exist outside of Anu himself, only to die in some random dungeon?

We are in 2023, Blizzard could have created a masterpiece from the start, a more deep story, better items and better leveling/end game. Instead, we just received a reskinned Diablo 3 without the fun that came with Diablo 3 and doing a test for them to balance the game.

We could have:

- better items, more affixes per item, better affixes

- better ost (damn, I miss Matt Uelmen style of music)

- much much longer and better story (and Diablo into the game!)

- more immersive UI/UX, better use of sounds

There is no pleasure in chaining dungeons empty of content and fun. There is just nothing to do, the content is empty of everything, there is nothing from the Diablo license: no mercenaries, no runes and runic words, no trade, no Diablo, no Tyrael, no bestiary lore, no separate class intro's,  no fun, no new gameplay, no item sets, no secret levels, no inventory charms.

All this along with the fact that the game needs an online connection and cannot be played offline at all makes this a total deal breaker. The game is just a cash grab on the Diablo name. Haven't been this disappointed with Blizzard since the release of Shadowlands.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Unfortunately, the San Andreas Mercenaries update made me feel very unhappy and let down. The loss of 180 cars, which drastically reduced the game's variety and enjoyment, was one of its most significant failures. The overall gaming experience has suffered as a result of this choice.

It is disappointing that there was no attempt made to improve the players' ability to use the in-game websites efficiently. The difficulties are exacerbated by this omission. By ignoring this crucial element, the developers missed a chance to improve the overall user experience.

In addition, the game's economics has just changed, making it all but useless. It is challenging to advance and participate in the game as intended because the balance and operation of the in-game economy have been damaged. Unfortunately, these problems have kept me from playing the game recently, as its current state has made it less appealing.

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"I really wanted to like this game - I love and have played every modern Atlus title post Persona 2. Atlus games are amazing because characters have so much depth and the story is held up by really interesting, nuanced philosophies that actually get you to think during and after the game ends. But Metaphor, at least 15 hours in, doesn't really have that - or much else.

The story is really, really bare bones, stories about racism and discrimination are definitely important, but the way tribalism is depicted in Metaphor is so blatantly binary and one dimensional. The dialogue is truly just exposition and drivel, and characters don't really have heart or soul. The strength of Atlus games comes from their social sim nature and their engaging characters who actually experience growth from beginning to end; the social sim gameplay of Metaphor doesn't hold a candle to Persona or even weaker games in the genre. The first act of the game is also all over the place. This game has serious pacing issues. Important story bits hardly get fleshed out, don't ever linger when it would actually be beneficial to; it's hard to explain but I just found the first few hours of the game so jarring. If I had to try, I'd say it's because so much gets dumped on you, but the contents of what gets dumped on you is simply not immersive. In the span of a few minutes, you watch a king get assassinated, fall off a wagon, walk through sand, and end up a goon under some fat mustached man. You move through a world alarmingly quickly with hardly any world building or immersion - unless you stop and talk to an NPC in which they will a) start BMing you for your race or b) tell you how their mom couldn't afford a cancer treatment because of some racist McScrooge (sorry, they all kind of blend together after the 8880183413th time). Or uh go into the menus and read extracurricular descriptions because that's good worldbuilding????????????

The characters are just really, really unlikeable. Your rivals in competing for the thrones are actually jokes. They are goofy caricatures with zero depth. They lack personality and are by nature extremely irrelevant because 99% of them are competing just to give up their spot to their big bosses, ie, generic evil church man and anime Napoleon. The majority of your party members are pretty much all mildly traumatized adults who, for some reason, defer to a prepubescent teenager. Except Gallica, Gallica is fire.

It would be okay if Metaphor made up for its poor story and characters with strong gameplay, music, and art. The gameplay is actually atrocious - you can literally dodge every single hostile monster and pretty much skip your way to the boss fights because of how bad the mob AI is. And the boss fights are a breeze because of how ridiculously broken synthesis skills are. There are hardly any puzzle elements to the dungeons, and the dungeon gameplay loop is pressing A to go under obstacles, fighting the same monsters over and over, and pressing A a few times to get through dialogue. 

When you get out of dungeons, the gameplay loop is pretty much even more dialogue. Which I wouldn't mind - my definition of a good game is honestly just glorified reading, except your dialogue choices have no consequence at all, unlike in other social sim-esque games. The rewards for dialogue are also pretty much identical across your party members, with hardly any variety. If you are not in a dungeon, you are probably reading boxes and boxes of unvoiced lines about the 81293812795th tribe experiencing racism or classism. I actually got really excited when after hours of clicking A, I finally was given an option to travel to some location relevant to a character's history. Imagine how disappointed I was when not only could I not walk around the location, but the location itself was just a static png. With more, unvoiced, dialogue.

Sound is really, really subjective, but I personally got so sick of hearing ""as time marches on and the age of a new king draws nearer"" literally every 3 minutes. The score does have an epic, orchestral suite, but it is so evocative of Fire Emblem that I was shocked the composer was Shoji Meguro. I haven't heard the entirety of the game's soundtrack, and Atlus titles are usually back heavy in terms of where the good music is, so I won't comment on things I haven't heard. What I have heard though are reused sound effects from Persona. A good number actually...

I've been trying, and totally failing, to keep explicit Persona comparisons to a minimum because I recognize a good number of newcomers haven't played those games before (therefore not being a super useful example), but I have to mention at least once that this game borrows, extensively, from the Persona games. And not innovatively either.

Now for the art. There is a big difference between style and graphical fidelity / quality. This game definitely has style. The UI is really, really nice. It's just unfortunate that the graphics of the game are straight out of a PS3 game in 2024. The graphics don't really detract from the gameplay, but it's not anything to write home about. It is, however, personally difficult to justify the 70 dollar MSRP for a game with 2008 graphics. 

With their Shin Megami Tensei games, Atlus showed just how incredible they were at showing, not telling. With the Persona games, Atlus showed just how great they are at writing compelling, interpersonal character dramas. With Metaphor, they will tell, tell, tell until you get sick of engaging with the repetitive dialogue, and cycle through one dimensional caricatures of characters in an overly classic, very vanilla fantasy tale. While the UI is a strong point, gameplay, audio, and visuals are sorely lacking. I really wish I could like this game, and I really wish I had it in me to drag myself through the game and finish it.

230410,Warframe,"There is only one thing you need to know about Warframe: It's free.

Oh, maybe I didn't make myself clear enough. When I say that Warframe is free, I mean, literally speaking, it is free. Still not clear enough? Alright, I'll elaborate. Apart from two different types of items - appearance items (such as skins and coloring pallets) and weapon/Warframe slots - it is possible for all players to access almost all types of in game items and entities (apart from a few that are no longer available to everyone). In this manner, it is possible for you to obtain every Warframes (characters or so to speak), every weapons, every non-visual-based items and the likes. Of course, there are conditions to fulfill, and obtaining everything will most likely take up a good portion of your time (isn't this what you are looking for?), but the point is, it is perfectly possible to play Warframe in the long run without paying a single cent. It's your choice. 

So, what is Warframe? In this game, you are basically a character known as ""Tenno"" who fights battles within a futuristic solar system. You will be teaming up with 3 other Tennos (this is a 4 player co-op game) to complete missions laid out by Lotus, a female commander issuing you orders. Nah, she is nicer than your ex-girlfriend, so don't worry about that. 

You will basically be facing three separate forces, Grineer, Corpus and the Infestation (think of the three races in Starcraft if you want to get a better idea). There are different types of missions, ranging from elimination, rescue, spy, to defense and rescue. As for weapons, basically you get to equip a primary weapon (rifle, shotgun, sniper and many others that are hard to categorize), a secondary weapon (categorization is hard for this as well) and a melee weapon (sword, mace, fist... you know the deal). As for your character, you will be using one out of the somewhat 10-ish (slightly less than 20, though the number is gradually increasing as more update comes by) Warframes. Each Warframe comes with different stats, such as self-repairing shields, like those in halo, health, energy (mana) and speed. Still, more importantly, each Warframe has its own unique set of 4 skills. These skills are great assets for the players as most of the times they will come in handy. One thing to note is that gender is preset, so those transsexuals don't have to fake their gender anymore, which is, well ... you decide if it's good or not. There are also mods (modifications) that you can insert into your weapons and Warframes to make them much stronger than they originally are. 

Oh and there are parkour. Learn how to press ""WASD"" + ""LShift"" + ""LCtrl"" + ""Space"" in fluid coordination. It will be helpful and painful, but you will definitely need them.

Simple?

Unlike many co-op shooters, Warframe definitely has its merits. One of the most apparent distinction of the game is that it has a leveling system that can be found in most MMOs. You can level up both your weapons and Warframes to a maximum rank of 30. Moreover, you can rank up your mods as well to make them more powerful. In this way, Warframe won't be a simple ""run-shoot-kill see-score go-sleep"" type of game. Never. There are things more important than that.

Another merit of Warframe is that there are frequent updates. When I say frequent, I mean FREQUENT, as in one big update per month or so. There will be new game modes, Warframes, weapons, mods ... etc. I mean, come on, who thinks that L4D2 came too fast after L4D1 is released? I do. Who is still waiting for L4D3 after all these years? I am. Who thinks that Gabe Newell should fulfill the unsaid promise of completing the trilogies of Valve games? I do. Come on, we have been waiting for L4D3 and Portal 3 and HL3, and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of waiting. This won't happen for Warframe though. The game has a gradual and comfortable pace of updating. You get new contents every now and then, and they usually blends well with the game. Usually.

Still, like most games, there are pros and cons of Warframe and I have to sincerely admit that there are shortcomings with this game when compared to other games. One major shortcoming (I won't say flaw) of this game is that it lacks a concrete story line. Apart from some trivial storytelling, there really aren't much of a tale going on. There are stories told, I'm not saying there aren't, but they are rather weak. I know, that is not their aim, and that is not really the point of Warframe, but compared to the rich (though monotonous) storyline of L4D and Portal, Warframe needs to good a better job here.

Also, the game can be rather repetitive. You know, this applies for most Coop shooters, so there really isn't much to say about this. Yeah, repetitive. 

So, in general, try Warframe. It's free. If you don't like it, drop it. Simple as that. If you do like it and if you feel that you will be playing it in the long run (like how I felt after my first 100th hours), do consider buying a little platinum to expand your weapon and Warframe slots. I bought like 19.90 USD worth of platinums. Not much, but it is the spirit that counts, right?","Very Positive87% of the 598,811 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

2537590,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024,"I definitely do not recommend this game in it's current state. I'm also in agreement with the mostly negative review status right now. A lot of major issues. I waited a few days after launch to even download the game, so I didn't get in on the issues with even being able to launch the thing, but there's still a lot wrong. The control editing is actually way worse to me than MSFS2020 was, there is no way to calibrate HOTAS, the controls that are supposed to be applied to all aircraft are not transferring between aircraft and need to be reassigned each time I fly something for the first time. Setting curves isn't intuitive at all and you cannot see movements on the page where you set curves so you are basically going back and forth between the menu and the game with trial and error. Some of the controls are a bit odd such as mixture axis 0-100% only picking up movement when your physical control is at the 50% mark and rather needing to use -100%-100% control for full range of motion. The marketplace isn't even available right now and I cannot use any of my MSFS2020 mods like I was promised. After 3 hours of trying to get things working and 2.5 hours of ""gameplay"" I've had about 10 minutes of actual flight time and only have a tiny portion of controls for the aircraft set up for basic maneuvers. The voice acting is basically just AI generated, which is fine for most of it, I wouldn't expect ATC calls to be voice acted as it would be impossible, but even for career mode where it's all scripted out. The bigger issue is they still say things like ""runway fifteen"" instead of ""runway one five"" which is EXTREMELY irritating for a flight simulator. It's made even more irritating when they were propping up how much they wanted to increase learning/training for people newer to sims or non-pilots. As a pilot myself it rattles my brain every time they make improper calls like this and it would have been simple to fix. It was a complaint people had in 2020 as well. 

Overall this feels like all of the aspects could have been add-on's for 2020 without much issue. The graphical updates certainly could have been, people were already doing that with mods. The career mode could have been as well, there's no reason a full new release was needed to add some scripting, qualifications (ratings/licenses) and a basic monetary system. The only thing I'd imagine would have needed updated would be the framework for aerodynamics. There were already mods out for banner towing and things of that nature, so it was totally possible for those to be added to 2020 as well. It just seems like this was rushed out as another title for nothing more than cash. This feels like a $20 expansion instead of a standalone title right now.

I'll be extremely hesitant to put any money into MSFS 2026 when that comes out. If they worked this stuff out before launch (already delayed) it would be fine, but still not worth the high price tag they put on this.","Mostly Negative35% of the 5,451 user reviews for this game are positive.",definitely not_recommend state agreement mostly negative status major issue waited day launch download issue able launch s_emphasizedtill wrong control editing worse msfs2020 no_way calibrate hotas control supposed applied aircraft not_transferring aircraft reassigned fly setting curve intuitive cannot_see movement page set curve basically forth menu trial error control bit odd mixture axis 0 100 picking movement physical control 50 mark rather needing 100_emphasized control range motion marketplace available cannot_use msfs2020 mod promised 3 hour trying thing working 2 5 hour 10 minute actual tiny portion control aircraft set basic maneuver voice acting basically ai generated fine expect atc call voice acted impossible career mode scripted bigger issue thing runway fifteen runway five extremely irritating irritating propping wanted increase learning training newer sims non pilot pilot rattle brain improper call simple fix complaint 2020 feel aspect add 2020 issue graphical update certainly already mod career mode no_reason release needed add scripting qualification rating license basic monetary imagine needed updated framework aerodynamics already mod banner towing thing nature totally possible 2020 rushed title cash feel 20 major addition add feature mechanic standalone title extremely hesitant msfs 2026 come worked stuff launch already delayed fine not_worth high price tag

236390,War Thunder,"War Thunder has been going downhill at a very alarming rate for the last year or so. I would have recommended the game 4 years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. 

1.57- This might be a fiarly good patch. Tons of new maps, planes, tanks, EC changes, and increased bomb damage(?). The only thing that I dont like is the complete kills on a tanks crew. It is sometimes difficult or impossible to pen a tanks hull, which means you will not get the kill if the last crew member switches to the drivers seat.


 I could see the mechanic being usefull for a tank with two crew, but have the guts and brains of your 6 friends splattered all over the tank would prevent me from freely moving around the cabin. It doesnt impact me much though, I only really play in the air war.

Edit- Alright, I think Gaijin finally did it. They have completely killed my desire to play ground forces. Complete kills are almost as worthless as the crew locks and spawn camping. At least I can still fly my planes as long as I take off within 30 seconds...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More edits- Apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier BR even more. F80s and Hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig 17s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. Random sim mode was deleted and the T-34s were given ammo that they never had. I think im done with this game for a while.



EDIT- I have been playing the game again at a friends request and I have noticed some good changes.

-They seem to have taken notice to us Simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.

   -We now have a somewhat polished version of EC mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.

  -For the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. It is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.

   -They fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more 1km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. Long range spotting was way better at the launch of 1.55, but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.


Its nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog shit we get for every patch. Its better than nothing, I guess.
_________________________________________________________________

Such a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. Here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.


* Matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. Cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors Russia in every way.

* Zero involvement with the community. Normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. These guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired REALLY bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.

* Plenty of broken promises everywhere. We were told we would have bomber internals over 4 years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. We were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. They said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. We were told the game would stop at 1952, but they are adding vehicles from the 70s because Russia always has  to one up everyone else. 

* Historical accuracy was thrown out the window. They give Russian planes lower Battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that 1944 Russian planes fight 1942 and lower German and allied planes. They also like to make Russian planes and tanks WAY more powerful than they actually were

* They keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the Allied and German forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. At the same time, we are throwing RUSSIAN documents at the devs that show how bad Russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti Russian propaganda.

* There are plenty of planes that CAN NOT STALL. Most Japanese planes and plenty of Russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. It is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.

The game's difficulty might seem intimidating at first, but as I played and learned the enemy attack patterns, the challenge further motivated me. Each victory gave me a tremendous sense of accomplishment.

The gameplay was fluid and finely crafted. The controls were responsive, and my movements directly translated to my character. It required time and practice to master the combat system, but the process was incredibly satisfying for me. The inclusion of different weapon and magic options allowed me to diversify my playstyle and provided opportunities to employ different strategies in each battle.

In terms of in-game richness, Elden Ring did not disappoint me. There was always a new area to explore, a hidden item to discover, or an intriguing character to encounter around every corner. The bosses' designs, stories, and fighting styles were remarkably impressive. Engaging in side quests and making choices to unravel the stories of characters further connected me to the game world. Additionally, the time loop system allowed me to experience different encounters and events, making each playthrough exciting.

Elden Ring's story completely immersed me. The lore and world design were profound and captivating. The backgrounds of the characters, the history of the world, and the events unfolding in this chaotic realm constantly pulled me deeper into the game, fueling my desire for more exploration.

In conclusion, Elden Ring was an unforgettable experience for me. Its beautiful gameplay, challenging nature, richly crafted world, and captivating story kept me glued to the screen for hours.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"I've been gaming for over 34 years, ever since the NES and Super Mario Bros. brought a new era of gaming to the states. I didn't know until later that the NES had helped to revive the gaming industry after a crash.

My favorite way to play video games became computer gaming in the late 1990s, with the release of games like Baldur's Gate, Ultima Online, Diablo 2, and Counter-Strike. These games were all so different from each other, but they all offered something special. Baldur's Gate had an incredible story and game-changing actions. Ultima Online was a massively multiplayer sandbox that gave gamers the freedom to do whatever they wanted. Diablo 2 had an excellent atmosphere and fast-paced ARPG action. And Counter-Strike had fast-paced action and perfected shooting mechanics as an online shooter.

Over the years, I've played many other great games that have pushed the gaming industry forward. These include System Shock, Deus Ex, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild, Final Fantasy VIII and IX, the Half-Life series, Portal, Left 4 Dead, Elden Ring, Bioshock, and The Last of Us. All games crafted perfectly and created with so much love and talent.

However, I've noticed that I've enjoyed fewer and fewer new games over time. I used to think that this was just a sign of getting older, but I realized that the problem was with the gaming industry itself. Most AAA titles now offer the same tired systems and graphics. The focus on realism has made games feel systematic & slightly lifeless as well as almost all games having some type of monetization system that just automatically makes the experience feel cheap and unmotivating. What happened to using your abilities and time to get the items that you want?

By 2023, I was basically only playing older games. They still offered a unique experience that I couldn't find in modern games. They didn't have monetized systems or focus on the realism that became so lifeless and cold. They were just well-crafted games that were made with a lot of labor and love by developers that wanted to make a great title just because they loved this industry just as much as I did.

Then I played Baldur's Gate 3. It was everything I had been looking for in a modern game. It was polished, true to the original Baldur's Gate, and free of monetization. It was a return to the old days when games were crafted to be amazing and had an experience that—once you purchase the title, once—were all available for you to explore just depending how you wanted to play the game. There are over hundreds of hours of cutscenes and it would most likely take thousands of hours and multiple play throughs to find everything this game has to offer. Each and every character feels like a completely unique being in the game, with their own voice-acted lines that they say, creating this world that feels so alive. Basically your play through will be unique to you and your character.  The combat—while turn based—still feels fast and exciting and open up's possibilities for you to brainstorm new ways to eliminate your foe. Your environment plays a big part on how you solve a battle. Hope you're not standing in water while fighting a mage with a lightning spell. And unlike a lot of modern RPG's, your actions absolutely have an effect on this world and the people that live in it. Even wearing specific items can affect those around you based on their beliefs or their relationship to you. And it's all done so well that it feels like a living and breathing world.

Baldur's Gate 3 did something different in the face of an industry that at times feels stagnant and same-y. Larian made a courageous game for gamers, as gamers. Baldur's Gate 3 is truly the pinnacle of gaming and I only hope  AAA studio's find this as a reminder of what games can truly be.

As of 2023, I realized that I wasn't growing out of touch with the gaming industry. The gaming industry was growing out of touch with itself. Baldur's Gate 3 is a beacon of light in a foggy and ambiguous time in gaming. The quality and care put into BG3 is what I thought most games would have strived to be in the year 2023.

If you're feeling like I do and you're tired of the gaming industry's monetization pitfalls and careless development, I highly recommend picking up Baldur's Gate 3. It's the type of game that made me fall in love with this industry all those years ago.

**edit** I should clear up that the playtime here on Steam does not reflect my overall playtime in BG3.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"  ESO is a nice game that lets you play at your own pace and luxury. 
It is varied enough to let you do various activities even at endgame, unlike some other MMOs.
  If you like the Elder Scrolls universe, or a medieval fantasy kind of world, you will enjoy ESO.
There are many locations that were included in the older games like Oblivion and Morrowind even some locations that are Skyrim-like. These regions and locations are nicely detailed. The graphics are very good for an MMO. I can spend my time just riding around the different locations, taking screenshots and enjoying the scenery. The amount of detail is amazing. 

  Audio and music in the game are great, with a few soundtracks from older games that add to the nostalgia.
Gameplay wise, it is fluid and not too complicated. There are a ton of quests to undertake. If you like to immerse yourself in the lore, then these quests are nice to do, as you get more exposed to the Elder Scrolls lore. 
  It is mostly a pve game, but there is a region that is pvp. Faction vs faction which can be fun, as mini armies fight around the map, attack resources, castles, or defend castles in sieges. 

  It is simple yet interesting. Definitely a game I would recommend getting, especially if its on sale.","Very Positive83% of the 123,718 user reviews for this game are positive.",eso nice let play pace luxury varied activity endgame unlike mmos scroll universe medieval fantasy kind world enjoy eso location included older game oblivion morrowind location skyrim region location nicely detailed graphic good massively multiplayer spend riding different location taking screenshots enjoying scenery detail amazing audio music great soundtrack older game add nostalgia wise fluid not_too complicated ton quest undertake immerse lore quest nice exposed scroll lore mostly versus environment region versus faction v faction fun mini army fight attack resource castle defend castle siege simple interesting definitely recommend especially sale

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"I really wanted to like this game but with each hour played I became more and more annoyed and disappointed with it. If you're a fan of the series and loved the deep world and story, you most likely will not like it either. I think newcomers who start with this game will probably like it... And some old casual fans, who really only cared about fighting a few monsters and romancing someone hot, will like it too.
This game is like Hogwarts Legacy with a Dragon Age skin applied. And while I liked Hogwarts Legacy it's not what I expect from franchise like Dragon Age.  

[b]What I liked in this game:[/b]
[list]
[*]Environtments - every zone you visit is beatuifully crafted with care. Really liked them. Especially the Necropolis.
[*]Some story moments - overall I didn't really like the story, but when it was good, it was really good.
[*]Character creator - there are a few thing weirdly limited that I don't understand. But you can make some good looking faces. Would've loved if there were more presets though.
[*]If you pick up the same item you already own, it upgrades the old one - eliminates inventory clutter.
[*]Transmogrification - if you don't like the way your gear looks, you can just change its appearance to a different one.
[*]Stabillity and Performance - only one crash during 81 hours I spent in this game. And the crash I may have caused myself by mistake.
[*]You can do all achievements on first playthrough.
[*]Warden Tomasz - The Gigachad of Weisshaupt. 
[/list]

[b]What I didn't like:[/b]
[list]
[*]No choices transfer from older games - do I have to say more? The world state you created since Origins is now gone and forgotten. Remember how they introduced The Keep to help everyone with creating custom world states for future games? Screw that I guess. Here are your 3 choices from Inquisition and one of them may not have any reflection on the story. Not to mention that during the story [spoiler] it's revealed that south Thedas gets totally obliterated. Why? Well to avoid having to adjust for choices from old games obviously. It's all a blank slate now.[/spoiler] It's just sad.
[*]Tone of the game - really... what happened here? Everyone's so jolly and happy. Old elven gods are here to destroy the world and I wouldn't be surprised if an NPC I speak with would suddenly start dancing and singing about how life is good. Nobody acts like they are really in this world.
[*]Dialogues - whatever you choose will not change the outcome of the conversation. Sometimes you talk like a bad therapist to a toddler. When you talk to your companions you can only offer support and words of encouragement. You can't tell them to buzz off, or challenge them on worldviews and ideology. It's the first time I dislike my own character because I could not choose anything meaningful to say.
[*]Combat - It's really not that bad and can be fun BUT it gets old and annoying. By the end of the game I just turned down the difficulty to one-shot enemies and be done with it. Also it feels like game expects you to play melee class. Even as a mage it feels better to play the dagger/orb combo. I wanted to play exclusively with a staff. Most of the fight was me running away from enemies to find a few seconds of break to replenish my mana or do a few normal attacks.
[*]Companions - I liked Harding because I liked her in Inquisition. Emmrich is okay and ending to his personal quest was good (at least the version I chose). Lucanis' quest feels unifinished and I forgot he's [spoiler]possesed by a demon[/spoiler]. His quests seem to forget about it too and there isn't much resolution to it. Taash is annoying and disrespectful to other people, while expecting respect from others. Davrin has a baby gryphon and that's all. I thought Bellara would be worse but actually wasn't that bad. Kinda like a discount Merril from DA2. Neve... I don't really remember much about her.
[*]Too many quests that want you to go somewhere and just talk for 5 seconds.
[*]Lack of depth in the world - there used to be so many nuances in this world. Now any edge or nuance is gone. Sanitized. It seems like the devs were afraid of offending people with a fictional world. Remember when Antivan Crows used to buy slave children and train them to be assassins? Remember how they executed their own members for failing a contract? Well now they're just a group of stylish Italian mobsters. Every faction was gutted like that.
[*]Braindead puzzles - pick up this crystal and put it on a dingus three meters away. At some point the crystal was right next to the dingus. 
[*]No replayability - I finished this game once and it feels like I experienced everything it has to offer. Choices are few and don't really change much about the story. You can't be an asshole to anyone so ""evil"" playthrough is out of the picture. And playing another class is simply not worth it to me.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"This is a good game and Arrowhead has done a great job. It feels like an actual live-service game where the players' decisions matter. The progression is well paced, and everything can be earned without paying extra with enough time and effort. The game does not feel like it wants to squeeze all of the cash out of my wallet. I get out what I put in.

However, Sony has decided to lock 170+ countries out of buying the game months after release. Luckily, people from those countries could get refunds, the entire point of this game is to come together as a community to fight threats larger than ourselves. Sony has elected to be anti-consumer and shut people out of a great game without giving a reason. 

Sony, you have stabbed not only your customers in the back, but also your coworkers at Arrowhead. You have lost a lot of community goodwill and trust. The first step (of a many, many steps) is to reverse the region-lock on Helldivers 2. The second step (of MANY, MANY steps) is to apologize to the gaming community and Arrowhead. The third step (of so many steps) is to reverse the region lock decision on the Ghost of Tsushima SINGLE-PLAYER campaign. After doing those three things, consider that the best way to make money is by making good products and ensuring that prospective customers can actually buy them. Honestly, this entire situation makes me embarrassed to own a PS4, PS5, and even your WF-C500 wireless earbuds. Be better.

Given that the game is good, I will change this review to positive if Sony comes to their senses and allows the rest of the world to Helldive.

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"Until they fix Brawl mode which is the only thing worth playing I will keep this on not recommended.  The draw/shuffle system is absolutely broken and the hidden seeds for decks so you never see certain cards(which are usually what your combos are) is a BS system that needs to be removed.   

Get ready to have every opponent waste your time while the game allows people to AFK for 5m with no penalties & even if you don't have to deal with that your opponent running a 3 color deck will get perfect mana ramp every single game while the system makes you go 12 games in a row getting mana screwed in a dual color deck(doesnt matter if you run 40, 60 or 10 land cards).   

I main golgari with mana ramp, usually 8+ creatures with mana tap, land search, artifacts etc & I still get screwed.   Rarely ever see opponents mulligan to boot, I usually have to mulligan twice every game just to get something that isn't a single land.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1]Genre: Action/Souls-like[/h1]

As a massive Dark Souls fan, I was really excited for this game, even more when I heard that G.G. Martin, creator of A Song of Ice and Fire helped with writting lore of this game. Since the game is from the creators of Dark Souls series, naturally I am planning to compare this game to it, since it has ton of similarities.  

I really enjoyed gameplay in this game. For the most of the game it's easier than rest of the souls games that I've played, and that was a bit refreshing, since I could focus more on exploring, and it was pretty chill game at first. Gameplay is pretty smooth and there are ton of fun weapons. I mostly used ultra greatsword, which I rarely use in these games, but it looks so cool and it was so fun to use. Overall it's pretty similar to previous souls games, you have weapons, shields, armors, magic, miracles, you have to worry about your equip load so you don't fat roll, you have standard stamina bar, you can fast travel and rest on sites of grace, which are checkpoints here, so same as always. Most important new gameplay mechanic are ashes, horse and you can jump (mind boggling). Ashes are basically different ghosts that you can summon to fight for you in areas where blue door icon apears. Ashes icon is almost always available in bossfights, and after finding [spoiler]Mimic Tear[/spoiler] ashes, if you upgrade it to max and plan to use it, it will make most bosses pretty easy, since upgraded ashes are stronger than you and have more HP. This is why I didn't use ashes in bossfights, I only used ashes while fighting multiple enemies. I had a rule, if boss calls a friend, I will call it too, otherwise I played fair. As for horse since the game is so big, it would take ages to travel it on foot, so that's why horse is here, and if you've ever played Darksiders 2, it works exactly like that. You can summon it almost everywhere in open areas and decide when it will dissappear. It's also easier fighting some enemies on the horse. You are also able to craft items in this game, and you are basically finding crafting materials everywhere in the world, all the time. It felt like flower picking simulator at first. There is also good tutorial in beginning of the game. Overall pretty solid gameplay, but I feel like ashes made the game way easier, and sometimes it's tempting not to use it.

Lore is pretty interesting, definitelly one of my favorite lores of the souls games. As always in souls games, you are supposed to investigate a lot, talk with npcs, write down/screenshot dialogues, read item descriptions, and then put all pieces together and make the story. Problem is cause the game is so big, it's really easy to miss the clues if you are not willing to explore every single corner of the game. I did explore a lot, but I definitelly missed important stuff, so I used wiki to collect all important lore pieces and after reading everything I think that the lore is good, and not that complicated compared to Bloodborne, which is still confusing to me. 

World design quallity is mixed for me. When we first enter the world, it looks so big and beautiful, but after exploring for a while you realise how empty this world is. It's supposed to be open world game, and open world means that you can do different stuff, but it's just bigger Dark Souls. All you can do is fight enemies, talk with npcs, loot items, craft stuff and explore this world to get more loot and understand lore better. But you could do all that before in previous souls games, it's nothing new (aside from crafting which is irrelevant). There are bunch of catacombs that you can explore, and they are all so similar. At the end of every catacomb is boss, and they are fun at first, but then they get boring. They don't help almost at all with understanding lore of the game, and don't bring you much souls. I would say it's worth doing few of them, just to try them out, and then using guides to found out in which ones are hidden achievements items. World is extremly big for a souls game, and it's really big overall. There are even whole undeground cities which I honestly enjoyed. While all this is great, I am personally fan of more interactive worlds, and there is ton of aimless wandering around here. In conclusion, while you can explore a lot, you can't actually do much, so I wouldn't call this game an open world.

Boss design. This is connected to the world design. Since the game is so big, there are ton of reskinned bosses. I've fought so many dragons, that have almost identical moveset. A lot of others optional bosses also repeat many times. There are total of 235 bosses in the game, and I can't say that I really really enjoyed more than 10-15 of them. Even some of the main bosses repeat later on. Even though I didn't enjoy much boss design in this game, there are some really good ones. 

There are around 30 quests in this game, and there are few good ones, but it's really easy to miss the clues on where to go if you are not careful, since the world is so big, and some ncps don't always give you clear clues. Some of these quests are tied to the endings of the game. There are few endings, and all except one are pretty much similar, and I didn't find any of them good tbh. After everything I would say doing side quests just to see the different endings is a waste of time if you don't care much about lore. Performances were terrible for me at first and a lot of other people, but then few patches came out, and I upgraded my PC, so it works good now, however I still had to lower some settings even though I got great setup. I am not sure how it's for other people. It took me 145 hours to get all achievements, however I restarted the game first time after 60h, so it took me 85h to complete it for the second time from scratch. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Really interesting and good lore, one of my favorite in souls games
- Pretty fun gameplay, a lot of cool weapons
- Main bosses are mostlly great
- Traveling with horse is fun cause you can just rush through boring areas if you want

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
- World design could be better, a lot of empty space, and looks kinda similar; you have green area, water area, sand area, snow area etc.But I guess this was intended, to represent empty world, it just can get boring sometimes.
- While some bossfights are great, there are a lot of reskinned bosses
- Performances problems for a lot of people at release, fixed a lot of issues in meantime, and now it works decent for me 
- Some good quests, and a lot of mediocre
- Ashes are fun, but make the game way easier

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- I didn't like the endings

[h1]Verdict:[/h1] I think that Elden Ring is a pretty good game, but I don't think it's anything new or groundbreaking, it's just a really big souls game. While the gameplay is fun, and lore is pretty good, world is extremly big, but empty and and a lot of bosses are reskinned, so the game can feel like work sometimes. I played multiplayer only 3, 4 times, so I can't comment on that. Overall I still enjoyed a game, and I am recommending it, but with the warning to expect just a big Dark Souls game.

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"[h1]A Disappointing Journey That Fails to Live Up to Expectations[/h1]

I was genuinely excited to dive into Metaphor: ReFantazio, hoping for an engaging RPG experience. As a fan of Atlus titles like Catherine, Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, and other classic JRPGs, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, the game turned out to be more of a disappointment than a bad game.

[h2] Gameplay: [/h2]

The job system in Metaphor: ReFantazio seems to imitate the one from Final Fantasy, where changing equipment allows characters to switch jobs. However, the execution falls short. Many characters find it difficult to take on different jobs due to their inherent stat growth. For example, characters with low STR (Strength) growth are ill-suited for physical jobs, making it challenging to diversify your party. This rigidity limits strategic possibilities and forces players to stick with predetermined roles.

Moreover, several characters join your party almost at the end of the game. In an RPG where character development requires significant investment and grinding, introducing new characters so late makes it hard to develop any interest in them. You're less inclined to invest time in leveling them up, especially when you've already built up your main team. As a result, the initial main characters remain the most commonly used throughout the game.

Additionally, some of the more advanced jobs unlock too late to be worthwhile. By the time you gain access to these ultimate jobs, you've likely already settled into other job branches out of necessity. The late unlocking of these jobs adds unnecessary pressure in the early stages, forcing you to manage without them for most of the game and diminishing the excitement of unlocking new abilities.

[h2] Storyline and Narrative: [/h2]

In the later stages, the plot takes a downturn, becoming overly simplistic and lacking depth. The initial excitement dwindled, and I found myself losing interest. It felt more like a chore to finish the game, driven only by the desire to see it through because I had already invested time into it. The story starts strong but ends anticlimactically, leaving many plot threads unresolved.

[h2] Character Development: [/h2]

Many characters require an excessively long time before their side quests become available again. This prolonged gap made it difficult to stay connected to their individual stories. For some less prominent characters, I couldn't even remember what had happened previously, making their narratives feel disjointed and forgettable. The lack of continuous engagement with these characters weakened the overall narrative and my connection to them.

[h2] Visuals and Art Style: [/h2]

While the game boasts a distinctive art style, the graphics feel outdated, especially when playing at 4K resolution. The visuals resemble games from the PS4 era, lacking the polish expected from modern titles. Although some environments are creatively designed, graphical inconsistencies and generic settings occasionally pulled me out of the immersive experience.

[h2] Sound and Music: [/h2]

Some of the music tracks are genuinely good and enhance the atmosphere during key moments. These pieces stood out and provided brief highlights in an otherwise unremarkable soundtrack. Unfortunately, the overall audio experience doesn't leave a lasting impression, and the voice acting doesn't add much depth to the characters.

[h2] Overall Experience: [/h2]

Despite its promising start, Metaphor: ReFantazio fails to deliver a satisfying RPG experience. It attempts to emulate elements from successful franchises like Final Fantasy but doesn't capture the essence that made those games great. The restrictive job system, unbalanced character progression, and late introduction of new characters and advanced jobs diminish the overall enjoyment.

[h2] 5/10 [/h2]

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Where to start hmm... Came back to ESO after 6 Years, a bunch of things changed, mainly I no longer have stupid fps issues and load screen issues. You will be able to run on max settings in PvE hitting around 100-140 fps (Tweaked the ini file to fix the mouse sensitivity issue) with an RTX 3080. Not sure how bad PvP is because I don't do PVP.

Here are my opinions about the game.
1. Music. A little biased because I am a fan of game OSTs. ESO's OST are epic and memorable, especially the one when you are doing dolmens. 

2. Quest and lore. Quests are all fully voice acted, even the side quests. There are tonnes of quest in this game, even if its just the base game. There are 3 different factions but, you can only choose the races under each faction to play unless you have the DLC/addon to have the freedom to select a faction with any race.

3. NPCs. One tip for people who love talking to NPCs, make sure to all the quest NPCs before and after submitting the quest. They will have different things to say which makes things lively. 

4. Activities. Need a break from questing? Try fishing and get the fishing achievements. Heard there's a new card game, might be interesting for people who fancies card games. If not, read the lore books let the lore sink in or just do dungeons.

5. PvP. I don't PvP. However, Alliance wars are very very laggy due to really bad server and also the number of players doing it. Imagine a large scale war with 3 factions in the same instance.

6. PvE. Quest mobs are easy to kill, quest bosses are also fairly easy. For solo content / questing, I recommend the Two handed skill tree for the temporary shield as it scales based on how many mobs hit in a swing (perfect time to recast buff/heals while soaking dmg.) World bosses are solo-able with a decent build and some resource management. If you want more challenge, try doing Dungeons and Trials.

7. Matchmaking. People say its bad and personally, I think its pretty bad. Queue times are long. Your best bet is to go to a highly populated zone like Craglorn, ask in chat to join trials.

8. Trials, Dungeons and Arena. Probably the end game goal for PvE to farm for your set items. Normal dungeons are fairly easy with a slight exception of Veteran dungeons. You probably want to gear up and have proper builds and a proper team of 1 tank, 2 damage dealers and a good healer. Trials are larger dungeons that requires 12 players to complete. Each different trials have their own specific mechanics so best you google and study up before joining one. Everyone has their own role in a trial and there are one shot mechanics during their boss fights. People get salty fast when wipes happen and no one is willing to teach and guide newcomers. Arenas like the maelstrom arena is where you can challenge yourself to see how good you are in PvE in terms of Gear, Skill and Resource Management.

9. Skill tree. There are 2 kind of trees in game. The actual character skill tree for your class, traits etc. The other one is your end game tree for buffs called the Champion tree. You unlock this tree when you hit level 50. 

10. Leveling. I'd say the pace is fine for playing casually. If hardcore, you can go from level 1 - 50 in an hour with buffs and gear.

11. Learning curve. Not that great for people who never played RPG games. Initial tutorial is fine but after throwing you into the world, it will be the classic way of playing an RPG game which is not that great for people now a days (i guess). I guess in my opinion, people now a days prefer the hand holding in learning the ropes rather than explore on your own kinda thing. This can be daunting for new players like the crafting skill tree in terms of what does it do, how to level them, researching traits, trait crafting etc. Personally I think RPG games are all about exploring what you can do in the world and experiment and theory crafting. Let your imagination run wild and see how far you can go. 

12. Subscription. My take on the subscription is that if you think you are able to commit playing this MMO for awhile, go for it. If you are just playing casually, you can do without the subscription. The main attractive part about the subscription is the crafting bags. Resources/ materials for crafting will be stored in the premium bag that has unlimited slots. It helps out a lot if you love hording gathered materials during your adventures. If not, the good ol' pack mule characters work, which means you have to worry more about inventory management. 2nd attractive part is that it unlocks DLCs which you don't own. Personally, I think you can do without them if you are playing casually, having fun exploring and killing stuff around. Plus, tonnes of quests for other factions are available for you to complete!

13. Server. Two servers are available for your choosing, NA and EU. Pick the one with the best ping and go with it. People in asia playing in NA or EU servers will get from 240 ping to 360 ping. Playable but frustrating if you are very very sensitive about lag. Personally, it didn't bother me much when I'm doing veteran trials and dungeons. It will be a different story in PvP because in PvE, you know what is going on, not in PvP where anything can happen. Zenimax says they are upgrading their EU servers at Q1 2023 but we will see how much of an improvement we get.

14. Guilds. There are Role Playing guilds (RP Guilds), PvP guilds, Casual guilds and trader guilds. Join whichever you fancy. I find casual guilds to be the best as there are a mix of players who are knowledgeable, willing to teach and most important of all, friendly, respecting and knows how to have a good time.

15. Premium currency. Only spend when you have disposable income. 

Closing notes ( I guess ?)
Great fall back game to scratch the RPG itch for casual gamers. 
For more serious gamers out there where min maxing either makes you happy or go insane, do your due diligence and research about Elder Scrolls Online. Game is simple and very very complicated at the same time.

Do I recommend this MMO?
Yes, unless you are a toxic gamer who doesn't share and teach other players how to do the hard stuff like trials and veteran dungeons. Its an MMORPG. There are casual gamers who just want to have fun. If you want to play with the pros, be the pro and join the pros. Make sure you are their level or you will get treated like how you treat other 'casual' or 'noob' players.","Very Positive83% of the 123,718 user reviews for this game are positive.",hmm eso 6 year bunch thing changed mainly no_longer stupid shooter issue load screen issue able max setting versus environment hitting 100 140 shooter tweaked ini file fix mouse sensitivity issue rtx 3080 not_sure bad versus versus opinion 1 music biased fan osts eso ost epic memorable especially dolmen 2 task objective given non lore quest voice acted side quest tonne task objective given non base 3 different faction choose race faction play unless downloadable additional released initial launch addon freedom select faction race 3 npc tip love talking npc task objective given non npc submitting task objective given non different thing make thing lively 4 activity break questing fishing fishing achievement heard card interesting fancy card game not_read lore book lore sink dungeon 5 versus versus alliance war very_emphasized laggy due bad computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player number player imagine large scale war 3 faction instance 6 versus environment task objective given non mob easy kill task objective given non boss fairly easy solo questing recommend handed skill tree temporary shield scale based mob swing perfect recast strengthen improve effectiveness heals soaking dmg world boss solo able decent build resource management challenge dungeon trial 7 matchmaking bad personally pretty bad queue time long best bet highly populated zone craglorn ask chat join trial 8 trial dungeon arena probably goal versus environment farm set item normal dungeon fairly easy slight exception veteran dungeon probably gear proper build proper 1 tank 2 damage dealer good healer trial larger dungeon requires 12 player complete different trial specific mechanic best google study joining role trial shot mechanic bos fight salty fast wipe happen no_one willing teach guide newcomer arena maelstrom arena challenge good versus environment term gear skill resource management 9 skill tree 2 kind tree actual skill tree class trait tree buff called champion tree unlock tree 50 10 leveling pace fine casually hardcore 1 50 buff gear 11 learning curve not_that great never_played role game_emphasizeds initial tutorial fine throwing world classic role game_emphasized not_that great day guess guess day prefer hand holding learning rope rather explore kinda daunting player crafting skill tree term researching trait trait crafting personally role game_emphasizeds exploring world experiment theory crafting imagination wild far 12 subscription subscription able commit massively multiplayer awhile casually subscription attractive subscription crafting bag resource material crafting stored premium bag unlimited slot help love hording gathered material adventure not_the good ol pack mule character mean worry inventory management 2nd attractive unlocks dlcs personally casually fun exploring killing stuff plus tonne quest faction available complete 13 computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player server available choosing na eu pick best ping asia na eu server 240 ping 360 ping playable frustrating very_emphasized sensitive delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection personally bother veteran trial dungeon different versus versus environment not_in versus happen zenimax say upgrading eu server q1 2023 improvement 14 guild role guild rp guild versus guild casual guild trader guild join whichever fancy casual guild best mix player knowledgeable willing teach important friendly respecting know good 15 premium currency spend disposable income closing note guess great fall scratch role itch casual gamers serious gamers min maxing make happy insane due diligence research scroll simple very_emphasized complicated recommend massively multiplayer yes unless behaving disruptive offensive unsportsmanlike manner gamer share teach player hard stuff trial veteran dungeon massively multiplayer role casual gamers fun play pro highly skilled experienced join pro treated treat casual inexperienced unskilled player_emphasizeds
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I've never been an MMO player. Briefly played Tera - liked it but found progression slow - and briefly WoW - disliked the combat, just felt like button mashing. I also played Mabinogi for a short while and really disliked the game's mechanics. One day I felt the urge to play one and I knew a friend was planning to start this so I bought it but neither of us started. 9 days ago a friend of mine was looking for people who wanted to start and I decided that if it was in my steam list I may as well try it out. I am now 95.9 hours in according to steam and I love it. I've just hit level 50 and got my Paladin armour and I'm still looking at all the content coming up. As I speak server is going down to patch even more content into the game. So here's the detailed review:

[b]Story[/b]

The story is a good one as far as MMOs go (based on my limited experience). I'd equate it to WoW in some ways as FFXIV builds off of an already established lore but is still extremely easy for new players to get into. I don't want to say much about it but Square Enix really put work into making a good story. It teeters a bit at times, especially around the middle (lv30-40 is a bit slow) but it's very enjoyable if you get into it.

[b]Classes[/b]

Combat classes are fairly traditional: tank, support, ranged DPS and melee DPS. Still within these wider definitions, each individual class is fairly unique. To add to this you are not restricted to the classes that you pick at the beginning of the game. You will unlock the ability to train any and all classses as you wish which allows for a lot of flexibility. But ""Oh, the grind ¬¬"" you say. Nope, all classes trained beyond the first receive exp gain bonuses which really speeds up the process. This is alongside the quick levelling options which I'll discuss in a later section. 

There's more though! All combat classses have a progression called a ""Job"" which is earned by reaching a certain point in the story, getting a class to lv30 and the corresponding second class to lv15, and then finishing the job quest. It's actually really easy to do and it encourages you to try a different role.

All combat classes are unique and don't overlap much at all which is great.

As for crafting classes, there's a fair few of them and I have limited experience of them right now but crafting itself isn't just sit there and wait for things to appear. There's an active process and is fairly enjoyable. Just like the combat classes, new skills are unlocked and it becomes a sort of strategic minigame. Quick synthesis for bulk items is available as well so you don't have to do it for each item.

Still I can see crafting becoming tedious. repetitive and boring at some point but that's no different from any other mmo. Also, unlike the combat classes, the crafting classes aren't really unique.

[b]Combat[/b]

The combat system is targetted, which honestly I was sceptical about when first going in as I'm not a big fan of targetted combat but it grows on you. This is mostly to do with how the game feels since you really have to think about movement, positioning, skill orders, skill timing etc. from more or less the beginning of the game. This is a big deal and playing the first 20 or so levels in WoW feels boring and just mashing buttons in a certain order. The 2.5sec global cooldown adds to the strategic element of it too. You have more time to think and decide what move would be appropriate, but you also have a longer window to be punished for choosing the wrong skill. I honestly think this is way more fun and interesting compared to other games with a much smaller global cooldown.

Another important point is that this game is very controller friendly. It's on the PS3/PS4 with cross platform support so that would be why. I personally play with a controller and it feels very smooth. I don't feel too overwhelmed with skills and I've unlocked all of them for my job with 3 cross skills in use as well (I have 2 full hotbars but it's very easy to switch between them). It's down to preference in the end but the option is really nice to have.

[b]Levelling[/b]

There are so many different ways to level it's crazy. Though the main story quest is compulsory, there are loads of side quests available.

If you think quests are repetitive you can switch over to doing FATES which are events that spawn that give gil (money) and experience to everyone that completes them based on the level of participation.

If that's boring there are many different dungeons to do with solid exp gain on all of them. Duty roullete will give you bonus exp once a day so deffo worth doing that.

No? Then you can do levequests which are contracts to do certain things in certain places which you can get by using one of your levequest allowances (which refill regularly). Levequests are available to crafting classes too and are considered the fastest ways to level them.

Still not enough? Then Guildhests might be for you. These are very similar to levequests but you're put into a duty (instance) with a party and asked to do it as a group. There's a daily bonus on guildhest roullete as well so that's good.

Also, the first time you do a certain dungeon, levequest or guildhest you'll be granted bonus exp which is always a definite plus.

Still too slow? Not enough content? Too repetitive? Well if you're that hard to please then I guess I should tell you that there are these things called logs which grant bonus exp for doing certain things. A hunting log will ask you to kill x number of y, while a crafting log will give you the list of everything you can craft. The king of all these is the challenge log which refreshes weekly and gives you a lot of exp for completing tasks like ""complete 3 dungeons"" or ""complete 5 levequests"".

Honestly there are so many different ways to level that players can pick something that suits them and though some can get repetitive they're fun for the most part.

[b]Endgame[/b]

You only need to google the game to see the amount of post lv50 content. The game's been out for about a year and there are things constantly being added. The first expansion is coming out soon so keep an eye out for that. Most people will tell you that lv50 is just the beginning, and they're probably right. I'm only just getting into the endgame and I look forward to everything coming up.

[b]Price[/b]

Well. This is the one major downside I see to the game. It's very expensive. Though nothing new for an mmo, it is a pretty heavy financial commitment compared to most other steam games out there. Especially considering you can get Tera, Mabinogi, and loads of other mmos for free now. You can buy gametime online from other sellers for a bit cheaper but it's still expensive. I suggest playing the trial to give you a better understanding of whether you'll enjoy it. I highly suggest it and will be playing it, but I can appreciate that a few years ago I could never afford to play a game like this.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

I honestly think this is the first mmo to seriously impress me with its ability to keep you interested. It doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it leave you with nothing to do. Bosses are often really cool and have interesting mechanics, even from an early point in the game. I really do feel that besides the price this game is practically perfect. It's a great game - buy it if you can.","Very Positive87% of the 71,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",never_been massively multiplayer briefly tera liked found progression slow briefly wow disliked combat button mashing mabinogi short disliked mechanic urge play knew friend planning bought neither_of started 9 day ago friend mine wanted decided 95 9 hour according love 50 paladin armour speak computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player software fix bug balance add feature detailed good far mmos based limited equate wow way ffxiv build already established lore extremely easy player square enix good teeter bit time especially middle lv30 40 bit slow enjoyable class combat class fairly traditional tank support ranged damage per melee damage per wider definition individual class fairly unique add not_restricted class pick beginning unlock train class wish allows flexibility oh grind nope class trained receive exp gain bonus speed process alongside quick levelling option discus section combat class progression called earned reaching certain class lv30 corresponding class lv15 finishing task objective given non easy encourages different role combat class unique overlap great crafting class fair limited crafting sit wait thing appear active process fairly enjoyable combat class skill unlocked sort strategic minigame quick synthesis bulk item available crafting tedious repetitive boring no_different massively multiplayer unlike combat class crafting class unique combat combat targetted honestly sceptical not_a big fan targetted combat grows mostly feel movement positioning skill order skill timing beginning big deal 20 level wow feel boring mashing button certain order 2 5sec global cooldown add strategic element decide move appropriate longer window punished choosing wrong skill honestly fun interesting compared game smaller global cooldown important controller friendly ps3 ps4 cross platform support personally play controller feel smooth overwhelmed skill unlocked 3 cross skill 2 hotbars easy switch preference nice levelling different way crazy task objective given non compulsory load side quest available quest repetitive switch fate event player enemy enter world gil completes based participation boring different dungeon solid exp gain duty roullete bonus exp deffo worth no_then levequests contract certain thing certain place levequest allowance refill regularly levequests available crafting class considered fastest way not_enough guildhests similar levequests duty instance party asked group daily bonus guildhest roullete good certain dungeon levequest guildhest granted bonus exp definite plus slow not_enough repetitive hard please guess thing called log grant bonus exp certain thing hunting log ask kill x number crafting log craft king challenge log refreshes weekly give exp completing task complete 3 dungeon complete 5 levequests honestly different way player pick suit repetitive fun endgame google post lv50 thing constantly major addition add feature mechanic soon eye lv50 beginning probably endgame forward price major downside expensive massively multiplayer pretty heavy financial commitment compared game especially considering tera mabinogi load mmos gametime seller bit cheaper s_emphasizedtill expensive suggest trial understanding enjoy highly suggest appreciate year ago never_afford play conclusion honestly massively multiplayer seriously impress interested overwhelm nor_does leave boss cool interesting mechanic early besides price practically perfect great

2183900,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","As a long-time fan of the Warhammer 40K universe and someone who enjoyed the original Space Marine, Space Marine 2 has completely blown me away!

From the moment I stepped into the boots of Captain Titus once again, I was hooked. The combat is absolutely brutal in all the best ways. Whether you're smashing through hordes of Tyranids with a chainsword or mowing them down with bolter fire, the action is fast, fluid, and incredibly satisfying. The melee and ranged combat balance feels perfect, and pulling off those savage executions never gets old.

The visuals are a massive leap forward compared to the first game. The environments are gritty and detailed, really capturing the grimdark essence of the 40K universe. Whether you’re fighting in ruined cityscapes or alien-infested hives, it all looks stunning and immersive.

One of the biggest highlights for me is the coop multiplayer. Playing with friends and unleashing the wrath of the Emperor as a team is an absolute blast. The teamwork and coordination required to survive against the swarms of enemies really elevates the experience, making it feel like you’re part of a true Space Marine squad.

Graphics 9/10
Gameplay 9/10
Performance 7/10

427520,Factorio,"This is a game about managing your own spaghetti you call a factory while a crap load of bugs want to step on and destroy everything you know and love. This game will steal your soul,chew it up, and spit it out just as you realize your 10 minute gaming session was 10 hours. Loads of fun and well worth the price not to mention it is continuously updated with newer and better things. I played this for years and when i blinked there were tanks and spider mechs added so i'm sure the developers have your best interest in hand.

238960,Path of Exile,"Simply the most in-depth Hack'n'Slash out there and the best according to me. Character customization is top-notch and replayability is huge. I have a little bit over 1k hours played on it (did not link the game to my steam account immediately) and I still  have many things to discover. However, it is a ""hardcore game"" less accessible than Diablo 3 or others games.

Pros:
- Huge passive skill tree offering in-depth character customisation
- Interesting spell customisation using gems (close to FFVII's materia system)
- Interesting trading system relying on barter only (no gold or any other in-game currency)
- Interesting crafting system allowing to modify dropped items
- Game is very skill based (rare for a hack'n'slash!)
- Very little Faceroll/OP builds, almost every build has drawbacks and strength

Cons:
- Can be hard to get into: trading system can seem overwhelming and in-game mechanics are quite complicated so use of the wiki and forum is much advised
- Animation can seem clunky at the beginning and game seems to play slow at the beginning
- Player can feel like reaching a gear-ceiling at the beginning of end-game if playign self-found (much better since Forsaken Master's 1.2 update though)

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"Posting this here, since Activision is re-branding to shake off the bad PR.

SBMM is creating some severe issues, leading people to think there is Skill Based Damage, but it doesn't stop there. The game is completely inconsistent on a technical level. Depending on the time of the day, your shots will do a different amount of damage to AI and players, there's plenty of proof if you look around online OR simply play the game and experience the frustrations of these co-op employee ran servers.  Every patch to fix bugs that I never had, I then would get in the bug that the patch apparently ""fixed."" Meanwhile serious bugs and hacking exists, that the team closes their eyes to and they push you $20 skins.

If you want to yuck it up and shoot some people, play the free version and add it to your rotation of games. I strongly suggest that you do not pay for this game.  If you make even a reasonable wage at 20 dollars an hour, you're still pissing away 3 hours of your 40 hour paycheck, just to be disappointed and have another over-marketed failure replace this.  Not to mention, any skins or battle passes are not worth the money, due to the high level of issues, bugs, crashes, and lack of transparency with the company, etc. 

They promised their community that they were going to break the annual cycle and let this run for two years.  Some folks bought the game due to the promise - Turns out, that's a lie and the next game will be out shortly.  It was all just a ploy to get you to purchase a game that they will intentionally trash, just to hype up another dumpster fire to bring in more money next year.  

Activision does not listen to their community, nor do they care. We are ""retention numbers"", a paycheck and good for their stock listing, that's it.  I have played COD since before many of you were alive.  I have uninstalled MW2 and will not play any further COD releases in the future. I was optimistic with their new approach to a COD game, but once again, I was let down by a company that panders to whatever makes them money.

This company is in it only for your money, not to create a quality game.

They hard coded a bug where you could speed the game up so travel time didn't feel so slow and now it slows the game. This change was made AFTER the demo. The fix to use the glitch is to turn VSYNC off and play in windowed mode.

Quests don't warn you before selling a quest item.
If you click on a building with left click, it eats all of your hard earned resources you didn't mean to dump into it.

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"After roughly 139 hours spent in the game, I’ve learned one thing; the longer you play, the more irritated you become. The game was enjoyable at first. It’s been a long time since I’ve played an MMO, so I was excited to get back into the saddle, and from that, I allowed a lot of the little bugs and inconveniences to slide. But now, at level 45, those little inconveniences have begun to eat away at me. Tonight was the final straw for me. 

I have a lot of grievances with this game, but the abhor respawn rate is the thing that has pushed me away. I’m literally having to sweat to stay afloat in most areas. The NPCs respond so quickly that I have no time to recover before they respawn again. I have died repeatedly because the mobs are so tight-knit, and by the time I’ve dps’ed a group down, another group aggros, and by the time I’m done with that group, I’m nearly dead… and the previous group is back up. Frankly, it’s stressful and not remotely fun. And to add to that, apparently there are NPCs that can get back up after you kill them. …So between the endless respawns, clustered enemies, and ‘second-phase’ NPCs… I just can’t anymore. If I wanted this kind of torture, I’d go play Dark Souls.

And while this is not the only problem, it’s the one that finally sent me packing.

Other problems that need to be addressed:

Travel: Jesus… the ‘expensive fast travel’ or ‘walk an entire continent’ is… too much, and frankly boring. I do not want to spend the first thirty minutes of my game-play walking over the same path. And honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever been in an MMO that didn’t have mounts.

Life Staff: This weapon should not be the only weapon in game that doesn’t scale with two stats. At least add intel so that healers can wield a fire staff and gauntlet. Otherwise, questing as a healer main is miserable.

Town Boards: Glitched currently. No matter if the company refreshes them or not, they aren’t updating.

Quest Givers: Talking to a quest giver right now is like rolling the dice. Maybe they won’t freeze you to the floor and require you to close the game, maybe they will. Who’s to say.

Dungeons: Where to start with this one? First of all, I have to create an orb with an annoyingly large amount of mats just to go in a dungeon? No. I'd rather just not go. Secondly, no trading while in a dungeon? Really? I seriously can’t reach over to one of my party members and give them food buffs? Why? This game wants to be realistic to the point of adding taxes to the game, but it’s implausible for me to hand the guy standing next to me some cream corn?? …Okay. Which brings me to my next complaint:

Taxes: I hate them. I mean, I get it, I guess. We’re establishing a new world order and with that comes taxes (I guess), but I don’t like it. I have to buy a house in order to store more stuff, but it’s going to cost me weekly gold to use it? WEEKLY? Don’t know if you guys know this, but in the real world, house/land taxes are paid monthly (or as a yearly sum). If you must have house taxes in the game, can we at least make them monthly?

Company Storage: Why is this not a thing? Whenever I craft meals or material, I have to text a company member in real life and tell them to log on to get it. It would be so much easier if I could just put it in a company shared storage for them to pick up later. I was genuinely surprised that there wasn’t a ‘guild bank’ when my friends and I created a company.

Item Drop: Bind on Pick-Up items… there are too many of those, and not a good idea for group dungeons. If I’ve just spent 2+ hours in a dungeon with others, and an item drops for me that would be good for the tank, I should be able to give that item to the tank. More often than not we get so many items another group member could use… and we can’t do anything with it because of the BOP. So, we’ve wasted hours, because dungeons in this game aren’t good for XP. You barely get any. In my personal opinion, BOP should only activate once you leave the dungeon.

There is undoubtedly more that I’m forgetting to mention, but the gist of it is this: The game feels like it is still stuck in beta while the quality of life slowly sinks into the toilet. I truly enjoyed this game at first, but lately it is a struggle to log in. And when I do, I don’t want to do anything, because the respawn rate is a struggle. That coupled with only two types of quests (search chest/kill stuff)… the game isn’t worth it right now. I truly hope that changes. But until it does, it’s not enjoyable to play.","Mixed68% of the 243,329 user reviews for this game are positive.",roughly 139 hour spent learned longer play irritated enjoyable long massively multiplayer online excited saddle allowed bug inconvenience slide 45 inconvenience begun eat tonight final straw grievance abhor act enemy reappearing world defeated rate pushed literally sweat stay afloat area npc respond quickly no_time recover act enemy reappearing world defeated died repeatedly mob tight knit damage per ed group group aggro group nearly dead group frankly s_emphasizedtressful not_remotely fun add apparently npc kill endless respawns clustered enemy phase npc anymore wanted kind torture play dark soul not_the problem finally sent packing problem addressed travel jesus expensive fast travel walk continent frankly boring not_want spend thirty minute play walking path honestly t_emphasizedhink massively multiplayer online mount life staff weapon not_be weapon scale stats add intel healer wield fire staff gauntlet questing healer miserable town board glitched currently no_matter company refreshes not_they updating task objective given non giver talking a_emphasized task objective given non giver rolling dice maybe freeze floor require close maybe dungeon orb an_emphasizednoyingly large mat dungeon no_i rather not_go secondly no_trading dungeon seriously reach party member food buff want realistic adding tax implausible hand standing next cream corn okay brings next complaint tax hate guess establishing world order come tax guess house order stuff cost weekly gold weekly guy real world house land tax paid monthly yearly sum house tax monthly company storage not_a whenever craft meal material text company member real life log it_emphasized easier company shared storage pick genuinely surprised guild bank friend created company drop bind pick item not_a good idea group dungeon spent 2 hour dungeon others drop good tank able tank not_we item group member bop wasted hour dungeon good xp barely personal bop activate leave dungeon undoubtedly forgetting mention gist feel stuck pre release version available testing quality life slowly sink toilet truly enjoyed lately struggle log the_emphasized act enemy reappearing world defeated rate struggle coupled type quest search chest kill stuff worth truly hope change not_enjoyable play

1283700,SUPERVIVE,"This is a fantastic game!  It feels a little overwhelming at first, but very rewarding as you improve and get better.  The game has a lot of depth, every hunter has their own special flavor, and the squad based gameplay makes the game feel very balanced.  

I find myself having fun messing around just as much as trying to lock-in and get sweaty.  The chaotic nature of the game makes every lobby different, but as you get a better understanding of the game mechanics, you'll love how much you can still control.  

I recommend this game to everyone that ever had a MOBA background, but aren't as much into the 3rd person and FPS Battle Royales out there.  Everything needing to be a skill shot allows for some much outplay potential.  Team fights can be both very extended skirmishes or instant wipefests depending on the skill of all squads involved as well as what powers and items are in their arsenals.  

I haven't been this excited about a game in a long time, and all of the top players of this game have been so kind and informative.  The developers are so engaged with the community and show so much passion for their game that I feel so welcome in most games even as a mostly solo-queue player.  

It's a free game and you only pay for faster hunter unlocking or cosmetics, so I'd recommend everyone give it a try with your friends!  The beginning might feel a bit brutal getting started, but there are a lot of beginner guides out there to help you start strong out the gate!","Very Positive89% of the 2,849 user reviews for this game are positive.",fantastic feel overwhelming rewarding improve depth hunter special flavor squad based make balanced fun messing trying lock sweaty chaotic nature make lobby different understanding mechanic love control recommend moba background 3rd shooter battle royales needing skill shot allows outplay potential fight extended skirmish instant wipefests depending skill squad involved power item arsenal excited long top player kind informative developer engaged community passion welcome game mostly solo queue pay faster hunter unlocking cosmetic recommend friend beginning bit brutal started beginner guide help strong gate

216150,MapleStory,"Old school MapleStory player here - beta days when there were only four classes (Mage, Warrior, Thief, Bowman) and only up to 2nd Job Advancement / level cap was 60.  I played this game all the time when I was in high school and it was a total blast with friends.  It definitely had it's drawbacks (too much grind, not much to explore once you hit the level cap, etc) but I loved it nonetheless.  Eventually MS had to start expanding and eventually all my friends quit and so did I-this was probably around the Big Bang Event when a bunch of new worlds started getting added.  I only ever made it to level 84 with a Chief Bandit and then I gave up because the grind was too much and all my friends were gone :[

Fast forward about 7 years and I've decided to redownload the game out of a sense of nostalgia.  I expected it to be way too complicated and confusing to jump back into...and while it was a bit overwhelming at first, I'm finding the new maplestory experience to be very casually pleasant.  The level pacing is so much easier and it seems like there's actually a lot more to do rather than just grind on monsters all day-Some of the side content and quests are actually pretty fun and interesting (I guess it doesn't hurt that I started right in the middle of the Maple Anniversary event).  There are also way too many classes for me to even want to try out, but I'm happy with the Hayato class for now and may try out some others.  

The simple but fun cartoony visuals haven't changed much, but I can tell with the cinematics and even some voice acting (lol, like what?!) along with the personalized story quests for different classes, Maplestory has come a really long way from it's humble beginnings.  The music is as catchy and lovable as I remember it and I think I may go looking for some of the BGM online because it's just so darn good.  

There are more quests than you could possibly hope to complete, more classes than character slots, but I think all of this is kind of appealing in it's own way in that you can choose which worlds you'd like to clear out or explore and still enjoy the above mentioned good music/cartoony sequences wherever you go.

All in all, I'm glad that Maplestory is still very much accessible to someone who still regards it as a special game in their yesteryears.","Mixed63% of the 13,193 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1085660,Destiny 2,"tl;dr: If all you want is a campaign experience, playing the story until the credits roll then moving on, you won’t get much out of Destiny 2. If what you want is endgame raids, dungeons, grinding for the best rolls on the best gear, tweaking your build to take on the hardest challenges in the game, and constantly having something new to do, Destiny 2 is in a fantastic place right now, and it will scratch that itch real good.

Buckle up, kids! It’s story time. 

Back when Destiny 1 first launched, I played it beginning to end, shrugged, and moved on. I would say I didn’t ‘get it,’ but honestly there wasn’t much to ‘get’ in its launch state. Years later I heard stories about how it had all improved and gotten way better and blah blah, but I figured it was too late to come back.

Destiny 2 comes out. I grab it, play it beginning to end, shrug, and move on. Again, there wasn’t really much to ‘get’ in its launch state. You had the campaign, you had one raid, and that was about it. There wasn’t really a reason to play anymore, so I didn’t.

I kept an ear out during the first year of D2. Curse of Osiris landed with a massive thud, Warmind was better received but still didn’t sound like enough. Then towards the end of D2Y1, they had the Solstice of Heroes event, and I thought “What the heck, let’s give it a shot.” The event was built around a pretty hefty grind/chase through all of the activities in the game to get some sweet-ass armor. I liked having a long-term goal to work on. I liked having a reason to play.

That right there is the key phrase: a reason to play. Because I enjoyed Solstice, I ended up buying Forsaken, and since then, for the entire past god damn year, I have played nothing but Destiny 2. Between Forsaken and the Season Pass, there has always a reason to play. 

Maybe it’s new lore drops in the Dreaming City. Maybe it’s Iron Banner. Maybe it’s a surprise exotic quest like Zero Hour. Maybe it’s weekly raid challenges to get more chances at the best gear. Maybe it’s a new Heroic Menagerie boss that I want to down flawlessly to get closer to the Shadow Title. Maybe it’s grinding the Forges in search of that elusive Feeding Frenzy/Kill Clip Blast Furnace. Maybe there’s some sweet-ass ship in Eververse this week only and I want to build up some bright dust to buy it. Maybe there’s a new Gambit Prime map. Maybe “Lake of Shadows” is the Nightfall this week and I’m looking for a well-rolled Militia’s Birthright. 

Visions of the Nine. The Vanguard/Drifter Loyalty Quest. Pinnacle Weapons. The Mars Community Event. Reckoning Bosses are dropping Sole Survivor this week. Escalation Protocol boss is dropping the Ikelos Shotgun this week. The Shattered Throne is open. I need certain Triumphs to fill out my Tribute Hall to get Bad Juju. Nine Menagerie runs for nine Leviathan mods. This week’s Ascendant Challenge has the last egg I need to get that awesome Taken Sparrow.

For an entire year, this game has held me hostage because there is always a reason to play. There is always something to do. Only twice, in the last 365 days, have I logged in, done my Gunsmith Dailies, then sat there and said “Wow, I don’t have anything to do in Destiny today.” Once was because I had already completed everything I wanted to in Iron Banner that week, and once was six days before Shadowkeep when I had completed all of my prep (stocking bounties, planetary mats, upgrade mats, etc). 

There’s plenty of other stuff I could talk about. The gunplay is second to none, the music is fantastic, and if you’re willing to dive deep into the lore it’s friggin’ amazing… but honestly, all of that is secondary. What I absolutely adore about this game is that Forsaken and the Season Pass gave me an entire year’s worth of awesome content for $60. Shadowkeep and the new Season Pass looks to do the same. There is no better bargain in gaming.","Very Positive80% of the 615,480 user reviews for this game are positive.",tl dr a_emphasized series connected mission level form storyline credit roll moving endgame raid dungeon repeatedly performing action gain resource best roll best gear tweaking build hardest challenge constantly fantastic scratch itch real good hour 2084 http wastedondestiny com 4_4611686018468460654 buckle kid s_emphasizedtory 1 launched beginning shrugged moved honestly launch state year heard story improved gotten blah_emphasized figured late come grab play beginning shrug move launch state series connected mission level form storyline large group player tackling difficult challenge play anymore ear d2 curse osiris landed massive thud warmind received sound towards d2y1 solstice hero event thought heck shot event built pretty hefty grind chase activity sweet as armor liked long term goal liked play key phrase play enjoyed solstice ended buying forsaken past god damn forsaken season pas play maybe lore drop dreaming maybe iron banner maybe surprise exotic task objective given non zero maybe weekly large group player tackling difficult challenge_emphasizeds chance best gear maybe heroic menagerie bos flawlessly closer shadow title maybe repeatedly performing action gain resource forge search elusive feeding frenzy kill clip blast furnace maybe s_emphasizedome sweet as ship eververse week build bright dust maybe gambit prime maybe lake shadow nightfall week rolled militia birthright vision nine vanguard drifter loyalty task objective given non pinnacle weapon mar community event reckoning boss dropping sole survivor week escalation protocol bos dropping ikelos shotgun week shattered throne open certain triumph fill tribute hall bad juju nine menagerie run nine leviathan mod week ascendant challenge last egg awesome taken sparrow held hostage play twice last 365 day logged gunsmith daily sat wow today already completed wanted iron banner week six day shadowkeep completed prep stocking bounty planetary mat upgrade mat plenty stuff talk gunplay music fantastic willing dive deep lore friggin amazing honestly secondary adore forsaken season pas gave worth awesome 60 shadowkeep season pas look no_better bargain gaming

1085660,Destiny 2,"Until the senior leadership team (SLT) and Pete Parsons resigns, I see no point in continuing to play this game.

SLT are solely responsible for the current state of Destiny that has been slowly simmering up until this point. Few Examples here:

- A downright terrible and offensive Lightfall expansion (that cost $50 at launch BTW)
- Lack of consistent ritual content, it took HOW MANY YEARS AND EMPTY PROMISES to get more Crucible maps? 
- The past two or so years have had issues with power creeping and loot feels less and less meaningful each season. Why bother chasing new stuff? its too late to address this now.
- Seasonal content structure is stale and boring. People are tired of playing boring seasonal activities that irrelevant and throw away after a season. This has been a recurring thing since Season TWO.
- Nobody at Bungie can decide if the non endgame content should be hard or easy. Constant whiplash of buffs and nerfs, its impossible to keep up. 
- Predatory monetization and over abundance of micro transactions. $50 expansions with $50 deluxe editions. $20 armor sets. Like when is enough?
- Inconsistent quality of story telling and plot delivering. How can this be some sort of epic conclusion when the past 9 years have seen one good campaign (The Witch Queen) and everything was mediocre to good at best? Hell, before Beyond Light, a large chunk of the story telling was in lore books hidden away. No matter how The Final shape ends up, good or bad, will it feel fulfilling? Hell no!
- The lack of the new player experience. This has been a problem since they vaulted a bunch of content in Beyond Light. Its been over 3 years since that happened HOW is there STILL no adequate new player experience? People have been asking for this and we still have yet to see anything meaningful.


I could keep going but this is off the top of my head. I'm so tired of the ""we hear you"" and promises that never get fulfilled. SLT could have led their team of very talented developers to fix and address the game's core pain points. But they are too busy ignoring their own team's feedback and player feedback. Instead, they are figuring out what the best way to further monetize and exploit players for more money is. 

I will no longer support Destiny or Bungie until their SLT is gone. They think they know what is best for the game but they have zero idea what is needed for a healthy state of the game and refuse to change. And when their vision fails, they layoff the people who implemented their vision instead of taking responsibility. How is that fair? Destiny is one of the best examples of a ""what if"". So much missed potential due to a few individuals who seek profit and money over anything else. Look at what happened at 343i, they cleaned up shop and Halo Infinite is slowly and surely getting into a better spot. Thats what happens when you put the person who led the fix of the disastrous Master Chief Collection as studio head.

I love this game. I hate saying this as if its some sort of +1 over other people to make my opinion worth more than others, but up through Season of the Deep, I was playing every single season / content drop since the Destiny 1 beta (except season of the worthy). But I am SO tired of the constant whiplash of good times and bad times, so its time to stop for good. It shouldn't have to be this way. I have met some great people playing this game and it sucks I cannot continue to play Destiny with them. Some of my favorite gaming moments and memories are from this game. But in its current state, stay away from this game, especially new players, there are way better ones out there that respect your time.","Very Positive80% of the 615,480 user reviews for this game are positive.",senior leadership slt pete parson resigns no_point continuing play slt solely responsible state slowly simmering example downright terrible offensive lightfall major addition add feature mechanic cost 50 launch btw lack consistent ritual took year empty promise crucible map past year issue power creeping item reward dropped defeated enemy feel meaningful season bother chasing stuff late address seasonal structure stale boring tired boring seasonal activity irrelevant throw season recurring season bungie decide non endgame hard easy constant whiplash buff nerfs impossible predatory monetization abundance micro transaction 50 expansion 50 deluxe edition 20 armor set inconsistent quality telling plot delivering sort epic conclusion past 9 year good series connected mission level form storyline witch queen mediocre good best hell light large chunk telling lore book hidden no_matter final shape end good bad fulfilling hell no_the lack problem vaulted bunch light 3 year happened no_adequate asking meaningful top tired hear promise never_get fulfilled slt led talented developer fix address core pain point busy ignoring feedback feedback figuring best monetize software loophole allows player gain unfair advantage player no_longer support bungie slt best zero idea needed healthy state refuse vision fails layoff implemented vision taking responsibility fair best example missed potential due individual seek profit else happened 343i cleaned shop halo infinite slowly surely spot thats happens led fix disastrous master chief collection studio love hate saying sort 1 worth others season deep single season drop 1 pre release version available testing except season worthy tired constant whiplash good time bad time good met great suck cannot_continue play favorite gaming moment memory state stay especially player one respect
427520,Factorio,"This review is coming from a person who loves games with micromanaging and automation like Dwarf Fortress and Space Engineers. I really needed something new to play, as I got bored with Space Engineers's lack of endgame stuff, and every research I did, factorio ended up showing up.

I saw the reviews on steam. People asking not to buy this game because it's a huge timesink and it ruins lives. I tried not to buy it, I really did. And so I didn't buy it, I downloaded the demo.

Huge mistake. The game is so freaking good that it grabbed my interest just with its demo. I finished the demo and bought it. I told myself ""no, I will control myself. I will do the things I need to do during the week and will only play factorio a few hours each night"". I did the unbelievable achievement of donwloading the full game and then going to bed without playing it. On the next day I managed to do my important, productive stuff, kind of. Then I told myself ""well, I deserve a small break"". That's when it started.

The game, as some youtube reviewer said, is pure cocaine. You can't simply stop playing, there's always something more to do. It's pure yak shaving: ""Oh crap i'm running out of coal. Better explore to find another coal deposit"". ""Oh shit I need a car for that. Gotta research the automobilism tech"". ""Oh shit for that I need some fancy science packs that I'm still not producing. Gotta get some more furnaces smelting that iron!"" ""Goddamn the biters are attacking my walls again. I need to make an automatic ammo-producing facility so I can auto refill the turrets"" ""Now i'm running out of power. Better make some more steam engines"" ""Ok what was I doing again? Oh yeah the automobilism tech. Ok I just researched it"" ""...For what did I research it, again? Oh yeah to explore and find some more coal deposits"" ""Ok now I found some coal deposit. Wait there's a huge nest next to it. I need to destroy it. But I need some more firepower - I need to research tanks"" ""Ok wait now I need more copper. Gotta make more drills and furnaces."" ""Well i'm also running out of stone to make the furnaces, gotta improve my stone mine"" and this goes on and on... as I said - pure yak shaving but it's NOT a bad thing, because you feel good doing each and every one of those things - by doing them you're improving your factory and making the game more practical - never have I played a game where my progress could be measured and felt so clearly. This is like the feeling of progress you get from playing those idle games like cookie clicker, but this is so much more fun than idle games, because it has idle game elements but you can manufacture tanks and trains and make huge operations - the ""idle"" part of factorio is that after you start automating things, your factory does everything for you - at the start you're mining coal and iron by hand and placing the manually on furnaces, by mid-late game you have robots that build structures and move items for you, huge facilities that manufacture every kind of item in the game - each with their own destination, most to be manufactured into something else, which will definitely have some kind of use later.

Now, remember when I said I got bored with space engineers because its lack of endgame content? I don't blame the devs, as the game is in early access (just like factorio, by the way), but factorio does something really smart to balance this. The further you move away from your spawn, bigger and more frequent enemy nests will be there. As your factory grows, so does the pollution it emmits: pollution, when it touches a nest, enrages biters and makes them attack your base. More importantly, pollution makes the biters evolve - so the small, early game biter can be killed with the starting pistol, but a behemoth, fully evolved biter, barely loses health to a machine gun turret with piercing ammo. Also, the biters can make new nests - do eventually they will start to overwhelm you, but you will have ways to defend yourself (while also enjoying the game) for a LONG time. Here's how:

In games where you can automate, farm and manufacture a lot of things like space engineers and minecraft, after you focus enough on creating a basic ""item farming infrastructure"", they become really easy - in SE you can mass manufacture ammo and missiles and fighter ships and drones after you have a basic mining setup, and in minecraft you can farm arrows and make XP grinders to get powerful enchantments and make lots of armor and traps and shape the environment to your benefit. Factorio is the first game i've ever seen of this type where you can of course mass produce weapons and vehicles and ammunition and other stuff, just like in the other games I mentioned, but the hazards evolve as you get more powerful - the amazing game designers behind factorio used a simple concept that we in the game development industry call the flow theory. The flow curve in factorio is nearly perfect: the challenges scale as you get more powerful. Simple as that. In the games I mentioned, space engineers and minecraft, they start really hard (with creatures attacking and hassling you while you're trying to get your basic base setup), but after a while they get super easy - so that is an unbalanced flow curve.

So to wrap this up, some pros and cons:

PROS:
-The game is VERY optimized - you can have a factory with thousands of items moving in conveyor belts, drones, being processed and changed, without it ever stuterring or dropping FPS
-The map is infinite (you have an option to make it finite)
-Has a great tutorial (part of it is available on the demo) and a not very steep learning curve
-Amazing graphics, reminds me of 90's games like Commandos and the first and second Fallout
-It has freaking CO-OP. Haven't hosted a server yet but I joined a friend's server - no hassle, I just put the i.p and port and bam! I was in!
-I cannot stress this enough - the game is surprisingly optimized for an early access game, I have yet to find a SINGLE bug or glitch.
-Not part of the game but for me it counts - the community, (at least on reddit) is very friendly and welcoming. Reminds me of Dwarf Fortress's or Kerbal Space Program's communities.
-The wiki is really detailed for an early access game - most early access games I play today have really crappy wikis, some with wrong information and subjective statements. 
-And I think one of the most important things is how polished the game is - not just the visuals and core mechanics - if you read the weekly blog posts, you can see that the devs care about not just big features, but small interface and overall user experience details that really help and make the game practical. I've never seen so much care taken into the actual usability of an early access game. These are really small things, that really make a HUGE difference, trust me!

CONS: 
As everyone keeps saying, this game will destroy your life. I've had it for about three days and have more than 24 hours registered on steam. On my last map, I started playing during the afternoon after programming some stuff. Time passed and I didn't notice - I accidentaly died and on the deathscreen it logged 9 freaking hours. That's when I realize the demonic potential of this game. 
Seriously. As a game developer, I gotta say Wube Software has found a great way to destroy competition -  they can put a stop in the productive life of everyone who plays their game.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"In a lot of ways, ESO is the worst kind of modern MMO. It's an easy rollercoaster ride through poorly written and incredibly shallow storylines, that trivialiizes away almost all of the content in the game, and mostly relies on a endorphin treadmill to keep people engaged. 

And yet if you approach it just as a b tier story based RPG, there is so much content here that it's easy to get a lot of enjoyment, and the fact it's all basically free makes it even more easy to recommend. 

Keep in mind though that the game completely botched its switch to a 'do anything anytime' model, and there's no in game way to actually play through its content chronologically. So if you want everything to actually make sense, you'll need to follow and online guide and play the quests in the right order, otherwise you'll be wondering why one quest is having you searching for a lost character, while another quest in the same area is literally being guided by the same character.

1203620,Enshrouded,"TL:DR: 9.5/10, best base building I've ever seen, great world, great multiplayer and connection quality, could do with a first person camera option (especially for building)

This game has the best building I've seen out of a 3D open-world non-voxel based game. The way terrain and building pieces interact is very nice, no terrain clipping when you don't want it, stuff like that. First thing I did was obviously build a grungy little cave in the side of a mountain with stone walls (it comes natural as a basement dweller) and I was expecting it to be difficult, as it would be in any other game like it, but no, the terrain tools worked flawlessly, the walls placed nice, the terrain at the entrance conformed perfectly to the walls, etc. It legitimately looked like the structure was pre-placed by the developers, that's how solid the build tools are.

The world itself in my opinion perfectly walks the line between overcrowded and empty in terms of buildings and locations, however I wish there were more flat spots for building a settlement near the starting area (small gripe, honestly just me being a picky person who loves base building.)

When the game was first announced I was worried it was going to take an MMO approach by forcing you to play on dedicated servers or singleplayer, but I was pleasantly surprised when it allowed for private non-dedicated hosting just to play with a friend or two. The hosting was very stable, I had no lag when connecting to a non-dedicated session. No tether distance to the host in non-dedicated (looking at you Ark.) Overall just a solid multiplayer experience.

9.5/10 this game is what Fallout 76 and Elder Scrolls Online should have been. Bethesda needs to take notes.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"There's been a lot of talk about size and scale, particularly in open world games. Elden Ring defies the normal (and correct) criticisms that open world games are full of dull tasks and extensively copied content. It's a game full of mechanical choices, systems in play, and rich environmental storytelling. No area of the game feels completely alike and so little feels wasted.

Elden Ring is likely to be challenging for most players, it being a From Software game. It has many of the trappings of the other Soulsborne games, but based on my own experience you are given more varied tools to deal with problems you might be having. My favorite thing about the open world nature of the game is if you are having a lot of trouble with a specific spot or boss, just go somewhere else for a bit! There's always something new to find.

The final few hours of the game are, in my opinion, weaker overall. The bosses get dirtier, stats are scaled against you MUCH more heavily in comparison to the rest of the game as well. Elden Ring suffers from what I believe is an intentional design choice that has been made since Dark Souls 1, but it's a choice that essentially results in ""First half of game ends up feeling better than second half overall.""

252490,Rust,"[h1]├ Digitals Review 👌🏻 ┤[/h1]

[b]Game Pros[/b]
• Clean menu
• Players can host their own servers off their computers for free, or pay to have it hosted on a local server
• Intricate base building system
• Hunting/Gathering 
• Day/Night Cycle
• Weather System
• Moddable
• Frequent updates and Dev blogs
• Procedural generated world
• Gives you a sense of paranoia
• Generated Biomes (Desert, Snow, Grass)

[b]Game Cons[/b]
• Game tends to lag/rubber-band if too many people are connected to the server
• Uses a lot of RAM
• KoS (Really depends on the person, but what do you expect?)
• VoIP needs work (Causes a second or two of lag after letting go of the VoIP key)
• Framerate/Crashing issues on AMD cards (Mainly on the R9 290)
• Runs on the Unity engine (Making it not the best for optomization, but the dev team is managing)
• Animals don't follow rules of physics. (They will run up walls if they feel like it)

[b]Controversial Features[/b]
• Sleeper servers (Even when you log off you are still in-game, and able to be killed. Pretty much forces you put in time to build a stable base before leaving the server. Or risk being killed.

[b]Relateable Games[/b]
• H1Z1
• The Forest 
• DayZ

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Rust can be a very fun survivial game, especially with friends. I put ""DayZ"" as a relateable game, but let me assure you they are two different games and should never be compared, other than them having a survival aspect. Rust can sometimes feel very slow pace on the official servers, so If you want to quickly build and join in on the action, id suggest a modded server with faster crafting and gathering. Overall, if you have the money, i'd suggest looking into buying this game. It is currently in Alpha, so really look into it before purchasing.

2379780,Balatro,"Game is really fun for first 10 or so hours. But as progress through the stakes (basically difficulty levels of the game) the game quickly loses its charm. Instead of introducing new challenges the higher difficulty levels instead focus on nerfing the player. This causes an extremely frustrating situation where can can spend hours playing first few hands and hoping that you get good enough jokers to continue.
Speaking of jokers, they cause another frustration. Problem is that a lot of jokers that you unlock by playing the game are really weak or very situational. Because of this instead of gaining more power as you unlock stuff you instead feel weaker and weaker as the weak jokers dilute the pool. 
Overall the basic game play is really addictive, although maybe a bit simple. But unfortunately the game falls apart after some time because of some very questionable balancing decisions.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 47,019 user reviews for this game are positive.",fun 10 hour progress stake basically difficulty level quickly loses charm introducing challenge higher difficulty level focus nerfing cause extremely frustrating situation can_emphasized spend hour hand hoping good joker continue speaking joker cause frustration problem joker unlock weak situational gaining power unlock stuff weaker weaker weak joker dilute pool basic play addictive maybe bit simple unfortunately fall apart questionable balancing decision

2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"Review after 100%.

Visuals and Sounds:
This game is genuinely one of the best-looking ARPGs I've played in recent years. The visuals and sounds are very immersive and detailed, the presentation was done so well that it would make me not want to progress but walk around, listen to the sound, and appreciate the details in the environment. Ghost of Tsushima was another one close to this level of stunning visuals but with a different artistic approach, it was beautiful in a way that's artificially enhanced to a point beyond realistic, but I don't feel that in BM:W, and honestly I prefer this art style more, not every piece of maps has to scream gorgeous, if the environment is to be mono-toned then it should be, that's what makes a game immersive. Even in mono-toned maps, because there are details everywhere, the game never felt boring to look at. 

The music and sound effects in the game are overall very good, not something out of this world but very polished, I would feel the different atmosphere throughout the game, whether during exploration, cut-scene or a boss fight.

Combat:
Combat is fluid and satisfying, there is no input action queue so you will need to pay attention to what your character is doing instead of just smashing buttons, which is fine otherwise the game would be too easy. Sometimes the input not registering in fights would get me killed but overall it's a very minor issue. This game also lacks a bit in the variety of weapon arts/moveset compared to similar games in this genre but overall it's still solid. 

Gameplay:
Boss variety is probably one of the best out there, no re-skinned clone and each encounter is a unique experience. Most of the boss designs are based on Chinese Mythology or Journey to the West with only very few exceptions, and it's such a treat to see how many were put in the game. The only issue for me was some of the bigger bosses' hitboxes were done poorly, mainly just Hundred-Eye, other than that they were all fun to fight against.  

Difficulty-wise is on the easier side for those who's experienced in ARPG/Soulslike, close to God of War Balanced I would say. There were a few bosses that I felt over-tuned at first but later on, I realized it was intended for players to reminisce the experience of how Wukong fought those bosses with the help of different vessels in JTTW, which can be found in different secret areas in each map. Some might find it a ridiculous design but the story and exploration in those secret areas was probably one of my favorite things about this game since they were the original JTTW timeline and brought back so many memories. 

One of the issues people mentioned was no map in this game, it didn't bother me that much besides chapter 3, as soon as I found out the torches/braziers were the guide it became much less of an issue. There are invisible walls throughout the game that they could've done a better job indicating, but it's not an issue that I run into often enough that's ruining the experience, it's not an open-world after all so walls should be expected.

I have only had 2 crashes throughout the entire time I played, one at the beginning of the game right after the intro cut-scene, and 1 crash during the game when I was surrounded by a ton of mobs that shot different things at me. Overall performance was good except for the final chapter where I noticed a bit of performance drop, but also expected given the map design essentially forces you to render the entire map.

Story:
The story could be a bit confusing for those who are not familiar with JTTW, we play as the destined one, and as we embark on our journey to retrieve Wukong's six indriyas/sense-organs, we meet different characters that show different states of mental torment of our human nature, our greed, aversion, ignorance, pride, and jealousy. I think some of the philosophical ideas in the game around Buddhism and human nature are not only very hard to translate, but were also presented in an obscure way. It's not something to critic as everyone has different taste when it comes to mysterious lore, nonetheless, I think it still did a fantastic job at depicting some of the stories from JTTW throughout the game with all the different side quests. 

The quality of the cinematic and animation throughout the game is also insane, if you haven't read JTTW you will be missing out on the context but regardless it's still amazing to watch even if you have no idea what's going on.

Verdict:
It is by no means perfect, but despite its flaws, it's still a great and unique experience and I enjoyed it, if you like ARPGs then it's worth trying.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 732,771 user reviews for this game are positive.",100 visuals sound genuinely best arpgs recent year visuals sound immersive detailed presentation not_want progress walk listen sound appreciate detail environment ghost tsushima close stunning visuals different artistic approach beautiful artificially enhanced realistic bm w honestly prefer art style not_every piece map scream gorgeous environment mono toned make immersive mono toned map detail everywhere never_felt boring music sound effect good not_something world polished different atmosphere throughout exploration cut scene bos fight combat_emphasized fluid satisfying no_input action queue pay attention smashing button fine easy input not_registering fight killed minor issue lack bit variety weapon art moveset compared similar game genre s_emphasizedtill solid bos variety probably best no_re skinned clone encounter unique bos design based chinese mythology journey west exception s_emphasizeduch treat issue bigger boss hitboxes poorly mainly hundred eye fun fight difficulty wise easier side experienced arpg soulslike close god war balanced boss tuned realized intended player reminisce fought boss help different vessel jttw found different secret area ridiculous design exploration secret area probably favorite thing original jttw timeline brought memory issue mentioned no_map bother besides chapter 3 soon found torch brazier guide became issue invisible wall throughout indicating not_an issue ruining not_an open world wall expected 2 crash throughout beginning intro cut scene 1 crash surrounded ton mob shot different thing performance good except final chapter noticed bit performance drop expected given design essentially force render bit confusing not_familiar jttw play destined embark journey retrieve s_emphasizedix indriyas sense organ meet different character different state mental torment human nature greed aversion ignorance pride jealousy philosophical idea buddhism human nature not_only hard translate presented obscure not_something critic different taste come mysterious lore fantastic depicting story jttw throughout different side quest quality cinematic animation throughout insane read jttw missing context s_emphasizedtill amazing watch no_idea verdict no_means perfect despite flaw s_emphasizedtill great unique enjoyed arpgs worth trying
238960,Path of Exile,"This game is utterly fantastic and the most striking thing about it is that it's free.  Generally F2P games always have some kind of gimmick or hook that gets players to pay out cash for perks or bonuses but not Path of Exile.  Being a huge fan of Diablo 2 I've been waiting for something to come along that captures what made that game so great back in its time and I've finally found it.

I've played other similar titles such as Torchlight 1 and 2 and while both of them are good games in their own right this still trumps them in nearly every way possible.  Enemy variation, item customization via the gem system, skill trees, difficulty, as well as area design this game has it all.  So far I've put in around 15 or so hours and I'm still nowhere near being done yet.

216150,MapleStory,"Maplestory was one of those games that I stumbled across as a kid in the early 2000's.
In my early online career, I mainly ended up playing Maplestory, Adventure Quest, and Runescape. Out of those three, I'd say the one that still gives me the most nostalgia and fond memories is Maplestory.
Back then I had the willpower of any kid with too much energy and no life, so was able to grind for hours on end to rank up my warrior and thief for many, many years. 

I actually haven't officially sat down and played Maplestory again since the release of Hayato (around 7 years ago ). 
Now getting back into it, I (at first felt easily overwhelmed), until I was actually recommended by a few current players to play on the Reboot server. Unlike the other servers, it doesn't have any player marketplace, and (as a result) everyone is able to progress their character based on their efforts alone. From what I've seen, it appears to have a lot less p2w mechanics than the other servers, as the Reboot server provides players ways to obtain ""Maple Points"" through bossing, and doing events which (essentially) allows you to use those points to buy NX items from the shop.
There's other QoL improvements on the Reboot server (more meso, item drops, exp, etc) that you can look up in far greater detail than I can provide in one review.

Overall; While Maplestory isn't entirely the same old nostalgic game we grew up with; Reboot helped add a welcoming fresh light onto the game I used to play all those years ago. I'm now currently enjoying casually playing the game again.
I'd say if you're on a similar boat as mine; I'd say give Reboot a try and perhaps join a maple community, as they're quite welcoming and open to answering questions. 
[i](even to an old pre-big bang boomer veteran like myself)[/i]
------------------------------------------------------
[b]tl;dr:[/b] I'd say give the Reboot server a try, as it adds good QoL improvements. Can't speak on the validity/fairness of the other existing servers.

I'd also take into account what others are saying about the game client and play the game via it's own launcher, as the steam version is probably not too well optimized. That's currently what I'm doing and it's been fairly stable.","Mixed63% of the 13,193 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"Where do I start?
It hurts me, really, really hurts me to not recommend one Dragon Age game, but here we are.
The Veilguard is a good and a bad game at the same time. It starts really badly, with some of the worst dialogue I've ever seen in a game. In the middle, it gets better, and in the end, it made me cry. (damn you Bioware, why?) That's it, the end is good.

Good things: 
The combat is fun, the best combat since Origins. The game environment is perfect, truly beautiful. Treviso and Necropolis are my favorites, gorgeous work by Bioware there. The hair is also great, the best hair in a video game to this day. I love it. The voice acting is good, as expected. I had no issues with FPS, crashes, etc, the game worked really well (which is rare these days). No EA app, no microtransactions, etc.

Now, the bad:
Companions: Really, I mean, really, Bioware? How can you guys improve in one area but leave behind what you used to do best, which is well written companions?
Davrin and Emmrich are the only ones who had good companion quests and are well written (I really like them). Harding was disappointment, Neve, starts ok, but somehow in the middle she gets boring?, Bellara looks like came out from a pixar movie, Lucanis is ok I guess. And, Taash... This is one of the worst, most horribly written characters in video game history, shallow, boring, monotone, egocentric, and annoying (is like a teenager in our team). Also, her romance with ***** is horrible, it made me uncomfortable in real life some things Taash says about ******.

Romance: Where??? Where’s the romance? 18 minutes of romance, really? We can't even hug our beloved before final fight? Why?

Choices: There’s little to none. You can be nice, friendly, or cool, and that’s it. No companion hating you :D, and they basically deleted everything we did in other games except for a few choices from Inquisition.

General story: The foundation of the story is there, it's good, but poorly written. It also doesn’t help when you hear modern day dialogue in a fantasy medieval game, it breaks the immersion. You can address today’s issues in a way that does not break player immersion, ok? Or don’t you guys remember Krem? Anyways.

This game is a mixed experience for me: it is not Dragon Age and it is at the same time? Sometimes I really enjoyed it and had fun, but there were too many unenjoyable moments as well. I can't believe this is what we got after TEN years. I just hope Bioware does better with Mass Effect, but, to be honest, I don't believe it.

In the end, I finished the game with a mix feeling of sadness and disappointment.

1203620,Enshrouded,"This is based on my current run of the game, i did play it at the start of the year when it first came out so i thought i would give it another try to see how things have changed.

I find most of the game pretty decent, but the combat needs a bit of work with blocking as you need to be pixel perfect with it. 
Hallow Halls is meant to be for groups, but then why is a NPC locked behind it, what a stupid design choice. It's a huge let down if you're a solo player, as you need to out level the dungeons in order to complete them as they're ""designed for groups"" which being an open world survival craft is plain stupid.
The game isn't bad, but it does have some questionable things going on with it. Stam takes so long to recharge when running around and in combat can cause issue if you get swarmed from mobs.

If the devs fixed a few things up and made the game run a bit better ( hammers the CPU ) then i would absolutely recommend it, until then i would wait and see.","Very Positive85% of the 53,278 user reviews for this game are positive.",based play thought thing changed pretty decent combat need bit blocking pixel perfect hallow hall meant group non controlled artificial locked stupid design choice huge solo dungeon order complete designed group open world survival craft plain stupid bad questionable thing stam take long recharge running combat cause issue swarmed mob fixed thing bit hammer cpu recommend wait

Other elements contribute to the game not feeling as battle royale-y such as a knockdown shield when you're downed so you can survive a bit longer for a teammate to res you or even if you completely die a teammate can resurrect you later at a beacon.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Likes:
- Lots of high quality content to do, especially for a free to play game
- Big immersive planets to explore and get lost in
- Both pve and pvp modes are fun
- The game is very pretty
- Sound design, voice acting, soundtrack are very good
- Core gameplay mechanics are polished and satisfying, such as gunplay and jumping and riding the sparrow 

Dislikes:
-Unfriendly to new players because of the sheer amount of content they immediately have access to, with no clear indication of what the symbols on the map mean, combined with a disorganized quest menu, among other grievances. This is definitely a game where you should look up a quick beginner's guide as a newbie to point you in the right directions.
- No ingame guildfinder, you have to do that on bungie's website for some reason
- Hard to keep track of quests; you should be able to pin more than 4 quests at a time, the menu is disorganized and quests can get lost, and a lot of quests will leave you scratching your head until you just have to google how to complete it
- A few instances of missions bugging out forcing you to restart 
- Waypoints could be better and less finicky 
- Menus are not good in general

Recommendation:
If you like the idea of exploring, particularly in a space and science fiction setting, you might really enjoy this game. If you like shooting a bunch of things and chasing after loot, you will like this game. It can/does become a massive time sink however, which might be a good or bad thing depending on the player.

The black artifacting on the screen over and over is too immersion breaking.  I spent the whole time trying to ignore it so I could check out the new AI helpers.  They were awful.  I spent an hour trying to get the helper to complete a field but after several attempts, all I could manage was a strip or two and then they would do a donut before saying they were finished.  I feel like Giants will work these bugs out and  I can buy it and enjoy it then.  The game has so much potential.

2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"Journey to the West's cool story development in a game with highly detailed visuals.
I also recommend you to not skip the entire music video.

Many people say that this is not a soul-like game.
But, I think it's still a souls-like game, even many friendly features like no soul dropping mechanism (including no death penalty), many unbalanced skills that much effective against bosses, you could also “over level” the boss, and then instant (but still satisfying) dodge, etc, etc.
However, this makes the game easier to be enjoyed by new players who have never played a souls-like game before as well as existing souls-like players.

The things I note are bad (maybe just for me) in this game are that you can't find safe points easily from a distance, and the controls [spoiler]in driving the cloud[/spoiler] are bad [spoiler](there is an ascend button but no descend button)[/spoiler].

And again, since this is a ""boss rush"" game (even not every boss is an actual boss I think), you could get more relieved and satisfying feeling in defeating a boss as in a souls-like game.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 732,771 user reviews for this game are positive.",journey west cool development highly detailed visuals recommend not_skip music video not_a soul s_emphasizedtill soul friendly feature no_soul dropping mechanism including no_death penalty unbalanced skill effective boss bos instant satisfying dodge etc_emphasized make easier enjoyed player never_played soul existing soul player thing note bad maybe safe point easily distance control spoiler driving cloud spoiler bad spoiler ascend button no_descend button spoiler bos rush not_every bos actual bos relieved satisfying feeling defeating bos soul
2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"Really good game, especially if you enjoy the Persona series. 

Pros: 
Archtype (Job) system is pretty flavorful.

Eloquently written; it's not about leaning right or left, it's about the gray between and understanding the weight of your words to your audience. It's an excellently written political story front to back.

Voice acting is excellent all around. No weak points. The main villain did an incredible job for their first VA role ever.

UI Design is super slick and just beautiful to behold. A lot of care and love went into these fluid menus.

Everything loads very quickly, no crashes. You just can't take that for granted anymore.

Combat system is really good once you get 4 people.

Cons:
3D models are looking really, really dated. I understand this way a design choice, but given how much care went into portraits, menus and such, the impression I get from the 3D models was very jarring and disappointing. Some of the outfits look really generic or downright awful.

Music was a noticeable downgrade compared to previous Meguro works. It's not a terrible OST, but I found most of the soundtrack pretty forgettable compared to something like P3R and P5R. Sound effects are very good.

Difficulty has a bit of a swing unless you just cheese MAG all over (I did not ever do this, but many that played the demo did.) The game can be effortlessly easy, or you can just insta-die vs an ambush. There's times monsters can just insta-kill you with no warning later in the game, I'm not a fan of those mechanics. There are quite a few excellent fights as well. It feels like normal is a bit on the rougher side, and easy is a bit too easy. A difficulty between the two would be a good fit.

Some Archtypes are pretty back loaded later on: You get a ton of stuff waaaaaaaaay late, which is a bit disappointing since you can't use it very much unless you grind. You can make a NG+ with it, but it does feel a bit disappointing first play-through.

No romance options: I didn't think about this much when I first started playing, but with what you go through and the weight of the words you speak to everyone in the game, not having any kind of romance options feels really odd. There's a saying ""Love blooms on a battlefield"" and given all of the vividly harsh realities constantly thrown in the game, not having any contrast to the theme of hatred is polarizing. A love interest could have helped elevate the story to new heights and could have been woven into the story.

Overall, I think it's a great game, and if you love the Persona series, it's a lot like that with similarities, with some of it's own special sauce. If you are interested, give the demo a shot first, you can always transfer the data into the main game if you wish.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"It's the original Helldivers but third person and with way more production values. It's also got some battlepass stuff, etc, but so far it seems very unobtrusive (I never got an ingame ad forcing me to look at the premium version, for instance, which is something that regularly happens with other games). 
Performance-wise, it seems solid so far on my computer using the default settings I got (mostly high, with Space set to low, amusingly, and I manually turned Motion Blur off). Running on a 3070, 32gb ram and a 5600x. At 1440p I average around 90fps on the missions I've played.

The online component is kinda borked right now, which isn't super unexpected to me, but with Arrowhead's track record I don't doubt it'll be fixed. Overall, it's pretty much what I expected and I'm quite happy with it.

PS: I'm from Buenos Aires and I say kill 'em all!!

Edit: After playing quite a bit more I have to say it's actually a lot more than just Helldivers 1 with more production values. The amount of work the devs put into this game is kinda crazy, it feels incredibly good to play, with really punchy gunplay and excellent sound design, and it also manages to keep you on your toes at all times in ways you wouldn't expect from ""mindless"" bugs and automatons.
Co-op is a blast (quite literally sometimes) and the mid game stratagems you can unlock can be true gamechangers when you start pushing into higher difficulties.
Very much recommended for anyone who loved the original, but also anyone who is into shooters, really.
They captured the Verhoeven Starship Troopers feel better than pretty much all actually licensed games based on the movie, too. From the propaganda reels you get at your ship to the music and the loading screen tips, it's kinda like living that movie (but not dying horribly for it!)

Edit 2: I already got the premium pass unlocked without paying a single extra cent over the Standard Edition price.

I've seen tech demos of those kind of building mechanics and it's awesome to see it in a game.  It's also remarkably easy to build exactly what you want above ground or underground and they have comfort mechanics to encourage making structures that look pretty with furnishings and everything.  My friend and I made bunk beds and a fireplace with the tools we had and it was surprisingly good looking using the voxels in conjunction with the premade structures. 
Outside of the building there are a bunch of handcrafted structures throughout the game world dotting the landscape.  There are also NPCs you can place in your homestead that have various requirements as well which is kinda similar to how terraria does it.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"Imagine being one of the people having a cry about the servers being at capacity or the situation with the anti-cheat.

It seems like people are completely void of reason and understanding. Just some years ago, the gaming atmosphere was down bad, and now we get a beautiful game from an Indie Studio, and just because they underestimated their success, they should get hounded for it...

Not only that but the anti-cheat thing is over the top. If a game has a lack of an anti-cheat or no anti-cheat, people complain, yet if it is too invasive and works well, people complain.

On top of all of this, the devs have been active addressing and fixing a lot of these problems. I don't know what else you can really do, regardless, you cannot please everyone.

There were a lot of things that I didn't know but the community in this game is ridiculously NICE. They are extremely helpful, especially the ones from Guilds. Sometimes you get free stuff from random people you don't even know. You can have random people helping you with gear farming, power leveling, quests, world bosses, anything at all. I try to give back to the community by doing the same, especially to people who really just started playing the game. Coming from FPS games with very toxic community meeting toxic players no matter where you go whether its in your own team or the enemy's team, it's definitely a huge difference. Part of the reason why I'm not going back to FPS games is because of how toxic the community is and it really just take away your experience and fun.

2379780,Balatro,"Firstly - shoutout to michaelalfox and northernlion on twitch whose runs of this game had me hooked from months ago.

I haven't played much yet of 1.0 but I have over 200 hours in the demos!! 

This game is wonderful. It strikes such a cool balance between BIG NUMBER DOPAMINE WE'RE GOIN CRAZY and actual strategy. You can sit and work out what will be better or you can just vibe it, and either way you'll have a great time. 

There's so much replayability here but even if there was only one or two decks in the game (there are a lot more) I found myself finally beating the starter deck and instead of thinking ""sweet, onto the next one"" I instead found myself wanting to run the starter deck again, but better. If that feeling translates to every deck in the game, I may never put this bad boy down.

On top of that, it's incredibly easy for the very involved and creative dev to expand should we ever get bored. Add one more deck into the game and watch everyone flock for another 3 months trying to figure it out. A handful of new jokers, or a new tarot card here and there. It is so well set up for expansion and has a dev who I think will look to improve and expand as time goes on (though I wouldn't blame them if they took a few months off!)

Hits all my endorphin reactors, makes me happy, makes me lose track of time, makes me theorycraft on public transport. All the giddy feelings I haven't had for many games over the last few years!

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"I usually do not do this. If a game is that bad people will usually know before purchasing or just purchase anyways because it seems like something they might enjoy. However, I feel an obligation to add my piece into the mix, with the way that the devs are going on about the status of the game.

I started playing this game on its true release (not this 3yr after release ""open-beta"" thing). On its release it was actually a really fun game! The combat was refreshing, the world beautiful, theorycrafting how you might want to play your character with the various weapons was intriguing and even the farming wasn't a total bore. At face value the game had tremendous potential. On top of that, there were quite literally a million people playing it! The sky was truly the limit for this MMO upon release. I had a ton of fun playing this game in its first year (over 400hrs of fun)!

Now, I am not going to go into all the details surrounding all of the bugs, the false promises, the cash grabs and all of the things that led us to where the game ended up, I am sure you have all heard those time and time again when reading about the game. No. My main quarrel with this game and its devs and the reason i have actually had to stop myself from giving this game anymore chances, is the fact that they are trying to gaslight their own community and standing player base.... And to me, it is just unforgivable. 

This whole re-release of the game they are doing to try and draw in console players isn't bad on its head. It is the way they are going about it! They are making it out to seem like the game has never been released! Saying that it is in open-beta all of the sudden when the game has been fully released years ago, is just criminal and a slap in the face to all of the players who have spent 100's if not 1000's of hours on the game.

Had they just been open and honest with the community from the beginning maybe this would have panned out differently. Releasing to console should have been a big and awesome thing for the game and its player base! Bringing in new players and friends, it could have been a grand event! But AGS chose the route of gaslighting and secrecy, which turned everyone against them.

The reason I felt the urge for this review and to put my two-cents in, is because these jackasses made a post about the game being in ""open beta"" and the post truly made me feel that these guys are so disillusioned that they actually believe themselves that this is the games very first release. as if this game didn't have one of the most catastrophic rise and falls of any game of all time. AGS could have taken it on the chin, learned from their mistakes and improved upon the game by listening to the active community and made a comeback, similar to ESO. But they chose the route of deceit and for that, not only can i not recommend this game, I would recommend to never contribute to anything AGS does if this is how they conduct themselves.

Edit: Earn ""day-1"" rewards for logging in during their stupid 3yr-post-full-release open-beta. You can't get more delusional than this as a dev company man, I swear. Please, no one waste time, money or breath. They will dig their own grave, jump in the casket, close and nail it themselves and have their new console buddies to bury it.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Damn this game is [b]good[/b]!

With [I]Enshrouded[/i], Keen Games isn't trying to reinvent Open World Survival Crafting. They're just trying to make the best OWSC game on the market. And they're in the running for doing so. We are barely past the first week of Early Access and it is already among the best OWSC games I've played.

This voxel-based building/adventure game takes from some of the best games in the genre, such as [i]Valheim[/i], and implements them with craft and polish. I could gush about the awesome things in this game... and since this is a review, it is the perfect place to do so! 

The game is open world, but excels in giving you guests that will take you into areas of interest. And those areas are dripping with lore that enriches the experience. In this game, you are not a renaissance paragon who is somehow a warrior/farmer/blacksmith/alchemist/etc. Rather, your character is an adventurer who is tasked with rescuing others of your kind, and [i]they[/i] have the specializations. These NPCs, once rescued, can be placed at your base where they will give you quests to advance their ability to use their crafts. Rescue the blacksmith and he will enable the creation of a forge, then give you a quest to find the crucible needed for him to create a smithy.

The game is full of much-loved Quality of Life mechanics. Your inventory is limited by space but not by weight, so you can develop your characters statistics as you really desire without feeling required to dump points into managing carryweight. As popularized by [i]Valheim[/i], you have three food/drink slots in your stomach, and the foods you eat give important buffs. But you will never perish from hunger or thirst, so you can spend the hours you work on your base without interruptions to manage needs, and even leave the game running during Real Life interruptions. Plus, as with games like [i]Valheim[/i] and [i]Raft[/i], there is no food spoilage. 

Other QoL include very limited corpse drops. When you die, you drop a random selection of your materials, but not your weapons, armor or vital objects like quest items. No more running back naked to try to get your gear from an area you couldn't survive when you had it. An additional nice feature is that your tombstone will be on the last safe-to-stand place you were before you died. Something I discovered when I crashed my first glider and found my corpse was a [i]long[/i] way from where I died -- it was back on the edge of the tower I had jumped from.

Some QoL is locked behind progression. It takes a good amount of gameplay before you can rescue the Carpenter who will provide the expertise needed to craft magical chests that enable crafting from containers. It can be a painful wait, but it makes getting there so much sweeter. And on the subject of storage, let me [b]thank the devs so hard[/b] for making all storage containers the same size externally. Finally! How many games have forced me to completely redo my storage area because the upgraded containers can't fit in the same place, or worse, have a larger footprint that makes them less space-to-storage efficient than the basic ones? With [i]Enshrouded[/i], none of that! And the storage chests stack! It's like the devs have played games and know what gamers need.

I also have to give a shout-out for being able to remove things without destroying everything on top of it. If I want to yank the lowest storage chest in a stack and replace it with a magical one, I can do so without the hassle of having to empty and move the ones stacked above it. If I want to change the material used for a section of floor, I don't have to move the furniture first. (With, for some reason, the exception of my bed.) Devs: thank you!

And a special thanks for the lack of raids, destructive weather, or other nonsense that interrupts building or threatens to destroy everything you have spent hours creating. There are plenty of games for that. But with [i]Enshrouded[/i], I am free to build the base I want instead of feeling forced to make the most defensive structure I can.

Other elements of the game are blissfully streamlined. I don't have to water and babysit crops. There is a cool danger factor in being able to have your weapon break in combats, yet I have never been a fan of weapon/tool degradation because repairing always felt like added grind that doesn't improve the game experience. So I [b]am[/b] a fan of being able to repair all your weapons/tools with a single click at the crafting bench with [b]no material cost[/b]. 

And speaking of combat: it's good. Special shout-out to the addition of a short-range, low-damage, fast weapon that doesn't use mana or ammo. Wands are effin' amazing. My character has little strength or melee skill -- she's a freaky acrobat who uses dodge rolls, double-jump and her glider to dance around enemies while peppering them with wand shots until they are dead. And it is glorious.

All of this isn't to say there are no issues, nor things I wish they developers would consider as they expand on and improve the game. There are bugs. I play with max quality graphics 99% of the time, but I have to drop that down to balanced or even performance quality inside some of the trap-laiden towers or the game crashes. The game occasionally struggles to load high-quality textures. And then there is the ballad of rake-mageddon.

And we are not free of the silliness that seems inherent in OWSC games. I'm always amused by some of the nonsensical results from the gamification of resources. Like needing 52 screws to make a computer in [i]Satisfactory[/i]. So far, the crown of absurdity goes to [i]Dysmantle[/i] for requiring electronics to upgrade a baseball bat. But [i]Enshrouded[/i] is the first game to make charcoal a multi-component resource that requires [i]dirt[/i] as well as wood. 

Lo, I am but a lowly dirt farmer.

Such issues are few and barely mar my enjoyment of this beautiful game. Which does bring me to a small wishlist of improvements: first and foremost being an increase in character models and options. We need more faces and maybe some alternate body types. I would like more choice in hair colors. I would like to be able to choose my eye color. Fascinating that I can chose my grunting voice from many different and barely-distinguishable options.

More importantly, however, is that I hope the upcoming content will include anything that gives the sense that I am actually working towards a better future rather than just creating a last stand.","Very Positive85% of the 53,278 user reviews for this game are positive.",damn good keen game t_emphasizedrying reinvent open world survival crafting trying best owsc market running barely past week player purchase play official release already best owsc game voxel based building adventure take best game genre valheim implement craft polish gush awesome thing perfect open world excels giving guest area interest area dripping lore enriches not_a renaissance paragon somehow warrior farmer blacksmith alchemist rather adventurer tasked rescuing others kind specialization npc rescued placed base quest advance craft rescue blacksmith enable creation forge a_emphasized task objective given non crucible needed smithy loved quality life mechanic inventory limited space not_by weight develop character statistic desire feeling required dump point managing carryweight popularized valheim three food drink slot stomach food eat important buff never_perish hunger thirst spend hour base interruption manage need leave running real life interruption plus game valheim raft no_food spoilage qol include limited corpse drop die drop random selection material not_your weapon armor vital object task objective given non item no_more running naked gear survive additional nice tombstone last safe stand died discovered crashed glider found corpse long died edge tower jumped qol locked progression take good rescue carpenter provide expertise needed craft magical chest enable crafting container painful wait make sweeter subject storage hard storage container size externally finally game forced completely redo storage upgraded container fit worse larger footprint make space storage efficient basic one storage chest stack game gamers shout able remove thing destroying top yank lowest storage chest stack replace magical hassle empty move one stacked material section floor move furniture exception bed special thanks lack raid destructive weather nonsense interrupt building threatens destroy spent hour creating plenty game i_emphasized build base feeling forced defensive structure element blissfully streamlined water babysit crop cool danger factor able weapon break combat never_been fan weapon tool degradation repairing grind improve fan able repair weapon tool single click crafting bench no_material cost speaking combat good special shout addition short range low damage fast weapon mana ammo wand effin amazing strength melee skill freaky acrobat us dodge roll double glider dance enemy peppering wand shot dead glorious t_emphasizedo no_issues nor_things wish developer consider expand improve bug play max quality graphic 99 drop balanced performance quality inside trap laiden tower crash occasionally struggle load high quality texture ballad rake mageddon not_free silliness inherent owsc game amused nonsensical result gamification resource needing 52 screw computer satisfactory far crown absurdity go dysmantle requiring electronics upgrade baseball bat i_emphasizeds charcoal multi component resource requires dirt wood lo lowly dirt farmer issue barely mar enjoyment beautiful bring small wishlist improvement foremost increase model option face maybe alternate body type choice hair color able choose eye color fascinating chose grunting voice different barely distinguishable option importantly hope upcoming include give sense working towards future rather creating last stand

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Oh boy, how to talk about my new obsession…

Elder Scrolls Online has really got its hooks in me, and I’m not an MMO guy at all. In fact, I usually get frustrated and bored before getting too far into these types of games. There is a ridiculous amount of price to content ratio here even if you pick up just the base edition, and it would take forever to describe everything I liked or disliked in such a massive game. So, as a non MMO player, I will list what issues I have with the majority of them and how ESO fixes or avoids these issues.

1) Boring, Tab Targeting Combat
Anyone who has played WoW remembers the frustration that came from being 40 feet away from a wild boar whose attack still manages to hit you because his attack was already queued up. The combat in the majority of MMOs is usually a static, detached affair, watching from afar, barely paying attention while numbers ping away. ESO’s combat is a much more input driven and reaction based system. Left click, and you attack. Right click, and you block. If an enemy is about to attack and you’re out of range or hiding behind a rock? They miss, as to be expected. A giant storm atronarch fires a charged lightning bolt at your face? Dodge roll out of the way and avoid the damage if you're quick enough. This isn’t the only MMO to have an action based combat system, but it serves the game well and keeps fights interesting. During the more intense fights I am at the edge of my seat, spamming healing spells, rolling away from danger, and interrupting enemy casts with well timed bash attacks. As good as Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim were, the combat system are the weakest aspect of these games. ESO’s combat is very good for an MMO, but would be considered dull in a single player RPG, in my opinion. However, with ESO's variety of movement skills, dodge rolls, and varied abilities I can safely say that the combat in this game is definitely better than the combat in main series Elder Scrolls games, and anyone who disagrees with me needs to go back and replay vanilla Skyrim and remember just how bad that game’s combat really is. There’s a good reason why “Stealth Archer” is a running joke in the series, turning the game into a stealth based high critical damage FPS just makes the awful combat pass more quickly, which is sad considering that the most fun form of combat is also the one that gets it over with the fastest.

2) Generic Collectathon questing
“Collect 50 bear hides” quests are the bane of many MMOs, and while ESO definitely isn’t without a few of these quests, the majority of the content tries to tell a story within them. As superficial as this is, the voice work and dialogue options sell these mini stories well, although some better than others. Some quests are also surprisingly compelling, it is clear that Zenimax Online has tried hard to make their world one that’s believable and immersive, which is commendable. Despite the effort they put into the writing and storytelling, if you rush through all of the quest content to level up quickly I can see you getting burnt out pretty quickly, which leads to my next point.

3) Level Grinding
Many MMOs only let you do the “end game content” when you hit max level. This has led to the phenomenon of many games being filled with “power levelers” as players try and get to the “Real Game” as fast as possible. Remember WoW’s Chinese power leveling economy? With ESO’s One Tamriel update, everything in the world scales to your character’s level. When I first heard about this, I was pretty upset, since this mean that even the crappy mudcrabs from the starter level will still take a couple of hits to kill, despite your character's level. It is admittedly jarring to see a character covered in flames and glass armor struggling to kill a measly wild wolf. However, after playing through some of the vast content offered, I understand now why they added this level scaling mechanic to the game. Since the content scales, from level 10 onward you can start doing the massive Alliance PVP and the four man dungeons, even playing alongside Level 50s and above. This means that even as a casual player I can get into some pretty challenging dungeon crawls and massive PVP battles at my own leisure, which is something in other MMOs I would have to grind levels to get to, by which time I would have most likely have lost interest.

4) Class/Role Restrictions
Most MMOs have very strict classes with little room for experimentation. While the holy trinity of Tank, DPS and Healer is present in ESO, the way weapon, class, guild, and armor skill lines are delineated mean that anybody can make any kind of crazy character combo they want. Want to make a Khajitt Sorcerer wearing heavy armor and shooting arrows and lightning bolts alternatively? Go for it! Want to try a sneaky Orc Nightblade who heals his teammates and maims his enemies as a support class? Totally viable! Obviously if you want to min/max there are definitely optimal class, weapon, armor and race combinations to choose, but the freedom to experiment and the ease of refunding skill points means that you are allowed to experiment with unique character combinations without fear of ruining a build and wasting your time leveling. I am currently attempting to make a Breton Templar Tank who also heals on occasion, but I couldn't resist getting the skill that allowed me to hurl javelins of pure light at long ranges, sniping mobs from far away. One thing I would recommend is that when you create a character, decide from the beginning to either put 90% of your stat points into Magicka OR Stamina, not both. Unfortunately, splitting your stat points between both will make you a jack of all trades, but master of none. 

5) Subscription Based Payment Plans
Once you buy ESO, it is yours to play whenever you want. When I tried out Eve Online (and boy was that an experience) I always felt a constant pressure to play the game because of its subscription model. My brain would tell me, “NO ROCKET LEAGUE FOR YOU, MUST GET YOUR $15 PER MONTH WORTH.” In ESO, the game is playable without a monthly subscription fee, so there is no such nagging voice in my head. There is an ESO+ option which lets you access all the smaller DLC and a separate crafting bag in game, leading to more convenient inventory management. However, you can buy this DLC separately, and with eight character slots and a shared bank space, it will be a long, long time until you can’t just manage your inventory through mules. I really think Buy to Play is the “sweet spot” of MMOs, compared to Free to Play which may lead to some purchasable items giving an advantage, Buy to Play manages to fund the developers without creating a need to monetize their product further.

I have yet to talk about the addicting crafting system which lets you specialize in six different disciplines, or the chaotic massive battles that is the Alliance PVP, or the excellent add-on support which allows you to customize the game's already slick interface to your heart's content with user generated tools. With the player count rising lately, plus the large Morrowind Expansion’s release this year, I can see this game having a long, healthy future. Are there more hardcore MMOs on the market?

230410,Warframe,"You are awoken rudely by the vile [b]Grineer
Captain Vor[/b], who has discovered a [i]Tenno[/i],
a Space Ninja on the wild planet Earth. He
gloats and tries to claim you as a prize for
his evil [i]Queens of the Grineer[/i], but you
break free with the help of the mysterious
[b]Lotus[/b], a beautiful woman seeking more
Tenno like yourself.

[b]WARFRAME[/b]

Lotus brings you up to speed in a galactic
war on a constantly-updating scale. Your
countless Tenno brethren appear with an
inevitable regularity, Lotus explains, a new
Tenno bringing new armor and equipment
with the strange, alien [i]Warframe[/i] biosuits.

You are immediately reminded of [b]Guyver[/b],
the symbiotic alien bioweapons in which
Solid Snake and Luke Skywalker starred in,
and you had shared a movie night or two
with Summer-Rain in the shadowy realm
of the friendzone before you became an
item with her years later.

[i]Summer-Rain.[/i] You think back on how all
this led to her passing and how you took
the loss by losing yourself in Dark Souls.
How the [i]Lordvessel[/i] allowed you to phase
between worlds and how Novocaine's 
Three allowed you to both come to terms
with her loss. Now in a cosmic frontier of
space ninjas, evil cloned descendants of
humanity and a scavenging corporation
of another branch of evil mankind, your
path is clear - become the best space
ninja with an insane selection of armor,
weapons and so much customization
options that you don't know where to
begin.

From Mars to Sedna, Saturn to the far-
flung reaches of mysterious areas of
space known as [b]Dark Sectors[/b], your
mission controller, Lotus, is a mix of
roles; mother, sister, long-distance
pesudo-lover. You undertake missions
on her behalf to protect the galaxy and
the stake that all Tenno represent, the
last portion of humanity that did not 
produce the bloodthirsty conquest-
driven [b]Grineer[/b] or the overly-monitized
[b]Corpus[/b] faction. You take the fight to 
the space zombies; the [b]Infected[/b], and
learn how to craft better weapons and
warframes along the way, painting all
you use and own in dull colors of green
and blue, trying your best to honor the
memory of your erstwhile love.

After what seems like months in space,
you meet others who share your role in
the universe as Tenno. They pair up on
missions with you, but it is silent, almost
hollow. You listen to the next orders of 
the Lotus but even then it seems like it
is part of a motion. Then you realize who
Lotus has reminded you of behind her
concealed face and her eyes- none other
than your ex, [b]Ms. Novocaine[/b] herself.

Trying to break free from the indirect
siren song of her voice and orders over
your warframe, you are powerless. On
this new mission to one of the far-flung
Dark Sectors, you decide on a gambit
and set your ship on a crash course into
the nebula. Lotus Novocaine knows this
however, and other Tenno are dispatched
to retrieve the wayward son. This detour
of the galaxy taking a dark turn, you
don't want to face your fellow Tenno, old
friends from a forgotten time, now under
the control of the Lotus.

She offers peace, security and longevity,
happiness as an eternity with her, doing
her bidding so that the galaxy remains
safe. In another time, you would gladly
have been one of hers. But not now. Not
when you are pledged to another, and 
you have a promise to keep. The risks of
the nebula be damned. You factor in
course correct before your Tenno close
in and punch it. Once more, the Lotus
faces the cold stars of the cosmos as
you ride within the nebula, closer to a
home where you belong.

Update 1: 
Regarding the ""Hobbyist"" part:

Hobbyist: a person who pursues a particular hobby.

Hobby: A hobby is a regular activity that is done for pleasure, typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements.

I'm not gonna pay you any more money or recommend this game to anyone since I'm not your ""bank"" for your own ""hobby"" needs. Neither this community needs to do so.

In fact, if you gonna do this as a hobby, then refund everyone their money back, and turn this game to a F2P since it's a hobby right?

Needless to say, I might be angry, but that doesn't give me any rights to swear or curse to any other human being. 

So my questions are these to Garry Newman:
- What was the goal/dream of this game when you first tought of it?
- Are you satisfied with the things that are going at the moment?
- Are you sure that you are using this community to the fullest extend for game improvements? (I'm talking about steam community, not reddit)

To be honest, I already gave up for a refund, but I don't plan on playing this game anymore either even if it is in my library. Since the experience I had was a bad one...

Update 2: I don't mind troll comments, but please, don't embarrass yourself...

Update 3:
* 23rd of November, 2017 *
Ran the game again due to a request from a friend, by using the same rig that I've had when I've first wrote this review. The launch was a success, guess they've fixed their issue (after 2 years lol).

Anyway, My friend suggested couple of servers which are located on europe, funny thing was, I couldn'T see those servers on my list so I've used friends tab to join that particular server that my friend was playing on since couple of game restarts and multiple refresh choices couldn't bring up those server names.

Aside from that, my rig handled the game just fine on maxed out settings. Seen some improvements as well. Tho I've seen some weird stuff too.

- Aparently there are still weekly wipes going on. (slightly do understand the reason but they should find an alternative permanent solution into this)

- Nude female/male body seems ok and hilarious but I've seen some seriously messed up scenes and heard some really messed up conversations from what sounded like 13-14 yr old kids who shouldn't even supposed to play this game, they should add some type of age check based on steam registry or at least moderate to a certain amount before the game twitsts these young generations minds. Maybe even ban that account due to violations of bypassing age check?

- Why can't I see all the servers? Had to use friend tab to join into their game server which wasn't showing up on the search.

- Looks like some privately owned servers have these nice rules which limits teamplay to a certain amount which is quite nice since that way, you don't have to deal with a group of 4535654343 people ganging up on a single individual.

I can imagine some questions will be asked so here's some answers before asked.

* Yes, I'm still not recommending the game, it's 2017 and the game is still in alpha.
* No, I still do not trust Facepunch Studios.
* Yes, I did in fact said that I won't play the game 2 years ago, a friend of mine made me run it and I've just fulfilled his request since it's what friends does.
* No, my rig is the same rig with same OS with same hardware. Nothing has changed for the past 2 years.

1203620,Enshrouded,"I very much want to like this game but after 20 hours of play, I feel like I have spent the time preparing to have fun instead of actually having fun. Enshrouded feels like its developers looked at Valheim and decided they could fix all the indie dev issues that sometimes make it frustrating. They did, and along they way they introduced a number of other issues that often make it frustrating.

Crafting is a pain point. For immersion, you can't just craft everything in your inventory. This is common in crafting games, and it's reasonable to encourage players to build up a base that lets them do bigger crafting. Except in Enshrouded, you have a crafting table, about fifteen specialized production buildings each used to slowly convert one to three inputs into one of a few options of outputs, and five (six if you count the niche Collector) craftspersons, plus the farming that's expected in most survival games. Most of these feel superfluous. You use a Kiln to make fired brick to make other craft stations.  Did we also need a Charcoal Kiln, just for charcoal? And a Smelter? And a Forge? You may find yourself trying to remember which crafter makes which crafting station so you can make it and use it to create ten of something to make another crafting station for someone else and then forget the first crafting station exists. Because the stations have a processing time for materials, you'll end up jamming a bunch of materials in when you unlock each one so you never have to wait for the product items when you actually need them, and then being done with the particular station essentially permanently. The ability of Magic Chests to allow crafters and stations to automagically pull the materials they need helps a little bit, but I quickly found myself yearning for the ability to craft everything out of a centralized table or interface instead of bouncing around. Your mileage may vary, and I have seen enough Minecraft Mod Packs adding layers of crafting complexity to know some people appreciate this, but for me the limited application of each station and intermediate items gave a lot of the game a ""collect ten deer pelts to unlock the quest to collect ten bear pelts"" quest vibe with extra steps.

Another complaint would be the combat. It's not badly tuned, and nothing feels unfair or trivial, it just doesn't feel engaging. Most enemies can be dealt with with one of either attacking quickly because they stagger on hit, rotating around them because they pause to swing and you can stay permanently behind them, or by alternating a timed block to stagger them and hitting them, then repeating until dead (which may take a while, some of the guys are damage sponges). There's still an element of danger if you mess up, so I don't want to say the combat is too easy, but it is not very deep. Although the combat is in the family of Souls-Like games, I never got the feeling of satisfaction that I had figured out a tricky enemy because there aren't really tricky enemies. 

Finally, for an exploration game, it is hard to feel like exploration is worthwhile. Finding a treasure chest never feels exciting because it's never going to give you something you can't easily make twenty of, because that's not how Enshrouded's progression works. Unless a quest marker is pointing you at a village or dungeon to get the item to build a new crafting station, nothing in that place is going to be a more exciting prize than you could get chopping trees or growing plants.

These complaints aside, the game does do a number of things well. The progression feels nice (though the enemies level up awfully fast relative to you if you don't explore a great deal), the Shrouded areas have a fun feeling of time pressure, the character mobility feels great, and the fully designed world with characterization and backstory feels much more engaging than the standard randomly generated world you see in most crafting adventure games. As I said, I very much want to like it, but given that at 20 hours I was still waiting to start having fun, I cannot recommend it as a purchase.","Very Positive85% of the 53,278 user reviews for this game are positive.",20 hour play spent preparing fun fun feel developer looked valheim decided fix indie issue frustrating along introduced number issue frustrating crafting pain immersion craft inventory common crafting game reasonable encourage player build base let bigger crafting except crafting table fifteen specialized production building slowly convert three input option output five six count niche collector craftspersons plus repeatedly defeating enemy completing task gain resource expected survival game superfluous kiln fired brick craft station charcoal kiln charcoal smelter forge trying remember crafter make crafting station ten crafting station someone else forget crafting station exists station processing material jamming bunch material unlock never_have wait product item particular station essentially permanently magic chest allow crafter station automagically pull material help bit quickly found yearning craft centralized table interface bouncing mileage vary minecraft modification alteration player fan pack adding layer crafting complexity appreciate limited application station intermediate item gave collect ten deer pelt unlock task objective given non collect ten bear pelt task objective given non vibe extra step complaint combat not_badly tuned feel unfair trivial engaging enemy dealt with_emphasized attacking quickly stagger rotating pause swing stay permanently alternating timed block stagger hitting repeating dead guy damage sponge s_emphasizedtill element danger mess combat easy not_very deep combat family soul game never_got feeling satisfaction figured tricky enemy tricky enemy finally exploration hard exploration worthwhile finding treasure chest never_feels exciting never_going easily twenty not_how progression work unless a_emphasized task objective given non marker pointing village dungeon build crafting station exciting prize chopping tree growing plant complaint aside number thing progression feel nice enemy awfully fast relative explore great deal shrouded area fun feeling pressure mobility feel great designed world characterization backstory feel engaging standard randomly generated world crafting adventure game given 20 hour waiting fun cannot_recommend purchase
2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"Game seems rigged to me. Way too many times have I faced an opponent that has the exact cards to counter my deck perfectly. Not to mention I have to mulligan 60% of the games I play even though I'm using 24 lands in a 60 card deck. No amount of adjusting the number of lands in my deck seems to change my opening hand. Games are almost always a blowout one way or the other, which is not fun either way. I don't like winning if the other player never gets to play. Drafting is mostly fun, but I have noticed some patterns there too. When I draft, after 4 wins I start getting flooded with mana, mana starved, or face an opponent that always seems to draw all of his bomb rares in the first few turns while playing me. Very ironic this happens after 4 wins considering 5 wins would cover the cost of the draft. Only a few times have I been able to win more than 4 out of the many drafts I've played. I refuse to pay for a game that seems rigged. Other card games I've played don't seem to have any of these issues. In my opinion, just play in person or play another card game.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"At its core, Dead By Daylight is a game that oozes potential and replayability. However as someone who has been playing the game for several years, I cannot in all good conscience recommend the game to anybody in its current state.

Behaviour Interactive is the least passionate, least engaged, and most lazy game developer I've ever come across. Never before have I had so little confidence in a studio's ability to perform basic tasks until I played Dead By Daylight. Bugs that would take a normal developer hours to fix would take BHVR weeks. In-game concepts that are common knowledge to the community are often lost on, or completely ignored by BHVR. 

You can expect balance changes that will leave you baffled and scratching your head because on a fundamental level, Behaviour Interactive does not understand their own game, nor do they intend to. Devs past and present exude elitism out of every pore as though they know what's best for the game, and the community knows nothing. Several glaring issues such as a heavy grind, a lack of diversity in recent characters, and power creep are sure to go unaddressed because BHVR both don't know or care about their game.

At the end of the day, Dead By Daylight is a fun horror/party game that is currently being run into the ground by its unenthused leadership.

If you play MyCareer or MyGM/MyEras/MyNBA, this game will be significantly worse for you. 

MyGM got stripped of multiple fun features from past gen games. You can’t talk to players, staff, or other GMs to help raise their morale. Sponsorships are gone. Team owner scripts just reset yearly. Owner bombards you with bad demands. You perfectly set up your team then he somehow wants 5 lottery picks by the next year so you have to gut your team. Action points are gone. So your typical day in MyGM becomes, finish off everything by the first day, then play or sim everything while doing nothing rest of the games, owner comes with a ridiculous request, you try to salvage it again in a single game day. Then nothing to do for a while til the next ridiculous request. 

MyCareer VC earnings got significantly nerfed. It’s so bad now. I was ok with spending money in past titles because it didn’t feel predatory. I knew I could get a decent amount just playing the game but felt like I just wanted to skip some of the grind by choice. Now it feels like one of those free to play mobile games where “you don’t need to spend money to earn”  but it’s infuriatingly slow to progress. Instead of buying VC being just an option, it now feels necessary. Rewards are very low now compared to previous titles and require tedious grinding. The bugs they fix quickly are the ones that involve VC exploits or giving longer timeouts to VC earning methods that players find. 

PC port is bad. Lag and stutter is always present even when you have a good pc. GPU and ram usage are fine but this game will fry your CPU. I have an i9 with the best cooler and it spikes up to 80s and 90 degrees. I have searched google and people are having similar experiences with this as well.

I guess it’s a fine game if you just want to play a basketball simulation game. I have no idea how’s myTeam as it is a mode that I don’t touch. I don’t know if that makes it worth 60 dollars though.

They are taking advantage of their monopoly by having you pay 200 dollars on top of the 60 dollars you already paid, to reliably compete in arguably their main game mode that most would like to play. I have the money to spend but I actively avoid these kinds of shit money pit designs.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"An excellent Final Fantasy game, a decent mmorpg. 

If you're buying this game, don't compare it to WoW because you'll be rather disappointed. The focus of the game is the players journey through the main story quests that are written better then most AAA singleplayer games nowadays. DO NOT buy a story skip if you want to get your full values worth from this game, you'll find yourself lost with the main story and then lose interest much quicker. The beginning quests can be boring at first, but it really picks up after 2.x (At this time of review, they are currently overhauling the 2.x main quest series scheduled to be released in patch 5.3, I recommend trying the game out then). 

End game itself is pretty good, the only problem is the end game rewards. Even WoW with its poorly received Azurite system in BFA, it at least has more interesting rewards then FFXIV's generic stat boosts. I find myself not bothering with the relic grinds because of this reason. If they made gear feel more unique and impactful, then they'd see players like me sticking around more often. 

Play it for the story! Once you finished everything and start feeling bored of the game, just unsub for a few major patches and come back later. That's literally how the developers want you to play it.

1401590,Disney Dreamlight Valley,"At the time this review is posted, the game is in ""Early Access"" and the review should be seen accordingly. The game is currently in an incomplete state with broken quests, unreachable items, and absurdly loud music {At 20% volume still loud} but the game itself is actually fun to play. However, for the price tag of $30 minimum and the EA Tag it bears; I recommend buyers beware.

Now for the nitty gritty of the game and what is good and bad. We will begin with the most fundamental aspect of the game which is RESOURCE ACQUISITION. This game WILL force the player to grind out a lot of materials by doing repetitive tasks. These tasks often cost energy or physical time. However, to offset the energy; you can recruit Disney Characters to grant you a chance at additional non-quest resources at Level 2 Friendship & above as long as their role matches what you are wanting free resources from. So if you want more stone and ore; you get a character that has Mining selected. If you want more crops harvested, you get a Gardener. As of the time of writing this; there are 17 characters you can have follow you in-game. That means you can select each profession 3 times and have 2 leftover. The professions are Gardener, Miner, Fisher, Forager, and Digger. However, the chances for items increase based on the Friendship Level {Max 10} of each villager with said profession. So for the moment if you get the game; choose wisely.

Now for the next aspect of the game that it will literally force you to do. That is ""Friendship"". Almost everything in this game revolves around that aspect and admittedly locks you out of past the starter content unless you get several levels of friendship for different characters. However it is admittedly very easy to grind out early levels. This nets you gold, motifs, furnishings, or even clothing. It also unlocks their sidequests which may or may not be annoying. Doing actions with said friend while hanging out gets you experience as a character, friendship experience for your buddy, and if you are doing their profession action; a lot more of everything. Unfortunately the game fails to really explain this well and I see little option to go through previous tutorials. But it is both a fun mechanic but devastatingly annoying to grind out levels for most folks.

Finally we come to the questlines, the final aspect I want to focus on in this game. It's annoying, hands down. The quests are broken. Some fail to register items in your possession, some fail to recognize you doing an action, and some just break entirely. Luckily for me, usually a full restart of Steam fixes this somehow. But for an EA game; you can always expect bugs. Though I am very surprised most of these got past ALPHA testing. *GLARES AT GAME COMPANIES SKIPPING THIS IMPORTANT ASPECT OF GAME DEV*

All in all, I can recommend the game once it goes down in price, gets more updates, and some much needed TLC from the development team.

[h1] Sum up[/h1]

+ A single character can learn all classes and jobs in the game.
+ Insane variety of content, even without the expansions. Up to 2000 hours easily.
+ An MMO that starts simple, looks appealing and raises the difficulty in later levels.
+ Dungeons, bosses and raids look amazing, featuring rich details and lots of effects.
+ Community is very social and they enjoy helping other players in anything they need.
+ Party finder for those lacking a party going solo, as well as other features to keep players together and make it easy to connect.

-  Monthly subscription can repel new players.
- Lots of content to do in order to catch up with the latest expansions.
- Early parts of the game can be quite dull and boring, though it gets much better.
- The duties which are solo instances can break a party temporally and be bothersome.
- Later in the game, it becomes a trial and error experience when battling new bosses and exploring new dungeons.

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is an MMO game base on the series with the same name. It features elements from all the entries and creates a huge world filled with lots of things to do. What set it apart from other MMO’s is that it looks visually appealing, that its system is easy to learn but hard to master and that it has a lot of versatility when it comes to its players. It is a fluid system with a good amount of room to explore and take it easy.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The gameplay features common elements of what an MMO would have. Players do quests in order to gain exp and level up, once they do they are able to queue up for dungeons, trials(bosses) and raids which they can battle together with friends or with other players through the party finder, which works like a charm.

Each player is required to choose a class, then at lv 30, that class will become a job. Job is a more specialized class. Depending on the class the player chooses, gameplay will vary and while it would be impossible to mention all of them in a review, I will give some examples. Classes are divided into three roles:

[h1] Healers [/h1]

Their job is to keep their fellow peers alive through the art of healing. They can range from the classic white mage with lots of healing spells, to a more offensive approach with the scholar who has damaging spells. Players can also opt to get a mix of both with astrologian, which depends on the high skill of the player and some RGN but features the higher arrange of abilities.

[h1] DPS (Damage dealers) [/h1]

They are the ones who kill the monsters. DPS is the role with more classes in the game and they feature different types of jobs such as black mages, which enjoy lots of damaging spells but lack utility, to bards who can buff their whole party with beneficial effects while keeping up damage or ninjas, who mix different kinds of abilities to generate powerful ninjutsu.

[h1] Tanks [/h1]

The heart of the party, they always must protect their fragile party members and be the shield that guards the realm of men. Like their description says, they keep everyone out of harm's way by provoking monster, rushing to deploy barriers or just being a pain for bosses to get rid of in general. Tanks will redirect all the damage towards them so that the healers and dps’s can do their jobs without preoccupying about dying.


Is the mix of all these roles that create a functioning party, and with the finder, you are always guaranteed to get a good balance of all of them. Each of these roles is equally important as they are pieces of a greater whole. The healers keep everyone alive, the DPS kills the enemies and the tanks keep the other two out of harm's way. No matter which role you choose, you will always be important for your party.

Speaking of side activities, there is another type of roles I haven’t mentioned yet. These are the disciples of the hand and the disciples of the hand. In these fields, players can find classes ranging from blacksmiths to fishermen or even culinarian! These jobs tend to break the normal pace of the game and offer a more relaxing environment. They might sound boring at first, but players often find themselves lost in them for hours. Once you get going, you just want to do more, and they are beneficial to yourself and your other classes.

If you are a culinarian, for example, you can make your own food which allows you to get bonus exp modifiers. If you are a blacksmith or an armorer, you can craft your own weapons and armors to use in your other classes. If you are a fisherman, you can sell the fish for lots of money on the player market and well, who doesn’t love fishing in a game?

[h1] Story [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a game that takes its story very personal and treats it with the utmost care. It does start pretty boring and dull but catches up fast and it can feel like watching a series or a movie. The richest stories are in the expansions, unfortunately, but these are quite enjoyable, filled with lots of believable characters, conflicts, development and more.

 Reading all of it or catching up to the latest expansions can be quite daunting, so if you are not into spending a lot of time reading/watching cutscenes, you can always skip them and rewatch them later at an inn’s room. There are also plenty of summaries only that are well written and consist of thirty to an hour reading material per expansion (game+2 expansions= 3 hours of reading total) so feel free to skip it if you do find it boring or exhausting to sit through. Do however note that the story is one of the strongest points of the game.

[h1] Some Notes [/h1]

The game runs well on any system that meets the requirements. Some areas might decrease your fps depending on your settings and the sheer amount of player characters that are present in the zone but fret not, this is not a big issue by any means. Duties can be bothersome when you are at a party with friends but are overall enjoyable. Probably the easiest MMO to get into has a UI that the player can adjust to fit their playstyle or needs and the game lacks any sort of pay to win or in-game advantage bought with real money, only shortcuts for those that simply don’t have a lot of time.

[h1] What Makes It Special [/h1]

What makes Final Fantasy XIV special is that it is well balanced when it comes to all the classes and jobs. That it looks more realistic when compared to its peers and that it features a dynamic, fluent system with that is easy to use but hard to master. By sharing all classes across one character, the player will never need to go back to the start of the game in they decide that maybe that class they picked, in the beginning, wasn’t the one for them. 

The game makes an effort to make fights different from one another. Players can find themselves fighting in Rubik's cube, getting devours by a Cerberus and fighting the beast from its stomach or even getting split from their bodies and have to move across a labyrinth of AOE’s in order to go back into them and continue the fight. There is always something new in waiting for the player in the next encounter. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a fantastic MMO, it is filled with great amounts of content and different ice breakers to teach new players how to play and hold their hands until they can go by themselves into the wild worlds of Eorzea. There are a bunch of side activities to break the normal pace of the game and have some fun if you are ever tired from questing, and each dungeon or trial keep adding new mechanics, keeping the game entertaining and making you wonder what you will encounter in your next adventure. I recommend this game to those that haven’t experienced an MMO, and to those that have as well.","Very Positive87% of the 71,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",fantasy enjoy helpful please follow curator url http com curator 43679955 starsdeck url sum single learn class job insane variety expansion 2000 hour easily massively multiplayer start simple look appealing raise difficulty level dungeon boss raid amazing featuring rich detail lot effect community social enjoy helping player party finder lacking party solo feature player easy connect monthly subscription repel player lot order catch latest expansion early part dull boring get duty solo instance break party temporally bothersome trial error battling boss exploring dungeon introduction fantasy massively multiplayer base series name feature element entry creates huge world filled lot thing set apart massively multiplayer look visually appealing easy learn hard master versatility come player fluid good room explore easy feature common element massively multiplayer player quest order gain exp able queue dungeon trial boss raid battle friend player party finder work charm required choose class lv 30 class job_emphasized specialized class depending class chooses vary impossible mention example class divided three role healer fellow peer alive art healing range classic white mage lot healing spell offensive approach scholar damaging spell player opt mix astrologian depends high skill rgn feature higher arrange ability damage per damage dealer one kill monster damage per role class different type job black mages enjoy lot damaging spell lack utility bard strengthen improve effectiveness party beneficial effect keeping damage ninja mix different kind ability generate powerful ninjutsu tank heart party protect fragile party member shield guard realm men description say harm provoking monster rushing deploy barrier pain boss rid general tank redirect damage towards healer damage per job preoccupying dying mix role functioning party finder guaranteed good balance role equally important piece greater healer alive damage per kill enemy tank harm no_matter role choose important party speaking side activity type role mentioned disciple hand disciple hand field player class ranging blacksmith fisherman culinarian job tend break normal pace offer relaxing environment sound boring player lost hour beneficial class culinarian example food allows bonus exp modifier blacksmith armorer craft weapon armor class fisherman fish lot market love fishing fantasy take personal treat utmost care pretty boring dull catch fast watching series movie richest story expansion unfortunately enjoyable filled lot believable character conflict development reading catching latest expansion daunting not_into spending reading watching cutscenes skip rewatch inn room plenty summary written consist thirty reading material per major addition add feature mechanic 2 expansion 3 hour reading total skip boring exhausting sit note strongest point note run meet requirement area decrease shooter depending setting sheer character present zone fret not_this not_a big issue mean duty bothersome party friend enjoyable probably easiest massively multiplayer ui adjust fit playstyle need lack sort pay win advantage bought real shortcut simply make special make fantasy special balanced come class job look realistic compared peer feature dynamic fluent easy hard master sharing class across never_need decide maybe class picked beginning t_emphasizedhe make effort fight different player fighting rubik cube devours cerberus fighting beast stomach split body move across labyrinth effect order continue fight waiting next encounter conclusion fantasy fantastic massively multiplayer filled great amount different ice breaker teach player play hold hand wild world eorzea bunch side activity break normal pace fun tired questing dungeon trial adding mechanic keeping entertaining wonder encounter next adventure recommend experienced massively multiplayer
306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"At the time of writing this I am roughly around 180 hours in the game.

When I first got into Elder Scrolls it was with Skyrim. Playing only that and none of the other previous games I was blown away with how detailed that game was. When I heard that a MMORPG was made with the same title I was very enthusastic. When I got Elder Scrolls Online, I was told it would not be ""Skyrim Online"", and to an extent, those whom mentioned it were correct. However my thoughts and feelings on that statement have changed quite a bit.

After playing for as long as I have, which in comparison to many others, I have found this to be right at home with my previous experience with Skyrim. I absolutley love this game. I feel that it is totally worth the $60 price tag and I invite other open minded players to give this game a shot. There are many differences from the Single Player version of Elder Scrolls but all of the reasons I loved Skyrim are placed in this game.

The ability to customize my character in any way I see fit, the endless caves, areas and places of interest to see. Fully voiced NPC's and endless hours of lore and other content for players to experience. Not to mention that NPC's reconize your heroic feats as you walk by them, often singing your praises and sometimes even questioning some of your actions that you have made in the game. In fact, there are many circumstances where I have had to make a tough decision and have spent much time dwelling after the fact if I made the right call. Should I have helped fight at the docks or was defending the fort the better call? The result might be the same but the fact that I even had to contemplate the lives of fictional NPC's that I would never meet again shows how enriching the plot can be.

The  PvP in my opinion is very hard, but very fun. I die often, but its not frustrating. Being able to team togeather with random strangers, plan an attack and take a fort seems like it would be difficult to do but everyone is on board and ready to play the game. They want to succeed as much as you and I found the community helpful and enriching, not to mention being able to use seige weapons is so much fun and adds a level of excitment I didn't realize was part of the game.

In the non PvP side, I found most players to be felpful, friendly and very outgoing. I found a guild almost right away and in that guild was open minded Veteren players who wanted to help grow and encourage newer players. Often investing a lot of time and energy explaining various parts of the game such as Armor, Weapons, Skill's, ect. Even non guild members and complete strangers are often pretty nice. I can recall looking for a Werewolf Bite and after a few bad players asking me for a ton of gold and crafting materials in order to give me a bite, one player simple messaged me and say ""don't pay them anything, I will give it to you for free."" Not only that but he also gave me tips on how to complete the Werewolf single player quest.

I plan on sticking with this MMORPG for a very long time. Its fun, its first person, its 3rd person and its live action. It has its faults, all games do, but if you can take things with an open mind and a grain of salt you will find much love for this awesome game. It wont ever be ""Skyrim Online"" but in many ways I really feel it is. A great story, great community of players, a big wide open world to explore with choices that are unique to your character. Seems pretty close in my opinion.

2300320,Farming Simulator 25,"MASSIVE Disappointment 

Upon release this game genuinely has the worst and smallest selection of equipment out of all farming sim games.  Examples being there is a whole 2 skid steers, 4 payloaders, not even a single base game swather and brands such as Great Plains, White and Challenger only have one single piece of equipment.  Alongside there is a lot of popular equipment that was in FS22 that is now not in this game, such as the Deere gator, challenger tracked tractors, self propelled mowers/swathers, versatile brand tractors, vermeer brand implements, etc.

People in the farm sim community have been asking Giants for years to add more stuff for their North American playerbase, yet once again they've failed to deliver, infact they have less stuff for the North American playerbase in this version compared to FS22 and FS19.

There are still close to zero US spec equipment and US brand implements implements, no gravity wagons, no air carts/air seeders, no small square bales, no pull-behind disc mowers, no (non forestry) excavators, no dozers, and the big one is there is STILL no bushels unit for grain.

You'd think after the farm sim series has been out for years Giant's would listen to their community and add extremely basic things that the American playerbase has been requesting for years, but yet again they fall flat.  The only real feature added to this game for the North American playerbase is a paid swathing mod, even though it was a free mod made for FS22.

Absolutely let down that we once again have to rely on modders to make this $65 dollar game be at least half decent.","Mostly Positive74% of the 7,878 user reviews for this game are positive.",massive disappointment release genuinely worst smallest selection equipment repeatedly defeating enemy completing task gain resource sim game example 2 skid steer 4 payloaders not_even single base swather brand great plain white challenger single piece equipment alongside popular equipment fs22 not_in deere gator challenger tracked tractor self propelled mower swathers versatile brand tractor vermeer brand implement farm sim community asking giant year add stuff north american playerbase failed deliver infact stuff north american playerbase version compared fs22 fs19 close zero spec equipment brand implements_emphasized no_gravity wagon no_air cart air seeder no_small square bale no_pull disc mower no_non forestry excavator no_dozers big no_bushels unit grain farm sim series year giant listen community add extremely basic thing american playerbase requesting year fall flat real north american playerbase paid swathing modification alteration player fan modification alteration player fan fs22 rely modders 65 dollar half decent

730,Counter-Strike 2,"I've been playing Counter-Strike since around 2000 when it was 1.6 beta.  It was a natural progression for me from HL Deathmatch which was a ton of fun back in the day also.  I've been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours I wouldn't even want to know playing it, but i've had a ton of fun with it too!! 

It's funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows, especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that, without CS I question if there would even be a Steam service.  It's funny how things happen!!  

Nobody will ever read this so i have no idea why i'm spending the time writing a review of this type, especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more XP, funny :)  

CS and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and i'm forever grateful for that, but I have to say that the current state of affairs with the game, steam and Valve are a little sad.  There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me.  Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from.  The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!).  Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy?  If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for???  Think about it and get back to me why don't you (and i'll be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants - sarcasm).

My review won't be complete without touching on the current Steam vs Opskins, and the whole trading saga in general. Why won't Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.?  There's so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service?  It's a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you're just dealing with so much legal backlog from the ""loot box"" gambling situation?!?!?!  Who know's?  Certainly nobody in the community, why?  No communication.  Is it because you don't think you're client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don't consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to?  A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo. 

Anyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority.

Cheers

2408820,Luma Island,"COZY. Played with a friend and it was very fun, although slightly laggy at times (not sure if it's my pc or internet, considering I can run bigger games fine). I understand the game is new and I don't expect it to be perfect so for what it is as of now, it's great. Game looks very big and has a lot of content. Fishing is fun, farming is fun, have yet to encounter lumas (still looking for luma eggs for quest!). I hope in the future items you craft have a better description because sometimes you are told to craft something but it is not clear when or how you should use the item (example fertilizer making quest saying i would need it for grapes but then i had no option to fertilize the land before or after planting the seeds and then 10mins later the plot randomly needed fertilizer). SPIDERS ARE SPOOKY. Slowly exploring the first cave is fun, although the torch system you have to put out to progress could be a little better. Being unable to pick up a torch and set it up elsewhere is very inconvenient. Tools never break so you don't have to worry about repairing them at all which is awesome. I don't play a lot of farm sims but I have 10k hours in ARK and I'm glad I don't need to worry about my tools breaking.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"I really can’t recommend this game. 

The writing is frankly terrible —cringeworthy and overly simplistic, with clichés and tropes everywhere. There’s no real sense of danger or stakes, and the dialogue feels like it was lifted from a bad parody of a Marvel movie.

The companions I’ve encountered (I think I’ve met all but one) are actively annoying, and the voice acting for one or two is just plain bad. (neve)  I dread any conversations with them because they’re so tedious.

The levels feel like the developers took all the wrong lessons from God of War: Ragnarok. Instead of borrowing the good elements—like solid storytelling and  decent characters—they copied the level design and created environments that feel artificial and repetitive. Sure, there are a couple of different biomes, but they all end up looking pretty similar and filled with random obstacles just to showcase your “powers.” Inquisition wasn’t perfect, but at least the world felt a bit more engaging to explore.

As for the general gameplay? It’s decent enough, but nothing special—definitely doesn’t make up for  the  nonsense kids cartoon that is the writing . Overall, I’d give it a 5/10.","Mostly Positive71% of the 24,035 user reviews for this game are positive.",recommend writing frankly terrible cringeworthy overly simplistic clichés trope everywhere no_real sense danger stake dialogue feel lifted bad parody marvel movie companion encountered met actively annoying voice acting plain bad neve dread conversation tedious level developer took wrong lesson god war ragnarok borrowing good element solid storytelling decent character copied design created environment artificial repetitive couple different biome pretty similar filled random obstacle showcase power inquisition perfect world bit engaging explore general decent special definitely nonsense kid cartoon writing 5 10
2183900,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","I've already gotten to play a quite a bit as I received early review access for my podcast, so I can confidently say this game is worth the time of any Warhammer fan. Saber did a fantastic job capturing the spirit of 40k - the setting, story, sound design, and overall atmosphere are all very well done with an emphasis on attention to detail. Plus they simply nailed both the look and the intensity of ""the swarm"" (much better than Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Helldivers, or even Doom).

Likewise, the combat never gets boring, as you chain endless combos of guns and melee into satisfying executions. The campaign is solid and can be played solo or co-op. The operations mode (which plays a bit more like Vermintide or Darktide missions) has endless ways to customize your character - both with gameplay perks and weapon upgrades, but also a nice cosmetic progression system. There are also class trials to hone your skills and try out the various flavor of marine that best suits your tastes.

I'm looking forward to checking out Eternal War (the PvP mode) now that the game has launched to the general public. All in all it's just a fun game you should get together with the boys and play (or just ride a bunch of cool elevators together, there are a lot in this game).

Note: The 21:9 support wasn't in when I tried it yet, so hoping that comes in the Day 1 patch, as well as a fov slider.

1282270,Strinova,"This game is why Steam needs more than a up and down vote because its a good game and it's fun but clearly the devs don't play their own game well enough to see the flaws.

Gun imbalance is obviously there but the utility spam in some game modes like escort is ridiculous. 
It's really just a matter of balance and non existent matchmaking that holds this game back from really taking off. 

On top of that, this game either has a ton of bots or people have become incredibly stupid.
This is also the only game I've played that seems to close my steam every now and then.

The ""paper thin"" mechanic is too easily abused and should exhaust some sort of stamina so you can't just be paper as long as you want.

Lastly, the time to kill is grossly inconsistent and I just can't figure out why sometimes.

2344520,Diablo® IV,"I have been playing Diablo Games for nearly 30 years. I cannot recommend this game at full retail price.
Is Diablo 4 good? Yes, as a generic ARPG. Buy this game AND expansion ( if you can call it that) on sale at a discount.

Does Vessel of Hatred make it better? Marginally, by making the game feel like a clone of Diablo 3 (for better or worse.)

Rune words feel lazy. Mix any two stones and get their prefix and suffix. No unique builds akin to the D2 LOD system.

The Spirit born is just a D3 Monk with Druid vibes minus the auras and plays like the Blood Knight from Diablo Immortal. It wouldn't surprise me if it was a copy paste job done to save time. 

Paladins ARE put in game! JUST LIKE WE WANTED! As non playable, chumpy characters. It even seems like they fleshed out the skills for a Crusader / Paladin just to give them to a Mercenary.  

Lorath is on vacation, the whole game. Said to be looking for Nayrelle ends up meaning WHO THE HECK KNOWS, BUT HE LEFT YOU A LETTER!

The base world and story telling do not fit the theme of Diablo. Too much emphasis is put on friendship, trust and feel good moments. This is a direct contrast of the GRIM DARK feeling they were going fr in this game. All for the story itself to never be finished and told to completion. 
Even after the expansion, no new end game boss, no fighting prime evils. No conclusion!

The fact that Blizzard would sell us an unfinished Expansion for the price of a fully loaded base game is beyond me. 
This game should more accurately be titled INTRO TO the Vessel of Hatred seeing as there is no new end game boss, the story is lacks conclusion and feels like a seasonal update not an expansion DLC, and the new monsters are just reskins of existing enemies. Flayers are a rare enemy encounter and underutilized. 
The Real Money Store works great though and you can be rest assured there are plenty of 20 dollar skins for you to spend money on.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"Elden Ring is a good game. Perhaps the best game FromSoft has made, give or take Sekiro. 

There are a lot of people who are going to play it and love it. Unfortunately, there are also those who will read the ridiculous aggregate reviews--rife with some unseasonably lofty claims--and forget that this is, absolutely, a FromSoft game. 

I came into Elden Ring as someone who has never really enjoyed FromSoft games, hopeful that this would be the one that finally snags me. I mean, look at the reviews, right? Despite my distaste for the sub-genre, I've played and beaten each game at least once (for reasons more to do with social circles than aught else), so I feel like I have experienced enough of FromSoft's content to be well-versed in how each game flows. I was thus expecting Elden Ring and its open world to be the major shake-up the series' gameplay desperately needed (in my opinion).

Sadly, this was not the case. 

Essentially, in place of an engaging, rich open world, I found a Dark Souls themepark; it's vast and overflowing with Dark Souls things you can do. Everywhere you look! Dark Souls! Under that rock. In that cave. Look at that castle on the hill--guess what's in it? That's right: Dark Souls. If you like Dark Souls, you are going to have an absolute blast. Elden Ring is an incredible, unforgettable Dark Souls experience. In fact, for you, this review should not be taken as a negative but as an overwhelming positive.

That said, if, like me, you have not historically enjoyed Dark Souls? Don't expect there to be much gameplay left beyond that classic loop to make up for it. Elden Ring is a Dark Souls game through and through. The rooms are just wider.

238960,Path of Exile,"As my most played steam game, I figured its a good time to write a review. As a completely free to play game, its the best of its kind. The average player could take 30+ hours to complete the main 10 acts (for the first time). I am just going to hit some top pros and top cons.

Pros:
-Great dev team with very active community engagement. You can routinely find the lead developer on reddit clearing up misconceptions and engaging the community along with their community manager. 
-Plenty of content for casual players to have a fulfilling experience
-Plenty of content for the hardcore player
-Regular 3-4 month content updates with new ""leagues"" that have unique mechanics. The come along side balance changes
-HUGE amount of build diversity. The meta is largely dictated by the community with every class having a great many choices.
-Skill tree is expansive and gives you a lot of choices on how you want to play your character. This can be a con as its a little overwhelming at first
-Spending money is optional however a great quality of life upgradges (like other free to play) For example, you get 4 free stash tabs which you can quickly outgrow once you reach endgame. This could lead into a con mentioned below. 
-If you choose to spend money on supporter packs, you get a great ""value"" 

Cons:
-It takes many hours and research to really understand some game mechanics. Skill tree, gems, links, etc
-You can play a lot of hours on your first character but may not be able to finish the game unles you follow some sort of guide. This game is hard and will require a bit of learning. My first serious playthrough blind got nearly impossible to progress right around level 50 dude to my lack of understanding how the game works. There are a lot of beginner guides at this time due to popularity. 
-While this game is free, being competive and serious in the end game will require some minor investments to expand your ingame stash tabs. It will also enable trading to be far more accessiable. However, you won't hit this wall until your at least 40+ hours in.
-Game can be unstable for some computers and long loading times. Many people recommending a SSD. 
-Grouping with more than 3-4 players can get server laggy (Depending on many factors such as build types and speed on which you are killing) You can group with up to 5 other players. 
-Trading requires a website to take full advantage of the game, some mods help

Recommendations:
If you get to end game, spending just 30 dollars on a support pack will get you enough currency for a few premium stash tabs. These are used to inertact with trading websites and allow you to list items for sale. 

Play with at least 1 friend will help tremendously. Not only do you get better drops (shared), you should be able to progress through the story much easier.

Follow guides for your first couple characters until you get a grasp on what works and what doesn't. Be sure to pick a build that does not need a lot fo gear. - Google - Sunder Build or SRS Summoner. These are 2 very different but easy to play builds that will introduce you into the game smoothly.

This is a game that I keep coming back to and every time I do, it gets more and more fun.

2408820,Luma Island,"TLDR; Luma Island is fun, until it's not. 
First off, i want to say that I've enjoyed what I've played (up through area 3), However there are a few things I'd like to see changed or improved upon.

The Gameplay loop is as follows: Mine (for an absurdly long time) -> Upgrade tools -> Craft profession items -> progress to next area.
Which isn't a problem at first, until you realize that the whole game is that and nothing more. Each area is practically a 'reset' in your progress with extremely minimal gain in doing so. 
You have fully upgraded tools from area 1? Yeah well now that you're in area 2 they perform exactly as they did when un-upgraded. Each area is just a different aesthetic with the same rinse and repeat gameplay. i gave it the benefit of the doubt hoping it would improve or do SOMETHING to spice things up in area 3; nope, same old same old. 
Another problem we ran into was the ""house system"". By the time we built the first house we were in area 3 already and unlocked the next tier; which means tearing down the first house and starting the absurdly long grind for the new tier. 

Suggestions for the dev:
- Add player upgrades; i.e. Running shoes, player based luck, %chance to double-hit, health/hit count. etc. 
- Add a benefits system to professions, maybe each title of profession gives your player some sort of (substantial) benefit, which would further incentivize picking up multiple professions in a playthrough.
- increase the profession item's values by upwards of 50%, the increase between tiers is so unbelievably minimal it hurts the motivation to make the higher tier items.
- Nerf spiders health, maybe half? Even with a fully upgraded iron whip area 2 spiders take way too long to kill (yes you can kill spiders, it just take an absurd amount of hits)
- Integrate a House upgrade system, so instead of having to remove the first one you can upgrade once you acquire the blueprint. (no spoilers for those who haven't made it this far, but having the houses give a really nice benefit)
- PLEASE reduce crafting/smelting times or add something to speed them up (perhaps with the aforementioned benefits system) , doubling crafting time per tier is ridiculous.

With the current ""force-wipe"" schedule, the playing field is leveled out at least once a month, more often on servers that wipe more frequently. Due to some popular misconceptions, it's important to point out the following:

What this game is:
A fun, cyclical, first-person shooter with some* survival-based game elements and base-building. It's brutal, incredibly difficult to start, and has a steep learning curve. You can never trust other players, expect them to kill/betray you at any time.

* It seems to be a fairly common misconception that this is a survival game similar to ARK, Conan Exiles, Minecraft, etc. It's important to think of this game more as a team-based shooter in a somewhat long-lived open-world environment.

What this game is not:
This game is not a survival game. Despite having survival elements the core gameplay loop consists of visiting contested areas of the map and engaging in player versus player battles, sometimes while attempting PvE encounters as well.

Pros:
* Forced wipes every month, optional wipes more frequently (levels the playing field)
* New content with every force-wipe (monthly)
* Tons of community servers to choose from, including modded servers
* Incredibly well-balanced on all fronts, including the gunplay, base building/defending, and PvE encounters

Cons:
* Server browser allows community servers to label themselves which can sometimes lead to servers that claim they are ""vanilla"" or ""unmodded"" when they are actually not. 
* Cheating is still a pretty prevalent issue on most servers, both official and unofficial. Cheating in the form of admin abuse is frequent on unofficial servers.


Lastly, this game is probably not for you if you: 
* Get attached to your bases in survival games
* Are easily frustrated by other plays being ""trolls""
* Are frustrated/disappointed by having progress ""reset"" at frequent intervals (either with server wipes or being wiped by a PvP raid)

All things considered, if you enjoy shooters, I highly encourage giving this game a try. Expect a very steep and frustrating learning curve, but if you can get past that point then it's a very unique and enjoyable experience.","Very Positive87% of the 932,545 user reviews for this game are positive.",incredibly fun balanced base strong not_unraidable gunplay unique skill based clearly taking inspiration old school half life deathmatch counter strike force wipe schedule field leveled server wipe frequently due popular misconception important following fun cyclical shooter survival based element base building brutal incredibly difficult steep learning curve never_trust player expect kill betray fairly common misconception survival similar ark conan exile minecraft important based shooter somewhat long lived open world environment not_this not_a survival despite survival element core loop consists visiting contested area engaging versus battle attempting versus environment encounter pro forced wipe optional wipe frequently level field force wipe monthly ton community server choose including modded server incredibly balanced front including gunplay base building defending versus environment encounter con computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player browser allows community server label lead server claim vanilla unmodded not_cheating pretty prevalent issue server official unofficial cheating form admin abuse frequent unofficial server lastly probably not_for attached base survival game easily frustrated play troll frustrated disappointed progress reset frequent interval computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player wipe wiped versus large group player tackling difficult challenge thing considered enjoy shooter highly encourage giving expect steep frustrating learning curve past unique enjoyable

If we look just at vanilla Hoi4, we can see that this game had so much potential, but executed poorly, even after so many DLCs its still pretty bare bones compared to another thing, which keeps alive this game for a long time. Its mods, mods and mods. There so much mods, so much different types of them, that you feel like youre a small kid in the toystore where all the games and toys are FREE, not only that, but those toys are made by regular people like you and I. Its quite impressive that pretty mediocre game could become 10/10 game just because this one thing. You can spend hours upon hours just trying different mods out. You want something like regular vanilla, but with more conten? Road to 56 got you covered. Maybe you want to play something quite different like, idk, alternative universe. You got boatload of them, one the well-known is Kaiserreich (and a Wacky Kaiserredux, which is waaaaay better and fun, then original, because more stuff the better. Change my mind.) You got also Cold war era mods, mideval  era mods, modern day mods, etc... You also got a unicorn which is sorta Visual novel in form of strategy which is called TNO ( The New Order: Last days of Europe).

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"I hadn't played an MMO where the best times come at the front half of the game until I played New World. Starts off wonderfully, providing a free-form leveling experience in a beautifully crafted environment, with many cues to wander off in any given direction you choose to do exactly as you please. It can suck you in for dozens of hours before the real cracks start to show. 

I've played my share of middling MMOs, and I stuck it out as long as I could, hoping many of the game-breaking bugs at the endgame would be fixed by the time I got there. I'm almost 60, but I'm not sure when I'll bother to finish getting there at this point. I just hit the ""fuck this"" wall today. With every weekly patch, it seems like at least two bugs spawn when another gets fixed. And with the mountain of technical debt AGS will have to pay to ever set this game on a reasonable path forward, I guess no one should be surprised. Client-authoritative MMOs in 2021 from a studio backed by Amazon? Now that's comedy.

The game looks great. The problem is variety. Environments end up largely being the same. Forests, rocky mountains, grasslands, and a few swamps... that's about it aside from some differing architecture and a snowy zone. The main visual differentiation between zones is the lighting filter. Feels cheap after the fifth or sixth zone you wander through. That would be fine, given that this is more of a grounded fantasy, but the bigger offender is the utter lack of enemy variety. You'll end up fighting the same 15 enemy archetypes, complete with the exact same AI, throughout the entire leveling experience. The only thing that kept it halfway interesting for me after about level 30 was seeing just how many I could pull at once and survive. Woohoo, I guess.

Combat is on the basic side but would generally be satisfactory if it weren't for the fact that so many aspects of it are wonky and outright broken. I appreciate that this is action-based combat instead of another tab targeter, and I like on a certain level that group combat is generally more chaotic than what you find in most MMOs. It has a more organic and interesting feeling than typical holy-trinity flows, but the chaos goes a bit too far. Tanks end up being rag dolls for trash packs and bosses to toss around at will as they perform a balancing act to avoid insta-death falls, maintain aggro, and trying to achieve some semblance of contributing damage to the group. 

Gathering and crafting is great at first. You can make everything you need. The initial levels never feel too tedious in terms of time commitment to get what you want. It genuinely feels rewarding. Then, at some point in the 50-100 grind for respective disciplines, the scope of how obtuse and hacky the overall system is becomes quite clear. You'll reach a point where, if you don't feel like spending hours gathering the exact same mats, hauling it back to town to refine, craft, play a never-ending storage juggling game, and craft things you don't want or need just to level skills, you just aren't going to progress with crafting at all. On top of that, it becomes more and more mentally draining to count on the crafting system to provide you what you need. Why even bother when most useful gear can drop from same-level mobs as you quest in a fraction of the time? There's such a differential in time investment and reward, that there seems to be next to no reason to bother with the crafting systems unless you love the worst of grindy MMO systems.

The economy is something else. The gold sinks, particularly with repairing gear, slowly become overwhelmingly obnoxious. Taxes on everything are insufferable, made worse by dumbass armchair economists who control territories and set rates. There simply aren't enough reliable income streams to keep up with all the sinks that eventually are introduced. It's important for currencies to remain relevant and not be pointlessly amassed, but this game takes the idea too far. Almost comes across like a Bezos wet dream of ancap bullshit society simulation.

I could go on and on with criticisms of this game, but in a nutshell, the game is busted. There are good gameplay bones on top of a dogshit engine that's unlikely to ever provide the dev team the time they'll need to flesh everything out for the long haul. With the mountain of spaghetti code the game is built on, it'll likely always be busted. It would take a miracle for New World to last much more than another six months without becoming yet another random, middling MMO on Steam that is doing little else but milking the remaining whales with overpriced cosmetics until the bean counters decide the margins aren't worth continuing to maintain the game or keep up servers. What a shame.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"Review: Dragon Age: Vailguard

Edit: About the missing dark atmosphere.
Edit: 5-11-2024 finished game.

Updated Review: Dragon Age: Vailguard

After further reflection, I’ve decided to revise my score for Dragon Age: Vailguard, particularly for longtime fans of the series. Originally, I rated the game a 6 out of 10, acknowledging its technical polish but highlighting significant flaws in its storytelling and world-building. However, after experiencing the full game, I’m left with such disappointment that I feel compelled to change my score to a 4 out of 10 for Dragon Age fans.

While the game’s combat and graphics remain strong points, they’re ultimately overshadowed by the severe mishandling of the series' story and lore. I won’t spoil the ending, but I will say this: the writers have effectively retconned nearly every major decision and storyline established in previous Dragon Age games. It’s as if the past choices, struggles, and complex storylines that made this series beloved were simply erased. The ending itself feels hollow and unsatisfying, failing to address any of the longstanding questions from previous games, leaving fans with a complete lack of closure.

This game could have worked as an entirely new IP, unburdened by Dragon Age lore and expectations. As it stands, Vailguard does not feel like a Dragon Age game, but rather a misguided attempt to capitalize on the franchise name without respecting its core elements or fanbase. For new players, it may be an entertaining RPG. For those who cherished the original games, however, Vailguard is nothing short of a disappointment.

First review

Pros:

""Dragon Age: Vailguard"" has a lot to offer from a technical standpoint. The combat system is engaging, offering satisfying, dynamic battles that feel impactful and fluid. The game strikes a nice balance between tactical and action-based mechanics, making it enjoyable for both newcomers and fans of more active combat. The graphics are a definite strong point, with beautifully rendered environments, and a detailed fantasy world that’s visually impressive. Plus, it’s well-optimized; the game runs smoothly on my PC without any significant frame rate drops or technical hiccups, which is refreshing.

Cons:

However, once you move past the surface, the issues with ""Vailguard"" become impossible to ignore, especially for fans of the classic ""Dragon Age"" series. The storytelling feels like a massive step back, leaving me puzzled by the numerous plot holes in just the first few hours. Major elements from the established lore of previous games are either ignored or hastily rewritten, leaving a disjointed, hollow narrative that feels disconnected from the world we’ve come to love.

The writing, too, is a major disappointment. Instead of immersing players in the world with subtle, layered storytelling, the game resorts to clumsy, heavy-handed exposition. Characters seem to deliver lecture-like monologues, explaining every detail rather than allowing players to piece things together naturally. This approach strips the game of any mystery or intrigue, making it feel more like a ""Dragon Age"" TED Talk than an immersive RPG experience.

Adding to this lack of immersion is the game's failure to build a believable world. Previous ""Dragon Age"" games were praised for their world-building, with deep lore and richly detailed settings that made Thedas feel alive. In ""Vailguard,"" however, that magic is missing. The environments and characters feel hollow, like they’re only there to serve the main plot points without any depth or substance. This lack of attention to the world around the protagonist makes it difficult to feel invested in the stakes or in the outcome of the story.

The game's beginning is another misstep. Instead of drawing players in with a compelling introduction, ""Vailguard"" starts by bombarding players with a detailed account of the protagonist's life, attempting to tell rather than show. There’s no connection, no emotional investment – just a series of explanations that fail to make the protagonist feel like a real person. A more effective start could have been to allow players to experience an origin story firsthand, perhaps freeing slaves, meeting characters like Varric, and then progressing to the main timeline. A prologue like this would have helped establish character connections, deepen the world, and give players a real reason to care about what happens next.

One of the most disappointing aspects is the absence of the dark, gritty atmosphere that has defined the series. Previous Dragon Age games were steeped in a sense of danger, where the stakes felt real, and the world seemed to be hanging by a thread. In Vailguard, that oppressive, perilous tone is missing. The stakes feel strangely low, even though the protagonist is supposedly fighting against gods. Despite the catastrophic implications of the main plot, no one else in the world seems remotely concerned. It’s as if only the protagonist cares about this monumental struggle, which feels both unbelievable and immersion-breaking. Given the scale of the conflict, it’s baffling that the rest of the world remains apathetic; surely, there would be factions, organizations, and everyday citizens rallying or resisting as well. This lack of urgency and broader involvement makes the world feel hollow, and it robs the story of its weight and believability.

Conclusion:

In the end, ""Dragon Age: Vailguard"" is a technically competent game that falls short in its storytelling and character development. For new players unfamiliar with the franchise, it’s an enjoyable RPG that could easily rate around a 7.5 or even an 8 out of 10 for its combat and visuals alone. However, for longtime fans of the ""Dragon Age"" series, it’s a disappointing experience. The neglect of established lore, poor writing, and lackluster world-building result in a game that feels disconnected from what made the series special in the first place. As a dedicated fan, I’d have to rate it a 6 out of 10 – a game that, while technically polished, fails to capture the essence of what ""Dragon Age"" is all about.","Mostly Positive71% of the 24,035 user reviews for this game are positive.",age vailguard missing dark atmosphere 5 11 2024 finished updated age vailguard reflection decided revise score age vailguard longtime fan series originally rated 6 10 acknowledging technical polish highlighting significant flaw storytelling world building experiencing left disappointment compelled score 4 10 age fan combat graphic remain strong point overshadowed severe mishandling series lore spoil ending writer effectively retconned nearly major decision storyline established age game past choice struggle complex storyline series beloved simply erased ending feel hollow unsatisfying failing address longstanding question game leaving fan complete lack closure worked entirely ip unburdened age lore expectation stand vailguard not_feel age rather misguided attempt capitalize franchise name respecting core element fanbase player entertaining role cherished original game vailguard short disappointment pro age vailguard offer technical standpoint combat engaging offering satisfying dynamic battle impactful fluid strike nice balance tactical action based mechanic enjoyable newcomer fan active combat graphic definite strong beautifully rendered environment detailed fantasy world visually impressive plus optimized run smoothly pc significant frame rate drop technical hiccup refreshing con move past surface issue vailguard impossible ignore especially fan classic age series storytelling feel massive leaving puzzled numerous plot hole hour major element established lore game ignored hastily rewritten leaving disjointed hollow narrative feel disconnected world love writing major disappointment immersing player world subtle layered storytelling resort clumsy heavy handed exposition character deliver lecture monologue explaining detail rather allowing player piece thing naturally approach strip mystery intrigue age ted talk immersive role adding lack immersion failure build believable world age game praised world building deep lore richly detailed setting thedas alive vailguard magic missing environment character hollow serve plot point depth substance lack attention world protagonist make difficult invested stake outcome beginning misstep drawing player compelling introduction vailguard start bombarding player detailed protagonist life attempting rather no_connection no_emotional investment series explanation fail protagonist real effective allow player origin firsthand perhaps freeing slave meeting character varric progressing timeline prologue helped establish connection deepen world player real care happens next disappointing aspect absence dark gritty atmosphere defined series age game steeped sense danger stake real world hanging thread vailguard oppressive perilous tone missing stake strangely low protagonist supposedly fighting god despite catastrophic implication plot no_one else world remotely concerned protagonist care monumental struggle feel unbelievable immersion breaking given scale conflict baffling rest world remains apathetic surely faction organization everyday citizen rallying resisting lack urgency broader involvement make world hollow robs weight believability conclusion age vailguard technically competent fall short storytelling development player unfamiliar franchise enjoyable role easily rate 7 5 8 10 combat visuals alone longtime fan age series disappointing neglect established lore poor writing lackluster world building result feel disconnected series special dedicated fan rate 6 10 technically polished fails capture essence age

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"I thought this game was pretty awesome. I played with my friends and my husband and the guild we were in. We all got to 60 together and had many adventures, bought and decorated houses. Then I had to have two hip surgeries back to back after breaking my left knee and right ankle in an accident and couldn't play due to health reasons. I come back to play with my husband, my guild and my friends and find out I can't. I've been kicked from our world, Their answer - just start a new character and make new friends. Seriously?!?  So don't get in an accident or have health issues and expect it is a game you can come back to. You know that feeling like coming home after being away from a favorite game, this isn't it. They kick you to the curb and tell  you the hours you put in are nothing, they don't need you back. Yes admittedly I was away from the game for 8 months but I was trying to get well enough to play any game, I never expected to no longer be able play a game i put the hours in to max out a character with my friends and family just for taking a necessary break. If you plan to just play through then its an awesome game but don't take a break or you basically lose everything. They only care about taking your money, not the player base. With pretty much any MMO players take breaks between updates, life happens, you go back, you see old friends and guild members and create new adventures together.....not here, they don't care about the returning players only the new ones. Sadly it has become a game I can no longer recommend.

UPDATE -- I was able to get back into my home world with my husband and my guild when they unlocked our world again. I am still unsure if I will be going back now that I have the option to do so. Some of our guild still hasn't been able to or want to after all this  hassle and I don't blame them either way they chose. This whole ordeal should never have had to happen.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"The new update has made the game extremely frustrating. 

This 'Nerf or Nothing' mindset that the devs have is going to kill the game in the long run. Nothing in this game has ever been powerful enough to warrant nerfs. The railgun and arc thrower were both nerfed because of a bug making them much more effective against bile titans than they ever should have been. Yet, they keep nerfing our tools, while making the enemies stronger, which actually discourages variety and leads to less diverse and more forced metas. It's honestly hard to tell at this point if the spreadsheet balancing is due to incompetence or a genuine malice Arrowhead holds for the playerbase. The excuse of 'Realism' is such bollocks. If our fire damage can't hurt heavy enemies, then the flame hulks shouldn't be able to damage heavy armour helldivers. But of course, the devs only care about 'Realism' when it fucks over the Helldiver, not the enemy.

Don't get me started on the new enemies (especially the tentacles that ragdoll lock you to death) but I think the constant nerfs for good (not op) weapons are a far bigger issue.

Either way, uninstalled and I will not be coming back until multiple patches in a row prove that Arrowhead are willing to change their nerf heavy mindset in a PvE game. Freedom of Escalation coming off the back of the best patch in the game's history has definitely ruptured any trust the playerbase had for the devs, and it is going to take multiple back to back to back patches of not gutting decent weapons and buffing outright useless ones for many people (including myself) to come back, and many more simply won't come back no matter how much things improve.","Mostly Positive74% of the 674,223 user reviews for this game are positive.",extremely frustrating weaken reduce effectiveness mindset kill long powerful warrant nerfs railgun arc thrower nerfed bug effective bile titan nerfing tool enemy stronger discourages variety lead diverse forced metas honestly hard spreadsheet balancing due incompetence genuine malice arrowhead hold playerbase excuse realism bollock fire damage hurt heavy enemy flame hulk able damage heavy armour helldivers course care realism fuck helldiver not_the enemy started enemy especially tentacle ragdoll lock death constant nerfs good not_op weapon far bigger issue uninstalled not_be multiple patch row prove arrowhead willing weaken reduce effectiveness heavy mindset versus environment freedom escalation best software fix bug balance add feature history definitely ruptured trust playerbase multiple patch not_gutting decent weapon buffing outright useless one including simply no_matter thing improve

2429640,THRONE AND LIBERTY,"
The fundamental problem with this game is that it cannot be considered pvp or pve.
- Pvp can only be done only when it's night in the game, and only in the dungeons where to access it you have to channel yourself into a passage always controlled by God tier guilds. 1 vs 20 , you die, you are out :D
- Pve makes sense only if you have a gs <2k, but as soon as you get to 3k+ you become literally immortal and it turns into a rush-farm. So no Pve either.
- Mass Pvp events are kind of nice but  you have to put yourself in a context, you need an hardcore guild to enjoy this kind of content.
Was it so hard  to make pvp GLOBAL at night? So that even small groups of 3-4 people can travel the world and have fun?

After you reach to 3500 GS dgearing up becomes pure RNG. You don't even need to buy lucent because it's a waste of money.
It can happen that you play 1 hour and you get 400 lucent , and at the same time it can happen that you play  8 hours and you get less than  100.

Global pvp  like siege depends on server balance. Can be an extermination of casuals by 3700 GS guilds, or it can turn balanced with good alliances.
This game is not for casuals, it's complex and you need to be part of an HC guild. It surely can be improved but if this does not change the servers will be empty soon.

236390,War Thunder,"Can be fun but hard to recommend for various reasons.Firstly i will just say its NOT p2w or Russian biased. It IS pay to grind less or not at all, with extreme greedy price model, mid to high tier tanks cost the price of a AAA game, FOR ONE TANK!!!After 250+ hours split across all 3 modes I feel the devs are taking the mickey.Lets cover the modes.Aircraft-Now IMHO as someone who's got thousands of hours in il21946 (ignore steam stats, owned 3 copies in total including 2 stand alone prior to it beign on steam and have 3 installs , only one runs through steam) i feel that its just not there physics wise, and look at the age of il21946? Go play that, a newer il2, DCS etc etc as they eat this for breakfast! The naval battles are absolute garbage and feel like a token throw in with no effort put into any parts of it, just dont bother! Only good thing i can say is that it prompted me to try W.O.W  which is the polar opposite, so if f2p naval battles is your desire, look there.Last and the ONLY reason i can be close to recommending this is the tank battles.When itrs right, its a lot of fun! Reminds me of the heydays of tank battles in Red Orchestra.The issue is its hampered by some sever flaws, intentional or incompetent I cant say for sure, but i lean towards the former, you know feels like the devs went to a certain seminar about ""whaling"" as they have been present for so long with ZERO attempts to rectify. The MAJOR one is the BR uptiering, where you get slapped against much better tanks of higher tiers, getting your rear handed to you.Not hard to fix, they claim split player base but thats garbage as there is NO SHORTAGE of players to have more fairer BR compression. The map designs, particularly spans are aweful, you often spawn facing wrong way or on a incline you cant drive up, theres also some very poor balance on certain maps and/or certain game modes. Oh you don't like map or game mode? You cant choose what you want to play, why would you want to do that and remove frustration that encourages marine mammals to open their wallets? Span camping is a HUGE problem with little to no protection. In order to advance you have to earn RP, to get this its desirable to win! Problem with that is the average players seems not to grasp this and instead hunts kills which give you a nice score and coins but not much rp and doesnt help your team in general, again the devs know this and do nothing, really makes you wonder why? Once you get past about the middle tier it becomes very hard to pay for damage/ammo , even when winning! So you have 2 options, go play lower tier to grind coin or pay real coin. Theres also some lovely bugs present for years such as INVISIBLE TANKS and GHOST SHELLS ever present to ruin your gaming experience, go look for videos on YT to understand.In short, the only reason it survives is theirs NO COMPETITION at least as far as tanks go, the other modes there is so go try tjhem instead. If you want tanks, give it a go but expect to stay in low tiers forever,  especially without over priced premium account which i tried for a month myself but wont be paying them a single cent from now on and i highly recommend you do not either.Its a shame because there is GREAT potential in the tank mode, but far to many issues to recommend it in any serious capacity.","Mostly Positive72% of the 561,252 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

252490,Rust,"Pro: Can be fun, can be rewarding.

Con: The fun is constantly drained and destroyed by other players. Rust is extremely difficult to play if you cannot spend a significant part of each day online keeping your hard earned stuff safe. Offline raiding is a curse for the casual player, you just can't get anywhere if you only play a few hours per week. God forbid you are a solo; you spend 3 hours building the most minmal base to simply start an existance then come back 2 days later to find it destroyed/griefed or taken over.

If you are budgeting less than 3 hours PER DAY to play this game EVERY DAY, don't buy it. The gameplay promotes toxic player interaction; the weaker are continually preyed upon by the stronger, irrespective of the total lack of gain for the stronger player to grief the weaker. The fact that you just spent your entire weekly budget of playtime building yet another starter base, only to have it raided - again - by a bunch of high level chadbags that don't even need your pathetic equipment doesn't enter in to the decision making calculus of the average no-life basement dwelling socially inept tween/teen/pre-pubescant squeaker virgins that play this game.

1282270,Strinova,"I’m going to give this game my good honest review (like I’m going to do with a lot of other games, for future reference, I’m writing this after Release :)

Im giving this game a solid 6.6/10. This game isn’t bad at all, but it isn’t the greatest either. I know I don’t have much game time in it but I can give a solid rundown of the game. 

The gameplay is, unfortunately nothing new. Aside from the paper Mario form mixed with link between worlds allowing you to become paper thin and stick to a wall to jump out of, it’s another hero shooter game. When you press play, it looks for a lobby, but when you get into one, you have to confirm to enter the lobby… for some reason. When I was dropped in, I either missed what mode I was playing or it wasn’t there. I was met with a familiar agent picking ui. Then I was just dropped into the game with no warmup time or time until the game begins. I was put in and had to start shooting. 

The modes, at least the couple I’ve played so far, were team death match normal, 7v7 on a small ish map. Which I guess is fine since there’s no sprinting. And a, battle royal team death match, a zone shrinking the map to which first to 40 wins. I also heard domination was a thing, but didn’t get it. I did see a ranked mode was on the listing, so I’d imagine that’d ring some people in.

The maps are… decent, they aren’t super eye catching. Some areas you have to use the stick feature to get high up. But their somewhat like traditional 2-3 lane cod maps.

Now, imagine something. Imagine valorant, and genshin got together, then cod mobile and overwatch got together, then those two got together and, this came out. When I first loaded up the game, I was met with a cutscene to which I had no idea what was happening fully. Which they explained somewhat. Then I was met with a similar menu like valorant or CS:GO. There is lore to the game. The unfortunate battle pass contains cutscenes of the lore for the season. 

The only difference being the dormitory and union tab, the dormitory for having “oaths” with characters to get rewards of some kind. Next you have a solid amount of agents, both very well made guys and gals with different abilities, weaponry and skins. 

Now, one thing I was happy about is this game is not pay to win, more like pay to have drip. You get items by doing gacha pulls, either character skins, or weapon skins or even sprays. You have your standard banner where you can pick the upped skin. And your event banner where you pull for the main character skin.

I will say, the graphics in this game are actually well made. The vfx and weapon skins are all colorful and eye catching. The skins are cool and shiny. But for character skins, it’s definitely like valorant, cause purple skins to grey (blue in the middle) it’s just slight differences. The characters are well made too, their outfits flowing some as they move, (gentlemen get your head out of the gutter with the physics) the fan service is a little unnecessary, but if you know anything about gacha games. It’s around star rail level fan service, maybe around zenless, which is much less than a bunch of games.

Overall, this game isn’t bad. It has potential. I wouldn’t say it deserves the review bombs for the region lock. Unless you’re trying to play with international friends, it doesn’t change much as far as gameplay. 

That’s all for now. Until I review my next game.

2300320,Farming Simulator 25,"Very neutral review. I had high expectations of what we could expect to see in 25 so far its met 80% of that. The game is visually appealing, has awesome new vehicle manufacturers, maps are beautifully done, graphics are mind blowing on ultra, some integrated features that were mods in the previous  game are now base game, which is cool, easy to use and very helpful, but.. some aspects just feels like its 22 through rose tinted glasses. 

I was a little disappointed to see a few of these in just 8hrs playing. Some updates and fixes needed ive noted here.

-Dynamic suspension isn't on all vehicles, not sure why its on FH16 forestry but not internationals etc work on that before adding new content.
-Vehicles aren't tension belt objects by default, should be able to be strapped down when transporting, also seed pallets dont have TBO physics box either.
-Vehicles vibrate on roads, suspensions too rigid, or Mass to low.
-Work cameras are still a dds texture, c'mon Giants
-Logs still push through collisions while moving after being strapped with tension belts.
-Character movement has acceleration animation which is horrible and laggy
-Rice foliage stubble clips through Rice Harvester tracks - needs foliage bending
-Chainsaw is horrendous to use, tree detection ring shows up on the 3rd or 4th try or not at all. 

Lastly... put those pillion pegs up on that Aprilia.. dont let Deb see them down when you come back to the farm Hoss.

1790600,DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO,"I have played this game from 5 PM CST to midnight on October 7th, which is 6 hours.

And I have some thoughts.

First off, I want to make clear that this is a worthy follow-up to the legacy Budokai Tenkaichi series from the PS2 era. The roster is near perfect (Just missing Super 17 and Pikon), gameplay feels snappy and responsive. Nothing feels like I am fighting the game just to get characters to do what I want, really, this game is simply a treat to simply sit down and play.

Environment is super reactive to smashing your opponents through it, never does it not feel satisfying sending someone through a building and watching it crumble. It is super detailed that if the devs came to tell me that this is the reason why local splitscreen is in a white void style stage, I would believe them. (Even more so given how other games in this series had to handle local vs)

You also unlock everything at a more than reasonable pace. It is super easy to get Zeni, from either story mode, world tournament, or just playing vs against the AI or other people. Which not only do places like world tournament offer insane turnouts for Zeni (and even Dragon Balls can be rewards), playing the game will also passively make progress with Zen-Oh and Whis' missions, which is stuff like ""Use Kamehameha 50 times"", as an example, and this gets you even more Zeni and Dragon Balls as rewards. (This is also not counting for the fact that if you get repeated items from combat, the game will auto sell it for Zeni, increasing your payout even more) To give an idea, I got the Million Zeni achievement in like, 3 hours. Needless to say, you will be rolling in the dough in less than no time.

This game is not perfect, however. Some transformations don't look real great (Z Broly's LSSJ feels too fast for it's own good, and Jiren just hard cuts to his full power with no flash or attempt to hide it, just to come to mind.) Strike supers find a way to miss, even if you are right in their face, so all you can do is just use them mid combo if you want them to work. The story mode is also presented in a underwhelming way. I get the emphasis is to sell on what-ifs and alternate paths, but presenting like a slideshow all of the filler aspects just feels cheap.

I am not gonna say anything on the online, as I have not tried it yet, I just want to enjoy the offline offering to myself for now. I have heard mixed reports on online working on Linux though, so you are gonna have to use your own discretion if you play on Linux. Steam Deck I also heard has issues playing online, but that is because since the game logic is tied to the game being 60 fps (essentially making 60 fps a necessity more than you would think for this game), and if that fps fluctuates, then the game and match it liable to fluctuate. Hopefully Namco and Spike can offer up some performance help for Steam Deck users.

If I had to put a number on this game, I would say this game is a 8 or 8.5 out of 10. Really solid and fun to play, but the issues I line up just hit that much harder because of the expectation I had going in. Still happy I played this game, and will continue to play it, I just hope Namco or Spike can help this game on Steam Deck, and address stuff like strike supers missing to such a degree.","Very Positive91% of the 36,092 user reviews for this game are positive.",5 pm cst midnight october 7th 6 hour thought clear worthy follow legacy budokai tenkaichi series ps2 era roster near perfect missing super 17 pikon feel snappy responsive feel fighting character simply treat simply sit play environment super reactive smashing opponent never_does not_feel satisfying sending someone building watching crumble super detailed local splitscreen white void style stage believe given game series handle local v unlock reasonable pace super easy zeni mode world tournament v ai not_only place world tournament offer insane turnout zeni ball reward passively progress zen oh whis mission stuff kamehameha 50 time example get zeni ball reward not_counting repeated item combat auto zeni increasing payout idea million zeni achievement 3 hour needle rolling dough no_time not_perfect transformation real great z broly lssj feel fast good jiren hard cut power no_flash attempt hide mind strike super miss face mid combo mode presented underwhelming emphasis ifs alternate path presenting slideshow filler aspect feel cheap not_gonna online not_tried enjoy offering heard mixed report on_emphasizedline working linux gon na discretion play linux deck heard issue online logic tied 60 shooter essentially 60 shooter necessity shooter fluctuates liable fluctuate hopefully namco spike offer performance help deck user number 8 8 5 10 solid fun play issue line harder expectation happy continue play hope namco spike help deck address stuff strike super missing degree
1203620,Enshrouded,"this is in no means a negative review based on game play. the 3 hours i got to play where great. however the state of the game has many players crashing within an hour of booting up the game ( if they get so lucky as to get it to boot) ive had my last 2 hours wiped after 2 sessions with no talks of fixing it nor any resolution in sight for those getting effected by this. its still early release i get that, but an update that makes about half of your player base unable to play might be something to fix ASAP rather than issues with manual save system.

Update as of 3 hot fixes and a huge update later.

Still no fix in sight nor talk about it. i would hold off on buying this game until its fixed. a 50/50 that you could play this game isint worth it.","Very Positive85% of the 53,278 user reviews for this game are positive.",no_means negative based play 3 hour play great state player crashing booting lucky boot ive last 2 hour wiped 2 session no_talks fixing nor_any resolution sight effected early release make half base unable play fix asap rather issue manual save 3 hot fix huge no_fix sight nor_talk hold buying fixed 50_emphasized play isint worth

2379780,Balatro,"[i]Balatro[/i] is an amazing roguelike game. I personally never enjoyed poker, but fell in love with [i]Balatro[/i], so if you're in a similar boat put the poker elements aside and think of it as a deck-building game. You have a 52 card deck which can be shaped in a variety of ways. There are 150 joker cards with unique effects that impact your run, planet cards which increase the power of poker hands, and arcane cards which typically allow you to enhance, alter, or remove cards from your deck. There are eight antes, or levels, in a Balatro run; your goal is to complete ante eight. Each ante has three different rounds, the first two can be skipped to recieve a benefit– however you'll miss out on the cash and item shop you would've earned from playing the round– the last one is a boss round where a specific modifier is applied to you (heart cards debuffed, face cards drawn face down, only one hand type, etc). After each round you get access to an item shop where you can purchase jokers, or cards which will improve your deck - you also gain interest on money held between rounds in-case nothing in the shop catches your eye. These elements all work together well to create a fun experience where every decision matters, that is unique each run, and always winnable (on lower difficulties) once you get the hang of it. 

One of my favorite things about [i]Balatro[/i] is how much variety there is. With 150 jokers and 15 deck choices, there are many different strategies you can build into while finding success. As an example, I recently won only playing clubs, only playing two pair, playing high card, and playing only face cards. In terms of criticisms for [i]Balatro[/i], while it is really well balanced around lower difficulties, once you're at the highest difficulty levels that doesn't hold true. IMO this is something that's way harder to balance in a deckbuilder, but in other popular amazing roguelikes, [i]Hades[/i], and [i]The Binding of Isaac[/i] you could throw a really high skill player into some of the highest difficulty settings/challenges available, and their skill could carry them to victory, and over a 50% win rate. In [i]Balatro[/i] on the other hand, you can play absolutely perfectly, and never see anything good in the shop before the round scale to a point where you're going to lose. I don't claim to be an amazing [i]Balatro[/i] player, but I can guarantee you that even the best [i]Balatro[/i] player in the world, or a bot doing everything perfectly, is going to have a very low win rate with the black deck on gold stakes. Another small point of criticism/feedback is joker balance; while most have amazing use cases, there are a few that feel worthless (moreso than ones that feel OP or super strong).

Another massive win for [i]Balatro[/i] is that the solo developer, LocalThunk, is clearly very passionate, talented, and receptive to feedback from the community. Since I've been playing there have been multiple patches balancing jokers, difficulty levels, card modifications, etc. even though I do have a few criticisms for [i]Balatro[/i], they don't make me think negatively about the game in any way because I know LocalThunk is listening to the community, and is going to continue doing an amazing job with the game (the only thing I dislike about LocalThunk is that he created that Completionist++ achievement). [i]Balatro[/i] is a game I was skeptical to pick up because of my dislike for poker, but now I have 200+ hours in the game, have completed all 20 challenges, and beat the hardest difficulty on 11/15 decks; clearly, I am very high on the game. [i]Balatro[/i] is also an amazing entry point for the roguelike genre. It's a game that is so unique, adapting many of the genre's best elements to a classic game in impressive fashion, on top of that it's incredibly polished and charming; [i]Balatro[/i] is a game anyone can enjoy, and it's an instant entry into the pantheon of all-time amazing roguelike games.

Hi, this is my first review and it is fitting that this is the game that gets it.

Why? because it spoke to my inner child (i'm 30) the one that discovered that samus was a girl while playing Super Metroid or watched Frog/Glenn split the mountain entrance with masamune in Chrono Trigger, that awe when the game gives you more than you expected.

How? I will tell you.

I played Warframe since the beggining, no Vor's Prize as intro or 4 revives per mission (more like 4 revives per day) the grind was just as bad as it is now, this is a free 2 play game expect some type of grind, but I liked the gameplay so I stuck around for more, they developed more content pretty fast, so I kept coming back, the community grew, I lurked like a lurker and watched as the lore grew and evolved.

2 or 3 years of that and then the Second Dream quest came around...

I've kept this in mind It's a F2P game, it does not have to be a rich game, hell even HOTS said ""You shouldn't think too hard about these things""

So yeah space magical ninjas! go and have fun!

But Second Dream came they have made a storyline. A good and compelling storyline and it's still being developed with more content every year.

I came for the ninjas but stayed because this is a game that care about being more than a bunch of mechanics tied together by gameplay and aestetics.

This would be seen in full price release, but it's a F2P with no pay wall (except if your want to do fashionframe as color schemes are behind a pay wall etc...).

Long story short ninjas play free.","Very Positive87% of the 598,811 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Good game, with some flawed areas. 

I personally find this is, although I'm kinda late to the party, a breath of fresh air after playing thousand hours of Dota / Overwatch for multiplayer games, mostly because of it's matchmaking system where you can have free selection whether you want to solo or play as a team. In this MP game, if you're not in a mood to pairing with other people, you can solo as a Killer. If you want to play with others, you can play Survivors. If played correctly, being survivors should give you a sense of togetherness when playing, covering each others' back so you can all escape together. Sometimes it just gets ruined by... errr... trolls. But whatever.

The Bloodweb System is quite neat, it's quite different than the skill tree commonly found in present-day games. You level up your branch based on your own decision, then arrange the perks in the slot to personalize your characters. You can also get and equip items along with its add-ons. Pretty much to my liking.

Let's not forget the adrenaline rush. Being somewhat horror game, it's pretty intense to play as survivors and getting chased around by deranged murderer. 

But still, I have my own personal griefs. 

The first one is that the connection is although dedicated, so problematic. Sometimes I get sent to wrong server, so I have yellow ping. It's definitely better than 2 years ago where I constantly got red ping. Also, hitbox detection still sucks, so there's that.

Don't forget stuck in a matchmaking screen bug, happened to me many times even with first-class connection.

DLCs are also another annoyances. You need to buy characters (Survivors and Killers). While the content is not gated by paywall, being limited in character selections if you're not willing to pay is irksome. I don't mind cosmetics and it's the only acceptable DLCs in my book.

The worst issue? BHVR really need to address cheaters. I am so ready to flip this review to be negative if they don't take actions anytime soon.

And lastly, I'm not a fan of the reward system. Completing 3/5 gens on your own? Still have final score lower than other survivors. Grah.

216150,MapleStory,"This game should be 18+. Aggressive loot box and monetization of game mechanics to trick people into wanting to spend money in a game with a kid friendly art style and child friendly censorship, do not at a glance, line up with the games target demographic.

Good core gameplay. If you know exactly what you are doing the monetization in the game is quite reasonable excluding loot box systems, you can earn currency to buy monetized things by spending time in game which is always a nice mechanic to see  in MMO.

Dailies system has been pushed nearly as far as it can go. Daily mission used to bring people back everyday can take 1-3 hours depending on current events and how much you care about your progression.

Lots of replayability, in fact the game wants you to make 40 characters (a Legion) which will take you between 5-80 hours each depending on your experience and resources on hand. (There area  few 2 hour runs but this will not be 99% of players)

Fair amount of diversity in playstyle in the characters so it helps not make it too monotonous and if you abandon a character because you don't like it don't worry you helped make all your other characters stronger in the future your work is not wasted you helped your Legion.

Every month I've been playing this game there has been some scandal with the devs mistreating the  community. Looking at community pages this appears to be a trend and they show very little signs of trying to improve.  People are often gaslighted for voicing their opinions which may explain the lack of positive response from the developer.  

No other game like it in the market.

------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW ------------

The only two games I ever pre-ordered were No Man's Sky and this (laugh now) and thus I wanted to give CDPR a fair chance to fix it before I write this. Now it won a Steam Award. Next year then ""Labour of Love"" award because bugfixes? Maybe I'm just too old for all of this.

Summary:
Most of the bugs on PC are gone by now, maybe except out of bounds errors.
I liked the story (still not finished) quite a bit but still expected more. Some cool side quests.
The Braindance is braindead. 
The whole open world aspect is negligible in terms of both gameplay and excitement.
The perks are as riculous, as the whole RPG aspect is.
It looks nice and sounds okay.
3rd person could have added a lot imo.
For 50% off, maybe. Better wait for 70% next Summer Sale.

Once again a developer promised stuff that did not happen until the date the publisher wanted the game to pay off. 
Except CDPR, in this case, is both.","Very Positive84% of the 693,658 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

2139460,Once Human,"It's a review from someone who has played the game for 870+ hours logged on Steam.

The game start off good after the initial release, mainly during the first server. No major game breaking bug, mistranslation here and there, but forgiveable for a newly released game. No significant lag except for Prime wars.

But the overall direction went to a totally different direction with major lag in all part of the game. Prime war? still lag. Silo, monolith dungeon? Lag. Solo Silo, Monolith? Lag as well. Running around the map? Lag as well. Some build is not viable due to significant lag. More and more translation error as well.

All while these major issues are still in game, the dev release 3-4 paid loot boxes. Note that the game are only in the 2nd round of the season and a season only last for 6 weeks. 
Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is fun, hence the 800+ hours, but I wouldn't recommend anyone to start playing it in the current state. Despite the lootbox, it's not a P2W game. The theory crafting in the game is fun, and albeit locked behind the Starchom in-game currency (can't buy with real money), you can still make a number of different builds, which I have tried at least 15-20 possible builds.

The base building is fun, but it's also one major reason for the lag, as mainly noticeable in the Blackfell area due to the trucks and the building on top. 

So, overall, it's a good and fun game, I would not recommend anyone to start playing it at the current state. You'll lose interest quickly with all the lag, and will definitely have bad impression with the mistranslation and the frequent bug. Watch the dev/community reaction on the lag issue, and see if it has been solve before trying the game.","Mostly Positive71% of the 104,699 user reviews for this game are positive.",someone 870 hour logged good initial release mainly computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player no_major breaking bug mistranslation forgiveable newly released no_significant delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection except prime war direction totally different direction major delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection prime war delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection silo monolith dungeon delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection solo silo monolith delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection running delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection build not_viable due significant delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection translation error major issue release 3 4 paid item reward dropped defeated enemy box note 2nd round season season last 6 week wrong fun 800 hour recommend state despite lootbox not_a p2w the_emphasizedory crafting fun albeit locked starchom currency real number different build tried 15 20 possible build base building fun major delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection mainly noticeable blackfell due truck building top good fun not_recommend state lose interest quickly delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection definitely bad impression mistranslation frequent bug watch community reaction delay interruption due slow inconsistent network connection issue solve trying
236390,War Thunder,"A decent game plagued by terrible monetization and community engagement from the devs. The grind is immense and the 70+ dollars for a single vehicle is ball busting.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"Gaming as a whole in the 21st century can be summed up perfectly by playing this game. Apex Legends has bar none the best game mechanics in any battle-royale and credit where its due, Respawn absolutely knocked the game fundamentals out of the park, however all of Apex Legends' problems stem from its overt and predatory monetization.

1. Loot boxes, literal gambling that you can spend your life savings on

2. Skill based matchmaking in pubs is incredibly strong, I am a Bronze 1 player and I have not had a teammate lower than gold in a non ranked game mode, for those who do not know, strong skill based matchmaking is forced onto developers to increase retention and coerce players to linger in the menus and browse the shop the longer they are out of a game.

3. Cosmetic prices in the shop are Valorant levels of greedy, some skins you cannot buy individually or even earn in game and all event skins come bundled which further inflates the price.

4. The amount of currency in this game is a psychological tactic used by developers to blur the line between real money and the corresponding ""premium currency"" You will never ever be able to outright be able to purchase the exact amount of coins in the shop to buy your desired cosmetic and will always have to spend more than you originally want to in order to do so which always results for you to have leftover currency which is also another psychological tactic used by developers to just push you over the edge to spend more money on this f2p title.

5. Despite all of this the battlepasses offered in Apex Legends have consistently been awful, providing little value to those who buy them and the only decent skin is the level 100+ skins which only apply to one weapon. Not to mention the vast majority of the cosmetics offered in the battlepasses are menial and only have 5-6 skins which only 1-2 of them are even legendary (actually change the character noticeably) 

6. Because all of this, the only progression in the game is so bogged down that you aren't even guaranteed a loot box every time you level up, which the lootboxes don't usually contain any of the premium skins bundled and price hiked in the shop, not to mention the lootboxes effect every hero in the game meaning if you get a legendary skin for a hero you don't have, it simply does not have any value to you whatsoever. 

7. The crafting material allows you to buy with in game currency skins and cosmetics you would otherwise gamble on with lootboxes however there is no surefire method to grind for this currency and the only way to get consistent crafting materials is to buy lootboxes outright.   

This is such a massive leap backwards from Titanfall 2's super consumer friendly cosmetic shop where cosmetics had incredible value while also respecting the consumer enough to not make the cosmetics the only thing having any value in the game. I bought into Titanfall 2's shop many times because of how fair and reasonable the prices, value, and quality of the items. The developers themselves have outdone themselves on consistently providing quality content to the game, the business side of EA and Respawn are giving mobile games a run for their money in being the most egregious and predatory monetization for a AAA product. All I ask is that Respawn listen to their player base and to not forget where they come from because I can guarantee that if Apex Legends was more consumer friendly they would make even more money and the playerbase would be happy. Respawn and EA can do better and we as a playerbase have to hold them accountable if we expect any meaningful changes to such a predatory system.","Mixed67% of the 964,080 user reviews for this game are positive.",gaming 21st century summed perfectly legend bar best mechanic battle royale credit due act enemy reappearing world defeated knocked fundamental park legend problem stem overt predatory monetization 1 item reward dropped defeated enemy box literal gambling spend life saving 2 skill based matchmaking pub incredibly strong bronze 1 not_had teammate lower gold non ranked mode not_know strong skill based matchmaking forced onto developer increase retention coerce player linger menu browse shop longer 3 cosmetic price shop valorant level greedy skin cannot_buy individually earn event skin bundled inflates price 4 currency psychological tactic developer blur line real corresponding premium currency never_ever able outright able purchase exact coin shop desired cosmetic spend originally order result leftover currency psychological tactic developer push edge spend play title 5 despite battlepasses offered legend consistently awful providing value decent skin 100 skin apply weapon not_to mention vast majority cosmetic offered battlepasses menial 5 6 skin 1 2 legendary noticeably 6 progression bogged guaranteed item reward dropped defeated enemy box lootboxes usually contain premium skin bundled price hiked shop not_to mention lootboxes effect hero meaning legendary skin hero simply not_have value whatsoever 7 crafting material allows currency skin cosmetic gamble lootboxes no_surefire method grind currency consistent crafting material lootboxes outright massive leap backwards titanfall 2 s_emphasizeduper consumer friendly cosmetic shop cosmetic incredible value respecting consumer not_make cosmetic value bought titanfall 2 s_emphasizedhop time fair reasonable price value quality item developer outdone consistently providing quality business side ea act enemy reappearing world defeated giving mobile game egregious predatory monetization a_emphasizedaa product ask act enemy reappearing world defeated listen base not_forget guarantee legend consumer friendly playerbase happy act enemy reappearing world defeated ea playerbase hold accountable expect meaningful change predatory
1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"Disclaimer: Editing review completely after I'm approaching 50 hours in (in 3-4 days of play). 

Warning: Larian is upfront about their decisions. It is turn based and if you don't want to play an EA/uncompleted game then don't spend 60 dollars. If it was on discount during EA it would incentivize people to buy that would otherwise not want to play the EA version of game.

Warning 2: People can't take jokes. Larian can be tongue and cheek. They are not malicious. Cancel culture is the thing that is malicious. 

1. This is not Divinity 3. The ambiance/atmosphere feels more in line with Knight of the Old Republic and Dragon Age: Origins. It reminds me of old bioware quite a bit. The gameplay and how one handles it is also quite different. I use consumables a lot more for instance, which impacts how I loot, how I look at starting fights, etc. The mechanics are different with 5e rules + more interactions with environment (breaking statues, stalagmite, burning webs, knocking people off edges, vertical gameplay matters more, etc.) There are some things that did remind me of Divinity but it is more surface things like accidentally putting a chest in my inventory, similar key bindings, etc. (250ish hours in Divinity Original Sin 2.

2. Permutations. There is tons of variability. Besides being multiple approaches to problems there are different arrangement steps can be taken. Not everyone will experience the depth of this though. I'm completely early access for the third time (a single play through can take 20-30 hours). 

3. It is not isolated from Baldur's Gate. This story is aware of the setting, and takes place after the Descent To Avernus. Lots of foreshadowing for what is to come and I'm excited to see how Larian handles the setup.

4. Characters. Some people thing they are lacking, but I don't think so. You are a party put together due to circumstances. It takes time for people to open up. I actually like this approach because it is similar to how a lot of DnD campaigns can go with a variety of characters that are put together when they otherwise wouldn't interact with one another. Furthermore, there are tons of characters outside the playable ones and lots of dialogue. Lots of people will miss out on this though. I encourage you to talk to the goblins and see what is in the game. Don't just murder hobo it or you will miss out.

5. I have not encountered any ""gamebreaking"" bugs. The worst bug was probably a visual bug that forced me to load to solve a puzzle. My game as crashed about 5 times so about once per 10 hours of gameplay for me. Clipping/lip sync bugs exist.

Well, my husband got me interested in playing this game and as you can see, I have 81 hours into it at the time of writing this review. It is SO good. It has just the right amount of scary and keeps my adrenaline pumping- even when nothing scary is happening. I'm scared to have my back turned, scared to even be using headphones (although I just can't seem to take them off). The ambiance is amazing and the multiplayer aspect is enjoyable, funny, scary, and addictive (when played with friends).

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"FOR NEW PLAYERS TO THE GAME: this review is for you, as it is my experience from being a completely new player with no idea what is going on.  Bullet points of review after intial intro, to keep things short and sweet for those looking to buy.

After being a WoW veteran since beta and playing various other MMOs (FFXIV, SWTOR, EQ, EQ2, etc.), I wanted to test this game out after it had the initial terrible reviews and then the ravingly good reviews after the rework patches.  I also was playing a LOT of skyrim special edition and wanted to expand upon that universe.

THIS GAME is decent.  For a new player it is immensely confusing, the world is not very linear to begin with and I really had no idea what I was doing when I made my initial character.  The tutorial and messages for new players as they play the game are lengthy, but not much time is given to read them.  Since the world is ""do whatever you want and play"", it sucks for new people since there, of course, is a best and worst of what you can do in certain situations.

That being said, this game is NOT skyrim.  You can't get away with wearing leather armor as a caster, as it really provides no benefit.

BULLETS:
- Extremely confusing to start, as the game has SO MUCH depth
- Alliance doesn't really matter (from what I can tell), but there are WAY more people on Aldmeri Dominion
- The combat system is awesome, but takes some getting used to (active combat, blocking, interrupting, etc.)
   ~MUCH better combat than other games where you just press the buttons to do the dmg
- Racial aspects DO MATTER A LOT.  It will effect your end-game if you want to be an elitist
- The only thing you can't ""reset"" is your class, so choose wisely at the start for class-specific abilities and passives
- You are NOT LIMITED by your class, as weapons dictate abilities (i.e. resto staff = you can heal as any class)
- Addons are slightly more annoying to use and there is a specific amount of memory given to them, which is a bad thing.
- Crafting is rather interactive and much better than other games, however without an ESO PLUS membership it sucks.
- ESO PLUS membership is almost NEEDED due to the crafting bag and general access.  ALMOST
- CROWN STORE is NOT worth it AT ALL.  Items are WAY overpriced.  Excessively so.  Watch youtube for crown purchases
   ~Crown crates are random loots and can contain stupid stuff such as potions and general worthlessness
- FORUM accounts are SEPARATE from regular accounts, when you buy the game pay attention to an email for them
- Armor shown at character creation doesn't matter, you can get a style motif in the game to make the other races' armor
- You have two skill bars (one being gained at level 15) so you can swap between two weapons if you want
- Side quests are sometimes hard to find, there are addons that can help you.
- There are damage meters for this game (Addons)
- I am still confused for a lot of the UI (isn't just social, guild, inventory, character tabs - much much more).
- breaking items apart at crafting stations is often better than selling them, be sure to check the attributes of the item

All that being said, I recommend this game on the FREE-TO-PLAY version, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you watch youtube videos for beginners BEFORE purchasing.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND the CROWN STORE, many things on there are already available to you and you can be literally throwing your money away.  IGNORE that entire aspect unless buying UPGRADES or DLC (like imperial race upgrade)
Play around with character creation, class testing, crafting, and weapon interaction before seriously committing to anything.
NOTE: If you get a sub, you get 1500 crowns per month you sub.  ESO plus of 3 months can provide you with the DLC and upgrades you may want and be cheaper/more beneficial than straight purchasing crowns.","Very Positive83% of the 123,718 user reviews for this game are positive.",player completely no_idea bullet point intial intro thing short sweet wow veteran pre release version available testing mmos ffxiv swtor eq_emphasized2 wanted test initial terrible review ravingly good review rework patch skyrim special edition wanted expand universe decent immensely confusing world not_very linear no_idea initial tutorial message player play lengthy not_much given read world whatever play suck course best worst certain situation not_skyrim wearing leather armor caster provides no_benefit bullet extremely confusing depth alliance matter aldmeri dominion combat awesome take active combat blocking interrupting combat game press button dmg racial aspect matter effect elitist reset class choose wisely class specific ability passive not_limited class weapon dictate ability e resto staff heal class addons slightly annoying specific memory given bad crafting rather interactive game eso plus membership suck eso plus membership needed due crafting bag general access crown not_worth item overpriced excessively watch youtube crown purchase crown crate random loot contain stupid stuff potion general worthlessness forum account separate regular account pay attention email armor shown creation matter style motif race armor skill bar gained 15 swap weapon side quest hard addons help damage meter addons confused ui social guild inventory tab much_emphasized breaking item apart crafting station selling check attribute recommend play version highly recommend watch youtube video beginner purchasing not_recommend crown thing already available literally throwing ignore aspect unless buying upgrade downloadable additional released initial launch imperial race upgrade play creation class testing crafting weapon interaction seriously committing note sub 1500 crown per sub eso plus 3 month provide downloadable additional released initial launch upgrade cheaper beneficial straight purchasing crown
2429640,THRONE AND LIBERTY,"Throne and Liberty is a free-to-play MMORPG developed by Korean developer NCSOFT meaning yes - you can whale your game into “Winning”

Once inside the game, wielding your credit card like a sword you make your way through a relatively alright tutorial and introduction sequence that tells you that you got Starlight within you, Paimon 2.0 and the ability to transform into your favourite furry friends of nature. After that you find out that not only are you absolutely nothing special amongst the thousands of other special Stardust sniffing furry transformers, you also can morph into other shit. Like crabs, Goblins, Spiders, overly monetized battle pass miniatures.

Yes this game has a Fortnite Battle Pass and YOU are going to not only be tempted to buy the premium battle pass, but it also has a LEVEL PASS - in which you can also buy a premium version of it. But that’s aside the point, you got to choose a primary and a secondary weapon with individual skills and passive skills to equip. There are a few weapons to choose from but ultimately it boils down to Tank, Healer and Damage Dealer, amongst which you got Sword’n’Shield, the wand with book which both can have whatever as secondary to compliment them and for Damage Dealer you got Bow and Daggers. Seriously I wasted a fuckton materials to find out what to run and even though most DPS builds use the daggers, the only true damage dealer class is Bow and Daggers. Everyone else is a clown with a funny hat.

Hold on mate! I hear you say - I don’t see this advice on build pages and all that I do have other options, right? Pfft, yea, if you play the content up to level 50. But honestly, once you hit endgame content, you’re going to realise how difficult it is as a black mage in a white neighbourhood.

So you might as well say that you have freedom to do whatever you want in that game and sure, more power to you. Lifeskilling in this game can be summarised up to Fishing, Cooking and taking bigger Ls than your little brother does at playing Tarkov. You don’t have a little brother? See, that’s what you get for living in Ohio.

Fishing is…self-explanatory. Get a hook, get some bait, throw the hook, yank the pole until the fish is tired and then be happy that you got materials for literally just cooking or a bag with materials that increase your fishing pole. You fish to fish in order to become the fish but I digress, cooking surrounds itself around materials you can fish, gather in the wilds, buy from the local shopkeep and Salt.

These highly marketable plushies you can collect in game and also through the MIGHT of your credit card, you can go into your whimsical home and send these plushies on expeditions. Preferably once to get Salt. The more Expeditions they finish, the higher their level and eventually you can send more plushies out.

And then you cook. For buff food. audible breathing - Expedition is the third life skill which is the most fun one to do because you can go outside, walk around [getting hit by mobs] and gather materials from material points you can see on your map. They are not bound to the person so whenever you see a tree stump you wanted to cut down being cut down by another player, the material node will disappear and you have to move onto another node, making those materials you gather truly your own. What a wonderful and fun experience!

Speaking of, did you ever want to know how it feels like to be playing online from the actual Amazon Forest? Well now you can, simply join a European server and over short or long you will see the funny internet connection error notification as the nice invisible people with black suits carry you back to the main menu or even make your client crash completely. Truly kiss a 40 bucks free-to-play gaming experience.

Let us not forget to mention the vast amounts of wonderfully nice comments this community gives to the developer on their discord! But I digress, my friends. Let’s talk about something more interesting to the rough core of MMORPG players, the part that wants to know….

THE ENDGAME

There’s this stigma about Korean MMORPGs and specifically MMORPGs either developed or published by Amazon that they are pay2win. I am here to debunk that theory in the most truthful manner. For you see, the endgame of Throne and Liberty consist of creating or becoming part of a Guild, join organised guild events with other max level players and grind for gear in dungeons.

In that aspect, Throne and Liberty really isn’t too much different from your average MMORPG, you got Co-Op Dungeons, Abyssal Dungeons to loot, you got day and night changing time changing abyssal Dungeon areas from PvE to PvP zones, world bosses that are also PvE or PvP respectively depending on whatever the schedule feels like marking them as and if that isn’t enough you can also grind contracts and PvP events for gear.

Or you could just wield the combined might of credit card and auction house and just $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Trading in this game is probably the most fun mechanic that ever has graced the digital landscape as trading with other players is virtually impossible without the auction house. In order to trade, you need to set a price for your item, pay the registration fee and on top of that also pay taxes. And all that with the game's real life currency. SO GET YOUR CREDIT CARD READY LADS! HERE COMES THE MONEY BAWHWAWHAWHHAH

As we have established this game has a lot to offer. I spent about 30 hours in this game and you, too, can grind for max level in even less than that. The speedrunning record so far lies below 4 hours, so long as you manage to not count in the frequent disconnects and server crashes, however, the game is nice to remind you as well, if you have played for way too long.

So it is up to you, my dear reader, to decide if I have failed or succeeded in this task to debunk this game as pay2win.

238960,Path of Exile,"Important disclosure : I started playing on Steam, but migrated my account to the standalone client. Hence, Steam thinks I havent played ""recently"".

TL;DR : I love this game.

Since you came here to read a review for a F2P game, here goes :

Good :
1. diversity. 7 classes, each with 3 sub-classes (except the 7th, she has only 1, but she can also pick points from any of the other 6 classes, fair, imho)
2. playerbase. want to buy stuff? want to sell stuff? want to party up? want to chat up? u wont find an ""empty"" game, ever. people play at all times
3. DIVERSITY. want to play a manly tattoo'd dude swinging a huge axe? done. want to play a quick, mobile huntress that shreds enemies with hundreds of arrows? can do. want to play a demented girl who lost her friends in a fire and has ""replaced"" them with raised zombies? OH BOY BET YOU CAN. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!! if YOU want, then that manly dude can swing his axe thrice as fast, for a small damage loss. or he can make his attacks BLEED his enemies. that huntress can electrify her arrows, or even make them chain off to nearby enemies. and if that sad girl ever gets bored of her new friends, she can always call up cute little flaming skulls of death that automatically seek out and destroy any that would harm her. ALL BY CHANGING A SINGLE GEM. seriously. i could go onnnn and onnnn. not enough space to write down everything.
4. its free. all content updates are free as in free beer. no obligations to pay or tell others what you're playing.

the bad :
1. the cosmetics cost a bit too much. however, they look SWEET. other than on a templar. #spoilers i guess.
2. some older content is not updated. mostly this is about old skills from 5 years back. yes, the game is that old.
3. rich people like to ruin everything. there's some people whose only motive is to hoard everything and deny it to others. good thing that no matter how much they hoard, others just farm more of the item in question :)
4. somewhat hard to play on older computers. yeah, if you're firing off a hundred spells per second, your PC WILL die of overheating lol.


There are absolutely NO paywalls. There is nothing a F2P player cant do that a paying player can. Well the only exception to this rule would be stash tabs, but I played for almost a year with the basic 4 tabs.

Be warned, this is not your traditional farmville style game. This game is BRUTAL if you arent paying attention.

Playing casually is an option, however, you need to learn atleast SOME game mechanics to not get insta-gibbed by white mobs in the tougher zones.

Once you understand how this game works, you will realize what a hidden gem it is. But, that requires sweat, blood and tears. You dont become an exile just by strutting around whacking at bosses with an unlinked Heavy Strike socketed in a white weapon, no. You become and exile by studying the masters!

1283700,SUPERVIVE,"SUPERVIVE is an interesting yet fun take of two popular game styles for the past ten years. It provides the top down aesthetics and quality of LOL and the team-fighting and looting of Apex Legends. I put about 5 hours into the beta and when they released the full game not much had changed. 

Though when I play this game there are some things that I feel on the fence about. Firstly, the size of the character base is limited to about 15, though you are only given 5 when you start. These characters are divided into three categories: Fighters(the ones that mainly deal the damage but range between assassins, snipers, and mid range dealers), Protectors(these are your supports that heal or buff your team in some kind of way), and controllers(your tanks and brawlers that have AOE abilities). With the current release of characters, I feel that it has been quite annoying to play against the same 5 characters on every team because nobody has unlocked any others yet.

Secondly, the itemization for these characters isn't super clear to me. Though I will admit that I haven't really looked into the specifics. But basically when you pick your champion when loading into the game, you are given a three options for your starting build. Damage, hybrid, or tank. The game recommends a starting build based on your character but you can choose whatever you'd like. Though, when you get in game you can upgrade these items by killing camps or other players, you can also switch your items in the loot boxes of other players. This is where I get confused, unlike League or Dota there hasn't been a super easy way to see the possible build paths or what these items do. When you upgrade your items you get to see three choices for an item each with a small description, I always click on the recommended upgrade because I don't know how else I'd go about upgrading my character. Though once you select your item, you upgrade its tier, which upgrades the stats and passives involved with that item. This isn't a big issue to me, just because there is really only nine or so possible items in the game(tank item, damage item, and boots all have three paths). But I would like to see more in game content to it rather than having to go look online.

With that all being said, I do find this game very fun and entertaining. I don't feel as if there is any super broken or overbalanced characters, though there are some that do feel super weak and unplayable. Playing this with two or three friends is always fun and a good time. On a side note though, I don't think this would be one that I would play solo, but it is a fun and competitive change to those hyper competitive alternatives that you could play(League, COD, Apex, etc.). The feel of the game is unique and the fights always feel intense and rewarding when you win, it also looks awesome and I honestly will continue to play this for a while.

So all in all, I'd give this game a 8 or 9/10","Very Positive89% of the 2,849 user reviews for this game are positive.",interesting fun popular style past ten year provides top aesthetic quality lol fighting looting apex legend 5 hour pre release version available testing released not_much changed play thing fence firstly size base limited 15 given 5 character divided three category fighter one mainly deal damage range assassin sniper mid range dealer protector support heal strengthen improve effectiveness kind controller tank brawler effect ability release character annoying play 5 character unlocked others secondly itemization character super clear admit looked specific basically pick champion loading given three option starting build damage hybrid tank recommends starting build based choose whatever upgrade item killing camp player switch item item reward dropped defeated enemy box player confused unlike league dota super easy possible build path item upgrade item three choice small description click recommended upgrade else upgrading select upgrade tier upgrade stats passive involved big issue nine possible item tank damage boot three path rather online fun entertaining super broken overbalanced character super weak unplayable three friend fun good side note t_emphasizedhink play solo fun competitive hyper competitive alternative play league cod apex unique fight intense rewarding win look awesome honestly continue play 8 9 10

I think this is definitely more akin to a DLC for the main franchise, difference is that if this were a DLC, you'd get to keep all your other progress etc. you kind of do with War zone but it's so much more compartmentalized. 

The content of the game so far is okay, by no means extraordinary. I knew that these issues were there before buying the game, as they are always there and have been there for a few games back. So far the campaign adds a ""Hideout"" type of thing where you tweak your game play, then you will come to missions that feel a little Ghost Recon (Go to objective, Clear Objective, Move to another objective and so on). I remember MW and BO games that were so engaging and had a decent story. This stuff makes it feel like a chore. I don't want to build up my hideout, I want to experience the story. Anyway, go ahead and buy it if you don't care too much about the content and price.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"I will edit this review if my opinion changes as I play. I am 4 hours in and I still don't feel like the game has started. My immersion in a Dragon Age game has legitimatly never been lower than these 4 hours. Player agency is non existent, I don't feel like I've gotten any opportunity to RP, or develop my character at all. I have no idea who this dude is, I don't feel like a part of the world, and the characters all blur together into a singular lifeless entity. Everything feels like a set, you get plopped into scenes at a rapid pace with no chance to explore. There has genuinely never been another game in the series that has felt so completely on rails and uninterested in letting the player actually interact with it. And the dialogue. Oh god. Not even just the player's, which is abysmal, but the dialogue in general is written so badly. Characters repeat themselves over, and over again like you're too stupid to have heard them the first time. Here is an example of what I mean (paraphrased but the gist is there): 

Character A: we’re searching for the Nadas Dirthalan! It’s an archive spirit. 
Character B: Nadas Dirthalan?
Character A: Yes! It’s a spirit that can tell us all about the ancient elves history!

A few minutes later

Character A: We’re close to the Archive Spirit! I have so many questions to ask it. 

Another few minutes later, we meet it, it disappears.

Character B: Well it’s broken like all the other artifacts here.
Character A: it’s not just any artifact! It’s the Nadas Dirthalan! The Archive Spirit! I have so many questions to ask it!

*fade to black, teleported to new location* 

Character A: blah blah something something Nadas Dirthalan
Character C: Wait! You met the Nadas Dirthalan? The Archive Spirit? We could ask it about the ancient elven gods!

If they aren't repeating exposition/objectives at you, they're using the most corny and predictable filler dialogue. How many times have you heard ""It's quiet here... TOO QUIET."" cuz it's got that. I wouldn't be surprised to hear a ""He's standing right behind me isn't he"" or a ""Well that just happened."" I guess this is what we're left with when EA decides to fire their best writers for the series.

8 hours in and I still couldn't tell you a single thing about these characters beyond one or two word descriptions. I could list a fact or two about them, but I really am getting absolutely no personality off them. Everyone feels so cardboard. The only character with a shred of personality is almost entirely due to the talent of the voice actress portraying her, working hard with a piss poor script. 

Part of me feels awful, hating this game so much. I want to make it clear that zero of the reasons to hate this game have to do with inclusion or ""wokeness."" I wish people would stop making it about that, it's a nothing criticism, it's an entirely artificial conflict, and it's made the fanbase into yes men who refuse to look at the game critically or accept anything but praise for what is so obviously a lazy game devoid of anything that made these games compelling. To the people who decry this game out of bigotry alone: the Dragon Age series has always included explicit queer identity and giving the player more options to express that aspect of their own character is a positive in my book. Having more LGBT characters or options for players to explore their own character's identity in a game does nothing to you. Get over yourself. Unfortunately, it's in a shit game that has no place calling itself part of what was an incredible trilogy, and yes, for all of DA2's short comings, it is still leagues better than this game. There is a STARK contrast between the two, actually. DA2 had a ridiculously rushed production, had ambitions it couldn't deliver on because of executive meddling and STILL managed to tell an incredible story with rich, memorable characters.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"[h1] Nope. [/h1]

This game spent nearly ten years in development- and it shows, both in good ways and bad ways.

Visually, it looks really good. Until we get to the characters.
Character design is one of the most important parts of a ""traditional"" Bioware game, in my opinion.
If I don't find the companions appealing, then the game doesn't hold much value for me as a Bioware title.
The heads are over-sized, and it's a baffling design choice. I'm assuming that there was some sort of broken logic behind it- something along the lines of ""the face is a canvas for emotion, so lets give everyone a MASSIVE canvas"".
Whatever the reason for it, it doesn't land. The design is somewhere between Dreamworks and FunkoPop.
The comparison to the human characters in Shrek is absolutely perfect.
The world itself, though? It looks amazing. And it runs surprisingly well on launch-day, which is rare in the 2020s.

When it comes to combat, it's a win for me. 
I've been enjoying this aspect a lot more than expected.
Forewarning; I did not like the combat in any previous Dragon Age game.
I always enjoyed the writing, the characters, and the RPG mechanics,
but the combat always felt like a chore that I was trudging through in order to access the ""fun"" part of the games.
In Veilguard, it feels like the opposite. The combat feels like a very simplified blend of a Soulslike and one of the Arkham games.
It's not difficult by any means, but it's engaging enough to be enjoyable- especially in comparison to something like Dragon Age: Inquisition.

But the MAIN part of a Bioware game for me is the character writing, and this is the tipping-point that has me dropping a downvote.
The actual stylistic design of people in general is bad, but then you have the specific design of the companions making it all even worse somehow.
Then you take those bad designs and slap a terrible personality on top, 'brough to life' by abysmal writing, and voiced by what might as well have been an AI from 2020, all the forced-diversity of a McDonalds advertisement, and you have the entire roster of companions summed-up.

The writing feels like it would be at-home in a Rated-E version of Fable.
Nothing is sincere, nothing strays too far into ""dark"" territory, the only time things get ""serious"" is when characters turn into sock-puppets for the writers to preach their sermons at you.

If you align with the propaganda that they've been peddling during the marketing-campaign over the past year, then you'll probably enjoy this game- go for it. It has all the colorful, safe, friendly, sterile content that you could ever want.

If you were hoping that this game was as nuanced and dark as the previous entries in the game like I was, then you'll be disappointed.
The game is exactly what I expected when it comes to the characters and writing- and that's unfortunate.
I was hoping that it was just the rage-bait mob exaggerating the severity of how bad this is, but it truly is irredeemable once you're engaging with any of the writing / characters / world.

739630,Phasmophobia,"I only have about 3 hours of play time so far and I gotta say... definitely a fun game to play with friends. It is actually very very spooky and well done, being that it's still in early access mode.  I can't imagine ever trying to play it in VR. Hell no. lol 

The game is basically about a group of ghost hunters (you) looking for evidence of ghosts haunts in various homes within a certain time frame, before the ghosts appear and attack. If you can grab enough evidence and leave safely before the ghost appears and attacks, you win and gain money to buy more helpful equipment to aid you on your next hunt. 

There is no killing or capturing of ghosts. Its not that type of game. 
Just get enough evidence and save to your journal, then guess out the type of ghosts that haunt the place are and be on your merry way. In many cases however, its not as easy as it sounds. Depending on certain situations, you may be forced to stay in these haunted places longer and force out a ghost to gain evidence.
Lights will flicker and go out with no way to turn them back on. This means you're in big trouble and you will have to try and hide in some corner and hope it doesn't see you.

These ""ghosts"" look incredibly creepy. From children to straight up disgusting zombie looking demons that strobe their way to you.
You can talk to them or taunt and anger them through your mic, which is a required tool.

You can play the game solo, but I recommend rolling with friends. It can be both scary and funny too. This is definitely one to play around Halloween time. :)","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 588,193 user reviews for this game are positive.",3 hour play far ta definitely fun play friend very_emphasized spooky s_emphasizedtill player purchase play official release mode imagine trying play vr hell no_lol basically group ghost hunter evidence ghost haunt home certain frame ghost appear attack grab evidence leave safely ghost appears attack win gain helpful equipment aid next hunt no_killing capturing ghost not_that type evidence save journal guess type ghost haunt merry case not_as easy sound depending certain situation forced stay haunted place longer force ghost gain evidence light flicker no_way turn mean big trouble hide corner hope ghost incredibly creepy child straight disgusting zombie demon strobe you_emphasized talk taunt anger mic required tool play solo recommend rolling friend scary funny definitely play halloween
2669320,EA SPORTS FC™ 25,"EA destroyed the gameplay for this one. 

The players are extremely slow, even the ones with supposedly high Pace. It feels as such as no one player can outrun another one. 

The passing is very imprecise, with players barely being able to receive the passes and more often than not just throwing the ball away, passing to the adversaries instead of a team mate. 

The goal area always feels like its crowded and the AI barely needs to do anything to get the ball from you or just make your player trip as if he was made of paper, while the other way around it takes 2-3 players tackling and heckling to get an opponent down

Overall, the game feels like a huge downgrade from the last couple years, at least when it comes to what actually matters which is gameplay","Mixed45% of the 21,642 user reviews for this game are positive.",destroyed player extremely slow one supposedly high pace feel no_one outrun passing imprecise player barely able receive pass not_just throwing ball passing adversary mate goal feel crowded ai barely need ball trip paper take 2 3 player tackling heckling opponent feel huge downgrade last couple year come matter
306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Bought this game years ago around when it came out didn't really play it or give it a chance. Recently I started playing it and I honestly love the game. Even Tales of Tribute. The combat, character, crafting and skill systems are all really well done. Really enjoy how you can make your character how you want. To bad there are still issues with lag and performance. It can take away from the PvP side of things. Then there is the difficulty. I feel like there is no middle ground difficulty anywhere in the game. It's either a walk in the park where you don't have to think at all or its absolute tweaker mode where you have to be hyper focused. 

For any new players don't bother buying any of the crown store DLC just get ESO+ getting the DLC won't give you access to double the inventory space or the crafting bag. Unless you want to sit and constantly juggle your inventory. I made the mistake of buying the DLC in the crown store I thought oh right on I'll permanently own the content (I don't like subscriptions). Which is true but you can't permanently buy the double bank space or the crafting bag. So you still need ESO+ which gives you access to all the DLC anyways.

Don't let the crown store turn you into a sucker like it did to me. I have explicit words id like to share with ZOS.

Phasmophobia is an investigative horror game developed and published by British indie game studio, Kinetic Games. The game became available in early access through Steam for Microsoft Windows with virtual reality support in September 2020. The game received a large influx of popularity the following month due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it, mainly for the Halloween season. As of October 15, 2020, the game was the sixth-most popular game on Twitch. It was the best selling game on Steam globally for several weeks in October to November 2020.

        [th]Description[/th]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The graphics are okay in this game. Nothing groundbreaking or amazing. Well I guess I can say the lighting effects are really good and adds to the atmosphere but besides that nothing that will blow your mind. The game looks good and you won’t be disappointed with it. The animations are pretty solid for an early access game. The character and ghost models could use some work though in my opinion.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Phasmophobia is such a unique game to me. You go into a house or any environment this game has to offer (won’t give any spoilers) and your main goal is to figure out what ghost you are dealing with and get out. Sounds simple? Well not quite. You can buy many types of equipment to help you make your task easier and can use some of the equipment to do challenges. You want to make more money in a ghost haunt? You have to do the objectives on the white board and take pictures of the ghost, and any ghostly events that happen throughout your playthrough. You have many kinds of spirits and they all give different clues, and you can find these “possessed” items that make it easier for you to find the spirit or can make the game a bit more “interesting” but I will not spoil what they are.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]The multiplayer is pretty good. No issues as well. You can have a total of four players into a game but the best and most scary experience is probably just two people total in my opinion. You can do proximity chat and radio chat which adds to the immersion. You can watch your friends as a ghost when you die which is a really cool mechanic. This game is built for co-op and it shows! The multiplayer experience is great and you will have a great time with it.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]You can put in a ton of hours in this game. A lot of experiences are pretty unique in their own way. I have close to 200 hours and I have had my time with the game now. You do have progression, but nothing crazy yet, just levels. I want to unlock clothing, customization, something in that area to keep me playing for the long term.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is really good. You can hear objects turn on or off from the spirit. The spirit can also give you some minor jump scares which are pretty fun, like make a creepy noise in your ear. Spirit boxes do use your voice in this game and the spirit can hear you if you are being hunted so be quiet if you are in the hunting stage. You can hear your friends in the game and it sounds really good I have to say. I do wish they added more spooks in the sound design. For example how about some screaming or weird noises from the spirit or whispers in the dark. Scratching on the walls or doors slamming would be amazing in this game.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I haven’t seen many bugs anymore. This game used to have some funny bugs but they are patched so that’s a plus and sad thing to see happen (check my screenshots). Besides that you will have no problems with bugs.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The game runs pretty well for me. I used to have some frame drops but now it runs pretty well for me. I have an average PC (well in terms of today’s standards), so you should be okay with performance.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]

[*]Graphics could use some work

[*]Needs a steam workshop for longer replayability

    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]This is a game I've been looking forward to! A ghost hunting game with friends. Phasmophobia does a great job and I'm really impressed. There are some things I feel like they can improve on, but overall it’s an incredible experience.[/td]

This game feels disgustingly underbaked at the moment, like a skeleton that only has enough meat to walk and do rudimentary things, but not well. And it HAS to do those things well, or else it's just a shambling mess.
...and where is A-Life 2.0? It was removed from the Steam page before release for 'marketing purposes' but it seems more and more now that they actually entirely gave up on implementing it in the first place.
Why is everything spawning on the other side of hills, or behind me when I'm not looking?
Why can I never encounter anyone who isn't within spitting distance that isn't inside a base?
Why are the mutants absolutely comical bullet sponges?
Why do all the enemies in an area instantly spot you the moment you silently kill one guy, if they haven't already magically spotted you and are laser-beaming you through foliage because crouching does little to nothing to conceal you?
What's going on here?

730,Counter-Strike 2,"CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.

In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.

The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.

Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.

There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?!

2429640,THRONE AND LIBERTY,"The game is bad, I don't recommend it, I have a strong character (3400 gs):

- The game is entirely based on guilds, if you are not from the dominant guild you will only get beaten, boss drops are from the guild, war is a guild, everything is a guild, which makes being from a dominant guild mandatory.

- PvP is unbalanced, few classes are good and it kills whoever hits the stun first, it becomes a repetition of stun, the arena is very poorly made and very boring.

- Game based on daily rates, which makes it boring, repetitive and boring, mandatory to play every day, otherwise you will get left behind.

- There is no way to farm and make money solo, everything depends on the group, or rather the guild, because going with randoms is frustration and with a guild is boring, to make money is based on rare loot and even a small chance of the item come can trade it.

- Boss system is terrible, hundreds of people with a tiny chance of dropping an item from the boss and if you're one of the hundreds lucky, the item goes to the guild, there's still the dominant guild killing everyone.

- Timetable for everything, timetable for war, timetable for bosses, timetable for the guild, timetable for everything, which becomes an obligation and not fun.

- The game has no trade, if you drop an item for a friend, there is no way to pass.

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"I wasn't sure id like Metaphor: ReFantazio when i got it. The Demo was strong, but sometimes its hard to fit an 80+ hour game with Persona inspirations into my schedule, let alone find the motivation to play a game with a strict in game schedule.

I am happy to report Metaphor takes the Persona formula and TWISTS it into something new, beautiful and engaging. You have a somewhat set schedule yes, but all my other complaints of a Persona game are GONE. NO monster collection, instead there's a new system reminiscent of 'Jobs' from your typical final fantasy. NO problematic social links, no romance at all was a bit of a bummer but it was nice being able to make friends and no forced romance. NO SCHOOL SCHEDULE, while this doesn't bother me too much, i'm just getting tired of having to study and take tests in game.

Metaphor really stands on its own and does it BEAUTIFULLY, if you love persona you'll love the nods and references to the other games and familiarity with its in game calendar. If you hate persona, i can say with confidence that its different enough to keep you entertained for its entire 80 hours

My only complaint, is that in a world and story that is so focused on injustice and racism it would have been nice to see any LGBT representation. Atlus sill struggles and will hit or miss LGBT rep, when its rival series Final Fantasy is slowly but surely adding LGBT characters. but this is just a personal preference of mine

For example, you’re in top of a guard tower and you look down to see a gate entrance with no one there. But if you walk down to the gate entrance, walk forward and then look back, the enemies guards now spawn. It honestly feels like I’m playing Garry’s mod with people spawning enemy NPCs infront of you over and over.

There’s a reason why there are no sniper scopes OR binoculars in the game even though we can see NPCs use them. It’s because there’s nothing to look at. Not a single enemy will spawn farther than 50 feet away from you. 

Also for a game that always takes place at night, there’s no such thing as night vision.. what a joke.

There’s a lot more issues such as low damage to mutants, buggy weapons, and piss poor performance, but the worst thing is the “implementation” of A-life 2.0. The game is empty because of this. The Devs said they will fix it in time, but it is a core feature present in all of the stalker games.

I never review games on steam, but i was looking forward for stalker 2 since it was first announced. It was supposed to release back in 2012 but now it feels like it should’ve released in 2025.","Mostly Positive79% of the 25,476 user reviews for this game are positive.",fan stalker series sadly cannot_recommend stalker 2 state feel half baked enemy player enemy enter world 50 foot infront half feature missing example top guard tower gate entrance no_one walk gate entrance walk forward enemy guard player enemy enter world honestly feel garry modification alteration player fan spawning enemy npc infront no_sniper scope binoculars npc not_a single enemy player enemy enter world farther 50 foot take night no_such night vision joke issue low damage mutant buggy weapon piss poor performance worst implementation life 2 0 empty fix core present stalker game never_review game forward stalker 2 announced supposed release 2012 feel released 2025
394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"The game is fun at moments. 

Positive:
 - New production system makes more sense than previous titles and seems to have a more lasting impact on gameplay
 - Focus trees are a nice mechanic to add flavor into the game. Can be restricting at times. 
 - Research is streamlined.
 - AI seems more accepting and willing to work with diplomacy
 - Being able to give clearer commands to automated troops
 - Variant units add flavor and can help make more impactful units
 - Most of the game is easy to understand

Negative
 - Game appears overly easy, even on hardest difficulty, for veterans of the series. You can run the game on the highest speed and pretty much not miss anything impactful. 
 - Game seems to end much sooner than expected (WW2 ending in 40-41, focus tree exhausted early, tech only lasts till mids 40)
 - AI makes odd decisions to automated troops and in deciding how to fight the war. Several examples of troops being brought hundreds of kilometers away just to guard one side of the front while there are plenty of unused divisions nearby. AI also appears overly easy to ""game"" and thus mass encirclements become common (more-so due to AI mistakes than your own doing)
 - Country AI seems to refuse to follow-up and take provinces, leaving sprinkled enemy provinces everywhere. Not a pretty sight to see disjoint pockets of France, UK, Germany, Italy, Nationalist Spain, and United States all over North Africa. 
 - Incentive bonus to automate troops cripples manual control. Manual control is constantly overridden by AI control if you have the larger army set towards an objective. Controlling units should be other way around. 
 - War in Europe is decided by how many fighters you can build, and that's about it. 
 - Air Unit Interface is clunky and doesn't logically form well together (difference between airbase and air region)
 - Complete lack of meaningful espionage and ways to impact intelligence
 - No way to automate trade leading to constant ""Lack of resource"" popups. Should be able to set it so you can just get it from best source and save yourself two clicks every week in the later part of the game. (if there is a way to do this, I haven't found it yet)
 - UI and Map is a clash of color, hard to find units with the mess of units that are displayed on the screen with all the other things happening on screen. 

Needs patchwork. Wait and see on DLC filling out content before deciding to buy if you are on the fence. If you were a fan of HoI3, the game can feel like a let-down and too simple at times, so expect a different experience going in. More open to beginners and new fans of the genre. Would only recommend to players that are probably more open-minded in their expectations than I am.

427520,Factorio,"I finally launched a rocket after starting and restarting over the years. The learning curve intimidated me for a long time. I felt a lot of pressure to move quickly and not waste resources. The stress of figuring new things out led me to endless, meaningless optimizations on the stuff I already built, and when I couldn't do that anymore I'd give up and stop playing for several more months.

If you think this might happen to you, I recommend turning up resource richness; even just by 33%. This will reduce the stress of running low on your starting resources and give you time for early failures. 

Have fun trying things out! If you learn to enjoy the process of solving the more difficult problems the game presents, you'll have a blast with it.

2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"“Black Myth: Wukong” is a groundbreaking experience that has set a new standard for action RPGs. From the moment you start, it becomes evident that this game is a labor of love, meticulously crafted to immerse players in a world that is both visually stunning and narratively rich.

The game's visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. Every environment, from lush forests to desolate mountains, is rendered with an attention to detail that feels almost lifelike. The character models, especially the protagonist Wukong, are intricately designed, showcasing an impressive range of animations that bring every battle to life. The dynamic weather systems and realistic lighting further enhance the atmosphere, making the world feel alive and constantly evolving.

But it's not just about looks—Black Myth: Wukong delivers on gameplay in spades. The combat system is fluid and challenging, requiring players to master a variety of abilities and transformations to overcome powerful foes. The influence of Chinese mythology is woven deeply into the game mechanics, offering a fresh and unique experience that stands out in a genre often dominated by Western fantasy tropes. The variety of enemies, each with their own distinct behaviors and attack patterns, keeps the gameplay engaging and rewarding.

The narrative is another highlight. The story, inspired by the classic tale of Journey to the West, is filled with depth, mystery, and emotion. It’s not just a retelling of an ancient legend; it’s a reimagining that adds layers of complexity to the characters and their motivations. Wukong’s journey is not just one of physical prowess but of self-discovery and redemption, making it easy for players to become emotionally invested in his fate.

Sound design and music also play a crucial role in creating the game’s immersive atmosphere. The soundtrack blends traditional Chinese instruments with modern orchestral compositions, perfectly matching the game’s tone and setting. Meanwhile, the sound effects—whether it’s the clash of weapons, the roar of mythical beasts, or the ambient sounds of nature—are meticulously crafted to draw players deeper into the world.

In summary,Black Myth: Wukong is more than just a game; it’s an experience that showcases the pinnacle of what modern gaming can achieve. It’s a perfect blend of stunning visuals, compelling storytelling, and challenging gameplay, all wrapped in a package that honors its cultural roots while pushing the boundaries of the genre. Whether you’re a fan of action RPGs or simply someone who appreciates finely crafted video games, Black Myth: Wukong is a must-play that will leave a lasting impression. This is not just a game; it’s a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come.""","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 732,771 user reviews for this game are positive.",myth groundbreaking set standard action rpgs moment evident labor love meticulously crafted immerse player world visually stunning narratively rich visuals short breathtaking environment lush forest desolate mountain rendered attention detail feel lifelike model especially protagonist intricately designed showcasing impressive range animation bring battle life dynamic weather system realistic lighting enhance atmosphere world alive constantly evolving not_just look myth delivers spade combat fluid challenging requiring player master variety ability transformation overcome powerful foe influence chinese mythology woven deeply mechanic offering fresh unique stand genre dominated western fantasy trope variety enemy distinct behavior attack pattern keep engaging rewarding narrative highlight inspired classic tale journey west filled depth mystery emotion not_just retelling an_emphasizedcient legend reimagining add layer complexity character motivation journey not_just physical prowess self discovery redemption easy player emotionally invested fate sound design music play crucial role creating immersive atmosphere soundtrack blend traditional chinese instrument modern orchestral composition perfectly matching tone setting sound effect clash weapon roar mythical beast ambient sound nature meticulously crafted draw player deeper world summary myth showcase pinnacle modern gaming achieve perfect blend stunning visuals compelling storytelling challenging wrapped package honor cultural root pushing boundary genre fan action rpgs simply someone appreciates finely crafted video game myth play leave lasting impression not_just masterpiece remembered year

1203620,Enshrouded,"[b] TL:DR: Good open world game with unique building and terraforming possibilities with obvious gaps in the multiplayer and still quite limited content. [/b]

First of all, I have played numerous representatives of the genre intensively: including Valheim, Ark, Conan Exiles, Myth of Empire, V Rising & Rust, as well as many adventure RPGs that focus more on telling stories and exploration than on sandbox building and survival. That's why I can say with a clear conscience about Enshrouded: It's none of those. Not a better Valheim, not Zelda and not a classic RPG either - it has a bit of everything and a few things of its own.

[h2] Pros: [/h2]
- [b] Building & Terraforming: [/b]
What makes the game really unique for me is the ability to model the terrain completely free. I mean - you have the same freedom as in Minecraft: digging a tunnel through the mountain instead of running around or climbing over it? No issue. Would you rather build a hobbit cave instead of an above-ground castle? - Let's go. Hollow out an entire mountain and recreate the mines of Moria? You can do it. Super cool.

- [b] Movement Utilities: [/b]
Very nice tools that make moving around easier and change the way you explore the world. Grabbing hooks and gliders - nothing new but well implemented.

- [b] Skill Trees and Equipment: [/b]
In terms of skill builds and equipment, Enshrouded is more like a classic fantasy RPG than an open-world survival game. A map with 12 skill trees that give you a lot of options to play your character in various ways. In addition, the ability to reset your selected skills almost free of charge gives you a lot of variation options over the course of the game.

- [b] The shroud [/b]
The basic concept of the shroud and the atmosphere it creates feels very good or better to say: scary.


[h2] Cons: [/h2]
- [b] GUI/HUD Usability: [/b]
The Overall Information architecture and click-flows of the GUI are pain in the a**. The world map is totally Overloaded, The building menu is terrible (Select a Hammer, Pressing Tab, Scroll the Mouse Wheel, Double Press Alt and press a Number-key from 1 to 9 just to select a Single Structure? Are you kidding me?) , The character- and skill information are also far too nested and has click paths that are too long.

- [b] Multiplayer Issues: [/b]
We started the game right at the release with 5 people. Ofcourse, it's more fun to play with friends, but the quests and the world progression are obviously not yet ready for large multiplayer groups. Even after 30-40 hours of play, it still wasn't clear to us which quests required personal progress and which progress happened globally. A player who arrives late on a server is completely overwhelmed by quests, but has no idea what his actual goal is. Clear recommendation: Start together, play together, stop together. Playing asynchronously on the same server is no fun.

Additionally, it doesn't feel like the enemy strength scales with the number of players, which is why the game felt very easy for us.


- [b] World Generation and Content [/b]
I can attribute this to the early access, but it should still be mentioned: Large Areas of the world seems quite loveless, especially in the late game areas, individual cities or POIs are nicely prepared, but a lot of it is just empty space without any challenge or opportunity to explore. In addition, our groups of 4-5 people player threw all the content in about 20-40 hours and there is no more progress to be done for us.


Overall, I still recommend buying it, even if I personally would wait for more content and advise against playing asynchronously in larger groups.","Very Positive85% of the 53,278 user reviews for this game are positive.",tl dr good open world unique building terraforming possibility obvious gap mode multiple player interact compete real limited numerous representative genre intensively including valheim ark conan exile myth empire v rising rust adventure rpgs focus telling story exploration sandbox building survival clear conscience not_a valheim not_zelda not_a classic role bit thing h2 pro h2 b_emphasizeduilding terraforming make unique model terrain completely freedom minecraft digging tunnel mountain running climbing no_issue rather build hobbit cave ground castle hollow mountain recreate mine moria super cool movement utility nice tool moving easier explore world grabbing hook glider implemented skill tree equipment term skill build equipment classic fantasy role open world survival 12 skill tree option play way addition reset selected skill charge give variation option course shroud basic concept shroud atmosphere creates feel good scary h2 con h2 gui hud usability information architecture click flow gui pain world totally overloaded building menu terrible select hammer pressing tab scroll mouse wheel double press alt press number key 1 9 select single structure kidding skill information far nested click path long mode multiple player interact compete real issue started release 5 ofcourse fun play friend quest world progression obviously not_yet ready large mode multiple player interact compete real group 30 40 hour play clear quest required personal progress progress happened globally arrives late a_emphasized computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player completely overwhelmed quest no_idea actual goal clear recommendation play asynchronously computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player no_fun enemy strength scale number player easy world generation attribute player purchase play official release mentioned large area world loveless especially late area individual city poi nicely prepared empty space challenge opportunity explore addition group 4 5 threw 20 40 hour no_more progress recommend buying personally wait advise asynchronously larger group

1790600,DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO,"I had high hopes for Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! 0, but it turned out to be a huge letdown. The game feels unfinished, and the graphics look outdated, even by older Budokai Tenkaichi standards. The controls are clunky and unresponsive, making battles more frustrating than enjoyable. Instead of the fast-paced, dynamic fights you expect from a Dragon Ball game, it feels slow and unpolished.

The story mode lacks depth and is just a rehash of the same sagas we've seen a million times without any new or interesting twists. The character roster is also a disappointment—many of the fan-favorite characters are missing, and the ones available don't have enough unique moves or transformations to keep things interesting.

Overall, Sparking! 0 feels like a cash grab rather than a well-thought-out addition to the series. I would not recommend it to any Dragon Ball fan, especially when there are far better games out there that capture the essence of the anime much more faithfully.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"So, I hated this game at first...

 I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of ""FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO"" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. 

It is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.

So I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.

Now I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.

Add-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.

For those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.

If any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.

But all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.","Very Positive83% of the 123,718 user reviews for this game are positive.",hated never_been massively multiplayer mindset fuck yeah mode multiple player interact compete real skyrim let short skyrim oblivion morrowind come core massively multiplayer s_emphasizedet tamriel sound tamriel storyline scroll massively multiplayer grindy massively multiplayer style quest wrong bewildering mechanic place tamriel chose wrong faction screwed surrounded waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay higher thankfully changed scale rock dungeon v300 mate fun slicing enemy saw friend spent hour installing join 70 gig slow internet prepare day download not_playing 14 month friend already veteran 250 luck introduced deconstructing equipment blacksmithing showed dungeon bascially enjoy grind bit lackluster dropped middle aldmeri dominion friend left mind usually hate massively multiplayer never_played wow enjoying triple digit wise stopping guild noobies help enjoy community nice elitist fuck competitive kicking dungeon 14 guild play explain mechanic help far collect hour add ons awesome able modification alteration player fan basic feature help information quality life improvement provide essential mod pack wish far t_emphasizedhink captivated long eu computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player join guild add visit url www godsofsalt com website url join teamspeak message diseasedcrow scroll glad gave chance
1245620,ELDEN RING,"Being my first souls game, I was convinced I would be wasting my money, and that the first boss I encountered would kick my ass. And I was proven right in no time, by the Grafted Scion. “But you were expected to be defeated by that one!”, you say. Worry not, the Tree Sentinel was also quick to put me back in my place once I had built the tiniest bit of confidence after beating the tutorial boss.

The game is fantastic. It got more and more rewarding as I progressed, and I was happy to beat the game a second and a third time, finding out new secrets during each playthrough. There’s no compliment I can come up with that hasn’t already been used to describe this game.

There are so many weapons with so many different builds to try. Bosses can be frustrating but there’s so much fun to be had. Even what is considered to be one of the toughest fights (looking at you, Malenia) is incredibly fair and fun. And the spectral horse you get is most likely the best horse I’ve ever ridden in any game, ever.

If I had anything to complain about, are the platforming sections. But after looking it up a bit, apparently FromSoftware never really knew how to do those, and they are so few and far between, that's hardly a reason not to buy the game.

I could also complain that I was unable to romance Boggart or Blaidd. They’re so cool.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I've played this game for over 2 years, closing in on 3 years in December. I've played WoW for 14+ years. I'm not new to MMOs. I can tell you, without a shadow of a doubt, that the developer of ESO, Zenimax, is putting this game on maintenance mode. If you want to play this game, just know that it is not as good as it used to be, because they have shifted a lot of their dev team off this game.

They are currently working on another MMO and ESO has been put onto a minimum effort content cycle of wringing money from people's wallets whilst they go full steam ahead on another game. New content is half-assed and designed to get you to spend money for minimal effort. Not only that, but they've started putting very overpowered gear into each new expansion/DLC to get people to purchase them, and then they nerf those items within a few months. It is downright scummy.

The game itself is fun and the base content is plentiful, but if you want to do more than casual leveling you have to pay for a subscription as it functions as a solution to every problem that is introduced if you want to do more than questing. Professions? Get a sub. Endgame? Get a sub. Participate in auctions and trading? Get a sub. Housing? Get a sub. Make your character(s) look cool? Get a sub.

Should mention how bad their forum is as well. They have a salaried group of people whose sole job is to police their forum hardcore. You cannot post anything negative about the game there. Ever. You will get your posts removed/edited by their mod police, if not get outright banned. I wish I was joking. Just browse through it and look at how many posts get edited by ZOS mods lol.

And if you want to know how Zenimax treats their playerbase, let's look at something that happened last year in 2021: https://old.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/pfgvvn/entire_raid_group_banned_for_reporting_a_bug/
They will outright ban people for reporting bugs. This is not the first time, nor the last time, that Zenimax has banned people for bug reporting. REPORTING. Not even taking advantage of a bug, but just experiencing it and then reporting it, like they are told to do. And bugs in this game are so frequent that you have to tiptoe over eggshells lest you might get banned. Currently, there is a re-occurring bug with daily login rewards that can give the reward multiple times. People have accidentally gotten multiple rewards because they don't even know it's a bug. Many of those people ARE GETTING RETROACTIVELY BANNED. For something that this inexperienced dev team can't properly fix. Talk about sad.

I've made a lot of friends in this game and had a ton of fun, but it is absolutely not a game worth investing in anymore. Just find something else.

Also, that 21 million players thing is a load of shit. Their highest player peak was under 50k and the daily peak is like 20k and declining. And looking through the recent reviews on here, it looks like ZOS may be buying positive reviews. Accounts that have not even setup profiles, but go out of their way to review a single game? Yeah that's not questionable at all.

Edit 2 months later: My friend with 12000 hours was permabanned. No prior warnings, straight to permanent. He had pretty much stopped playing the game already, so kind of weird to get banned when he had not much game time. He also wrote a negative review on Steam, so it's not surprising to come to the conclusion that my friend was revenge banned by ZOS for the review. I'm probably up next for a ban.","Very Positive83% of the 123,718 user reviews for this game are positive.",2 year closing 3 year december wow 14 year not_new mmos shadow doubt developer eso zenimax putting maintenance mode play not_as good be_emphasizedcause shifted currently working massively multiplayer eso onto minimum effort cycle wringing wallet whilst ahead half assed designed spend minimal effort not_only started putting overpowered gear major addition add feature mechanic downloadable additional released initial launch purchase weaken reduce effectiveness item month downright scummy fun base plentiful casual leveling pay subscription function solution problem introduced questing profession sub endgame sub participate auction trading sub housing sub cool sub mention bad forum salaried group sole police forum hardcore cannot_post negative post removed edited modification alteration player fan police not_get outright banned wish joking browse post edited zos mod lol zenimax treat playerbase happened last 2021 http old reddit com r elderscrollsonline comment pfgvvn entire_raid_group_banned_for_reporting_a_bug outright ban reporting bug not_the nor_the last zenimax banned bug reporting_emphasized not_even taking advantage bug experiencing reporting told bug frequent tiptoe eggshell lest banned currently occurring bug daily login reward reward multiple time accidentally gotten multiple reward bug retroactively banned inexperienced properly fix talk sad friend ton fun not_a worth investing anymore else 21 million player load shit highest peak 50k daily peak 20k declining recent review look zos buying positive review account not_even setup profile single yeah not_questionable 2 month friend 12000 hour permabanned no_prior warning straight permanent pretty stopped already kind weird banned not_much wrote negative not_surprising conclusion friend revenge banned zos probably next ban

381210,Dead by Daylight,"I appreciate the free weekend for Day by Deadlight since I was very interested in playing the game, and now that I put some hours into it, I can say for sure that this is a very addictive survival horror game. I want to explain why. To me, this is a love letter to fans of the classic slasher horror movies like Halloween, Friday The 13th, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It really does a fantastic job by creating this foreboding atmosphere where you can actually simulate those terrifying moments that you watched on TV. Now instead of being the one sitting comfortably on your sofa, shouting at the protagonists for making the wrong decisions, you can now be the protagonist and try to overcome the situation yourself. Or if you want to see the annoying teens of the movie bite the dust, you can now be the murdering psycho that finishes them off.

At its core, Dead by Deadlight is a cat and mouse game where four survivors are up against one killer in one of many scary locations. The group must work together, repair five generators, in order to activate and open the exit door. All while avoiding the killer of course. It sounds simple enough. However, the key to success is to cooperate with the other survivors. You will quickly learn just how important it is to keep everyone alive. The fever you are, the easier it will be for the killer to track you down. What I love about this is that you are not given any in-game chat. The only means of communication are hand gestures. The survivors are at a serious disadvantage because of this and adds serious tension during every round.

Each killer has its own means of attack and abilities to which they can use. Now something that is important to mention is the camera view. While the survivors have a third person view, the killer has a first person view. This brings balance to the game, although it does not make things easier. Two hits from the killer and you are down. They can either leave you to crawl in agony or pick you up and hang you from a meat hook. The other survivors can rescue and heal you at the risk of being caught themselves. While many might hate the fact you cannot harm the killer, I think it's a cool aspect since survivors must use their wits and plan a strategy to survive.

There is clearly lots of grinding to do in this game just to level up each character that you play, not only to unlock items that you can use, but also perks which are quintessential. I don't mind it though. There is such a rich experience to have every single round, lots of thrilling chases, lots of new stuff to discover and learn. There is a lot of fun content here to keep you engaged. There are many flaws here as well. Many glitches, many network problems, lack of tutorials, lack of PC options (had to disable vsync from .ini files) and the matchmaking can be awful at times. I also strongly believe that this game is not for everyone. I suggest giving it a try while it is still free to play before purchasing.

Overall, I'll say Dead by Daylight is a very nice multiplayer game, with decent challenges, good co-op and with an immersive atmosphere for any horror fan to enjoy.","Very Positive80% of the 546,855 user reviews for this game are positive.",appreciate weekend deadlight interested hour addictive survival horror explain love letter fan classic slasher horror movie halloween friday 13th texas chainsaw massacre fantastic creating foreboding atmosphere simulate terrifying moment watched tv sitting comfortably sofa shouting protagonist wrong decision protagonist overcome situation annoying teen movie bite dust murdering psycho finish core deadlight cat mouse four survivor killer scary location group repair five generator order activate open exit door avoiding killer course sound simple key success cooperate survivor quickly learn important alive fever easier killer track love not_given chat mean communication hand gesture survivor serious disadvantage add serious tension round killer mean attack ability important mention camera view survivor third view killer view brings balance not_make thing easier hit killer leave crawl agony pick hang meat hook survivor rescue heal risk caught hate cannot_harm killer cool aspect survivor wit plan strategy survive clearly lot repeatedly performing action gain resource play not_only unlock item perk quintessential mind rich single round lot thrilling chase lot stuff discover learn fun engaged flaw glitch network problem lack tutorial lack pc option disable vsync ini file matchmaking awful time strongly believe not_for suggest giving play purchasing nice mode multiple player interact compete real decent challenge good mode multiple player collaborate towards common goal immersive atmosphere horror fan enjoy
1401590,Disney Dreamlight Valley,"At first the ddv was pretty good, a solid enough game for early access. I enjoyed it for a little. 
However the introduction of micro-transactions (the premium shop) AND free to play being taken away when that was what was promise and what alot of hopeful players were waiting for is completely unacceptable and a clear sign of pure greed on the companies part. the cost weighed up with the amount of gameplay you get with the base game does not add up to an equal amount so ultimately id say its not worth it, unless major changes were made.

252490,Rust,"Sit down ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you a story.

Once upon a time a lonley noob logged onto his first server, the great London III Test server to be precise. I never left this world but instead began my time mingling with the local flora and fauna, once mauled by a bear in the dead of night as I was escaping from angry Russians with Assualt rifles and another gunned down by an angry helicopter as I inspected by loot, stolen from the corpse of an unsuspecting man.

I started with my small 2 x 2 hut which lasted the staggering time of 27 minutes before I was beaten to death by angry men with rocks - Note to self, I really must get a lock for that door. They took my Wilson, torch, stone hatchet, blueprints and hammer, then disappeared into the night.

Lurking around on chat I found an active community whom deemed me friendly, I joined them only to discover they were actively at war with another ""clan"" - the lonely noob was cast into a great battle and was soon geared and ready for combat!

It ended in a hail of gunshots and looked like a scene from Mafia as my body was thrown against a stone wall from the sheer quantity of Thompson bullets hitting my frail body. I respawned in my bed, aptly named ""Liquids S**g sack"" and collected my meagre belongings - they team assisted me in taking a small and poorly guarded home on the airfield for myself. I joined with a few other solo'ers as we crafted and reinforced our little part in the world, we sent out supply runners and traded with the larger clans, all whilst maintaining good relations with the other server dwellers.

The day before the wipe, everything changed. Darkness fell that night as usual, I sat atop my tower with a team of three - we waited for the sunrise but little did we know we would be cast into a recreation of the purge. It started small, a few skirmishes here and there, the odd burst of gunfire or stray arrow but soon out outer wall was slowly chipping away. The Russians had found us and they were determined to get in, I moved around silently on our upper tower and peaked around, only to be met by the sound of my skull crushing under the weight of a finely timed rifle shot. I respawned quickly at the tower sleeping bag and retrieved my equipment, shaking I moved around to the lower firing platform and thats where I saw them, several members scatted on the rocks - I look aim - FIRE! I direct hit, his wails could be heard and my position was met by a barrage of fire. Wood splinted and the stone clanged as the air was filled with lead, we had lost the base, the encampment that has stood the test of time but in the end we were undermanned and out gunned.
My allies fell and with no local sleeping bags made were banished to the unknown of the darkness.

A messaged appeared in the chat - ""We are coming."" - Our saviours had arrived, the local smaller groups had combined into a roving kill party to assist us. As I sit under my stone stairs bandaging my wounds, the cackles of fire eminated from outside, the rumbles of F1 granades, the sound of whizzling lead and the thrum of arrows was all around. Dirty, bloody and glorious.

The fire fight died down outside, I crept towards the sniping perch and peered out. It was done, we were victorious. We lost some brothers in arms but the day was won, I ran down stairs to greet my new brothers, opening my airlocks and reaching the front door. The door flew open as the electronic lock pinged, the team had assembled outside I walked to towards them and  ... BANG. BANG. I fell to the floor, screaming and bleeding. The voice chat icon appeared ""We are sorry"", they stepped over my body and began looting my gatehouse. 

So ended my Rust adventure.
The treacherous ""allies"" will fall, I swear this. The first light dawned on a fresh server wipe, I look out upon my new grassy home. I smile. ""Soon.""

1085660,Destiny 2,"They fired Michael Salvatori who worked with Marty O'Donnell way back when to create the iconic Halo music and has been Destiny's music lead since D1, they fired Michael Sechrist who composed tracks like Deep Stone Lullaby and Queen's Oracle, they fired the community managers, they fired the social media team, they fired some of the production team, they fired some of the art team, they fired some of the recruitment team, they fired some of the legal team and they fired some of the QA team.

They did this at this specific time in the month deliberately as employee benefits last only until the end of the month. A lot of employees had unvested shares because of the Sony acquisition as part of staying with the company, but now those shares go back to Bungie.

The employees found that they had been fired on the day they had to leave. Some team managers were not told who on their team had been fired. Some employees were seen crying at their desks by other employees who were also fired who have spoken up about it anonymously. Employees were not allowed to say goodbye or exchange contact details.

The ""Light and Darkness"" saga comes to an end. A sci-fi, fictional story about standing up to the darkness, to evil, and fighting for the light, for what is good. It's ironic that in the real world Bungie are the darkness getting rid of those who have been part of the company's identity for years - decades even, and who have been instrumental in shaping many of the favourite memories we have of Destiny. But it's over now.

We blamed Microsoft for Bungie's problems, then we blamed Activision for Bungie's problems and before we can blame Sony for Bungie's problems it's revealed that it's Bungie who are responsible for Bungie's problems and great hard-working talented people have to pay the price for bad management.

This is Bungie's Final form.

1085660,Destiny 2,"I legit feel fucking sick over all this.

Shadowkeep had me thinking Bungie was finally taking Destiny in the direction it needs to go in. But two seasons later and it’s easily the worst the game has ever been. This game has lost all semblance of soul, there is zero effort put into anything. It has become a cash shop hellscape where you pay for the privilege of grinding shit and then also pay for cosmetics. Eververse continues to get full support every single season with tons of new items and the all the best armor. Meanwhile, there's STILL no vendor refresh after years of asking, MORE reskins for f2p armor (Trials finally comes back and its armor is a reskin, are you FUCKING kidding me Bungie?), new weapons with entirely worthless perk pools (while the threat of our old weapons being taken away from us still looms), constant nerfs to everything mildly powerful, new exotics are crap and feel useless, I could go on.

And let’s talk about “content”. Yet another season of Bounty Simulator, with seraph bunkers literally being obelisks 2.0. Go grind for materials to upgrade this vendor so you can buy upgrades to go grind for more materials so you can buy bounties to farm for weapons, that’ll be $10 please. Yes, thrilling game content, very fun. Strikes are still fucking worthless, no new raid or even raid lair that we got with Activision, no new story content aside from half-assed fetch quest dialogue from a half-assed replacement for Ana’s VA. The main story continues to move in no discernible direction, rather we have to deal with three month long side quests every single season despite Bungie’s promise that the story will “carry over” to the next season.

God I miss old Destiny. I fell in love with this game's universe and all the soul it had. But it’s just totally soulless now, it feels more like a chink gacha gambling simulator than the space opera epic that was imagined all those years ago in D1.

427520,Factorio,"UPDATE:
This is an incredible game. Every mechanic is well thought out and works flawlessly with the rest. The devs are profoundly active, continuously adding new content and quality of life improvements. Bottom line is - if you're looking for a factory / automation game, look no further. It's worth every penny.

Pros:
- Brilliant logistical mechanics and challenges
- Super satisfying animations (seriously, I have sat around just looking at my factory for longer than I'd like to admit)
- Very fluid user experience - the game doesn't get in the way of what you're trying to do. The challenge comes in designing your factory, not placing tiles for it.
- Self pacing - it doesn't matter how experienced you are with management games. Factorio will grow with you. If you're faster, it'll send enemies at you faster. If you're still learning, it'll chill out.
- Base defense mechanics give a refreshing challenge. You don't just have to build your factory, you gotta protect it!
- Incredible and active modding community.

Cons (sort of):
- The only thing about Factorio is that it scratches a rather specific itch. If you don't enjoy base building and logistical challenges, this isn't the game for you. If you do, stop reading and buy the damn game.

394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"The Hearts of Iron- series has long been the great-granddad of grand strategy games for me. The 4th installment as a whole is my favourite of them all, and I keep coming back to from time to time. Sometimes trying different nations and sometimes previously played ones, but with different political approach. It even has the appeal for me to play the same nation same way multiple times, trying to learn from previous mistakes and optimitizing my performance.

There's so much depth to the game it would take a small book to thoroughly review it, but I'll just settle to saying it has everything what comes to leading a nation through the times of WW2 in it modeled one way or another. The only aspect that remains pretty much abstracted is tactical battles, as your control is limited on division/flotilla/air fleet level, and the only way to affect below that is how you assemble your divisions (what kind of battallions and support companies are included in each division structure) and a little bit by choosing the general in command of the division. You can choose to abstract it even further by letting your generals take care of your large scale orders on army level, but I personally prefer to control divisions myself to preserve valuable manpower.

Other than that, you certainly have a number of ways of tailor your nations actions, and it isn't necessarily easy to approach. But like so many times in case of games with great depth, once you master the game mechanics there is a vast amount of things to keep your interest up. If Paradox games and grand strategy games in general are to your liking, in my opinion Hearts of Iron 4 is one of if not your best bet to play this very frequently depicted era.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"This game is both the best MMO and the worst MMO i've ever played.

I'm a casual player trying to get immersed in an MMO so my review is not based on raiding and stuff like that.
These are this things i've been focusing on while playing this game for 1400 hours
1: I've been Fishing.
2: I've been Selling dodo's and other pets.
3: I've been chatting with my friends.
4: Doing quests

let's just get this out of the way, Chat Bubbles.
I've missed a ton of people attempting to talk with me, and likewise a lot of people have missed me because the game doesn't have a feature to enable chat bubbles, i'm tired of having to constantly look at the bottom corner of my screen instead of paying attention to what is going on around me.

Let's also talk about immersion, i'm gonna use Thavnair because i just traversed it and completed the side quests, so it's still fresh in my mind.

Visually the area look amazing, and immediately i attempted to swim around the island to explore, but i was met with an invisible wall... 
oh well i thought, let's explore a bit on land, so i proceed on land and hear birds, so i listen to the birds in the background and look around.. but there's no birds in the sky.... i learn of the people and the trades of the lands, fishermen are standing by the docks ready to sell fish but there's no fish visible in the ocean.... there are no small critters on land either, all these things together made the zone feel more hollow than i had hoped,
and that's before i found out the entire zone is split by a massive invisible wall.
All these things above mixed together made the zone feel rather soulless to me sadly.

The game have great weather changing systems, which makes the zones feel a lot more immersive, but you're constantly bumping into barriers, and that way always reminded that this is but a game and not a virtual world to get immersed in.

It might sound like i hate the game, but if you go do a profession, like in my example fishing, you find out that this game have the VERY BEST fishing system you'll find in ANY MMO, there's rare fish, big fish, many fishing skills, underwater fishing, you can even go on a boat trip and fish..... but it doesn't stop there, you can take the fish and put them on canvases or in different Aquariums and then DECORATE THEM, it's sooo amazing.  . having fished in many mmo's this one makes me feel like an adventurer on a fishing trip, oh and let's not forget the HOUSING SYSTEM. . . let me just tell you, once you've a house it's like a new game.

Here comes my controversial take though. . . i like to make my own story, do my own thing and get immersed in the world, however no matter how hard i attempt to deny it, i'm the chosen one.. the warrior or light.. a god slaying near deity like being, and i want nothing to do with that... however before i can fish i have to do the MSQ, i like the MSQ's story, but i wish it was in separate game because i dont wanna be this chosen one that the world believes i am, i wanna craft my own stories and go on adventures but it's hard ignore all that, because this game LOVES the story and REALLY REALLY push you towards it. . . 
I WANT TO know about the world and the cultures, i just hate being the o mighty chosen one..... never have i felt more restricted in my choice of character in an MMORPG than in FFXIV, because unlike other games, in FFXIV there's HUNDREDS of hours of story and YOUR character takes center stage, as i said before, i wanna know about the people and cultures so i dont skip the story.. but it's so hard to dispense your disbelief if your character isn't the warrior of light, Hydaelyn's chosen, but instead maybe an evil warlock.

However despite this i keep playing, and give it my stamp of approval because it does professions like fishing and RP stuff like housing so amazingly well, the community have been an absolute joy aswell.. and i've yet to meet a person who didn't get somewhat happy when i sold them a Dodo,
so i hope you enjoy your time in Eorzea :)

3097560,Liar's Bar,"Fun little game, but I'm not entirely sure if it has enough replay value right now to warrant the asking price. There are plans for more gamemodes in the future so I think it will be much more worth-while then. The game is not bad by any means, it does exactly what it says on the tin, so if you are content with the fact that maybe you won't get that much playtime in it initially, it might be worth the purchase. I kind of wish the game had an option between ""Recommended"" and ""Not Recommended"" as I don't inherently think the game is bad by any means, it just doesn't have that much content as of yet.

There are some little things I'd like to see added, like more playable characters (heck, the bar has some characters in the background while you're playing the game, why not make them playable?)

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"I'd recommend this game if you know nothing about cyberpunk 2077.

I want to love this game. I've been following this project since 2013 and preordered as soon as it was available. If you strip away all the hype, all the promises and trailers the devs and CDPR corporate heads made, the game is decent. A good 40-60 hour time sink in a very beautiful, GPU-demanding world. In the year that it has been released, most of the major bugs have been rolled flat, though there are still moments where the game breaks.

The story has gotten some backlash, but I didn't mind it that much. It was engaging enough but a bit predictable. I won't mention the ending, but I will say that the supporting cast and side characters did a phenomenal job and Keanu is... well Keanu. The guns get pretty boring once you've seen them all, and there are a very clear set of ""best guns"" while the rest are used as stepping stones. The character skill trees aren't as realized as the could've been, but there are still some very cool builds and skills to mix and experiment with. 

The worst part of this game is the world itself. Despite the beauty and large map size, the world of cyberpunk is pretty hollow. The civilian AI sucks, the police AI is even worse. Navigating around the map on wheels feels clunky, and some parts of the map aren't even finished (I'm looking at you, Pacifica). Similar to fallout, there are some stellar side quests, but they are rare. The majority of them are either fetch quests, or ""kill person X"" missions. The gameplay loop is decent, but it could be so much more.

Cyberpunk is like being promised a new smart phone and receiving a beat up flip phone. Yeah, it gets the job done and checks all the boxes. But the promise of something greater with more functions and polish diminishes the value of what I ended up with, and I can't help but feel disappointed knowing what could have been.","Very Positive84% of the 693,658 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

I'm amazed by great locations, enemies, armors and music. 
Bosses are cool, many interesting designs, tho some of them are extra challenging and one of them is just rather impossible solo.

As a souls fan i appreciate how they got best features from previous games (Dark Souls serie, sekiro and BB) and put it here. I was thinking it could be like Skyrim- cause all that open world-, but it is even better!

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"[h2]It's Persona 6 but in a fantasy world, and it's great.[/h2]

TL;DR: If you like Persona or SMT games, you'll like Metaphor: ReFantazio. It's got everything Atlus is known for;

- Bonds ([i]Social Links[/i]).
- Archetypes ([i]Personas[/i]).
- One ally whose primary job is to narrate and/or cheerlead you in dungeons and who will undoubtedly unlock her own Archetype later on. ([i]Teddie, Futaba, Mitsuru, etc.[/i])
- A calendar and day/night system putting a soft time limit on your activities.
- A dark-haired male protagonist with standard-issue amnesia about the details of his past.
- A magical mystery room only Protagonist-kun can access occupied by a white-haired, dark-clothed mystery man named More, who guides you in the use of your Archetypes ([i]aka Igor, R.I.P Isamu Tanonaka[/i])

...and so on. Really, all it's missing is that it's not set in a Japanese high school. 

Atlus clearly is still in love with the visual style they nailed down with Persona 5, because while this game has it's own style and aesthetic to the UI and menus, it's very clearly [b]heavily[/b] inspired by P5s - and hey, it works. It's way more appealing than a standard everything-in-boxes menu system, and fits the flow of everything very neatly.

If you've not played an Atlus RPG before, combat [i]can[/i] be much more fast-paced than in some JRPGs - if you have the right setup and abuse enemy Weaknesses, you can destroy them before they even get to act more often than not. However, if you [b]don't[/b] have the right setup, battles can be a war of attrition as you whittle down the enemy's health sliver by sliver with attacks they're not Weak to while trying to keep your team upright at the same time. Thankfully, there's NPCs in the game called Informants who will sell you the down-low on what to expect in a dungeon area you're heading to, so that you can prepare accordingly (or go in blind, if that's your preference - their info isn't expensive, but it's not mandatory either.)

Unlike the Persona series, Protagonist-kun is not the only one who can freely switch between different Archetypes - while your recruitable party members all bring one of their own along ([i]or unlock one shortly after meeting them through a Persona-standard 'I am thou, thou art I' style cutscene complete with painful-looking summoning method[/i]), they simultaneously unlock that Archetype for the use of you and your other allies. All they need to do is unlock it for their own use first by paying not-Igor a chunk of Magla (a secondary currency that's used expressly for the Archetype system.)

After progressing past a certain (relatively early) point in the game, you even unlock the ability to change, unlock and upgrade them yourself without needing to go to the Not-Velvet-Room first, allowing you to do so on the fly mid-dungeon.","Very Positive91% of the 10,386 user reviews for this game are positive.",h2 persona 6 fantasy world great h2 tl dr persona smt game metaphor atlus known bond social link archetype persona ally primary narrate cheerlead dungeon undoubtedly unlock archetype teddie futaba mitsuru calendar night putting soft limit activity dark haired male protagonist standard issue amnesia detail past magical mystery room protagonist kun access occupied white haired dark clothed mystery man named guide archetype aka igor r p isamu tanonaka missing not_set japanese high school atlus clearly love visual style nailed persona 5 style aesthetic ui menu clearly heavily inspired p5s hey work appealing standard box menu fit flow neatly not_played atlus role combat fast paced jrpgs setup abuse enemy weakness destroy act not_however setup battle war attrition whittle enemy health sliver sliver attack not_weak trying upright thankfully npc called informant low expect dungeon heading prepare blind preference info expensive not_mandatory unlike persona series protagonist kun not_the freely switch different archetype recruitable party member bring along unlock shortly meeting persona standard thou_emphasized art style cutscene complete painful summoning method unlock archetype ally unlock paying not_igor chunk magla secondary currency expressly archetype progressing past certain relatively early unlock unlock upgrade needing not_velvet room allowing fly mid dungeon

236390,War Thunder,"Best current dog fighting game that I know of, held back by its insane over-monetization, prices, and the grinding which is balanced around them.  It's also gosh darn gorgeous, has a bunch of modes, has amazing gameplay (when there are no glitches or poor balancing acts in play), and has mixed vehicular combat.

You can expect very good support for mouse and keyboard with the ability to remap to your heart's content. Stick and VR users will definitely enjoy themselves here. I like QE for throttle and WS for pitch to help my mouse aim be sharper, especially when I'm in Spitfires or Zeros.

Anyway, I just... I don't know. I tried to get back into this game and every time, I'm enjoying shooting down planes. Then I make it back to the main menu and shake my head because I remember why I stopped. That feeling of progression isn't present here when going past Rank 2. It's miserable. You have all these planes for all these countries, walled off by hours upon hours of grinding, [b]even with[/b] boosters or premium status. Heaven forbid if you choose a country that you end up disliking further down their vehicle research tree.

And if for some reason, you'd like to try other things such as ships and tanks (or maybe that's what you went for initially), then you'd best prepare yourself for Tony Hawk: War Thunder Edition. To make matters even worse, each vehicle has upgrade parts that can be grinded for which means matchmaking can still be... questionable. Your plane versus someone else's upgraded plane means you'll lose (assuming you both have a similar amount of knowledge). Climbing means living for some countries, and if they climb faster than you, well....

And there are repair costs that will eat away at your normal in-game currency unless you're racking up kills every time. You want to put your plane in a slot, please pay more Lions (normal) to do so. (Eagles are the premium currency.)

I just can't recommend this game long term. Any money spent was done so in order to bypass the grinding and monetization mechanics implemented to delay progression. Big thanks to my good friend that gifted me some packages when I was financially not rich to help me progress. I'd like to point out that I've spent $225 on Path of Exile, a game I've played since 2012 and then linked to Steam when it debuted here. I felt good when I spent that money on GGG because it created this feeling that I was paying them back for all the good times they let me have with their game. A feeling I didn't get with War Thunder. I even feel better spending money on Pokémon GO. There are just better ways to monetize.

I guess there's Ace Combat 7. I'll go give that more attention despite how it controls.

War Thunder, maybe try it out for the stellar gameplay, but give yourself a strict budget and know when to call it quits.

Ah, for reference, I'd like to add that I made it to Rank V in the US tree and have two jets, F2H-2 and F9F-2. Rank III for USSR, Britain, and maybe Japan.","Mostly Positive72% of the 561,252 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

2669320,EA SPORTS FC™ 25,"Last FIFA I played was... 13 i think.
Gameplay wise it is similar. Players move better, however sometimes when I do a through pass, the player just stops running which is irritating.
Also defensive play can be weird (might be just me doing something wrong). Sometimes when I run with the ball and enemy wants to tackle me, they can teleport in order to get in the right distance. While when opponent runs with the ball and I tackle them, literally nothing happens, not even animation of the player being pushed. I'm treated as a weak gust of wind.
Other than that, I mainly play Ultimate team. You earn very little in-game money. When I watched some streamers (previous FIFAs though) spend thousands $, open dozens of packs and get nothing worth it... yeah, building team is hard.

Bug wise... gameplay seems fine, except the tackle thing. However I often get menu bugs - when switching tabs or after finish a match, the menus just don't load. I have background screen, music plays, I can open and close social menu, but nothing else.
When you start the game, the FC 25 logo is so pixelated that it's actually kinda sad. 360p image upscaled to 1440p resolution.

216150,MapleStory,"UPDATING THIS REVIEW ONE MORE TIME: Nexon has officially removed the Jett class from the game because it introduces bugs they don't want to dedicate time towards fixing. Jett is a Global Maplestory exclusive class. There are a few other non-Korean Maplestory classes like Beast Tamer, Hayato, and Kanna which could be removed on a whim at this point. They allowed anyone with a Jett to transfer to a different job in the Explorer branch, but the way the transfer was done was poor and not well thought out. I was personally affected as I had a level 250 Jett I had sunk around 1000 hours into (kind of low for some of the more hardcore players). Honestly after this removal my desire to play the game is basically zero, there's no reason to put time into these unique classes when they could be removed at any time for any reason. The hyper burning and tera burning events aren't enough for me to come back. I'd still recommend playing literally any other game, even Lost Ark.

The ignition update has now launched (11/16/22) and I wanted to add a small tidbit to this review. Nexon has officially removed an item from the game that boosts spawn rates for two hours. You used to be able to buy 15 of these per month by using currency from killing bosses. Without these the game is still perfectly playable but progression will be much slower in comparison. Still cannot recommend this game, and certainly not in light of spawn booster removal.

To be frank, I love this game but can't recommend it to anyone.
It's not even that the game has many problems, to Nexon's credit many client bugs and server issues that used to plague this game are generally fixed and I might crash once a month now. Whereas in the past I would crash once or twice a day while doing dailies.

It's not even that progression is heavily time gated through dailies, or that the game requires an absurd amount of hours and has a near necessity to create dozens of alts to make any real progress on your main.

It's not even that I think the EXP curve is bad post 250, or that the balancing is bad, or that the jump between killing higher level bosses is bad.

It's not even that for the mind numbing weeks of grinding that turn in to months, and then to years you're not even guaranteed to make progress. Blowing up your equipment is the norm here. RNG will be both cruel and benevolent.

I think the main reason I can't recommend this game to anyone is that there are so many better things to do with your time. I'm invested in the game, I'll be playing it until it shuts down. I don't mind that it's going to suck thousands of hours more of my life away before I stop playing.

But if you're dead set on playing this game and you want something mindless with a steady sense of getting something done, this is a good fit. There are so many unique classes in this game it's hard to imagine someone not finding something they'll fall in love with. You've heard it again and again from reviewers but the graphics in this game feel timeless. The music is beautiful, and if you've played in the past the nostalgia is going to hit hard. It's endearing. As of writing this review (7/4/22) the Destiny update has launched and right now might be the best time ever to play this game.

Assuming you're going to play the game in the ""traditional sense"", the gameplay loop will be grinding for an obscene amount of hours to get strong enough to take down a new boss. You'll kill the boss, get the loot if it has any, and start gearing up to kill the next boss. Sounds fast right? Not really. Bosses are weekly and their drops are either RNG or time gated. With some bosses you could go dry for over a year on a drop you might want.

Know what you're signing up for here. At the bare minimum you'll need to train 12 other characters that you may not enjoy playing to gain skills to ""transfer"" to your main. These are fairly significant and you'll need them if you're going to be serious about playing. If you really want to min/max you'll need to play a total of 40 characters, not consistently, but at least each one to a specific level. I enjoyed it, many don't. 

Assuming you don't want to spend money, the Reboot server is generally the way to go. This server disables trade between players and has been revamped to allow players to play the entire game without spending money if they really want. Otherwise, playing on any other server be prepared for a long F2P road or to fork over money in the magnitudes of thousands to reach the endgame. Reboot is a time investment. Regular servers are generally a money investment. Both are possible F2P.

If you're on the fence and like what you see in videos and pictures, give it a shot.  The real gameplay loop starts at level 200. Look up guides for things you're confused on, the game has a lot of different systems and menus you need to navigate to enjoy it. 

Otherwise, don't bother. Find another game.","Mixed63% of the 13,193 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1063730,New World: Aeternum,"I purchased New World very early on.  It looked beautiful from the screenshots and it promised to cater to my style of play - PvE.  I admit, when I first began playing I was in love with the world.  I thought it beautiful.  The crafting was fun, the areas were interesting, the flora and fauna were engaging. I was looking forward to owning a house.  Yeah, my MMOrpg world was very rosy.  

Alas, I am also a casual player.  I did not spend my first weeks every hour in the game leveling up.  This is bad because recent changes to the game has made it nigh impossible now to level up crafting without PvPing - More on this below...

Then the changes began.  The Devs were listening to the PvPers.  They were loud in their demands, and unhappy because they truly believed the game was made only for them.  The rest of us should suffer at their hands.  Well, apparently the devs agreed with them.  

This game is basically PvP.  It claims to be otherwise, but in reality it caters solely to PvP players and their entitlement.  (Just check the forums and you will easily see it for yourself.)  The idea that PvE and crafting were welcome in this game was a lie.  Basically it was a Bait and Switch.  

Now if you love PvP and don't mind being ganked at low levels by wandering death squads of level 60 players - this game is for you!  Yes, this is what I mean by PvPing.  The cost of repairing your equipment alone will break you.  

If you want to play in a game with a decent community and/or delivers on its promises to cater to any style of play - Don't bother with this game.  

We hear Final Fantasy 14 is good....  Seems to be where many of the massive amounts of players fleeing New World are headed.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"What started out as a review turned into a life story.....Once upon a time...

I was planning on buying The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) base game from an online digital marketplace, then maybe pick up the Morrowind chapter later on ""if"" I could get into it. To my surprise when I went to check it out on Steam it was £9.99 ""WITH"" the Morrowind chapter included in the overall price. A nice little surprise. 
If you do decide to purchase this game I recommend creating an account on:

""account.elderscrollsonline.com""

 first, which you will have to do anyway in order to play the game as it's run through a 3rd party but it's easy enough. Just be aware though the “userid” you choose on the 3rd party site will be the “userid” displayed while you’re in game. 

After I finished downloading the game through Steam I did have a slight issue with the installation... I noticed a few other people who have written a review for this game have also had the same hiccup but it is easily sorted out by ""repairing"" when prompted. Also, another thing to point out, you can play ESO with a controller (I am currently using a wired XBOX controller) if you fancy sitting back and relaxing, while you play on your big T.V then I’d strongly recommend not using KB/M. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as the conventional “plug and play” you do have to enable it in settings-gameplay. Also, like Skyrim you can toggle from first to 3rd person with the touch of a button.

Now on to the best part... The game is truly TRULY beautiful, the colours are vibrant, stand out and feel genuinely warm. The Elder Scrolls Online really does a fantastic job making sure you feel completely immersed in the environment. For me, this is a huge plus! Personally when I am playing a game like this I want to feel like I’m no longer sitting on my sofa, in front of the T.V, I want to feel like I’m actually running around Tamriel, taking in the sights and sounds. This is what I mean when I stipulated I feel “completely immersed” and ESO does a hell of a job creating that escape into that magical fantasy world. 

As crazy as this sounds, one of my favourite things about not only this but every game or movie I play or watch is its soundtrack and wow!! The Elder Scrolls Online is on the money again!! In my humble opinion a great soundtrack can make or break a game. Just look at “The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt” as an example, an amazing soundtrack = amazing game… “ELEX” shit soundtrack= shit game LOL (I know these are just my opinions but you get my point lol). ESO’s soundtrack is really something special... I looked into The Elder Scrolls Online soundtrack and they created it over a few YEARS and honestly it truly is a masterpiece. Amazon’s review has it 4.5/5 stars. It gives you this warm sense of nostalgia as it contains music from Skyrim.

I was racking my brain thinking what game The Elder Scrolls Online reminded me of… I know I'm kinda showing my age a little here but it's a lot like ""Fable 3 crossed with Dragon Age: Inquisition"" with some of the grand designs of some of the buildings and the atmosphere but again this is subjective as it purely my opinion. 

The NPC's really blend in well with the environment and are able to create a truly unique atmosphere. Also, NPC's involved in the quests you partake in look amazing when you’re speaking to them. The body language feels genuine and the words are actually synced with the movement of NPC’s lips plus no crazy facial expressions like “Mass Effect Andromeda” LOL. 


DIFFERENT RACES, FACTIONS & CLASSES

Another aspect I absolutely LOVE about this game is the “freedom of choice” and the “character customisation”. It is head and shoulders above most MMORPG’s on the market today. As far as I’m aware you are able to choose between TEN different races with THREE different factions that looks like this:  

“Ebonheart” Pact Faction Races

Argonian (Reptilian),  Dunmer (Dark Elves),  Nord (Human)

“Aldmeri” Dominion Faction Races

Altmer (High Elves),  Bosmer (Wood Elves),  Khajiit (Feline)

“Daggerfall” Covenant Faction Races

Breton (Human),  Orc (Also known as Corrupted Elves),  Redguard (Human)

Imperials (Human)  I think you have to purchase the “Imperial Edition of the game” to get access to this class and I think Imperials are able to join “any” faction.

CLASSES

Dragon Knight
Nightblade 
Templar
Sorcerer

NOTE
 I was checking out benchmarks on YouTube so I would have a rough idea what kind of FPS I could expect when I ran into something I think 99.9% of novice, semi and pro gamers would be interested in. Check out 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKRnY0YLLbc

on YouTube. The difference between choosing the minimum settings in comparison to the maximum is “Night and Day” TRULY! The textures, terrain, rendering ect are all obviously superior on the highest setting. I personally did the test myself using the R9 390X and can attest & confirm the evidence of the results. As most are aware it obviously depends heavily on what GPU you’re running ESO on but “if” you’re GPU allows you to run ESO on the highest settings I strongly recommend you do as you won’t be disappointed. Also, if you fancy pushing your hardware that little bit further and tweaking your graphical settings to improve your average FPS check this out on google, it’s pretty cool. This is, however, for advanced P.C enthusiasts not novices (No offence intended).

https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/368986/mega-thread-eso-performance-tweaks-fps-improvements-stutter-free-graphics-tweaking

As I stipulated above I'm running ESO on my R9 390X and FX 8350 OC’ed @ 4.5GHz it truly looks AMAZING. It hardly puts any stress on my GPU at all which in my opinion is particularly impressive as my CPU is ancient (6+ years old) is more than likely bottlenecking my GPU. There is no stuttering, lag, tearing ect and my GPU temps are well within the respectable limits.

Honestly, I am struggling to find anything negative about this game... Obviously I am aware that there was a fair amount of problems when the game was initially released back in 2014 but given the amount of time from then to now I think it’s fair to say the patches and updates have done their intended job. One thing I will mention is this game can get REALLY expensive if you let it... True, it’s not a ""Pay to Win"" kinda game in the conventional sense but you do get the feeling with how slowly you acquire gold that it would most definitely be easier to just buy crowns (in-game currency) but that's something you have to search your own soul in deciding if it's worth it.

In my opinion the game is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing and what's more the customisation of your character is also another huge plus. 

Overall Score:
9.6/10 – Amazing!!

One final comment I wish to end with and for me was kind of a make or break, potential deal-breaker was the ESO community… This community, for me is without a doubt the best community I have played online with to date. If you need help and ask 9/10 you get it. An example, I went into a dwarven mine while I was lvl 2 or 3 and kept dying so I asked someone who I had never spoken to before, who was on his/her way out if they could help me. We went back through everywhere they had been before, with me.. So I was able to complete that quest. Proper top draw community!!

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"Though I'm still very early into the game (or at least I would hope so), I cannot recommend it to anyone who's hoping for a real CRPG. HOWEVER, if you've never played a Dragon Age game before I believe that the majority of people interested in the game might enjoy it. The non-recommendation reflects my dislike of the game rather than advice on what you should do with your money. That being said, my expectations were so abysmally low that I can't say that I've been underwhelmed, in fact I'm impressed, but if I were to have to name the positive aspects of the game I would struggle. The game feels like a soft reboot in many ways, and pushes to new extremes the ignoring of lore and retconning which really began with Inquisition.

The biggest issues I've had with the game which I know will apply to all are technical issues. I'm only 9h in, and I already have corrupted save files. Additionally, the game constantly takes ages to load, be it to get to new areas or loading terrain during a cutscene. The character creation screen, which has seeming received praise from everyone who got their hands early on the game, and which is in many ways good, is reduced by other things. Namely, the fact that your character may just decided to revert to a preset appearance out of the bloom, and if you edit it with the Mirror of Transformation you might just be stuck with that default appearance and need to recreate your custom appearance or load an older save. The other issue, although this one is closer to a nitpick, is that whereas there are four lighting settings for Rook's creation, which were specifically added due to complaints in Inquisition, when you recreate your Inquisitor you are stuck with a single ugly greenish lighting, which I'm unsure is a joke or just a middle finger. 

The gameplay has completely dumped any notion of being a traditional western RPG. Technically, it still is RPG gameplay, just in the same sense as Assassin's Creed games have been since Origins. The gameplay is now closer to Dark Souls than to DAO or Baldur's Gate. This is not an exaggeration, the fighting is now largely reliant on parrying and dodging the big red attacks like Soulsborne games, or Shadow of War. Every weapon (at least for rogue) now also has a stagger value, which might as well be called ""poise damage"" from FromSoft games. In a way, I respect Bioware for going this route, as both DA2 and especially Inquisition felt really confused as to whether or not they were RPGs in the same vein as DAO or wider appeal action games. However, the execution is rather apalling. It is incredibly difficult to visually tell when you're supposed to parry, every enemy seems to have a ranged attack and there seems to be a drastic aggro on the player under all circumstances. Most of the time, as a rogue, I end up cheesing fights by running around the enemy's whilst waiting for my abilities and arrows to reload, which is far from the ideal way of playing the game. The reduction of the party size from the traditional four to three would be incomprehensible to me, if it weren't for the ease of use for console users. 

The environments of the game are its highlight. They all look very good visually and in a vacuum. However, both their usage in gameplay and their place in the DA franchise is again, poor. The game's idea of ""exploration"" is having an objective marker constantly point the way and expecting you to never deviate to loot the obvious areas which aren't directly on the beaten path. Much worse in my opinion, is the environment's within the narrative. Both Tevinter and the Qunari now run some sort of dystopian 1984-style government where they're monitoring movements in the street with big spotlights from the sky and screaming at citizens what to do. This aesthetic is incredibly jarring in a fantasy setting, especially DA which has a long history. The visuals for Arlathan are gorgeous, but again they clash with the aesthetics of DA and look like something out of a PlayStation game like Knack or Jak & Daxter rather than a DA game. Antiva is the one area I've explored so far which I've no criticisms of, visually. 

I won't delve into the game's story or characters much, as I'm too early into it to judge in good faith. However, the writing is poor and at many moments cringe. In too many moments did I feel like I was having a group therapy session when the tone really did not align with that. On most occasions, the writing is just rather plain, direct and boring. Bioware has decided to return to the god-forsaken three dialogue paths of DA2 as the default, ie. Diplomatic, Joker and Aggressive. However here there doesn't really seem to be an actual correlation between the type of line chosen, the line which shows up around the wheel, what ends up being said and the reaction of other characters. A lot of lines which appear to be ""jokes"" are the unfunniest shit you'll ever hear. You also seem to be stuck into being a nice guy no matter what in both behaviour and speech, which is rather jarring considering this is supposed to be a ROLE-PLAYING game.

The music is rather meh and in some spots it sounds like it belongs in Mass Effect rather than Dragon Age. 

As I've said earlier, and this is my biggest gripe with the game, it almost feels like a reboot. Bioware has decided that, in effect, only two decisions from the previous games would be imported in this one. Both from Inquisition. To me this is plain lazy and dishonest. What was so magical to me when I first played Origins, beyond the lore and characters, was the fact that decisions you made during the game would reflect throughout it, and were ultimately preserved during the credits. Although Inquisition and 2 didn't react to all choices of the previous games, I always found it interesting to have some tiny change in only a handful of lines of dialogue when speaking to a character because the Warden or Hawke had done B instead of A. There were poor executions, such as the case of Leliana in Inquisition if she died in Origins, however these were generally the exception rather than the rule. All that goes through the window now, because none of the prior choices matter. Morrigan, who if she had him centers her life around Kieran by the time of Inquisition, will never mention him here. Instead, she's here only to do a cheap cameo and get the player to soyjak at their screen. This is compounded by the earlier mentioned change in artstyle, which to me is an overall loss. Demons and darkspawn are the most egregious example, with the latter receiving a second visual overhaul which makes them look goofier than ever. The Qunari/Kossith suffer from this as well. The Darkspawn also seem to be entirely different from what they were in DAO, which was the main reference point for everything Darkspawn. Finally, many mysteries of the lore which have been speculated over for a decade now are answered in a blink with no gravitas, in the most matter-of-fact way possible. 

I am far from being in love with this game, although I will play it to completion. Unlike others who might feel ""betrayed"" by Bioware, I feel rather indifferent. The quality of their work has been ~ 0 since the release of Andromeda, and this is not the grandiose return some may have expected. The studio has decided to dump the last few fans which got onboard with their games prior to Inquisition, which is about time. My greatest regret with the game is that it did not stay in development hell longer, so that maybe Bioware looked at BG3's success instead of, well only god knows what they were trying to do when making this game.","Mostly Positive71% of the 24,035 user reviews for this game are positive.",early hope cannot_recommend hoping real crpg never_played age believe majority interested enjoy non recommendation reflects dislike rather advice expectation abysmally low underwhelmed impressed name positive aspect struggle feel soft reboot way push extreme ignoring lore retconning began inquisition biggest issue apply technical issue 9h already corrupted save file constantly take age load area loading terrain cutscene creation screen seeming received praise hand early way good reduced thing namely decided revert preset appearance bloom mirror transformation stuck default appearance recreate custom appearance load older save issue closer nitpick whereas four lighting setting rook creation due complaint in_emphasizedquisition recreate inquisitor stuck single ugly greenish lighting unsure joke middle finger completely dumped notion traditional western role technically role game_emphasizedplay sense as_emphasizedsassin creed game origin closer dark soul dao baldur gate not_an exaggeration fighting largely reliant parrying dodging big red attack soulsborne game shadow war weapon rogue stagger value called poise damage from_emphasizedsoft game respect bioware route da2 especially inquisition confused not_they rpgs vein dao wider appeal action game execution rather apalling incredibly difficult visually supposed parry enemy ranged attack drastic aggression aggressiveness circumstance rogue cheesing fight running enemy whilst waiting ability arrow reload far ideal reduction party size traditional four three incomprehensible ease console user environment highlight good visually vacuum usage da franchise poor idea exploration objective marker constantly expecting never_deviate item reward dropped defeated enemy obvious area directly beaten path worse environment narrative tevinter qunari sort dystopian 1984 style government monitoring movement street big spotlight sky screaming citizen aesthetic incredibly jarring fantasy setting especially da long history visuals arlathan gorgeous clash aesthetic da playstation knack jak daxter rather da antiva explored far no_criticisms visually delve s_emphasizedtory character early judge good faith writing poor moment cringe moment group therapy session tone not_align occasion writing rather plain direct boring bioware decided god forsaken three dialogue path da2 default ie diplomatic joker aggressive actual correlation type line chosen line show wheel end reaction character line appear joke unfunniest shit hear stuck nice no_matter behaviour speech rather jarring considering supposed role music rather meh spot sound belongs mass effect rather age earlier biggest gripe feel reboot bioware decided effect decision game imported inquisition plain lazy dishonest magical origin lore character decision reflect throughout preserved credit inquisition 2 react choice game found interesting tiny handful line dialogue speaking warden hawke poor execution leliana in_emphasizedquisition died origin generally exception rather rule go window prior choice matter morrigan center life kieran inquisition never_mention cheap cameo soyjak screen compounded earlier mentioned artstyle loss demon darkspawn egregious example latter receiving visual overhaul make goofier qunari kossith suffer darkspawn entirely different dao reference darkspawn finally mystery lore speculated decade answered blink no_gravitas matter possible far love play completion unlike others betrayed bioware rather indifferent quality 0 release andromeda not_the grandiose expected studio decided dump last fan onboard game prior inquisition greatest regret not_stay development hell longer maybe bioware looked bg3 s_emphasizeduccess god know trying
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Usually I dont do reviews on Steam about games... but Rockstars greed and Rockstars support impotence made me unstoppable to not throw out my feelings... so...

I remember first time GTA V was announced to PC.. I was excited as huge GTA franchise fan! Intrigued that finaly I would not need to dream about PlayStation to play one of best games ever! That was huge... pricy, but huge, loved it anyway - ordered a pre-order with some huge bonuses here in Steam for quite a lot for that time for game! Enjoyed!

First I enjoyed game really much... liked it, loved it, played it a lot... but real life took my attention and GTA V and especially GTA V Online hours reduced till I was legit to say Im not playing it anymore... so few weeks before I write this review I returned and was suprised that there is a lot things to upgrade, purchase and amazing new content - even got new friends, since my old friends was not playing GTA V anymore! Started to understand that it will take few weeks to get some of my mostly desired content... that meant playing MC stuff, selling bunker stuff, researching bunker stuff, playing heists and everything... since my cars was so slow and not top notch (couldnt afford compatable for racing). So far so good ? Yeah... I always was aginst cheating - public looby modders always f**k things up.. bomb you remotely, engage PvP with god mode or etc... simply hated it - till I found community to play with and who usually occupies public lobby and kicks anyone who is just cheating or creating cage around you!

Perfect! My return will be easier in such community - I will need few less weeks to get desired items - some members are rich and lets test me newest cars (my best was Zentorno and Osiris, T20 too) but there wooow Buggati Chiron like car and it cost millions! So community players see that I cannot afford even security on my MC businesses and in some heists they put me in clear advantage since they gave double digit millions in account (I usually didnt have more than 1.5 million in-game cash) and put my reward for heist ridicilusly high (75%)... nice good heist time evenings and luckly selling some bunker stuff and woilaa - got 3.7 millions in-game cash - tought about what to buy and since it was late evening - went to sleep with idea that tomorrow I will choose what of desired content I will buy :) Got really excited about community and game again - fully returning to play it...

Sounds too good ? Yes... today (its evening of the day I wanted to choose what to buy) I recieve email that Ive been bad boy by violationg Terms of Service/EULA and I got suspended for 30 days and all my items will be deleted...

Devasted ? At beginning not really - even tought: ""Phe, Ive have done nothing bad, didnt cheat - whatever. It must be error and usually that kind of stuff is repaired and all will be fine""... Ive been heard that there is ban waves where innocent people been banned and tought that Rockstar should be fixing that - so with good willing - made ticket in Rockstar Support about my suspension and warning to delete all achievments Ive been earned so far (some of them, for example my first supercar - Zentorno, more than few years old). Guess what ? They auto-close this kind of ticket... Okay, thought thats a bug - so I got live chat with support and explained what halppened... and first line of support just say he cant help me - there is some factor that is reason for banning me and when asked about what - he was not able to say, just that its violation of ToS/EULA! As experienced customer support guy - I understand first line guys problem and tell - okay - please escalate issue about bug to his supervisor if he really cant help... so amazingly my live chat with support is taken to other guy which is less coming to me back and just closes conversation with same text ""I will not tell why you got banned, its not without reason"". Im shocked... even angry! I paid at that time 60€ for game... 

Devasted! Support should not be so bad but then I started reading reviews and internet about everything and I see a lot complains about banning innocent players, yet I remember how was going in random public lobby - if not blown appart, then caged with some modder... and then me - who hard work in-game cash to get desired car... and now this - my GTA V Online character will be deleted, all my cars will be deleted...

How I feel about it ? Im devasted,,, paid for game and I will be honest - Online part of game is last that Im in there for, since single player I have been 100% completed on XBOX360... and now they take me from me without reason or because their ban bot is failure or mistaken or simply badly coded... I keep asking why Rockstar is doing this ? My only guess would be that 60€ I have paid to them (ofc steam takse some part, so tehnicly a bit less) is not enough or they want more... You would ask how I become to this illuminati theory ? Just keeped asking why ? Ofc I have another steam accounts and by CS:GO items (played that game for more thousands of hours) I can sell - I can easaly earn those 20€ and not be bitch about all unfairness of Rockstar here, but Im man with principles and I can publicy tell - NO. Rockstar, I will not pay you more to get content I already paid for long time ago overpriced amount of €.

What to do next ? Sue Rockstar ? Nah... I readed ToS/EULA and terms I have checked checkbox that I agree and it basicly removes any rights to me to go to court to say that Rockstar is simply abusing me... Forget ? No, Im man of principle. Wait 30 days and start from zero - probably... at this point thats only thing I have left and apparently I will return to game, but probably It will take for me more than 30 days for that - just because my anger about unfair situation is too big but I still love this game, yet I understand that developer company and support is softly saying BAD.

At this point Im really glad that I never bought any shark cards and I will never buy extra copy of GTA V on other accounts to pay extra to Rockstar!

This game has one of the most abusive PTW systems I've ever come across.

Making your own decks with the cards you have is barely an option, since the obese grease stains who play this game religiously are willing to shell out their entire net worth to make the exact same meta deck that everyone else is using.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Any longtime Dead by Daylight player knows that this isn't a horror game. If you're looking for scares, I wouldn't consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time. It doesn't have enough build-up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer. That said and set aside, I enjoy a good chase, or simply losing the killer's line of sight and giving them the slip. It can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock. There have been times where I have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden. Those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes. Hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right, and it's one of the aspects that drew me to Dead by Daylight. It's a game about being sneaky, and trying not to get caught. On the other hand however, getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole, because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door. Contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them, each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting. As with any game I feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game, and sometimes it's possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook, which can be very not fun. 

I give Dead by Daylight an 8/10 and I've enjoyed my many hours playing, and so I will recommend.","Very Positive80% of the 546,855 user reviews for this game are positive.",longtime know horror scare consider scary predictable build suspense instill fear caught killer set aside enjoy good chase simply losing killer line sight giving slip funny outsmart someone hiding tree rock time lost killer simply circle object remaining hidden moment succeeds eye hide seek fun game manage aspect drew sneaky trying not_to caught hand purpose taking killer long chase help repair generator unhindered gain plenty boldness point distracting helping escape killer spends wasted chasing a_emphasized highly skilled experienced runner 3 teammate utilize towards 5 generator running power exit door contentwise continued introduction killer survivor alongside unique ability keep thing interesting mention community encountered online situation break possible killer camp hung hook not_fun 8 10 enjoyed hour recommend
2300320,Farming Simulator 25,"As I played all games since FS15 and having played many many hours I can give my expert opinion.

1. The menus are absolutely shite, the store sorting is unbelievable, they put everything in vehicles unlike before with separate pages for trailers, tools… Which makes it very hard to find something and very annoying, it evolved backwards and its due to the fact the devs had to make it look different because all the new features could’ve been added to FS22.
2. The graphics aren’t as good as they say, yeah I see a bit of fog but I dont see much improvement from FS22, also when I fist started the game it set some ass resolution and it took me 2 tries to change it for some reason I was selecting my res and it was loading a different one. Also the performance is crap like FS22, when you load on a map first time you get stutters… I mean I expected it to change as according to them this is a “new game”.
3. I actually feel like there are less machines and vehicles than the last game, the MAN trucks are gone, there isnt enough variety of tractors or matching brands, like I want to have a Fendt tractor with Fendt implements but thats not available.
4. The deforming ground is a new feature yes but its not done all the way as it should, there should be more variety and it should happen everywhere it should to be honest not just fields.

Overall im extremely disappointed, every dev team now is the same, they sell the same games and sometimes their new games are worst than the old ones. Now, should you buy it? Well, do you have any other option? All the mods are now made for this game and everyone is playing it so I guess you have to go with the flow.

252490,Rust,"If you ever thought about buying this game, let me give you some advice. For the first couple hours you play this game, mute voices. Trust me, you don't want to listen to little kids who are either roof camping or running around with a group of 6+ talking shit about you when you die. Don't get stressed out about not having a gun in first hour. The game takes patience. If you like to PvP, then yea, you should have a gun by the first hour, but if you like to build, dont worry about the gun. Just farm resources. Also don't get discouraged if you got raided offline. It just means that who ever raided you was to much of a pussy to raid you online because they know they would lose to you. Unless you live in a 2x1 base then yea, you're at fault there. When just joined a new server, don't bother farming for stone and stuff, just get some tools, and farm scrap. Because by chance you could get a gun from a box and then you would want to research it, this also gives you the opportunity to know who are the nice people and who are fuckers who like to roof camp or zerg up.

2768430,ATLYSS,"TLDR AT BOTTOM

---

Atlyss is an indie action RPG that masterfully blends retro mechanics with modern, fast-paced combat, delivering a thrilling experience that appeals far beyond its furry-focused aesthetic. From the engaging combat to the strategic resource management, Atlyss is packed with depth and challenge that will captivate fans of the genre.

Combat: Fast, Strategic, and Immensely Satisfying**  
The combat system in Atlyss is a standout feature, offering a mix of fluid movement and strategic planning that keeps every encounter fresh and exciting. Enemy attacks are often slow and telegraphed, allowing sharp-eyed players to anticipate and parry them. Perfectly timed parries feel immensely rewarding, not only stopping an enemy’s attack but opening them up to devastating counters. However, the real magic of the combat system shines when you're facing groups of three or more enemies at once. The chaos of dodging around the battlefield, parrying multiple foes in quick succession, and timing your AOE abilities to thin their ranks creates an exhilarating flow. 

The tight controls make these moments feel as much about skill as planning. You’re not just button-mashing; you’re weaving between attacks, countering threats, and unleashing combos with finesse. There’s a rhythm to the combat that, when mastered, feels deeply satisfying. Add to this a variety of weapons and skills to experiment with, and every player will find a playstyle that suits them.

Enemies and Challenges:  
The enemies in Atlyss are well-designed, offering varied patterns that challenge your reflexes and adaptability. Some foes are slow but powerful, requiring precise timing to counter, while others are fast and relentless, forcing you to constantly reposition. This variety keeps combat engaging and unpredictable. However, some enemies—particularly in later areas—can feel overtuned, hitting too hard or having excessive health pools that disrupt the pacing. While this adds a layer of difficulty, it can occasionally feel frustrating rather than challenging, especially when you're caught unprepared. 

Retro-Inspired Mechanics:
Fans of older RPGs will appreciate the clever incorporation of classic mechanics into Atlyss. Stamina and resource management play a crucial role, echoing the deliberate pacing of titles from the PS1 era. Every decision matters, from when to expend stamina on an AOE attack to whether to use a rare healing item. These mechanics add a layer of depth to the action, encouraging thoughtful play rather than reckless aggression.

Movement and Exploration:
In addition to its combat, Atlyss shines with its snappy movement system. Dashing feels intuitive and responsive, letting you quickly navigate both battlefields and the game’s environments. The levels are intricately designed, with hidden paths and secrets waiting to be uncovered. Exploration is encouraged, and the game rewards those who take the time to stray from the beaten path with items and chests.

Early Access Challenges and Potential:
As with many early access titles, Atlyss has its share of growing pains. The most noticeable issue is with controller trigger inputs, which don’t function as expected when binding actions. For players who prefer controllers, this can be a notable annoyance. Additionally, while the enemy designs are largely enjoyable, some balancing tweaks are needed to ensure that all encounters feel fair yet challenging. These issues, while present, are far from game-breaking. 

It’s important to note that Atlyss is the work of a solo developer, and the level of polish and creativity already on display is remarkable. Frequent updates and transparent communication from the developer suggest that these issues will be addressed over time, and the game is brimming with untapped potential.

Why You Should Play It:
Even with its imperfections, Atlyss delivers a unique and thrilling experience. Its fast-paced combat, retro-inspired mechanics, and polished presentation make it a must-play for action RPG fans. Whether you’re parrying a horde of enemies, exploring it's detailed world, or experimenting with new builds, the game consistently delivers moments of fun and excitement. 

---

TLDR:  
Atlyss is an action RPG with fast, strategic combat, retro-inspired mechanics, and rewarding exploration. Its parry-heavy combat shines, especially in chaotic group battles where you dash, counter, and unleash devastating AOE attacks. While controller issues and some unbalanced enemies mar the experience, this early access gem from a solo developer brims with potential. If you love fast-paced, skill-based RPGs with a nostalgic flair, Atlyss is a must-play.",Very Positive98% of the 496 user reviews for this game are positive.,bottom indie action role masterfully blend retro mechanic modern fast paced combat delivering thrilling appeal far furry focused aesthetic engaging combat strategic resource management packed depth challenge captivate fan genre combat fast strategic immensely satisfying combat standout offering mix fluid movement strategic planning keep encounter fresh exciting enemy attack slow telegraphed allowing sharp eyed player anticipate parry perfectly timed parry immensely rewarding not_only stopping enemy attack opening devastating counter real magic combat shine facing group three enemy chaos dodging battlefield parrying multiple foe quick succession timing effect ability thin rank creates exhilarating flow tight control moment skill planning not_just button mashing weaving attack countering threat unleashing combo finesse rhythm combat mastered feel deeply satisfying add variety weapon skill experiment playstyle suit enemy challenge enemy designed offering varied pattern challenge reflex adaptability foe slow powerful requiring precise timing counter others fast relentless forcing constantly reposition variety keep combat engaging unpredictable enemy area overtuned hitting hard excessive health pool disrupt pacing add layer difficulty occasionally frustrating rather challenging especially caught unprepared retro inspired mechanic fan older rpgs appreciate clever incorporation classic mechanic stamen resource management play crucial role echoing deliberate pacing title ps1 era decision matter expend stamen effect attack rare healing mechanic add layer depth action encouraging thoughtful play rather reckless aggression movement exploration addition combat shine snappy movement dashing feel intuitive responsive letting quickly navigate battlefield environment level intricately designed hidden path secret waiting uncovered exploration encouraged reward stray beaten path item chest player purchase play official release challenge potential player purchase play official release title share growing pain noticeable issue controller trigger input function expected binding action player prefer controller notable annoyance enemy design largely enjoyable balancing tweak needed ensure encounter fair challenging issue present far breaking important note solo developer polish creativity already display remarkable frequent update transparent communication developer suggest issue addressed brimming untapped potential play imperfection delivers unique thrilling fast paced combat retro inspired mechanic polished presentation play action role fan parrying horde enemy exploring detailed world experimenting build consistently delivers moment fun excitement action role fast strategic combat retro inspired mechanic rewarding exploration parry heavy combat shine especially chaotic group battle dash counter unleash devastating effect attack controller issue unbalanced enemy mar player purchase play official release gem solo developer brim potential love fast paced skill based rpgs nostalgic flair play

2878980,NBA 2K25,"So, the last NBA 2K game I played was 2K13. I've been itching to return for a few years now, but the negative reviews and the fact that 2K was selling old-gen version for PC kept me away. But with 2K25, I finally decided to jump back in, and it's been awesome.
I only play offline singleplayer MyNBA mode, so keep that in mind. 

Good:
[list]

    [*] Graphics are great and performance is good. Experienced a crash once in 40 hours.
    [*] Customization is crazy. Sliders for everything, from gameplay to in-depth settings and behaviour of CPU in terms of players' value, player development or coach preferences.
    [*] MyNBA mode is rich with features, offering a deep franchise experience with lots of stats and coaching settings. It's very impressive and way better than it was the last time I played. 
[/list] 

Bad:
[list]

    [*] Presentation could be better (replays, real TV overlays).
 [*] A couple of times, the game got stuck at ""syncing with 2K servers"" after a match, forcing me to quit and lose all progress. It's frustrating when this happens.
    [*] I expect a lot of commentary to disappear starting from year 2 because a lot of phrases are recorded regarding the 2023-2024 season. So after you advance to year 2 all those comments will become irrelevant and probably disappear from the broadcast.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"I usually don’t write reviews for games but writing it this time as a long-time fan of the series and the game seems to be caught in the online woke/anti-woke war. I am 7.5 hours in and would probably update as I get more into the game. So far, this game is not for long time fans of the series.

Edit 1: Look at the cons section.
Edit 2: It feels like this game is a soft reboot of the DA franchise for ""modern audience""
Edit 3: Look at the cons section.
Edit 4: Look at the cons section.

Before anyone accuses of me being a white nationalist/nazi/racist/bigot. I am an Indian and have 0 skin in the game for first world social problems. We have our own problems to deal with and again writing this as my perspective as fan of the series.

Pros
1.	Decent optimization and game runs very smoothly at 4k@120hz for me at least.
2.	Gorgeous world design and environment.

Cons
1.	Ham-fisted implementation of diversity. What I mean dropping a pointy ear Asian lady is skin deep diversity. Not every race in the game needs to be representative of every real-life race. That is a gross oversimplification.
2.	Animation is janky. Just look at characters running around, did they use the same animators as ME:A ?
3.	Writing, the companions keep dropping lore exposition and some time it gets annoying. Also, the conversations have as much depth as a puddle.
4.	Edit 1: There is something off about the character design. I thought I would get used to the change in the art style, but unfortunately, I am not. 
5.	Edit 1: Where are the dark fantasy elements from the previous game?
6.	Edit 1: 10 hours in and the game still insists on holding my hand.
7.	Edit 3: Taash
8.	Edit 4: 0 player agency

Just different
1.	Not much open world so far, the style is closer to ME2 than a Dragon age game. This is not a problem for me but can be divisive. 
2.	UI is a bit confusing for me on PC using a PS5 controller, took some time to figure out how to get to the character menu, also still not sure where journal is to change the active quest.
3.	Not a fan of follow the quest marker school of gameplay, but most of the recent games have it so putting it here instead of cons.  
4.	Combat is spongy and they seem to have taken inspiration from Jedi: Survivor. Which is different from previous DA games.
5.	The starting squad does, does not have 1 from every class and you cannot switch between characters. Which is something personally don’t like but few my friends are fine with this streamlining. 
6.	Dumbing down of RPG elements, the game plays more like action adventure than an RPG. But then this has been a trend with every game from DA2.","Mostly Positive71% of the 24,035 user reviews for this game are positive.",usually write review game writing long fan series caught online woke anti woke war 7 5 hour probably far not_for long fan series 1 con section 2 feel soft reboot da franchise modern audience 3 con section 4 con section accuses white nationalist nazi racist bigot indian 0 skin world social problem problem deal writing perspective fan series pro 1 decent optimization run smoothly 4k 120hz 2 gorgeous world design environment con 1 ham fisted implementation diversity dropping pointy ear asian lady skin deep diversity not_every race need representative real life race gross oversimplification 2 animation janky character running animator 3 writing companion dropping lore exposition get annoying conversation depth puddle 4 1 design thought art style unfortunately not_5 1 dark fantasy element 6 1_emphasized0 hour insists holding hand 7 3 taash 8 4 0 agency different 1 not_much open world far style closer me2 age not_a problem divisive 2 ui bit confusing pc ps5 controller took figure menu not_sure journal active task objective given non 3 not_a fan follow task objective given non marker school recent game putting con 4 combat spongy taken inspiration jedi survivor different da game 5 starting squad does_emphasized not_have 1 class cannot_switch character personally friend fine streamlining 6 dumbing role element play action adventure role trend da2

With a plethora of playstyles built in to the uniquely designed name-sakes: your Warframes and the associated weapons and accouterments per style of over the shoulder, potentially extremely high-speed combat across multiple game modes your hunger for digital violence *can* be enabled sweetly. Each weapon, companion, Warframe, combat location, faction, and story-relevant character has articulated lore for those interested in looking into it, and the primary story itself (as of (2/23/2024) has broad enough appeal that most persons *could* likely enjoy it were it pursued. 

The game is primarily instance and squad-based of up to 4 people. The majority of Warframe’s single mission game modes are on various planets against the games number of enemy factions which are primarily dependent on the area. 
It’s few but well-crafted open areas are hubs for players to interact, and each have a special faction to grow in rapport with, gaining the player access to new weapons, cosmetics, etc.
 These open-world factions (and factions one gains rapport with in general) however are time-gated, availing the player to only a certain amount of rapport per their what is called ”Mastery Rank: the game’s leveling system amounting to using any weapon, Warframe, or companion to its highest rank once. That is to say that improving the optional speed of faction accrual of rapport requires a player “master” a certain number more items each rank.

One of Warframe’s greatest weaknesses is a told from one of its strengths: it’s wealth of ideas.
Since the devs are always coming out with *new* content, unfortunately the interweaving of new with old content and expanding on the interplays of new systems appears to take a backseat to “progress” which certainly happens, but leaves loose ends abounding.

While Warframe is not pay to win, it is pay to progress (for me) in a timely manner.
 The “premium currency” can be bought, but with the interest, and access to the Warframe Marketplace which is both and in game chat window and an associated app. Premium parts can easily be farmed (for the willing grinder) and sold for said premium currency to buy weapons, Warframes and cosmetics, but more importantly: storage for them which adds to extra variability of play styles and eliminates need for selling weapons one likes in favor of more space.

Even if however were you to buy every weapon, that is available for purchase in the game however, it would still be a grind to level them all up, and learn what one likes about each set of loadouts.

The games variety of combat styles and unique type of sci-fi, post-poly apocalyptic aesthetic, I find do a lot of heavy lifting for a good stretch of playtime, and despite elements of negative critique I find the game still fun enough to go back to for its particular brand of mass brutality. 

Additionally, If you’re willing to pay the full price of a AAA title on a day when login bonuses (which are fairly regular) equate to %70 off premium currency, one could easily get enough premium currency to purchase one or several weapons to start out with a loadout that at aesthetically appeals to the player, that may be enough to keep you coming back and playing through other issues. It was for me.","Very Positive87% of the 598,811 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"I adore Helldivers 2.  It's gameplay and its world-building is top-notch, and the bad business practices which have crept into video games over the last 20 years are much milder and better disguised than comparable titles.

As of early October 2024, the in-game microtransactions are the least obtrusive and onerous they can be while still including them.  The Kernel-level anti-cheat doesn't bloat the system or over-tax your hardware.  Roughly fifty hours of gameplay yields 1000 SuperCredits - enough to purchase one new Warbond.  Forced mission type rotation is built into 3-mission ""Operations"" which contribute to the larger meta-story of the campaign map.  11 difficulty levels allow players to find the most rewarding difficulty for their skill level and squad size.  And the game-play loop is addictive as all hell.

But I can't in good conscience actually recommend anyone actually purchase this game at this point.  Tens of thousands of players who did so when this game was at its height of popularity are now unable to play the game they purchased after Sony pulled server support in their countries.  Players who tried to get around this using VPNs had their Steam accounts banned by Valve.  And now after a change to the laws in California, the EULA has been updated to make it 100% clear that players do not own copies of this game, but rather are buying licences to access an online service which can be changed or shut down at any time at the whims of the developer Arrowhead Studios or the publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment.

All signs point to a day some time in the future where this game will simply be pulled from service like so many MMOs and ""games as services"" before it.  At best it's comparable to a theme park with lots of roller coasters but there's someone at the door waiting to confiscate your balloons and cotton candy.

Or, as Darth Vader famously said, ""I am altering the deal, pray I do not alter it any further""

Please visit the ""Stop Killing Games"" campaign and lend your support.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"Unfortunately I can't recommend this game. 
Maybe as a standalone IP it would be pretty decent but as an instalment for dragon age it just guts the good of the franchise and turns it into cringe. 
My understanding all the old writers of the serie by now quit and a new fresher probably younger and inexperienced writers took over and the dark medieval fantasy setting turned into a power fantasy immature very family friendly narrative. Sure the world's state is mature and dark, but almost every interaction and social aspect feels like written for very young audience with continuously reminding the player about the current plot and goal. After you keep hearing in the first 3 hours the same one sentence over and over it gets exhausting. I get it that this is what happened and need to do something about it but I also have my quest journal to check if I would really need to be reminded. 

What made the serie great that I always had my option to play as a great hero or a major pain in the ass with consequences and differences in choices and their outcomes. This was fully stripped from the game, my Rook unable to be in disagreement, I can't make my choices freely I am heavily forced to be supportive in matters which I feel ways too related to irl politics running down instead choices and understanding of Thedas the world I trying to immerse myself with.

I love some good representation in games, I do. This is not the game for that. Moreso it is hurtful and more damaging then ever to the LGBT community, it enforcing one person's ideals and observation on a very sensitive topic (unfortunately the angry teenager who is loud and can't be reasoned with from the tone of the writing) and ignores everyone else. I felt crynge and major discomfort and disgust in many points with this. Specifically want to mention a moment between Taash and their mother who tried to understand and reason to understand her child on a way I know many LGBT person would have loved if their parents would react like that. Instead Taash continuously attack and defy their mother like if two different people wrote the conversation between the characters and neither of them discussed what the other one wrote. 

What kept me going was the lore addition. This was my absolute favourite franchise from 2009. I had 100% achievements on all 3 instalments through the years even if my original DAO achis got lost after the phpbb forum turned into origins app. I have lot of lore books on my shelves of Thedas and so, I love the world, I was and is invested in the setting and possible backgrounds, secrets and mysteries. This is not the dragon age I played, this is not that dark fantasy I immersed with and sat hours thinking how I want to approach to solve its world's issues and problems. 
This is... ways 'too modern' and 'politically involved and touched' with disrespect towards people its trying to represent. 

I don't even want to go into how much known characters feels gutted and twisted and maturely downgraded from older games. That is another can of worms to open. 

I only hope somehow they can salvage this. DMC did it, there is enough lore foundation for a better come back, but this in this shape and form is a no from me. The much I would love to 'love' it.","Mostly Positive71% of the 24,035 user reviews for this game are positive.",unfortunately recommend maybe standalone ip pretty decent instalment age gut good franchise turn cringe understanding old writer serie quit fresher probably younger inexperienced writer took dark medieval fantasy setting turned power fantasy immature family friendly narrative world s_emphasizedtate mature dark interaction social aspect feel written young audience continuously reminding plot goal hearing 3 hour sentence get exhausting happened task objective given non journal check reminded serie great play great hero major pain as consequence difference choice outcome stripped rook unable disagreement choice freely heavily forced supportive matter way related irl politics running choice understanding thedas world trying immerse love good representation game not_the moreso hurtful damaging lgbt community enforcing ideal observation sensitive topic unfortunately angry teenager loud reasoned tone writing ignores else crynge major discomfort disgust point mention moment taash mother tried understand understand child lgbt loved parent react taash continuously attack defy mother different wrote conversation character neither_of discussed wrote lore addition absolute favourite franchise 2009 100 achievement 3 instalment year original dao achis lost phpbb forum turned origin app lore book shelf thedas love world invested setting possible background secret mystery not_the age not_that dark fantasy i_emphasizedmmersed sat hour approach solve world issue problem way modern politically involved touched disrespect towards trying represent known character feel gutted twisted maturely downgraded older game worm open hope somehow salvage dmc lore foundation shape form no_from love love
2582560,EA SPORTS™ Madden NFL 25,"+ Team builder (Finally)
+ Cleaner menus
+ New announcers
+ Franchise mode makeover 
+ Player likeness for some players, which is noticeable and pretty accurate
+ RB fights for yards and falls forward
+ Actual QB sneak

- Game play feels sluggish compared to previous years
- AI defense is terrible per usual, players just don't play their zones and don't take realistic pursuit angles 
- User has been nerfed even more on defense (I know we don't want Madden 20 superman LBs back, but at least make the user feel like they're a difference maker, especially with how atrocious the AI defenders are.)
- Oline still broken, but better than in madden 24
- Receivers still don't go after the ball (Probably my biggest gripe about this game)
- Skill moves are nerfed so much that it takes the fun out of using the ballcarrier
- Still get sucked into animations occasionally
- Marketed as ""Physics based tackling"", which is just not true. Play a game of NCAA 14 to see real physics based tackling.
- When editing a player it takes you into a separate loading screen that pauses menu music (small critique but noticeable if you spend a lot of time in franchise menus)


Overall it's a step up from Madden 24. I would give this a positive rating compared to previous maddens, but overall still negative. Nowhere near what we should be getting from a football game in 2024. EA still has the exclusive license to NFL ""simulation"" style football games, so until that changes, this is still the best football game on the market, and if your a madden fan your likely gonna buy it anyways like we always do lol. Also EA refused to put College Football 25 on PC, so another big middle finger to us football fans.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"After Final fantasy XIV 1.0 was a gigantic flop, Square Enix was brave enough to give the title a reboot.

With success!

A Realm Reborn is really fun. This already starts with the story which is very long in my opinion. The atmosphere and the music are wonderful. Every detail in the game is lovely designed. There are so many possibilities in the game to kill time. For example, there are FATEs which are events where you must fight in groups against world bosses and other opponents. Even if you've reached max level, you can still enter old dungeons because your level gets capped and you can enjoy them with newer players. If you're bored with your current class, then you don't have to create a new character. Just change your weapon, and you can play as another class. I really like that idea since I don't like to have multiple characters.

If you're a Final Fantasy or MMORPG fan, then you should definitely give this title a try. It's one of the greatest MMORPG's in recent years.

2768430,ATLYSS,"I've got about 40 hours in the itch.io demo, and now I have several in this one.

I enjoy the game quite a lot, but there are some things about it that make it INCREDIBLY frustrating to play

-Bosses are basically damage sponges even if you're fighting them above the level where they appear in the dungeon. They feel like a MASSIVE slog after you've had to go back and try again 5 times because kaluuz' attack hits repeatedly and eats up your stamina. the only way i've been able to beat him at level 17 is by constantly backing away from him and only firing every so often, because i literally don't have the stamina to take more than one attack from him (and this is despite me putting points into dexterity!). and it takes probably 10-15 minutes to do this, to the point that it just becomes tedious and my fingers cramp up from constantly having to move with ZERO time for reprieve.

On that note, PLEASE give us the ability to actually pause the game. I genuinely don't understand why that's not an option in the first place. I guess you could argue people could use it to cheese bosses or something but honestly i don't really think that matters anyway. I'd just like the ability to pause because life happens and i don't want to lose progress and die. and also my finger joints are killing me please let me take a breather for the love of god

-Enemies move WAY too quickly. There's difficult, and then there's just unfair, and the movement speed of most of the enemies in the game lean more toward the latter. the minchrooms, for example, are basically inescapable unless you're constantly sprinting, but the SECOND you go to attack, they catch right back up to you. I'm going to use Kaluuz' battle as an example again, because the appearance of the poltergeists and miasmas in the latter half of the fight are incredibly frustrating. poltergeists have an insane reach with their scythe, meaning you have to constantly be dashing away and using up your stamina.

-Some of the basic (non-boss) enemies are also needlessly huge. I get that it's to distinguish them from weaker enemies, but you could just as easily keep them a similar size and the color palettes will differentiate them well enough. Slimes and slimeks are okay, but the hellsludge enemies in the catacombs are RIDICULOUSLY big, and the game always seems to trap you in a heavily confined space with them. Their ear attack reaches way too far to even be considered REMOTELY fair, especially when they take up a fifth of the space you're stuck in!

This next bit is a VERY small nitpick, but height adjustments should come with an inverse-scaling jump height, imo. I've played a character at max height, and a character at a significantly shorter height, and the taller character has a definite advantage when it comes to being tall enough to grasp a ledge when jumping. I think making smaller characters jump higher and vice-versa would help even this out a little

I know my review seems a little contradictory, since I still HIGHLY recommend playing, but I'm only so harsh with my critique because I want it to be even better than it already is.

Onto the negative:

[*]A confusing UI with a lot of windows to open to find what you want, especially regarding quests, there's about three r four different ways to look at them. 
[*]Real money trading auction house, because it worked so well for Diablo. 
[*]Open World PvP zones and PvP focused endgame. You know how this goes, one guild/group/nationality dominates while everyone fights for scraps, it's how it always goes on these things. 
[*]Back and forth quests, the desert questing is awful in areas, having you run back and forth countless times for simple quests.

Ultimately, it's a game that hasn't learnt anything from failing predecessors and continues to try and make an ultimately PvP focused experience work, with PvE tacked on like an afterthought. While not realising, in MMORPGs and games in general, except for exceptions, and usually the loud minority, players don't spend most of their time in PvP. Take Age of empires for example, Age of Empires 4 was built for PvP, but AOE2 is still more popular? why? because it has extensive options for offline play. 

Though..I'm probably gonna keep playing up to level 50 and see what the game has to offer then, though given how limited PvE feels, I won't be playing for long.","Mixed68% of the 51,674 user reviews for this game are positive.",spent struggling recommend pretty movement fluid control combat simple surprising depth combo battle pas awful enjoy onto negative quest bugged preventing progress others confusing text leaf running circle confusing ui window open especially regarding quest three r four different way real trading auction house worked diablo open world versus zone versus focused endgame go guild group nationality dominates fight scrap go thing forth quest desert questing awful area forth countless time simple quest olist learnt failing predecessor continues versus focused versus environment tacked afterthought not_realising mmorpgs game general except exception usually loud minority player spend versus age empire example age empire 4 built versus aoe2 popular extensive option play probably gon na 50 offer given limited versus environment feel long

1203620,Enshrouded,"A amazing game filled with adventure and potential. I really enjoyed this game as i played. I hope this game continues to grow. I don't know if the game devs are listening but if they are this is what the game needs:
1. More life: for examples more NPCs that are in the world. Maybe add a caravan or a traveling merchant, also more cities filled with survivors  that found a way to survive the horror of the Shroud. Maybe add a function were random people hear about you accomplishment destroying the shrouds roots and want to come to you settlement and if they come there they will could build too and wonder the settlement.
2. Increase the level cap to 100. You reach the level cap too quickly and once you reach it some people don't feel motivated to continue to play. 
3. More loot, more loot, more loot. The more loot the better. There is a lot already but as a gamer to the core more is better. It would be nice to be able to go to a random chest and find something no one has found before. As a gamer i want to feel the excitement to find the next thing. Nothing like finding a sword that actual feels like a real treasurer.
4. Mounts. This game would really benefit from this. I would love to find a baby dragon that i can raise that eventual becomes an adult that i can ride.
5. Companions. If your a single player it gets lonely in the Shroud. Can i have a dog, cat, person i saved from the Shroud, and so on.

1283700,SUPERVIVE,"Supervive is everything that got me into gaming in the first place—chaos, hype moments, and the kind of fun that makes you want to play with friends all night. If you're a fan of games that mix action with strategy, you’ll love this one. As someone who’s usually frustrated by battle royales that either drag on with endless down time or explode into complete mayhem, Supervive strikes the perfect balance.

What makes Supervive stand out is how it seamlessly blends all the best parts of games we love. Whether you're brawling, farming, lockpicking, fishing, cooking, flying, spying, or just going full-on “fuck it, we ball” , there’s never a dull moment. The pacing is spot on, offering both the thrill of combat and the satisfaction of building your strategy—no more waiting around for the action to kick in.

What really sells it, though, is how fucking deep the strategy can go. It's the kind of game you can build mastery in, but also one where you can just turn off your brain and have an absolute blast with your squad. Whether you’re getting together with friends for a serious run or just screwing around for fun, Supervive gives you the freedom to enjoy both sides.

I cannot recommend this game enough. If you’re looking for something you can grind in, but also want to share epic, hilarious moments with your crew, this is your game. Jump in, let loose, and let Supervive show you what it means to truly have fun in a game.","Very Positive89% of the 2,849 user reviews for this game are positive.",gaming chaos hype moment kind fun make play friend night fan game mix action strategy love someone usually frustrated battle royales drag endless explode complete mayhem strike perfect balance make stand seamlessly blend best part game love brawling repeatedly defeating enemy completing task gain resource lockpicking fishing cooking flying spying fuck ball never_a dull moment pacing spot offering thrill combat satisfaction building strategy no_more waiting action kick sell fucking deep strategy kind build mastery turn brain absolute blast squad friend serious screwing fun give freedom enjoy side cannot_recommend grind share epic hilarious moment crew loose mean truly fun

[i] The game is good and enjoyable, however it can be both recommended and not. [/i]

The Sims 4"" builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessors, refining the gameplay mechanics and introducing new features that enhance the player's ability to create and control virtual lives. The game allows players to create and control virtual characters, build and furnish homes, and guide their Sims through various life stages and experiences.

[h2] Mechanics and Design [/h2]
The game retains the core gameplay mechanics of the series, allowing players to create and customise virtual characters, build and furnish homes, and guide their Sims through various life stages and experiences. 

[h3] Emotions System [/h3]
Another significant addition is the Emotions system, which adds depth and complexity to the Sims' behaviour and interactions. Sims can now experience a wide range of emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and embarrassment, which are influenced by their environment, social interactions, and personal traits. 

[h3] Building [/h3]
A central aspect of the sim's franchise experience is the building mechanics, which allow players to design, construct, and customise their Sims' homes and community lots. 

One of the most notable improvements is introducing the room-based building system. This system allows players to create and manipulate individual rooms as modular units, making rearranging and modifying structures easier without requiring extensive reconstruction. This feature streamlines the building process and encourages experimentation. Thus, players can quickly test different layouts and configurations with minimal effort.

Another significant enhancement is the addition of the Build Mode catalogue, which offers a vast array of objects, materials, and decorative items for players to choose from. The catalogue is organised into intuitive categories and features a search function, making it easier for players to find and select the necessary items. This extensive selection of building and furnishing options enables players to create highly detailed and personalised environments that reflect their Sims' personalities, lifestyles, and aspirations.

Moreover, the game's vibrant modding community further enriches the building mechanics, which has produced a wealth of custom content, ranging from unique architectural elements to entire pre-built lots. This user-generated content expands the game's creative possibilities. It allows players to incorporate diverse styles and designs into their creations.

However, the building mechanics in ""The Sims 4"" have limitations. Some players have expressed frustration with the lack of certain features, such as the ability to create curved walls or split-level structures, which were available in previous iterations of the series. Additionally, the game's reliance on DLC and microtransactions mean that access to certain building materials and objects may be restricted for players who do not wish to make additional purchases.

[h2] DLCs: Locking and Monetisation Strategies [/h2]
In previous iterations of the series, certain features and content were included in the base game or expansion packs, providing players with a more comprehensive experience without additional purchases. However, ""The Sims 4"" has adopted a more aggressive monetisation strategy, with numerous expansion packs, game packs, and stuff packs that collectively add to a significant financial investment for players wishing to access the full range of content. This has led to concerns about the game's reliance on downloadable content (DLC) and microtransactions, which can be seen as a barrier to entry for players with limited financial resources.

This form of microtransactions has been criticised for several reasons. Firstly, it can be seen as a form of artificial content scarcity. Once part of the core experience, features and content are now gated behind additional purchases. This can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among players, who may feel that they are being unfairly charged for content that should have been included in the base game.

Secondly, this monetisation strategy raises concerns about the potential normalisation of microtransactions in the gaming industry, as it may encourage other developers and publishers to adopt similar practices. [b]And I guarantee this practice will be the same if the Sims 5 ever comes out. [/b]This could shift towards a more fragmented and costly gaming landscape, where players are increasingly expected to pay for additional content to enjoy a complete and fulfilling experience.

It is important to critically evaluate these monetisation strategies and consider their implications for the gaming industry and player experience. While developers and publishers have a legitimate need to generate revenue to sustain their operations and continue producing high-quality games, it is essential to balance financial viability and provide a fair, accessible, and enjoyable experience for players. By supporting more ethical and consumer-friendly monetisation practices, players can help to shape a more sustainable and equitable gaming landscape for all.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
""The Sims 4"" offers a unique and engaging virtual life simulation experience, building upon the foundations laid by its predecessors and introducing new features that enhance the player's ability to create and control virtual lives. The game's strengths lie in its emphasis on creativity, self-expression, and storytelling and its efforts to improve accessibility and inclusivity. However, I cannot recommend buying the game due to EA's monetisation strategy, but it is a ""fine"" game. [b] However, if you ever want to go out to sea, you can easily find everything unlocked in that vast ocean.

427520,Factorio,"The game is a never ending stream of satisfaction, while still getting to use your brain to its fullest with gameplay never getting old, ever.

It's an endless pursuit of building, unlocking, crafting, improving, and always trying to make your productions more efficient/faster/bigger/higher yielding, all while having to constantly protect yourself and all your carefully crafted constructions and manufacturing lines from the Zerg whose numbers seem to keep increasing. You can never, ever forget to continue to keep up with defense and weapon tech or you'll slowly become overwhelmed over time.

You've played many games with systems that sound like this, but honestly nothing compares to this game. It's on another level and still manages to be extremely fun.

You'll always want to be more efficient with your building and manufacturing not for the sake of being efficient because who really cares honestly, but because you need MORE THINGS FASTER! EVERYTHING, MORE! NOW! When your inefficient hastily thrown together setup is becoming bottlenecked in various places and thus isn't making your flying robots nearly fast enough to satisfy your deep, angry hunger to see what the robots actually look like in action, it'll send you on a quest to improve each step of your manufacturing setup over several hours where you'll forget you were even making robots to begin with. From the outside you may see ""tedious"", but when you're on the inside, it's ""adventure"". You discover yourself what you need to do to fix one problem, one at a time without even meaning to. Endless discovery.

Highly recommend playing with a group of friends. After 15 hours or so you really start to get a real sense of what it must be like to run a company or manufacturing plant with so many moving parts. Get enough people together in a server and I'm sure you could simulate the insanity that is managing the LHC.

You make a server with 3-4 friends.
One friend decides to set up Iron Plate production and mining while everyone is off doing other things.
After 10 hours, you realize you've always had a steady supply of Iron Plates, Steel Plates, and Copper Plates coming in to help you build your chemical plants and batteries, but you really have no idea how the Plates are being made or are even getting to you. All you know is your friend would occasionally ask if you needed some, so he would bring you materials in the form of a conveyor belt whose path you would modify to fit into your automation you're working on, and it's working very well! You're well on your way to making robots..... But never mind how all these materials are getting to me from my friend.. How did I learn to make robots in the first place?

You realize your other friend has been unlocking new technology all this time with a lab setup, so you go to check it out and discover he has spent all this time setting up an automated lab researching process with 3 different products all being automatically manufactured and poured into the labs.. And guess what's being fed down there as well? Your other friends Plates, and your own Batteries and other things (since he needed some and you were like, oh I won't just give you some batteries, I'm going to give you an entire endless line of batteries). All while another friend has been managing a conveyor belt full of coal that circles every piece of equipment that uses coal, thus keeping all the machines operational, and loops back around for excess, where it is periodically stored into containers. And managing electricity grids. And turrets. Defenses. Exploring when you need more materials (stones, jfc). Killin Zerg any way you can... Or constantly trying to run away.

This is just the best. That's all it is. The best.

As far as Early Access goes, haven't had it crash once. Haven't run into any weird bugs yet.

Cons?

Only one. In multiplayer, the entire game pauses and waits for the person joining to download the map before resuming. If the person joining has a very low download speed, this usually equates to a having enough time to make a sandwich and some coffee for the group. A smoke break if that's your thing. Not too much of a bad thing really, but it would be great if the game could continue to function while the new player downloaded the map.

We are.. 20 hours in or so into our map? And I still don't think we're anywhere near being able to build a rocketship. But we do finally have little flying robots repairing our base now!","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 156,951 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"In Dead By Daylght, each game consists of 4 survivors and one killer. Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening the two doors. Killers must chase after the survivors and sacrifice them. Survivors and killers are able to use perks, objects in the environment, add-ons and offerings that help to give advantage within the game. Dead by Daylight is also quite similar to Deathgarden from the same developer. It features a hunter that is trying to incapacitate & kill runners.

With over 300 hours in the game so far, I can honestly say it's one of my favorites. Lets start off by saying that this game isn't going to be for everyone. If you're the type of person to get salty, then chances are this game will make you extremely mad at some point. Yes, any game can make someone rage, but in Dead By Daylight, the salt is real. Almost like League of Legends, maybe even more. 

If you're a killer, survivors will body block, pallet loop, pallet stun you, flashlight(Blind) you, hold you hostage(hiding and never leaving) and ragequit. If you're a survivor, killers will lag switch, face camp(not moving from you while you are hooked), slug, or focus you(most call it tunneling). Both sides have OP perks that the other side thinks is unfair, and if you main killer, you'll have to face groups of friends that are all communicating in discord which puts you at a big disadvantage. 

Also, I wouldnt say its neccessary, but it is very recomended to have headphones. Whether you are the killer or a survivor. You will want to hear those footstepds, crows, survivors breathing, heartbeats, etc. Sound will play an important role in how you play. 

Unfortunetly, if you are here for a true horror game, you might want to look somewhere else. The initial scariness wears off pretty fast. The jump scares are still there though. Especially with Myers and Amanda. 

Might not be heartstoppingly scary, but If you like being startled and fancy a solid challenge, this game is great.

238960,Path of Exile,"This game can't be beat right now. Free to play, and what Diablo 3 should have been. Steep learning curve due to the game being so customizable with builds and the vast amounts of currency and items. This means you might actually have to learn something for once instead of having the game spoon fed to you like Diablo 3. Just get it and stop waiting for Diablo 3 to be this game. There are 3 websites that you need to know so that you can hit the ground running. 1) PoE Wiki 2) Poe.Trade 3)Currency.poe.trade

The wiki site is for learning about generally how the game works. The Poe.Trade is a legitimate website that you use the same way the Auction House in WoW works. People can have a custom stash tab that they can market their items in. Then their items show up on this website. So it makes it real easy to just do a simple search for the item you want, and it will populate the closest match from someone who is Online right now that you can trade with. The Currency.poe.trade is the website you need to use to see what the going rate is for currency in the game. For example, there is no gold, so you will get drops in the game that do various things like upgrade a normal item to a rare item. The main thing to trade is Chaos Orbs which you can think about as Stone of Jordans from Diablo 2. In the trade channel within the game, when someone has an item for trade, they will say ""Winds of Change Gloves : 1c"" This means they are selling the gloves for 1c which is 1 chaos orb. You can get chaos orbs from anywhere just like all of the other currency (monster drop, treasure chest, boss drop, etc.) You can also trade multiple lower quality forms of currency for a chaos orb like ""Jeweler's Orb 9 : 1c"" That means I want to trade 9 Jeweler's Orbs for 1 Chaos orb.

I hope that helps you get started. Check out Youtube videos on current builds that are effective and that you might like to play. Follow their guides for where to spend your passive points and you should be good to go. Trade your stuff for Chaos orbs, when you get enough, buy gear for your build with them. Also, get a loot filter. Tons of items drop on the ground, most will not be a) of use and b) of value. I use NeverSink's itemfilter from the GitHub site. Go to ""releases"", download the latest Source Code version and extract the contents to your Documents > My Games > Path of Exile > folder. Then within the game you can choose the filter from your Settings > UI > Loot Filter drop down. The loot filter doesn't show crap/less value items when they drop and instead will only show good items and will also play a subtle sound everytime something decent drops.

Peace!

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"I've loved MTG since first playing almost 30 years ago and I've had some enjoyment playing Arena as well. While it's no substitute for playing the game in person, I like to jump on and touch base with where the game is going once a year or so. However, I've felt something was off with the shuffling system throughout the majority of my experiences with Arena. I finally lifted the rock off of my head recently and engaged in some internet research. Sure enough, there was an overabundance of players that made claims to rigging with the shuffling-as well as with other aspects of the game. While there isn't any concrete evidence to support the claims, I've encountered enough ridiculous phenomena of my own that seem to anything other than ""organic"" or random. So, I'm empathetic with their whining-er-complaints. Another (major) complaint of mine is that the meta is very restrictive. I wish there was more care taken with card design to allow for a wider degree of meta. I started a few deck ideas of my own and then began tweaking them as I went along. In an attempt to make them more competitive, they inevitably began to resemble meta. This was counterintuitive to my goals of somehow creating competitive decks that fall outside the meta. Probably a foolish endeavor on my part. Nonetheless, as my decks were pulled closer to meta I began to run out of crafting materials and realized the need to venture into purchasing gems. And that's where the adventure stops for me. Maybe I sound cynical, but I feel there are some game designers a hell of a lot smarter than I am that did a terrific job of leading me straight to that pay door. I simply refuse to enter. For me, I will look forward to visiting with some old friends once or twice a year to draft from a cube. Playing the game in it's purest form is a joy to me. And I guess that's why I'm logging this review. For those of you who haven't had the privilege of playing in person I encourage you to go find a gathering place local to you-if possible.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"Ahhh Helldivers 2... 

I'll start by saying I obviously have enjoyed the game, I've got over 100 hours in it so there is absolutely something there, at least there was.

The developers don't really seem to have any ability to listen to the player base as every update that comes out makes the game less fun. I don't pay attention to the ""meta"" and I don't even really bother with the highest difficulty level, but they have nerfed pretty much every weapon to the point that it doesn't FEEL good to use any of them. Every weapon now feels low impact, with limited ammunition. 

That, and there are multiple technical issues introduced every update. My controller has stopped working at random with the latest patch.

2300320,Farming Simulator 25,"My biggest complaint about this game is that the shop menu doesn't have a garage section where you can see your owned vehicles. I took me about 5 minutes to figure out what equipment i spawned with and how much horsepower and capacity the vehicles had. The new way to check what you own is to go to the vehicles tab in the menu which tells you what you own, but doesn't specify the horse power or the capacity. I don't know who thought this was a good idea. There is also no easy way to go back to the shop menu from that menu either.

Another complaint is that the cruise control max speed number doesn't change when you switch from KPH to MPH. This is ridiculous. Everything else everyone is complaining about such as the stuttering, screen flickering, and just unstableness of the game are also true and all happen. I have a 7950x3D and a 4090. I maxed the settings at 1440p. I shouldn't be only using 35% of my GPU and 10% of my CPU and only getting an unstable 60fps.

I also forgot to mention, the new flashlight is bad. It's too far away and doesn't give enough light and it stays on the screen even after you turn it off. The new ai workers also don't work perfectly which is to be expected, but this was a feature that they were hyping.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"I really loved the game when it came out. Totally new experiences, a player-centric design approach, and an underdog studio sticking it to the rest of the industry. Well except Sony.
The game was small then but to be expected; the intention of the developers was to create an evolving gameplay experience and narrative. 

6 Months later and the game is plummeting in quality.
A few new enemies and environments to fight in are great, but there are always new game breaking bugs popping up. 

The development team has a problem with control over all aspects of gameplay; 
1. Obsession with balancing, disrupting preferred play styles and in many cases creating bugs
2. Progression is a joke. You are capped at a very low limit on resources you can find. You can grind away to level 150 for absolutely no reason. 
3. Armor customization has so much potential, but I dislike Arrowhead's decision to make armor sets not color customizable. Different armors give different stats, which means that I have to look wear a certain one and look a certain way if I want those benefits. This player would rather wear the armor that looks the coolest, without any drawbacks

1085660,Destiny 2,"4,000 hours later, i decided to finally say my peace on Destiny 2.

As someone who loves Bungie's halo games and has stuck with the Destiny series since the D1 beta, Destiny 2 has been an actual roller coaster of commitment. It can be the best experience you've received in gaming, or feel like a collossal waste of time. The management of this current day Bungie is killing any remaining amount of hope I have for Destiny's future. I genuinely wish I could give a mixed rating for Destiny 2. I don't want to downvote it because i don't actually think the game is utter garbage, it's quite good in how it feels to shoot the guns in this game, use abilities, and experiment with the deep buildcrafting system the game has to offer. The storytelling(for the most part) is captivating and interesting, and endgame activities like raids and dungeons are experiences worth sharing with friends. But on the other end, the corpa end, lies the games flaws. The monetization has gotten extremely out of hand. While the game is free to play(closer to a free trial), you must buy expansions and episodes to acquire more content to play. The game also has dungeon keys, event passes, and a whole heap of store items that can be bought individually. It is disgusting how far this has gone and it's increasingly hard to convince any friends that the game isn't horrible every time Bungie adds to the overwhelmingly negative stigma surrounding the game's media 24/7. The community has also taken a pretty hefty nose dive from everything that has happened and you can't really blame them, some of these people play destiny 10 hours a day so at least you're doing better than them. While the most recent expansion, The Final Shape, was a great conclusion to the saga and a well received product, the content that followed the expansion is so middling, it isn't worth sticking around until another big hit comes along. I'm just tired, of all of it. The poor business decisions, the monetization, the aura of negativity, it just can't be healthy to stay in this space as long as some people do. I can ONLY recommend this game if you are going in with a group of friends and if you're able to snag some expansions on discount. I recommend you just focus on having fun with your friends in a bubble, ignore anyone telling you what you should be using or how you should be playing. Play through the stories, get loot, buildcraft, play through raids and dungeons together. Don't buy event passes or eververse items. Don't take the pvp seriously.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1]Elden Ring: A Monumental Open World Masterpiece[/h1]
Elden Ring is a fantastic masterpiece that serves as a template for what excellent writing, gameplay, and environment design can feel like when done in great detail and when these elements interconnect and feed each other. No other game is as challenging, fun, and addictive as this title; Miyazaki and his team have truly outdone themselves with this entry in their list of soul games. 

[h1]A World Awaits[/h1]
If you ask me if Elden Ring is a hard game, it is not, and the same applies to all Dark Souls titles as well. The best word to describe these games is ""authenticity,"" as enemies offer a challenge based on what they are. Yes, a Dragon shooting a fireball will hurt, but it is a dragon, so it has to hurt. Otherwise, it would be a joke with wings. If there is something one can learn from these games, everything matters. For example, the number of enemies is a reasonable challenge, while three or four can be a quick death.

As its heart, Elden Ring demands precision, commitment, and patience. While an enemy in the open might be easy to deal with, the same enemy in a different zone, such as a close corridor, can become a nightmare. The player has a lot of options in what they can do, from their builds, where they progress their character and watch it grow, unlike in any other game, but in how they will approach a fight or a challenge that is in their way. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3303604272

It is a game where bosses are more on the offensive guide than previous titles. You can enter the fog gate, and they are already springing towards you. FromSoftware has outdone itself in some spectacular fights, such as Malekith, where having a berserk-inspired boss with a giant sword that can jump into the air and throw slashes at you is not only a fight that makes you tremble with excitement and fear but also a graphical show of how the team has come a long way in animations and boss design. To experience defeat and try again is the means to become an Elden lord.

[h1]Soulsborne Meets Open World[/h1]
Elden Ring's shift to an open world from the secluded areas of previous installments enhances its best quality: exploration. As you traverse the vast, intimidating landscapes, the world of Elden Ring comes alive. You can feel that you're not supposed to be there, but like a mouse that sneaks into a kitchen, you push forward, discovering secrets and facing fearsome foes. This sense of adventure is at the heart of Elden Ring.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3303603901

The enviroments being so varied not only visually but also in their layouts give each zone a distinct sense to it. The emotion you feel as you fight foes and the relief when you get to that next grace means that knowing where to go or not knowing where to go changes your experience with the game. Lakes with water that could drown you, giant islands with tornadoes, a volcanic manor, or ancient flooded cities are just some of what Elden Ring offers to those who dare to venture into the Lands Between.

[h1]A Triumph of Worldbuilding[/h1]
George R.R. Martin's influence is evident in the game's intricate lore and complex characters. I beat just the core game, but I was distracted by side quests from other characters. That quest became compelling and a facet of the game where I enjoyed progressing them and discovering what would happen to the characters living in the Elden Ringworld. Blaidd, for example, is a cool werewolf with a compelling story, while The Witch Ranni is a fan favorite, and her quest will take you to incredibly secret zones.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3303603449

The game is also full of secrets, as I stated before, but the quantity of these secrets is so absurd that I beat the game three times by now across PS5, Series X, and now PC, and I keep finding new stuff I didn't see before. To my shame, it took me three times to realize the game has a crafting system...haha. One can play Elden Ring, beat it, and replay it, and they will have an experience that is still extraordinarily fresh and wonderful. It is a colossal success to fit so much in one game and keep the magic of what makes it special and able to last in the long term.


[h1]Multiplayer: a Blessing and a Curse.[/h1]
Regarding multiplayer, the game can be fun to play with friends but suffers from it a bit. Co-op can make boss fights into a joke, while invasions can sometimes be annoying when you invade someone, and they proceed to do a 1 VS 3. The core experience is to play alone and use co-op when stuck in a fight, but there is also freedom to play in any way. In a way, Elden Ring misses those fights in Dark Souls 3, where bosses were supposed to be able to take three players at the same time.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Elden Ring is a masterpiece that redefines the genre of open-world games—a title where all elements of the experience are worked to perfection and have no weak spots. A must-play for all gamers, whether a seasoned souls-borne veteran or a newcomer to the series, you own it to yourself to try this game and seek the unforgettable journey that Elden Ring offers. Be prepared to face challenges, frustration, discovery, adventure, and triumph.

1643320,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"Alright, I've plate Soc and CoP, and of course gamma. I feel like this game just, isn't worth the jank at the moment. By that I mean The amount of performance issues would be forgivable, if every every element of what i want in stalker was there, but its just not. so without further ado:

The good:
-The world and environment is on point. incredible recreation of the zone, looks and feels gorgeous
-gunplay, as in, ""how guns fire"" is nice and gritty and sloppy but still feels modern and useful. 
-horror element is actually pretty good (minus some caveats I'll explain in the negatives).
-radio music really good
-anomolies are much improved imo
-vibe (some caveats)
-new weapon wheel pretty useful
-when working, I'd still say its fun.

The Bad
-I'm going to put performance here. some would say its ""the ugly"" but I can get over some jank. MOST of the time, I get alright frames with DLSS and frame gen.  about 50-85. The first main hub town however, I am constantly stuck at 8-10 frames lol. Makes the part of the game that's supposed to feel like a respite from the zone just feel obnoxious, especially showing up encumbered with loot, just for trade menus to lag constantly. couple this with occasional fog glitches and textures not rendering, as well as pop in, and its a real ruiner of immersion. sure old games looked janky, but they were consistently playable and consistently the same level of jank. This is inconsistent. 
-The UI. Its atrocious. I put it here however as UI is not a complete L to me. But the UI in this just seems like some stock unreal engine garbage. I attempted turning it all off but encountered 2 issues. 1 being you cant check health in your inv like in the other games, so turning off the UI literally leaves you with no way to view your health. 2, You can't turn off the stupid loot highlighting. This is by far the most egregious (to me) of all the UI elements. I like going into a room and searching. now you just have a bunch of clutter on screen that makes you play and search like a robot. just walk in, spam f, get out. No real perception needed on your part. and this leads into my next point which highlights this issue further:
-lack of clutter loot. so far, 95% of what i find laying around is bandages and medkits. There simply isn't as much variation in loot, which combines with the UI tag to making looting feel less cluttery and sorty and more just ""pick up health/ammo for next fight.""
-food demands feel pointless. I have/had such an overabundance of food the hunger mechanic just feels pointless and unrewarding.
-difficulty levels. I put this here rather than in ""ugly"", because in spite of it really irritating me, I can respect the fact stalker anomoly/gamma aimed to be as modular and blank template as possible in regards to difficulty, whereas this may aim to be a more curated experience. nonetheless the difficulty levels between normal and veteran remind me of bethesda difficulty complaints. stalker (normal) just feels not hardcore at all, and veteran is just bullet sponge enemies. a flesh creature takes like a whole ak mag to take out, and humans, while not nearly as bad, don't feel realistic with the number of shots it takes. Just overall feels worse than the original games difficulty.

The Ugly:
-right off the rip the worst thing to me is the bad AI/ lack of A-life. Sometimes the AI combat is good in terms of flanking, however the cover of AI is awful. And as plenty of other reviews state, there is no A-life mechanic. Enemies just spawn in and don't loot other enemies, unlike in other stalkers where there is a whole world occurring separate from your intervention. On higher difficulty this can result in really stupid unfair deaths, but mainly is just immersion breaking and feels cheap and shallow. ESPECIALLY when you see them spawn in. Results in firefights where there's no real planning you can do, no retreat points or cover, and enemies sometimes just walk at you. Haven't gotten a sniper rifle yet, but it does make me wonder if sniping is even possible when enemies wont spawn that far out, and they spawn randomly.
-light level. I like dark nights. I really do. But 2 issues cause mega problems with night in this game. one is your flashlight sucks and isn't helpful at all, and trying to get it to a point where it is helpful, just results in not needing a flashlight at night. 2 is it can be pitch black and you can't see, but enemies can. died alot just trying to locate enemies with guns 20 yards in front of me that magically see me. an unhappy medium where it FEELS like the game is intended to be dark at night, but was not balanced around that in mind.
-stupid pointless UE5 ass generic ass dying light ass dialogue options. I hate games that make you have conversations when there's no real reason to. conversation just feels like a huge chore, and like this stupid dated mechanic developers throw in because they feel like its expected of them. You basically have 2 options that lead to the same outcome, or the ""find out more"" option, that then leaves you with the other two options you had anyway lol.
-stupid auto lean system that you cant turn off. There is a peak and lean control option, however theres also an annoying forced lean system when you are close to cover that screws your camera all up and gets you killed. Not only is this shitty to play with, but just really irks me because it feels like some stock UE5 mechanic they kept in just cuz. At worst it screws up your gun fights, and at best its totally redundant with your ability to independently lean. and you CANT TURN IT OFF! WHY!!!!

All in all, I think when its optimized, it will be a fun game. However, I don't think it will be a stalker game in the old sense. the physical world vibe is there, but the awful AI, awful UI, and the stupid UE5 sheen on everything just takes me out of it. so basically (if i get my refund) I might rebuy when its fixed, knowing it will be more or less fun. And if the game was just straight up oldschool stalker, but better, I'd just power through the bugs.

There's also a lack of engaging endgame content with limited dungeon clears (3 per day), forcing players to either wait for RNG or pay to progress.

230410,Warframe,"A prime (ehhehe) example of free to play done right. With a constant stream of content, intimate developer and community relations, and a player driven economy based on a tradable and therefore entirely unnecessary to purchase premium currency, as far as free to play games go, it really doesn't get better than Warframe.

Now, as far as gameplay goes... It's fast, and it's grindy. There's not much more to it than that. You'll be constantly doing missions to get drops, often the same ones over and over again, with a secondary goal generally being to do it as fast as possible, all so that you can get various item drops to make other weapons and frames to do it all over again. It doesn't really sound great spelled out like that, but it really is.

2344520,Diablo® IV,"EDIT: D4 bad, still the case in Season 4. 

The ""loot rework"" made the game go from absolutely awful to below-average. It's still super underdeveloped, boring, bland and significantly inferior to Hero Siege, Last Epoch, Grim Dawn and PoE. Itemisation is still utter trash, skills and builds are shallow and the progression lacks any excitement. What I mean to say here is that Diablo IV is actual LEAGUES behind the competition, with a bunch of absolutely clueless developers at the helm. These guys have zero idea as to how to design a satisfying ARPG. And these same devs are now pushing out a 40$ DLC.


ORIGINAL REVIEW - still no changes here. After a year in development, the game still sucks.

The game is below industry standards. Systems are basic and boring, while the overall variety you get from season to season is nonexistent. Gearing sucks. They clearly have no idea what they're doing to such a degree that it's mind-boggling that someone is paying them to do their job. Season 3 is the worst season design I have ever seen, and I played through a lot of garbage seasons in PoE.
On the upside, sound and graphics are nice and ability design is cool. If you want a solid ARPG to sink your teeth into, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a short-term experience, there are better games for that.
I enjoyed levelling my first character and was very optimistic, only to find out later that all classes are basically rinse and repeat of the same mechanics with very little variety to them. Very disappointing.

1085660,Destiny 2,"What was a good game has now turned into a dlc purchase simulator. This is NOT a free game and should not be advertised as such. Everything that was free before got removed from the game. No more base campaign, no nothing. Just to force you to buy the other campaigns. 

But wait there's more. 

You buy the expansion thinking you're ready to go. And it used to be like that. Not now. You now have to buy Dungeons that come out during that expansion. Yep. You have to pay to access content that should otherwise be already in the expansion. And then add season passes on top. 

So you pay full price for an expansion. What you get is a campaign. And a new zone. But then, the rest of the content coming throughout the expansion lifetime costs extra. New dungeons? Extra. All the other story bits? Season pass. Absolutely pathetic and horrible monetization.

Furthermore, they've removed most of the old conted from the beggining. The intro campaign? Deleted. Some of the first planets we had? Deleted. And many more.

If you want to know if you should try the game? There's no point. Without throwing your wallet at it you won't see much. As everything is paywalled.

2582560,EA SPORTS™ Madden NFL 25,"i originally was going to  give Madden 25 a thumbs down review due to the initial performance issues. 

however, after I restarted my PC and booted up the game again all the performance issues seemingly went away. It plays at a locked smooth frame rate consistently now, doesn't stutter, etc. There's a few bugs here and there but rarely gamebreaking.

Gameplay wise, this might be the best madden in years (not a high bar but still). The gameplay feels very responsive, realistic and smooth, doesn't feel cheesy, the run-game feels hella good, passing game feels great, the boomtech and new physics makes tackling and hitsticking much more satisfying, everything just feels really good and fun to play.

I played the 10 hour trial and decided to buy the early-access (at a discounted rate) because I was able to tell that I'd be playing this a lot and I didn't feel like waiting for release. That's how much fun I was having truthfully. Also, it's crossplay so I'm going to be playing with my console friends.

tread lightly though, this game runs just fine on my rig but as you can tell in the other steam reviews that might not be the case for you.

1845910,Dragon Age™: The Veilguard,"If you never touched Dragon Age games before, this game is ok at best. If you played DA games before, the main story is great, the environment design is great. Literally everything else is a step in the wrong direction. 

 In a age where we have RPG""s like Baulders Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077 and many more, this is game proves that even AAA or AAAA games have their own tiers, and this one is a clear lower tier RPG compared to those.

Combat is engaging for the most part. Tho compared to previous titles of the series is the most simplified it has ever been. Im not far enough to tell you yet if the simplified combat will get boring, but I can definitely see it being so for some.

Main Story is by far the best part, specially if you are someone who played DA Inquisition.  Side quests tho are not nearly to the level they were in previous games. 

Companions, probably the worst part of the game. My main issue is how bland they all are. Each and every single one is so simple and lack complexity to the point they don't even seem like people. Their just 1 trope made into a character.  The only ones that are actually interesting and that I personally enjoy seeing and listening too are the recurring characters from the previous games.

The dialogue between companions is also the worst we have see in a DA game . DA was a series that used to be lauded for its companions and their banter with each other. In this one companion banter is simply there to tell you the Player what is going on. They only talk about things to ensure you the Player are not confused about where to go or what to do. It not there to make you more immersed into the world around them or add to their character depth. They are just constant tutorial voice, you need to pull this level, you need to face the statues this way. You need to find the powerstone thingy, or this fog is thick or why is to so quiet over and over,  tutorial speak, tutorial speak,  tutorial speak. I have a at least halfway developed brain, I can see the obvious you don't need to keep telling me.

2183900,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2","As a Warhammer fan, the art, the design, just everything pleasing to the eye

As a GAME, this game is overhyped and overpriced. Outdated gameplay that didn't innovate in any sense of the word. I'm disappointed that this was literally just sm1 with better graphics. The content is extremely lacking, 6 repetitive missions with repetitive gameplay to boot. It's better to buy on sale for those who don't wanna read everything.

- Story:
It's brief, generic, and forgettable. The plot is more generic slop comparable to a call of duty campaign so don't expect too much there. The story is effectively glaze central for the BLUEBERRIES then omg secret bad guy plot out of nowhere instead of Tyranids being the main focus, diverting from the more interesting developments that could've been. Wish there was more focus with the marines themselves instead of lol chaos again.

- Lack of various QoL options like FOV sliders.
Not enough graphics options to disable features like post processing effects or light sensitive features, Lack of support of  various monitors, Motion blur literally doesn't go off when you set it to off, the list goes on. The game can be a disco show at times, giving me headache on top of only being able to see my character's GIANT ASS cheeks lawd haf murthy.

- Clunky movement and unresponsive actions at times
Dodge is horribly delayed, not many ways to cancel out of animations.
There's these weird moments where you stand still thinking you'd dodge and you may say to yourself ""what i dodged what the heck"" well I'm here to tell you you're not CRAZY. The dodge is hard coded to buffer sprint as an action on PC, resulting into delay actions because of the buffer option select between dodge and sprinting. Extremely ass cheeks.

- Clunky Melee and Ranged Combat.
Aimming feels stiff due to the options for sens being so limited. But for the most part the clunkiness comes from how underpowered the weapons are. There's about 4 usable guns i can think of in my head. The sound design is lacking for some weapons and don't pack the resounding WALLOP that Bolter has in other games. Then the crosshair bloom just makes weapons feels so off and boorish that's not even worth shooting half the time cause you can't hit the board side of a barn. Melee which I was hoping to be different enough to entice ultimately falls short dude to the lack animation cancels for dodge and more. You end up parrying everything as much as possible for it is the only way to cancel, downside being you're standing still to get peppered by bullets. I hope it changes.

- Overly reliant on ""QTEs"" or executions or deadshots
Now that know this may not seem like an issue at first but when you realize these are the only ways to regen armor during combat it becomes glaring. It's cool to see the first 20 times but after 3 hours you'll wish there were introduce more ways to engage with regen. Standing still doing a cool animation with a camera interrupts the flow of gameplay and adds to the clunkiness of the game. The lack of ways to regain armor is astounding. THEY REALLY want you to abuse executions and deadshots as much as possible cause of the iframes executions give you. I wish the game would encourage aggressively slashing my enemies instead of having to watch an animation play for 500th time.

- Overly reliant on off screen indicators
This is the same problem i had with god of war 2018 where the fov was so low that had to see my characters HUGE ASS BACK. Constantly taking backshots from tyranids because i have to look at the funny circle around my character and press the button. It's lazy to me and makes combat feel unfocused.

- Difficulties are badly designed
One sentence, increasing health and damage and nothing is bad difficult design.
Bullet Sponges put people to sleep stop this shit. Really throws the balance out of whack.

- Content is lacking and the game is highly repetitive
I can't be bothered to play the same 6 missions over and over again that hardly vary enough to be noticable. There's not much to say because of the game not having content on release. The only way they tend to vary is ""place X amount of bombs"" objectives change the number of bomb. Again how is this game 60 bucks? 

I really wanted to like this game but it's just an outdated action game to me. 

I'm sleepy as shit when i made this review so i may have missed some points i wanted to make. But don't buy right now wait for sale.

EDIT 17/10/24: Yeah I'm done with this game.
 This roadmap is actually horrible.
 1 New mission when we only have 6 in the game is baffling. 1 new weapon is cool i guess. 

But the biggest kicker of the whole thing is the obvious malice against modding. They essentially killed modding this update. The only thing keeping the game on life support for me. I enjoyed cosplaying the deathwatch, using various weapons with different classes in pve, AND FINALLY HAVING FOV IN THE GAME, it was a good time. Instead of saber embracing this part of the community, they've effectively killed it off for good this time. Don't let the shills tell you this game is a good faith game. It's not. It's more marine slop core. I'm sure the designers and most devs were very passionate about making the game, but some of the higher ups definitely didn't understand the game's fanbase.","Very Positive80% of the 87,349 user reviews for this game are positive.",fan art design pleasing eye overhyped overpriced outdated innovate sense word disappointed literally sm1 graphic extremely lacking 6 repetitive mission repetitive boot sale wan na read brief generic forgettable plot generic slop comparable call duty series connected mission level form storyline expect effectively glaze central blueberry omg secret bad plot nowhere tyranids focus diverting interesting development wish focus marine lol chaos lack qol option fov slider not_enough graphic option disable feature post processing effect light sensitive feature lack support monitor motion blur literally set go disco time giving headache top able giant as cheek lawd haf murthy clunky movement unresponsive action time dodge horribly delayed not_many way cancel animation weird moment stand d_emphasizedodge dodged heck you_emphasized not_crazy dodge hard coded buffer sprint action pc resulting delay action buffer select dodge sprinting extremely as cheek clunky melee ranged combat aimming feel stiff due option sen limited clunkiness come underpowered weapon 4 usable gun sound design lacking weapon pack resounding wallop bolter game crosshair bloom make weapon feel boorish not_even worth shooting half cause board side barn melee hoping different entice fall short dude lack animation cancel dodge parrying possible cancel downside standing peppered bullet hope change overly reliant qtes execution deadshots not_seem issue realize way regen armor combat glaring cool 20 time 3 hour wish introduce way engage regen standing cool animation camera interrupt flow add clunkiness lack way regain armor astounding abuse execution deadshots possible cause iframes execution wish encourage aggressively slashing enemy watch an_emphasizedimation play 500th overly reliant screen indicator problem god war 2018 fov low character huge as constantly taking backshots tyranids funny circle press button lazy make combat unfocused difficulty badly designed sentence increasing health damage bad difficult design bullet sponge sleep shit throw balance whack lacking highly repetitive bothered play 6 mission hardly vary noticable not_much not_having release tend vary x bomb objective number bomb 60 buck wanted outdated action sleepy shit missed point wanted wait sale 17 10 24 yeah roadmap horrible 1 6 baffling 1 weapon cool guess biggest kicker obvious malice modding essentially killed modding keeping life support enjoyed cosplaying deathwatch weapon different class versus environment finally fov good saber embracing community effectively killed good shill good faith not_it slop core designer passionate higher ups definitely understand fanbase

3097560,Liar's Bar,"Great idea for a game, I like the character designs and the atmosphere and care that went into the bar itself.

However I'm really scratching my head on why AI voices were used in this game. At first I was under the impression that you could type and the AI voice would convert your text and that would be how you communicate in game. You could have fun banter between the characters and each game would be more unique...

1790600,DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO,"

Why Sparking Zero is good:
1) up to date roster
2) up to date graphics
3) combat mimics the anime perfectly (this cannot be overstated)
If this is all you care about, then I recommend it.

Why Sparking Zero is still trash overall (From someone who expected better):
1) It is missing content like extra game modes that were present in every other dragonball game dating back 20 years. Bonus Battle mode and scenario builder are good but older games had much more. there's no excuse for a game thats had this long to develop to be released with less content than games that would be considered ancient by today.

2) similar to the above, it's missing characters. while it does have newer up to date characters from Super, it's still missing the characters from the previous game BT3. Specifically it's missing all the Dragonball characters and GT characters Nuova and Eis which I expect to be released later.

3) The game costs $110 if you want the full game. And yes, in this case, this is literally what's happening. The game was released with characters already created (Beast Gohan and Orange Piccolo) yet they were specifically held back, despite being finished. So this isn't ""extra bonus content"" this is ""we already have this done but if you want it you gotta pay the real price"". And if you think there will only be 1 pass, you're a fool. The true full price for this title will be $200 before its sunset. You can argue thats a symptom of modern gaming, but if you're going to say this is BT4 then i'm going to count this as a strike against it for the purpose of being a true sequel rather than a cash grab.

4) Game was released in a poor state (this will be a collection of minor problems)
a) Damage Balancing: While I have no problem with 'balance' as far as the characters are concerned, I do have a problem with the sheer amount of damage the characters all deal as it relates to the health bars they have available. 1 single combo from Sparking into an Ult can deal 5 bars of health easily and i'm sure you could do more against someone that doesn't break the combo. You start with 3. this shouldn't be possible. Ults shouldn't do 3 bars of damage. I shouldn't be able to combo into 5 bars of damage. This isn't a ""SS4 Gogeta is OP"" so much as ""all characters need to have nerfed damage so that these fights can feel anime accurate, a fight shouldn't be over as soon as someone lands sparking mode 30 seconds into a match""

b) Lack of clarity: Missions are not clear what the objective is. You do not know how many enemies you are fighting until you clear the mission, so you don't know to what extent you have to ""try"" until you've beaten it. Missions should clearly indicate how many enemies you're up against so you know if its a ""go into sparking and start spamming because this is a 1v5 fight and there's no other reasonable way to win this situation"" or a ""oh its 1v1 so I can do melee only with no ki at all and just have fun"". Additionally, they do not indicate what the requirements are for the bonus missions. ""Beat the enemy fast"" is what almost all of them say, but how fast? And there's not always a voice cue to indicate when you took too long. Additionally, this is bad game design because it forces you to use the OP sparking->Ult combo to shred the enemy as fast as possible, there's no other way to clear these bonus objectives. Also, people have made so many threads about beating Jiren or Goku and not completing the story because the game just isn't clear that there's two paths and you did the wrong one. Game should be more clear.

c) Incomplete details:  Virtually no character interactions. Every character interaction can be seen in Zeno's menu, and its something like 60 or so. Thats pathetic. There's no reason you couldn't have people read a few more lines each, you wanted this game to be an anime accurate, anime immersive, but yet you couldn't find the budget to make characters have dialogue. Bardock has lines though, so thats good. But Gohan really got snubbed. I had something else for this but forgot while I was writing.

d) No sense of accomplishment: from unlocking all the items by spending Zeni you got from the dragonballs or winning a fight because you ult'd in the first 30 seconds, theres no real sense of accomplishment in this game as its all so trivial. I have to handicap myself so that I feel like I actually did something. I can't even use super attacks because it feels like its cheating, as it trivializes the entire experience when the fight is half over the moment you stop pushing square and decide to push L2 for a change. Even the missions that are difficult do not leave me feeling accomplished because I only beat them by using the only tactic thats viable in a 1v4 or 1v5 which is to rely on sparking mode, as you cannot possibly win these fights otherwise, and i say that as a melee main. 

e) Bulma


tl;dr I think its a fun game, nice to look at, if you don't care too much then its great, I recommend it.

1203620,Enshrouded,"It ain't perfect, but for early access it's pretty dang good. I like how progress is tied to exploring the picturesque landscape. The world is huge and well designed, full of lovingly crafted areas and structures. Traversal can be a little janky but there's a lot of freedom. It is very fun to jump, glide, grapple and dig your way around. The joy of exploration is often its own reward.

If I had to complain, this game does suffer a little from open world copy/paste repetition. Some bosses are reused in different areas, and though there are sometimes differences in their abilities I think something as simple as giving them unique skins would do a lot to help make the encounters more distinct.

Overall I'd say its a good thing that Enshrouded leaves me wanting more, it's been a long time since I've played a game that keeps me coming back as much as this one.","Very Positive85% of the 53,278 user reviews for this game are positive.",perfect player purchase play official release pretty dang good progress tied exploring picturesque landscape world huge designed lovingly crafted area structure traversal janky freedom fun glide grapple dig joy exploration reward complain suffer open world copy paste repetition boss reused different area difference ability simple giving unique skin help encounter distinct good leaf wanting long keep
1063730,New World: Aeternum,"I was one of those hyped people that started right when New World launched...back then, once past the queues, i had the time of my life in a mmorpg. The server start was amazing, many people looking for fun. Despite all that people said, I actually enjoyed the leveling, but I am kind of a grinder in every game so dont take my word for granted in that case :D I stopped playing after a couple of weeks like a lot of people because of all the bugs and exploits, especially the duping exploits gave me the rest and i quit. I didnt want to play a game, where the market was basically done.

A friend of mine started playing again and he actually managed to convince me to try the game again a week ago. And i am so surprised...positively! The servers got merged so there are tons of players on the one we ended up with automatically (we can still change if we want for free) and they are insanely active!

(or expedition :P) All the Storages are accessable from every town storage so no BS travelling around with goods anymore.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"I wanna start by saying Sims is always a classic. Each game they make improvements and there is always a level of enjoyment creating a false reality to live in. Even then, though, some key features are taken away for no reason (example color grids for anything rather than just makeup.) This game is just generally a good example of the EA way.

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"Wait for a sale.

As consumers, we shouldn't settle for mediocrity, especially when it comes at a premium price. This game, in its current state, feels unfinished and reflects ATLUS at its worst—essentially a cash grab built on the goodwill of the Persona series.

This game parallels Final Fantasy XV, suffering from an extended development that ultimately detracted from its quality. While there are redeeming qualities, the flaws are too significant to overlook. I completed the game on Hard with a filled memorandum and every Follower quest complete. I have experienced all that the game has to offer in my 80 hours spent with it, and I found it lacking, especially given the minimal replayability and lack of New Game+ content.

There is no real player choice in this game, hence why you're provided an option that skips prompting you for a choice in dialogue. 90% of the options are the same thing said slightly differently. The game isn't open world, it's almost completely on-rails. And speaking of dialogue, most of it isn't voiced, this is something I've come to expect from a JRPG, but hearing audio blurbs like 'Yeah!' when the text reads something entirely different is a simply offputting, and this kind of situation happens a lot.

We were promised a title that would rival Persona and Shin Megami Tensei, what we received lacks the depth of combat in the latter, and social elements of the former. If there were ever a game that 'style over substance' applied to it'd be this.

Content is consistently recycled: enemy reskinning is rampant, dungeon design is repetitive, and even boss music is reused where it shouldn't be, undermining immersion. The final boss of the Coliseum is a reskinned Minotaur from 60 levels ago, the NG+ superboss is yet another reskin with the generic boss OST. This minimum effort approach is unacceptable for a $70 game.

The writing is juvenile, with characters presented as one-dimensional caricatures. The narrative is riddled with plot holes and lacks cohesion, particularly in its rushed buildup and payoff. As a fan of SMT and Persona, it’s disappointing to see a game that fails to capture the strengths of either series, coming across as pretentious and derivative. The final stretch of this game is perhaps the worst I have ever seen from a Persona-like title, it's as if it just wants itself to be over.

Graphically, the game is subpar, suffering from blurred textures, inconsistent object styling, and noticeable clipping issues. While I appreciate the passion behind the art, music, and world-building, the execution of the narrative and character writing is severely lacking.

In conclusion, despite some enjoyable elements—like follower interactions, humans, the art direction, and standout music—I cannot recommend this game at full price. Wait for patches and sales before considering a purchase; it’s a shame that such potential is trapped in a poorly constructed package.



I enjoyed my time with this game, but a large part of that was me ignoring and excusing its flaws because I've grown accustomed to shoddy releases. This is not worth your money in its current state.

There is passion here.

But that alone isn't enough to justify shelling out your money for this unfinished product.



EDIT:

I’m baffled, not only by the praise this game receives from critics and consumers alike, but the fact that both will avidly defend it as some infallible magnum opus. While it has a minimum level of quality, this should be expected. Its shortcomings shouldn’t be ignored. It’s not an innovative masterpiece; it’s derivative, created by a multi-million dollar company that has been tuning this genre of game for decades, a company notorious for predatory monetization, milking of titles, recycling material, and unfinished releases.

Though the art direction, music, menus and overall presentation are appealing, they are superficial to the experience of a narrative-driven JRPG. We should prioritize writing, character development, and thematic depth instead, all of which are sorely absent in Metaphor. The antagonists being comically, irredeemably evil is a boring step down from prior games in this line.

A major issue of mine is that the game was marketed as an open-world, choice-driven JRPG, but it’s actually a linear experience with zero meaningful choices, there is a reason they let you opt out of dialogue 'choices' entirely in the options menu. There is a single ending, which is disappointing for anyone familiar with their prior titles.

I completed 100% of the game without a guide simply by following the linear path, that isn't a brag, it's a testament to just how little there is to actually do in this game. I wish I had something else to look forward to, but NG+ offers so little incentive, as there are no choices or challenges. Regicide is an absolute stomp unless you actively limit yourself in combat, it should be available without NG+.

For a $70 title celebrating the 35th anniversary, it should meet the standards set by Persona 5 Royal at the barest of minimums. Including substantial optional quests, a lengthy story, and engaging side content. Instead, you can experience everything the game has to offer in about 80 hours, far less if you avoid grinding. Most of that time will consist of unvoiced dialogue boxes.

This game was advertised as a merging of Persona / SMT but feels like a hollow imitation, failing to capture the greatest qualities of either, and failing to lean into its own uniqueness. Again, there are great qualities here but it fails to meet a standards set by releases from years prior.

I expect more from established publishers like ATLUS, and I fully anticipate that a planned expansion of some sort will solve a few of the problems with the initial release. 

I implore everyone reading this to compare what's offered in this game to what's available in Shin Megami V: Vengeance and Persona 5: Royal, and explain why we should be content with receiving less content in a less polished package for more money.

We should have higher standards.","Very Positive91% of the 10,386 user reviews for this game are positive.",wait sale consumer settle mediocrity especially come premium price state feel unfinished reflects atlus worst essentially cash grab built goodwill persona series parallel final fantasy xv suffering extended development detracted quality redeeming quality flaw significant overlook completed hard filled memorandum follower task objective given non complete experienced offer 80 hour spent found lacking especially given minimal replayability lack no_real choice provided skip prompting choice dialogue 90 option slightly differently open world completely rail speaking dialogue voiced expect jrpg hearing audio blurb yeah text read entirely different simply offputting kind situation happens we_emphasizedre promised title rival persona shin megami tensei received lack depth combat latter social element former style substance applied consistently recycled enemy reskinning rampant dungeon design repetitive bos music reused undermining immersion final bos coliseum reskinned minotaur 60 level ago ng superboss reskin generic bos ost minimum effort approach unacceptable 70 writing juvenile character presented dimensional caricature narrative riddled plot hole lack cohesion rushed buildup payoff fan smt persona disappointing fails capture strength series across pretentious derivative final stretch perhaps worst persona title want graphically subpar suffering blurred texture inconsistent object styling noticeable clipping issue appreciate passion art music world building execution narrative writing severely lacking conclusion despite enjoyable element follower interaction human art direction standout music cannot_recommend price wait patch sale considering purchase shame potential trapped poorly constructed package enjoyed large ignoring excusing flaw grown accustomed shoddy release not_worth state passion alone justify shelling unfinished product baffled not_only praise receives critic consumer alike avidly defend infallible magnum opus minimum quality expected shortcoming ignored not_an innovative masterpiece derivative created multi million dollar company tuning genre decade company notorious predatory monetization milking title recycling material unfinished release art direction music menu presentation appealing superficial narrative driven jrpg prioritize writing development thematic depth sorely absent metaphor antagonist comically irredeemably evil boring prior game line major issue mine marketed open world choice driven jrpg linear zero meaningful choice opt dialogue choice entirely option menu single ending disappointing familiar prior title completed 100 guide simply following linear path brag testament wish else forward ng offer incentive no_choices challenge regicide absolute stomp unless actively limit combat available ng 70 title celebrating 35th anniversary meet standard set persona 5 royal barest minimum including substantial optional quest lengthy engaging side offer 80 hour far avoid repeatedly performing action gain resource consist unvoiced dialogue box advertised merging persona smt feel hollow imitation failing capture greatest quality failing lean uniqueness great quality fails meet standard set release year prior expect established publisher atlus anticipate planned major addition add feature mechanic sort solve problem initial release i_emphasizedmplore reading compare offered available shin megami v_emphasizedengeance persona 5 royal explain receiving polished package higher standard

2408820,Luma Island," At first I thought it was just another clone of Stardew and other similar games. In fact, it turned out that the game is quite 
self-sufficient.
 It has similar ideas, but in general the game is about something else. The main and most interesting aspect is the exploration of the world. Locations are filled with all sorts of secrets, riddles, puzzles. The visual style of the game, as well 
as the sound design make the exploration very pleasant and exciting.
 Characters in the city toss in the job of transforming or rebuilding something now and then. There are also several professions to choose from, the essence of which boils down to one simple pattern of actions - craft 5 valuable items, then make the 6th, take it to the teacher, and then repeat the same with new materials. Basically only the process of their extraction changes - farmer grows them, miner digs them, fisherman catches them, etc.

 From the first minutes it may seem that the game has artificially slow progression - you chop trees slowly, dig ore for a long time. But then a very important and strong counterargument pops up: the game has no stamina, fatigue, hunger, health, need for sleep, and most importantly - there is no inventory limitation, it is literally infinite.
And you realize how comfortable it is to play without all these limitations. Yes, grind is still grind, you will have to spend several minutes to dig 50-100 units of ore. But due to the almost complete absence of factors that interfere with this process (except for spiders in caves), it is easy and not annoying.

 The game also has a lot of other interesting mechanics like pets, tomb exploration, etc.
I highly recommend playing on your own if you like this kind of cozy games. Is's very enjoyable, beautiful, addictive.
Plus very clear and convenient thanks to the simple and informative UI.
Cooperative up to 4 players allows you to relax with friends. Connect is very fast, no crashes, everything in the game is very well synchronized. My girlfriend and I are stuck in Luma Island for long evenings. 
For 14 hours of play we did not encounter almost any bugs.

P.S. I would like to wish the developers not to abandon this wonderful project and continue supporting to get even more sells.

Over my extensive play time, I have watched Gaijin take a promising, fun game and turn it in to something that is directly opposed to the wishes of their player base, from balance concerns to gameplay changes.  While the core gameplay is still solid and the graphics are honestly quite beautiful, the company behind this game is one of the most dishonest I've seen.  They actively censor any discussion of their game that paints it in a negative light, even going so far as to create a poll asking forum members to choose between changing core mechanics of a game mode, or issuing copyright strikes against any video that discusses hacking in War Thunder.  Add to that their absurdly draconian chat rules and the e-thug moderators that gleefully ban anyone who has the nerve to disagree with them, and you have an environment that is extremely hostile to free speech.

394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"I'm a history enthusiast and a long-term Paradox fan. I enjoy Hearts of Iron 4 to no end, but I just cannot recommend it, so what exactly went wrong?

Pros:

+ Deep and engaging gameplay. This game really shines at presenting the player with complex problems in a very orderly and easy to understand manner. It's streamlined without taking away too much depth.

+ The frontline system. You don't need to micromanage hundreds of your divisions, you can simply assing them to the ever-changing frontline, and they will try to follow it. You can even draw up specific battleplans and decide when to go on offensive by executing them. This system allows you to focus on the bigger picture instead of getting bogged down in the details. Despite some imperfections it's still a great improvement over the preceeding games.

+ Freedom of choice. This time you are really able to just go in and reshape the world to your liking. This is allowed by the new system of national focuses which give the game a ""narrative structure"" and let's you (or the AI) take historical or ahistorical paths.

Cons:

- DLCs. Right now you'd be a fool to expect a Paradox game to be complete at launch. Many features were purposefully cut out from the base game, including stuff that was already present in previous titles. In order to fix that, a new DLC will be published every couple of months.

- Mess. Each DLC introduces new systems and mechanics, some of those new features don't bring anything substantial to the game, instead they just add unnecessary complexity and contribute to an already overcrowded and incosistent UI. On top of that, the game stills suffers from poor implementation of it's core systems (such as peace conferences and alliances), balance issues and the abundance of ahistorical paths, leading to unpredictable and gamebreaking outcomes.

- AI (or lack thereof). Weak AI encourages cheesy exploits and grindy tactics, taking away a lot from the challenge.

- Performance issues. By the year 1943 the AI will spam out hundreds of divisions causing performance drop even on very good platforms. This issue remains unaddressed since the early HoI games.

In conclusion: An exceptional grand strategy game held back by few significant flaws.","Very Positive91% of the 223,776 user reviews for this game are positive.",history enthusiast long term paradox fan enjoy 4 no_end cannot_recommend exactly wrong pro deep engaging shine presenting complex problem orderly easy understand manner s_emphasizedtreamlined taking depth frontline micromanage hundred division simply assing changing frontline follow draw specific battleplans decide offensive executing allows focus bigger picture bogged detail despite imperfection s_emphasizedtill great improvement preceeding game freedom choice able reshape world liking allowed national focus narrative structure ai historical ahistorical path con dlcs fool expect paradox complete launch feature purposefully cut base including stuff already present title order fix downloadable additional released initial launch published couple month mess downloadable additional released initial launch introduces system mechanic feature bring substantial add unnecessary complexity contribute already overcrowded incosistent ui top still suffers poor implementation core system peace conference alliance balance issue abundance ahistorical path leading unpredictable gamebreaking outcome ai lack thereof weak ai encourages cheesy exploit grindy tactic taking challenge performance issue 1943 ai spam hundred division causing performance drop good platform issue remains unaddressed early hoi game conclusion exceptional grand strategy held significant flaw

1203620,Enshrouded,"Honestly not very fun? When you are at home there is nothing to do because there are no invasions, and being out in the wild is kind of boring too because the game is samey and easy. The lack of emergent events, the ease of fast travel, the static enemy locations, lack of a weather system, limited bag storage and the way the stamina system works all means that you'll be doing insipid, quick trips to get mundane loot and then warp right back home to craft boring things. Not even rare loot is very exciting because weapon movesets are very similar across the board and the ""unique"" stat bonuses each weapon can unlock only come after spending a lot of money on upgrades - something you will not want to do because finding another copy of the same weapon later on, when you are a higher level, will make your upgraded one obsolete and a huge waste of money.

I don't really see much to this game. I was impressed at first when I thought combat was more involved and how the building system copied Valheim's, except THAT game had a much more robust system that made you deal with structural support, smoke and base defense. Even Valheim's combat, which WAS a lot more clumsy, still had more nuance to it in the end because weapon types were a lot more varied, different types of shields had different weight, biomes were harder to deal with, etc... 

I wouldn't really recommend Enshrouded right now, if at all. It's not terrible by any means but it's not particularly good at anything else either and while the idea of the shroud is cool, it doesn't make up for all the other barebones mechanics the game has.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"[h1]DOWNLOAD THE NVIDIA GAME READY DRIVERS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD[/h1]
I crashed like twice but didn't have a problem after I got the new game ready drivers. I'm literally making this review as a reminder. Had a blast so far but jesus guys, update your nvidia drivers.

ULTRA EDIT:
[h1]A Flawed but Fun Experience[/h1]

I might as well actually review this game in its current state considering the attention this got, while I have not finished it I feel I have experienced enough of the core mechanics to formulate an accurate opinion at least on the gameplay. 

It is a Witcher 3 reskin with a cyberpunk setting, considering that Witcher 3 was amazing (and I still have yet to get through it entirely) it does translate. Narratively this game excels, the dialogue is well written and acted and the characters are hard to not fall in love with. Walking around the world is exhilarating although unengaging, it is lacking interactivity. That being said the gameplay itself is a lot of fun. The guns pack a huge punch, very satisfying to use. The melee with katanas specifically is fun but broken, I did a body and reflex melee build and was able to behead TONS of foes before they even had time to react. The game is unfortunately plagued with bugs, less severe bugs especially after the recent hotfix but there are a myriad of small immersion raping bugs that pop up here and there Bethesda style. 

Ultimately I invest in player agency/good writing and fun gameplay at the end of the day, the graphics are important but less so. The decision-making of Witcher is here and that's really what I like the most HOWEVER this game was clearly not ready and considering recent events with the dev I will be hard pressed to trust them again. This is an incredibly bad launch. 

All of that being said, if you're the type that is a fan of Deus Ex, Dishonored, or Fallout: New Vegas you will love this game warts and all just for the godlike quest design those and this game offer. Plenty of skill check dialogue to be found. Suffice to say that I have had a good amount of ""That actually worked?!?"" moments so far which is a really hard feeling to nail down with games like this, you usually only get that out of CRPGs like Age of Decadence or Divinity, etc. At the same time I do not judge anyone that refunds this game or waits for a more stable version to come out because CD PROJEKT RED really dropped the ball and should not have released the game in this state. 

In conclusion, this game is mostly what I expected it to be and it is a shame that people expected this game to be the second coming of Jesus. I was banking on the decision making and quest design and this game delivers on those fronts. Everything else though, it does fail here and there but, in my opinion, not enough to make the game genuinely bad. If I had to give it a score out of ten it would be a solid 8/10. Hopefully CD PROJEKT RED can iron out all of these problems in a timely manner and elevate its standing.

Also driving anything is just plain awful, it depends on what you're driving but in my opinion it should just be the same for whatever you're driving but I'm just talking out of my ass at this point.","Very Positive84% of the 693,658 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

[i]Skip to the bottom for my final thoughts[/i]


[h1][u][b]Breakdown:[/b][/u][/h1]
[h3][b]Introduction[/b][/h3]
With the latest expansion [i]Greymoor[/i] on the horizon, I thought I'd write my review for The Elder Scrolls Online a few months in advance for new players who may be interested in the game currently. It's best to get a head start before the content drops!

[h3][b]Gameplay[/b][/h3]
The Elder Scrolls Online, which I shall refer to as ESO, is a popular open-world MMORPG developed by ZeniMax Online Studios, and allows its players to explore a vast amount of Nirn during an unfamiliar time period in the Elder Scrolls universe.

[i][b]Play as you see fit[/b][/i]
One of the best features of ESO which I highly commend is its easy accessibility to all players. That isn't to say that the game is easy - rather, it doesn't punish new players for mistakes they may make in the early stages of the game. Trust me, I myself made countless mistakes across a few characters before really getting a foothold. The learning curve may be a bit steep, but the early stages aren't absolutely brutal on new players. Feel free to put your character points into whatever you deem fit - you can always respec your points cheaply later on when it really matters.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975511257

I'm not the best person to go to in terms of advice for beginners; there are plenty of in-depth beginner guides that can help you off your feet. But if you like going in blind as I did, know that it's never too late to follow a build. Furthermore, ESO is available to play in two main ways, PVE (player vs environment) and PVP (player vs player). I personally stick to the PVE aspects of the game, notably dungeons, delves and questing. I haven't quite gotten to the raids yet.

Choose your role (Damage Dealer, Tank or Healer), set up your skill bar and prepare for battle. I've heard mixed reviews of ESO's combat system, but I personally have no problems with it and enjoy combat. Furthermore, there are currently six playable classes (four of which are available for free with the base game), ten races (nine of which are available for free with the base game), and thousands of unique viable builds to choose from for your gaming pleasure.

[i][b]Puts the Massive in Massively Multiplayer[/b][/i]
One of my biggest gripes with ESO, that is also simultaneously one of my favourite features of the game, is its ridiculously massive world that is incredibly easy to get lost in. But with great power (huge 3D world with nice models, fully voice-acted characters, etcetera) comes great responsibility - in the form of 100-odd gigabytes on my hard drive. You read that right: over 100 glorious gigabytes of disk usage.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975507520 

On the other hand, ESO is also massively multiplayer in the sense that it is still very much alive. Unfortunately, the game isn't cross-platform, but on NA PC you still see other adventurers *mostly* wherever you go. The community is also *mostly* friendly, with many guilds waiting to welcome you in with open arms. By the way, you can be a member of up to FIVE different guilds, so there's really no excuse not to make some friends.

If you're the type of player who likes playing through content by yourself, don't worry. You're not alone. You can play through the majority of ESO's content, sans high-tier PVE challenges.

[h3][b]Story[/b][/h3]
In my humble opinion, ESO is one of the best MMORPG story content-wise. I used to be the type of player who would skip through dialogue and cutscenes to get straight to the combat. Eventually, though, I started taking the time to listen to the fully voice-acted dialogue. Some quests are certainly better than others, but overall the quests are of good quality. I highly recommend you level your main character through questing rather than grinding. Not only do you get to experience the quest, but you can also get unique rewards and lots of XP.

[h3][b]Audio and Visuals[/b][/h3]
ESO is a great looking game and is again one of the best MMORPGs visual-wise in my opinion. I'll admit, there are definitely some meshes that look better than others (outlier examples), but for the most part, the game looks great. I really enjoy riding on my mount from point-to-point rather than just teleporting. The better rig you have, the better the game looks. The soundtrack is also superb, and as I've mentioned, the dialogue is fully voice acted.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975507736

[h3][b]Value[/b][/h3]
In terms of the base game, which frequently goes on sale, there are hundreds of hours of content available with no other purchases, microtransactions or otherwise. 

[i][b]The Business Model[/b][/i]
On the other hand, there is also a plethora of paid DLCs, expansions, and microtransactions available in ESO's Crown store. The game's premium currency, Crowns, can be traded among players in the form of gifting items in exchange for gold. This is often done through middlemen and can be risky. ZeniMax offers no other form of currency exchange. There also exists a paid membership, ESO Plus, which is not required for the base game, that grants subscribers unlimited access to all DLC (excluding new expansions), a number of crowns and other benefits.

Again, the aforementioned microtransactions are not at all necessary for hundreds of hours of enjoyment, but I myself have made purchases on the Crown store and am currently an active ESO+ subscriber.

[h3][b]Bugs/Issues[/b][/h3]
In the actual game itself, you don't run into issues all too often. I experience the occasional crash, but this may not necessarily be due to ESO. Regarding server performance, however, much of the community have raised complaints about the poor performance of the games servers and matchmaking capabilities specifically. This problem mostly applies to those interested in PVP, however, problems do exist with the Dungeon Finder (hit-or-miss queue times).

In general PVE play, especially if you're sticking with the overworld content, you shouldn't experience many problems. If necessary, restart your game every few hours to keep the memory usage low.

[h3][b]Performance[/b][/h3]
My computer (see below) has no problems running ESO at high settings, however, I acknowledge that for lower-end rigs you may encounter difficulty in running the game. Make sure to check the minimum specifications, and if your PC has equivalent or better parts. The in-game settings menu allows you to customize the graphics settings to suit your needs.

CPU: i7-8750
GPU: GTX 1060
RAM: 16GB DDR4

[h1][b][u]In Closing:[/u][/b][/h1]
[i][b]Greymoor is coming.[/b][/i]
The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited is one of the best MMORPGs currently available on Steam. Play how you want in the game's expansive world, against other players or enemies, and prepare yourself for the Dark Heart of Skyrim.

2537590,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024,"So sick of the ""release it broken and fix it later"" mentality from major game developers these days. A company as resourceful as Microsoft should've seen the increased server load coming from miles away. To release a game in a downright unplayable state is a major disappointment. IF you are even lucky enough to get past the seemingly endless loading, all that awaits you is endless graphical bugs and glitches with non-loading menus and bugged career airplanes soft locking your progression. In the current state, I cannot recommend this game and will be requesting a refund. I genuinely think Microsoft should've delayed the release if they were unable to accommodate adequate server demand or given users an option to download more of the files instead of having everyone attempt to stream them all on day one. I plan on purchasing the game in the future once the issues have been addressed.","Mostly Negative35% of the 5,451 user reviews for this game are positive.",sick release broken fix mentality major developer day company resourceful increased computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player load mile release downright unplayable state major disappointment lucky past seemingly endless loading awaits endless graphical bug glitch non loading menu bugged career airplane soft locking progression state cannot_recommend requesting refund genuinely delayed release unable accommodate adequate computer host multiplayer session facilitates communication player demand given user download file attempt stream plan purchasing future issue addressed
394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"I’m a working professional with wife/kids/mortgage and a preference for strategy games with single-player campaigns that can be played over months. This review is written for folks in similar situations.
 
SUMMARY: HOI4 is a tactically deep and enjoyable WWII real-time simulator, and is recommended if long-term planning, unit customization, and managing intense global wars sound appealing to you. Compared to other recent Paradox map-staring games (EU4, CK2, Stellaris), HOI4 is very light on diplomacy and has no exploration, characters, economy, or ethical dilemmas to wrestle with. Instead, this game is completely focused on mobilizing your industrial base for war and then operational-level tactics once war breaks out. 
 
This focus, and the familiar WWII setting, makes HOI4 more accessible to new players that like fast, micro-intense war games (CoH2) and might be skeptical of the slower peace/war/peace/war pacing of EU4. That said, HOI4 still has a steep learning curve and new players will need to spend some time on the wiki (or YouTube) to understand the best strategies for nation building and designing effective combat units. You can find several detailed Reddit posts with hundreds of useful tips on unit design, combat, national strategies, multiplayer, min/max, etc. Any question you can think of has likely been asked before, and if not, then post it and one of the forum super-nerds will get to it. Steam's 2-hour trial period is not enough to learn this game so check out one of Quill18's more recent YouTube tutorials if unsure.
 
For veteran EU4/CK2 players, be aware that HOI4 is NOT as rich in nation building and role-play, and that your bag of dirty tricks will easily outwit the feeble diplomacy AI. There is no satisfying progression from local to regional to world power, and small nations (e.g. Hungary) have no realistic chance of challenging the major powers (e.g. Germany) without exploits. Satisfaction in HOI4 comes from building superior industry/logistics, and then effective use of combined arms, concentration of force, and maneuver to crush enemy formations. For veteran HOI fans that have resisted buying, HOI4 really is the red-headed step child among recent Clausewitz games and features like a detailed order of battle are very missed. HOWEVER, it still looks fantastic, has decent quality-of-life automation, and is good for 200+ hours of good WWII fun while we wait for Imperator Rome to get patched a few times.
 
GAMEPLAY: Most of your time is spent as Commander-n-Chief organizing armies, training troops, setting up battle plans, and assigning commanders based on skill and traits. Patton, Rommel, Montgomery, Zhukov, and other famous names make appearances and have a tangible impact on the armies they lead. Combat between units has dozens of +/- modifiers relating to width, terrain, commander skill, flanking, air support, and many more, and is a complex subject for new players.

UNITS: Equipment stockpiles are fed by your military factories and are used to reinforce or train new divisions. The quantity of equipment needed (e.g. exactly 300 Medium Tanks) is determined by the divisions you create in the “Division Designer,” an interface that allows specifying the mix of specialized battalions (tanks, infantry, artillery, etc.) that make up a combat division (represented by sprites on the campaign map). Effective division design is the most complicated aspect of HOI4 and min/max players will spend a lot of time optimizing (and agonizing over) the best battalion mix. 

SUPPLY: Logistics in HOI4 is incredibly important for effective combat, and units out of supply won't reinforce and receive a nasty penalty to stats and movement. Any sizable invasions outside of Western Europe require logistical planning such as building ports or prioritizing the capture of urban areas for supply bases. Invasion routes actually matter in HOI4 and it's worthwhile to create small ""light"" divisions for combat in low supply areas like North Africa.
 
NAVY: The Man the Guns DLC added significant content and automation to naval warfare, and also more complexity to read up on. Most importantly, naval combat was tweaked in the latest free patch to make decisive naval engagements rare, and new fuel constraints have made running a massive and thirsty battle fleet in laps around the Pacific impractical. There are certain optimal ratios for ship types within a fleet and these are covered in the forums (more reading...).
 
AIR: Air superiority (from fighters) and combat air support (from CAS) requires some re-basing management as front lines move around, but also confers significant ground combat bonuses. Naval bombers can sink ships when deployed in force and especially when attacking ships in port. Air combat is not very sophisticated in HOI4 and future DLC’s will hopefully beef up this system to add Air Chiefs and simulate pilot shortages.
 
FOCUS: The National Focus tree is a structured series of choices that provide buffs, change government types, give casus belli, and push the world towards war. In general, the National Focus tree for a country is tailored towards its historical path and martial strengths: For example Germany gets buffs to armor research and claims on Danzig, the US has a strong air force and industry, and Italy totally sucks at everything. The order in which research projects and National Foci are chosen is VERY important for supporting your overall strategy: For instance, Germany may benefit from delaying war with Poland to focus on industry buffs or Japan may rush torpedo and cruiser research bonuses to have an edge on the USA.

TIPS: Below is a list of tips for new HOI4 players starting up a single-player campaign.
 
1. First Game: Start with the Italy tutorial to learn the basics. Conquer Ethiopia and then Yugoslavia for experience fighting a medium-sized enemy with an air force. Italy rapidly loses fun once the Allies start slapping you around.
 
2. Second Game: Pick Germany for a fun campaign on regular difficulty. Germany has a very powerful industrial base, no overseas colonies to worry about, and has the best military leadership. The fascist government type makes declaring war easy and HOI4 has been (mostly) scrubbed of atrocities to ensure you don't feel too evil.
 
3. National Focus: In 1936 starts, your first NF choices should improve industry and research. For Germany, this is the left-most side of the tree starting with Four Year Plan. Unlocking extra research slots is key, so prioritize this focus when you see it.
 
4.  Division Design: A solid starting infantry division for new players has 10 infantry battalions (20-width) with support artillery and engineers. Armored should be 6-tanks/4-motorized with support artillery, engineers, and recon. Big 40-width divisions are technically optimal for combat, but aren't necessary for beating the AI and new players will struggle with attrition. 

5. Red Menace: The USSR is capable of bringing immense manpower and equipment resources to bear (pun intended) once Uncle Joe gets them organized. If playing as Germany, don't wait for Ivan to kick in your door and instead go on the offensive while they are still weak in 1940-1941. Yes, you've heard of this plan before, but the right strategy is to attack south and secure the Caucasus oil fields BEFORE striking north.","Very Positive91% of the 223,776 user reviews for this game

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"There's a lot of whining about one shotgun being nerfed. That's not the real problem.

Whenever patches get pushed out, or new content, it feels like they did zero testing on anything at all. They do livestreams to ""prove"" they tested, but it's always staged with a prefab group, meaning they have zero testing from a ""normal"" player perspective.

There are so many glaring problems that make the game actively un-fun: Constant ragdolling, lack of variety in Major Orders, limited stratagem space forcing players into only a handful of builds in 6+, and a lot of abandoned weapons that don't have a place even in lower difficulties because all of the new enemies are just constantly tanks with limited means of defeating them.

There's a lot of fun in the concept, but I just don't understand how the dev team can push junk updates out constantly without realizing they're doing something wrong.","Mostly Positive74% of the 674,223 user reviews for this game are positive.",whining shotgun nerfed not_the real problem whenever patch pushed feel zero testing livestreams prove tested staged prefab group meaning zero testing normal perspective glaring problem actively un fun constant ragdolling lack variety major order limited stratagem space forcing player handful build 6 abandoned weapon lower difficulty enemy constantly tank limited mean defeating fun concept understand push junk update constantly realizing wrong
1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"[h1] ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS [/h1] 
This review is based on over 100 hours of gameplay during Patch 7 of Early Access. This was played unmodded, both with and without friends, and with an intent to explore all aspects of the early access release. Opinions can and may change over time.

[h1] WHAT IS BALDUR'S GATE III: [/h1]
This game is heavily inspired by the mechanics and themes of Dungeons and Dragons, with reasonable alterations in gameplay when compared to the tabletop game, providing an immersive and expansive adventuring experience. The game functions on a turn-based role playing game with a foundation of dice rolls, realised character fantasy, and meaningful choice progression. Larion Studios' Baldur's Gate III draws stylistic inspiration from the award winning Divinity: Original Sin series but has made mindful efforts to remain true to Wizard of the Coast's Dungeons and Dragons. The game follows the player character through Act 1, accompanied by up to 3 (of 5) optional followers with their own backstories, in their search to find an explanation and cure to an invasive Mindflayer 'tadpole' they have been infected with. The follower interactions are vast with humour, rivalry, personality and romance (if desired). Currently there are 9 available classes which offer distinctly different play styles, progression systems, and deterministic specialisation choices. The multi-player allows for yourself and up to 3 friends (in place of the 'Origin' followers) to create their own original characters and share the experience together.

[h1] PROS: [/h1]
[b] - Dungeons and Dragons based stats, dice rolling, and mechanics. [/b] This is visualised well in game with gratifying spell effects and satisfying dice roll graphics.
[b] - Enriched with Story. [/b] Very few corners are left without interest, no bloodied corpse or dusty tome is without explanation, and every character (including your own) is lysed with intricacies and mystery.
[b]- Replay-ability. [/b] It was difficult to complete a single play-through without theory-crafting a new way to play, sometimes this was excited by a new interesting magic item, sometimes it was simply receiving a difficult character choice. Even the smaller choices on quests on your adventure will have you thinking ""What if?"".
[b] - No Dull Moments. [/b] Ambushes, deep character development moments, unexpected (and sometimes hilarious) cutscenes. Even engaging with the bartering system can be entertaining. You can really savour every minute and digest it at your own pace.
[b] - Sound Design. [/b] Beautiful music is no rarity. Conversations are fully voiced with an exquisite narrator. Spells, weapons and the environment all show the weight of the action.

[h1] CONS: [/h1]
[b] - Early Access. [/b] The game will leave you begging for more, Act 1 though impressive may only contain 30-60 hours of game-play for the average play-through. Though the game will undoubtedly be brilliant on release; the updates will come slowly until then.
[b] - Missing Races and Classes. [/b] With 14 currently recognised classes in WotC's Dungeons and Dragons, the current 9 we have are fun and engaging, but not all encompassing. Not all races are accounted for either, which is expected to change, but causes your character creation to lack potential choices.
[b] - No Undo. [/b] Every action is permanent, though this is a good choice for making important story decisions (saving is always an option), mis-clicking or misunderstanding the permanence of a choice can lead to frustrating moments. This could be resolved by more conscious saving, but I'd prefer more auto-saves or an undo button in non-dice roll moments.
[b] - Level 4 Limit. [/b] Currently early access is limited to level 4, level 5 is where I would say ""this is where the fun begins."" in most D&D settings.
[b] - Price. [/b] Currently not a complete experience in early access, this price is mostly for individuals who wish to support Larion financially during the development of the game, or to play/test/bug report to help with Larion's usage statistics and polish of the game.

[h1] CLOSING STATEMENT [/h1]
Every minute of time spent on this game has been a wonderful experience. This early-access build sets a new standard for what is possible with a limited version of a game, though in some areas improvement is needed. Satisfying to the D&D craving I often get, but also elevating the immaculate story telling of D:OS2. This game is a masterpiece already and on release will be the cause of many [strike] hours of sleep lost [/strike] dream-filled nights.

2139460,Once Human,"Actually pretty good. 

Game looks and sounds nice enough and runs fairly well, though I have encountered quite a few bugs and issues such as textures not loading, or buildings not loading in resulting in enemies and loot appearing to be floating in mid air. I could not get into any servers close to me as they were all busy, so I am stuck in an Asian server with 100ms+ ping but in all honesty it hasn't really mattered much anyway since I am on PVE mode. 

All that aside what is here is a looter shooter with base building mechanics and character upgrades and a fair bit more I wont get into (as I haven't gone too deep into it yet). Needless to say there is quite a lot of game here for free and it all plays really well and I have not been constantly pushed into any store to buy micro-transaction garbage.

739630,Phasmophobia,"I've removed my positive review after the newest update, for a multitude of reasons. I'll switch this back to Positive once they've mostly been addressed.

1- The game runs really poorly since the new update. My group had played this game for over 100 hours with next to no lag or optimization issues. Now we're lagging out when we turn on flashlights, the rain is all coming down at once, and we keep running into the walls thanks to stuttering. Also we couldn't even close the game without crashing out. 

2- Please revert to the old shop. The new shop looks cosmetically more appealing, but it's terrible to use. I feel like I need a tutorial on how to use it. Does the Auto-Add do anything? I still need to press ""Add"" even with this ticked. 

3- The inverse difficulty curve of making everyone start with garbage gear until hunting the ghost feels more enjoyable is a questionable decision. The new implements just slow the game down, and while I'm sure some players love them, why force everyone to play that way? We enjoyed setting up our high-tech gear and having someone in the van shout orders at us. I guess we're not allowed to play our way until we grind a few hundred rounds for XP. Riveting. 

4- Death. I get that dying makes you lose some gear, but why such the $ and XP loss? Instead of earning $700, we earn $175? Are you kidding? How does that encourage using cursed objects, surviving hunts, or getting good ghost photos? I guess we should just quickly get our evidence and leave ASAP or be punished if we're unlucky.

If I had purchased the game now, I would have refunded it.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"Apex Legends Review: My Favorite Shooter, But It's Struggling

Apex Legends has been my favorite shooter for its thrilling gameplay and unique characters. The gunplay remains satisfying, and teamwork is essential, but recent updates have introduced frustrating balance issues.

While the visuals and audio continue to impress, the game feels like it’s in a slump. New content often lacks depth, and seasonal events have become repetitive. The community is still passionate, but competitive play can be more toxic lately.

Overall, Apex Legends still holds a special place for me, but as of now, I can’t recommend it.

730,Counter-Strike 2,"I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. 

The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. 
With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. 

I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator.

2344520,Diablo® IV,"DiaBLOWS 4 chunks. Yep folks, another big budget goof by one of the greatest developers to ever fall from grace. Diablo IV is at best an ok game, but it is certainly measured by high standards. The visuals are good, the gameplay is same-old, and the story falls under 'sure whatever' territory. The real problems are how Blizzard manages this game and all releases these days.

Blizzard is hell-bent (pun intended) on exploiting money from their zombie following (myself included) and locking content in battlepasses, putting predatory DLC and making people rebuy their games on the same gaming platform (I still need a Blizzard account so this counts as the same platform) is awful but I would say forgiveable as it is pretty standard corporate greed these days.....

.....now for the unforgiveable, Blizzard will ban users without reason, censor discussion, have goofy community policies which contradict everything that made them successful decades ago. The worst part is they are in denial on all this, in Overwatch 2 for instance the development team went out with a statement so thick on copium that they basically claimed to be getting review bombed, they also implemented an automatic ban policy curated by a flawed system, and oh boy hope you don't encounter any bugs or need Blizzard support to help you, because their support services will give you the run around and corporate copy-paste lines for days (I could probably simulate a more rewarding experience with a chat AI, since both would ultimately accomplish nothing in rectifying the game).

TLDR I spent money on this game so you didn't have to, please upvote this, because this is less about the core game itself and more  about all the things they have built onto and around this game and their other releases. I'd like Blizzard to explain away this as a review bomb....


....all that aside I am still a shill for Blizzard in some regards and hope we get Warcraft 3 Reforged lol :)","Mostly Positive71% of the 28,017 user reviews for this game are positive.",diablows 4 chunk yep folk big budget goof greatest developer fall grace diablo best ok certainly measured high standard visuals good old fall whatever territory real problem blizzard manages release day blizzard hell bent pun intended exploiting zombie following included locking battlepasses putting predatory downloadable additional released initial launch rebuy game gaming platform blizzard count platform awful forgiveable pretty standard corporate greed day unforgiveable blizzard ban user censor discussion goofy community policy contradict successful decade ago worst denial overwatch 2 instance development statement thick copium basically claimed bombed implemented automatic ban policy curated flawed oh boy hope encounter bug blizzard support help support service corporate copy paste line day probably simulate rewarding chat ai accomplish rectifying spent please upvote core thing built onto release blizzard explain bomb aside shill blizzard regard hope warcraft 3 reforged lol

2429640,THRONE AND LIBERTY,"Edit: I don't care how far a company leans away from P2W. This is one of the least egregious P2W titles that has ever come out of Korea exclusively because its designed in a way where the Whales in the game are funneling currency into other players instead of a void. It's a smart system if you're launching in Korea and want to limit P2W mechanics.

They weren't launching for Korea though. Every faint trace of P2W has to come out before I change my review because the principles and design philosophies around these systems are corrupted. You can still see remnants of a system where you could fail to craft fundamental things like Growthstones.

The game is incredible. It's gorgeous, it's optomized all the way to the tits and it is, genuinely, a revolution of MMO gameplay. But I will NEVER recommend a game built on p2w philosophies until said philosophies are completely and utterly extracted from it.

TLDR: If not for their monetization scheme, this would have been a golden-era level showing of game design. If WoW were designed this way, you'd basically have 75% of the things you collect (Gear, Crafting Mats, Consumables, Everything) added to a page with a button that said ""Collect your winnings now! Only $9.99!"" 

This game has me torn like to other game ever has, if not for its monetization Throne and Liberty would have been the new GOLD STANDARD for MMOs,

The back end of their servers is incredible, you can move seamlessly between fast travel points without a loading screen. The game is optimized to the teeth and is gorgeous to behold and MOST of the game are masterfully designed, engaging and limit pushing for a genre I feared to have entered permanent creative stagnation.

But whoops all your characters have to buy a $10 battle pass and a $10 ""Leveling Track"" pass to ever hope to compete(Even if you bought the 5 day headstart, which was a giant trap and buying the Battle Pass is more. The Battle pass on its own throws its purchasers over a MONTH of a F2P players daily limit for resource farming, just for doing everything you'd be doing anyway.

The f2p Track for the battle pass on the other hand is worth claiming 1 times of every 20. 

If they gutted the P2W out of the game (No contract limits, No Progress from Battle Pass and things gated via a daily cap of Lucent earned IN game THROUGH PLAYING THE GAME I would sing praises about this game until the sun burned out to everyone  who would listen. But as it stands now I will tell everyone to avoid it like the Plague for the same reasons I've illustrated here.

Removing ANY of their monetization mechanics would DIRECTLY improve the game in every single instance. Their monetization scheme is going to strangle this game, exactly like every other NCSoft game.

Throne and Liberty WOULD HAVE been a once in a lifetime revolutionary rebirth of MMO's but was ruined by ensuring you can't function without buying what will inevitably be a monthly ""ticket to ride"", but also swiping their credit card to interact with the Auction house is MANY other ways. The ONLY reason these mechanics exists are to drive people to giving them money. Not to make the game fun or improve the experience. These features ONLY exist to insidiously and underhandedly drive people to Pay, pay, pay.

Many content creators are blinded by the fact they've been so desperate for a quality MMO (Which, again, this game would have been if not for the monetization. and will gloss over how pay to win it is (Even people who are favorable of the game are mostly like ""Yes P2W, but is it really?"" and the answer to that phrase is almost universally ""Yes.""

I'd pay a subscription that gave me nothing, just to keep the game running,  before I will ever engage with their micro-transaction shop. The Battle-Pass amounts to a sub fee, but predatory. Instead of saying ""Pay or you can't engage"" it becomes ""Pay or you can't engage in a MEANINGFUL way"". 

That fact gets perpetually misunderstood by people because of all the flashing buttons, limited time offers and FOMO.

1203620,Enshrouded,"This game is amazing. Basically Valheim but IMO better than valheim was when it first released and honestly can hold its own against present valheim. Mostly all positives but there are a couple things i would like to see changed. For one, setting options like palworlds has would be nice, being able to switch loot dropping on death to it not dropping on death. I honestly hate that in survival games considering its not a difficulty thing per say, its just a time consuming thing which imo is a waste of time. I wanna be exploring and doing productive things not going back to my dead body cuz i accidentally slipped off a ledge into fire. Again imo thats not difficulty its literally just wasting the gamers time.
I also came across a little issue with roots, playing coop in my cousins hosted game, i destroyed a root when he wasnt there and he didnt get the skill point for it and when he went to the spot the root was still gone. we thought he might be screwed out of the point but we just had to restart the server. but what if your playing on a server you pay for thats always online, then what? Another little nit pick, the hit boxes sometimes seem a little wonky, example ill be standing completely behind an enemy and theyll swing, the axe makes no contact with me yet i take damage.. 
Again tho those are little nit picks cuz overall without question i recommend buying this game. Shit I wouldve paid 59.99 for this game, its far better than some triple A titles! I love the variety in skill tree, might of put double jump inside the circle  with skills like the wood cutting and mining skills, rather than on one of the class part of the tree but again this is an opinion based nit pick. The building in the game is SOOO good. The fact you can place square by square for roof and wall pieces, most games just have full walls and limited roof pieces.. Im excited to see 6 months from now some of the insane builds people come up with.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Destiny 2 is in a peculiar place in 2024. While it still boasts one of the smoothest and most satisfying gameplay experiences in the FPS genre, it's increasingly weighed down by a series of issues that make it hard to recommend, especially to newcomers.

The Good: Let’s start with what still works. The gunplay remains as stellar as ever, a masterclass in how a first-person shooter should feel. Whether you're landing precise headshots with a hand cannon or unleashing space magic with your Guardian’s abilities, Destiny 2's core gameplay loop is as addictive as it was at launch. The visuals are still stunning, and the world-building continues to offer a rich, albeit convoluted, lore​.

The Bad: However, these positives are increasingly overshadowed by the game's numerous downsides. The monetization model has become a major sticking point. With each passing year, Destiny 2 feels more like a cash grab than a cohesive experience. The endless stream of paid expansions, season passes, and in-game currencies like Silver make it clear that Bungie is keen on milking its player base for every penny. The new episodic content delivery, though offering some flexibility, has yet to prove its worth​.

The in-game economy is a mess, riddled with layers of currencies and RNG-based rewards that make progression feel more like a chore than an achievement. Bungie's attempt to keep the game balanced across both PvE and PvP has also led to constant nerfs and adjustments, often at the expense of player fun​.

The Ugly: Community feedback continues to be a mixed bag, with players often frustrated by the lack of meaningful improvements. Whether it's dealing with buggy events, unsatisfactory matchmaking systems, or the sheer grind required to stay competitive, Destiny 2's flaws are hard to ignore. Even Bungie’s attempts to freshen things up, like introducing massive Crucible matches, come across as desperate rather than innovative.

Conclusion: In 2024, Destiny 2 is a game that still shines in short bursts but is increasingly hard to stick with long-term. The endless grind, combined with aggressive monetization and a lack of meaningful content updates, makes it feel like a shadow of its former self. Unless Bungie can drastically revamp its approach, Destiny 2 risks fading into obscurity, a relic of what was once a beloved franchise. If you're a lapsed player considering a return or a newcomer enticed by the lore, tread carefully—this star is losing its luster.","Very Positive80% of the 615,480 user reviews for this game are positive.",peculiar 2024 boast smoothest satisfying experience shooter genre increasingly weighed series issue hard recommend especially newcomer good s_emphasizedtart work gunplay remains stellar masterclass shooter landing precise headshot hand cannon unleashing space magic guardian ability core loop addictive launch visuals stunning world building continues offer rich albeit convoluted lore bad positive increasingly overshadowed numerous downside monetization model major sticking passing feel cash grab cohesive endless stream paid expansion season pass currency silver clear bungie keen milking base penny episodic delivery offering flexibility prove worth economy mess riddled layer currency rng based reward progression chore achievement bungie attempt balanced across versus environment versus led constant nerfs adjustment expense fun ugly community feedback continues mixed bag player frustrated lack meaningful improvement dealing buggy event unsatisfactory matchmaking system sheer grind required stay competitive flaw hard ignore bungie attempt freshen thing introducing massive crucible match across desperate rather innovative conclusion 2024 shine short burst increasingly hard stick long term endless grind combined aggressive monetization lack meaningful update make shadow former self unless bungie drastically revamp approach risk fading obscurity relic beloved franchise lapsed considering newcomer enticed lore tread carefully star losing luster
381210,Dead by Daylight,"""Nothing is meant to be fair, and apparently by design"" - Mathieu Cote (Game director On Dead by Daylight)

I will try to explain why I write a negative review despite having a lot of hours and constantly playing this game to this day.

From a psychological standpoint:
[b] The game lures people into gambling addiction! [/b]
If you're online enough, you could have seen people complaining over the fact that they don't really appreciate Dead by Daylight but they are unable to quit it. The fun fact is the game that is based a lot on RNG factors, aka luck, and tries to look ""competetive"" develops gambling addiction. It's the core issue. 
You win, then you lose, after that you go for another match to show off your skills of defeating the unfair events and survive or kill every survivor. It's addiction is based on a constant feeling of irritation, the developers acknowledged it during one of their interviews. Gambling addiction funnily comes from losing, not winning. You will be annoyed by everything. By one of the most toxic communities, by poor balance decisions, countless bugs. Despite bringing the feeling of satisfaction sometimes, your mental state overall will be worse by the end of most play sessions. You won't play this game because you like it, you will play it because you're addicted to the constant feeling of surpassing the irritation. And the worst part is that you will feel rewarded because of the fact that you got luckier than players who are there to mock you and verbally abuse you by the end of a game. It's not healthy no matter how you look at it. Even if you have ""thick skin"", it's simply unenjoyable to waste your time on such people when you think about it. 
PVP games have toxic enviroment more often than not in general but at least they try making the gameplay more skill dependant and you can actually feel rewarded for your skill. Not luck, RNG.

From an account security point:
The developers, Behaviour or BHVR for short, are incompetent. Extremely incompetent. There's a very meaningful review in the top ones from a person who used to work there that I really recommend reading if you haven't done so, it's always interesting to know what's going on inside the gamedevelopment process. With the date of the review it's laughable that such issues described are still there. Recently hackers got a new way of banning people, they just go online, start streaming while pretending to be a person they want to ban. With no investigation, staff has sent out bans to the actual users without any investigation and capability to appeal the ban properly as support is very quick at closing submitted tickets. And they put heavy bans, so your EAC, Easy Anti Cheat program, will detect your hardware and everything. DDoS attacks happen too often in this game as well, be aware if you still want to play it for some reason despite all of the valid point made in many negative reviews.
This game has a large number of cheaters. I don't even talk about subtle onces, they are actually just customers for the developers as they said so themselves, look at the review of the person who worked there. I talk about the onces who straight up can keep you in a match for an hour while they break the game.

Talking about the other reasons why I can't recommend this game: 
- It requires you to waste too much time grinding and paying. Licenced characters can only be purchased via real money and if you want to get original ones for free, you need to put 50-60 hours for each character. And there are so many of them, it may take 850-1.020, if not more, hours to gain them all for free. Even more, considering they add characters.
- The developers work on their game when they WANT. The reason for that is the fact that this game does not have any competition. This brings flaws and small patches that do not really feel drastic and entertaining. Moreover, if the upcoming changes are disliked by the community, they will be rolled anyways since what can people do, find another Dead By Daylight? Money were put into creation of the things players didn't like, get it or leave. Oh, wait, you won't. 
- The game feels dull actually. It doesn't have anything to do with the amount of hours one may have. We have no new content despite new killers and perks that kind of change gameplay in very subtle ways. The issue here is that the perks don't do much, currently the game has a few strong perks, the meta, that the community takes and the other perks are not being used at all unless a player wants to feel less powerful for some reason. And the killers often feel dull as well. Instead of constantly working on the previous perks and killers the developers prefer to make new perks and killers for the sake of pumping up money. They rarely change anything, it's lucky to have a patch with some big interesting changes at least once a year.
- The developers obviously lean towards the side that brings more money with the help of the cosmetics. It's not a secret that killer issues take much more time to be solved than the survivor ones. It brings unfairness into the game in certain cases. They often push out strong perks and balance them after sales of the characters the perks are tied to go down significantly. So if there's a new perk that really dominates out of a proportion, be ready to see it for a year or two. 
- The moderation on the Steam and the official forums will literally ban you for showing any concern about the game's health. If you complain too much, it's spreading negativity and it's against the rules. Literally. This creates a false sense of positivity when the community is annoyed with BHVR.
- I will point it out again, the support isn't really helpful and deals with many issues quite poorly. The in-game report system only flags certain players, they won't get banned if you press a few buttons there. To have a person banned for sure you need to take extensive amount of steps and most of the times you need proof. So if you don't have your games recorded, you can't sumbit tickets to support effectively. 
- Once when Stranger Things chapter licence got to its unexpected end, the FOMO success really got into publishers' minds. They have started doing limited time payed content, they even took out certain cosmetics that existed before that decision. Felt icky, you could see how they tried pumping the money out of you. Recently they have changed their mind and made only event cosmetics time-limited. However, just understand that the company is after your wallet, not your experience.
- You will have to close your comment section. I've never seen a community being this obsessed with leaving toxic comments on your profile. 

Please, do not support this mess. It looks fun on the outside but it's a mess.

----
I would like to mention one pretty significant thing about the game's developers that had happened at some point.
The community asked for colorblind setting for more than 4 years. This request had been dismissed until some point when the scandal occured because of it.
One of the developers called the whole thing boring. Clearly they aren't interested in wasting resources on something that won't bring them much income. The game has lost it's initial charm long time ago and has nothing passionate about it.

Destiny not only charges you money for seasonal content but they delete it every expansion.

We’ve been deployed to the farthest reaches of the galaxy, facing ruthless cyborgs and colossal bugs. Every mission is a dance with death; every shot could be our last. But we are Helldivers ! We don’t retreat. We don’t break. We charge headlong into danger where others would falter.

Remember, victory isn’t won by one of us, but by all of us. Each of you is a critical cog in our machine of war. This is not a battleground for lone wolves, it’s a symphony of strategy, cooperation, and sacrifice.

That is a BIG NO for me!  

This game is VERY difficult squad based game. I can live with that. There is no offline play and solo play is stupidly hard. Duh! Its a squad game.  Graphics are decent as are the game premise and functionality.

The problem I have is that the game installs a ROOTKIT on your PC without them informing you. This ROOTKIT installs at the kernel level on Windows. 

That was bad enough, but when my AV caught the ROOTKIT trying to access files outside the program file directory that had nothing to do with the game that I considered this an insider threat and major security issue. I immediately removed the game and requested a refund.

 I cannot have some random company accessing files on my PC that do not belong to them. No telling if they are collecting personal data, or up to other nefarious things.

If you read the forums, the anti-cheat ROOTKIT is only designed to protect their micro transaction system but will randomly delete any files it considers a threat without notification or permission.

The game itself is closer to something like God of War reboot than Souls, thank goodness. There is no penalty for death and after few initial bosses you know the combat system well enough to play at your own pace.

The only downside is that not every piece of text in the game is translated so far, plus the first hour or so could be a little too cutscene-heavy.

Otherwise, it's a very beautiful game with deep yet easy to learn combat system and easy to follow plot.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 732,771 user reviews for this game are positive.",far run ultra rt 4080 qhd incredibly visually appealing strong production value cool chinese voiceover yeah stable agressive alt tabbing closer god war reboot soul goodness no_penalty death initial boss combat play pace downside not_every piece text translated far plus cutscene heavy beautiful deep easy learn combat easy follow plot

2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"[h3]One of the best adventure games ever[/h3]

Developers had an advantage of taking a very well developed world and one of the most famous story in it. And they not only took it but they delivered on it. Game has wide variety of enemies each of them has it's own backstory (obviously taken from chinese folklore but still) which slightly enlarge our understanding of the world. And just this world and story is enough to give this game a try even if you are not a fan of any other aspects of the game.

Game consists of 6 chapters each of which has it's unique enemy cast (with exception of ch5) and corresponding bosses. I remember entering ch5 and my thought ""lol those enemies are just reskins of earlier ones lazy devs"". But in any other game I would just perceive this as a norm and the fact that I perceived this as a minus speaks very highly about enemy variety in the game.

Bosses divides in two parts - chiefs and kings. Difficulty-wise they are mixed up, kings just have more shiny moves I guess...
Bosses in a vacuum are all awesome - they has their place in the world, they has a backstory, they have cool moves and good loot. Also they are balanced pretty good for an adventure game even tho I wish they was harder cos amount of bosses I just first try facetanked is unhealthy in my opinion. On the other hand I heard that some people struggles a lot on different bosses so my opinion is not objective here. And yes, I also struggled on those two bosses :)

Maps are also awesome - with unique biomes and gorgeous views. They are normal adventure type maps with branching path to the end boss. But game doesn't have any map in menu so navigating and finding all secrets can be quite time consuming (especially in ch3).
Chapter 6 map is failed (in my opinion) experiment on openworld type of map. There is literally nothing in it except for a few bad bosses and 1 (one!) chest.

Why ch6 bosses are bad? I hate 2 types of bosses: ""puzzle"" boss and ""catch me bitch"" boss. They are like 90% of ch6 bosses :(

But game is not without technical problems of course
First of all - camera. Camera can get behind a tree or a wall which is annoying. Also camera tracking is quite loose so if you move around around the boss too much or if boss is has very mobile moveset - he will be out of your field view for a good 30+% of a fight. Also you can just lose target lock during some of boss moves if you don't manually readjust camera during fight (which is annoying if you use gamepad).
Minor problem with inputs - for example run button won't register if you pressed it before your run-prohibiting move ends.
And annoying problem with lack of target tracking. Like you know how lazy boss designers adds insane target tracking to all moves of bosses - here designers went deeper - heavy attack after roll in 75% of cases will just miss the mark completely - it's not hitting where enemy was, nor where he is going, just some random particle in the air, which is extremely frustrating after you spent like a minute to charge this attack.

But despite these problems game is still awesome, bosses are still very manageable due to variety of builds (and ability to redo your build at any time).

1643320,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"As a long-time fan of the Stalker series, I was eagerly anticipating Stalker 2, hoping it would carry forward the elements that made the original trilogy so special. Unfortunately, the biggest disappointment for me is the glaring absence of the iconic A-Life system, which was a defining feature of the earlier games.

In the original Stalker games (Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat), the A-Life system brought the Zone to life. NPCs and mutants had their own routines and behaviors, wandering dynamically through the world. You could stumble upon a random firefight between factions, witness mutants hunting stalkers, or find allies looting the aftermath of a skirmish. It made the Zone feel alive, unpredictable, and immersive. You never knew what might happen as you explored; the world moved and evolved independently of your actions.

Stalker 2, however, feels static by comparison. NPCs seem tethered to specific locations, and encounters are heavily scripted. The lack of emergent gameplay—something that was at the heart of the Stalker experience—leaves the world feeling lifeless and shallow. The Zone no longer feels like a living, breathing ecosystem but rather a backdrop.

The absence of A-Life is especially frustrating given the technological advancements since the original trilogy. With modern AI capabilities and hardware, the potential for an even more dynamic and immersive Zone was immense. Instead, it feels like GSC Game World missed an opportunity to push the boundaries and instead delivered a world that feels more like a theme park than a wilderness full of danger and mystery.

There are other issues—occasional bugs, underwhelming side quests, and some graphical inconsistencies—but the lack of a dynamic world is what really kills the experience for me. Without A-Life, Stalker 2 feels like a shell of its predecessors. For newcomers, it might be an okay introduction to the Zone, but for veterans, it's hard not to see this as a missed opportunity to build on what made the franchise special.

If you’re a fan of the original games, temper your expectations. The Zone may look more polished, but it lost its soul.","Mostly Positive79% of the 25,476 user reviews for this game are positive.",long fan stalker series eagerly anticipating stalker 2 hoping carry forward element original trilogy special unfortunately biggest disappointment glaring absence iconic life defining earlier game original stalker game shadow chernobyl clear sky call pripyat life brought zone life npc mutant routine behavior wandering dynamically world stumble random firefight faction witness mutant hunting stalker ally looting aftermath skirmish zone alive unpredictable immersive never_knew happen explored world moved evolved independently action stalker 2 feel static comparison npc tethered specific location encounter heavily scripted lack emergent stalker leaf world feeling lifeless shallow zone no_longer feel living breathing ecosystem rather backdrop absence life especially frustrating given technological advancement original trilogy modern ai capability hardware potential dynamic immersive zone immense feel gsc world missed opportunity push boundary delivered world feel theme park wilderness danger mystery issue occasional bug underwhelming side quest graphical inconsistency lack dynamic world kill life stalker 2 feel shell predecessor newcomer okay introduction zone veteran hard not_to missed opportunity build franchise special fan original game temper expectation zone polished lost soul

(lookin at you fatshark, overkill)

developers of this game have proved they do not actively play their own game (beyond a specific difficulty lol). the balancing mentality of this game is foul and the devs really just killed their own divers (playerbase) from the start with every patch that introduced more bugs than fixes, which i consider to be such an epic gamer move, that even i couldnt explain why they do this.

the game is also filled with a ton of bugs and glitches ranging from inconvenient to game breaking. some of them have been there from the start and are still in, some are introduced with every new patch. playing this game has become a hassle of its own.

216150,MapleStory,"I really do wish I could recommend this game. I have spend many, many, hours on it. I was drawn in by the excellent storyline and seemingly endless levels.

But then it hits you. The level curve is absurd. The content is either sparse or not worth your time (good luck leveling between 120 - 150) and the top play is just far too repetative. There is always a best build, and they are painfully obvious. All these status effects, elemental damage, forget them. Only element that matters is holy, and most enemies die before you can do whatever horrible status effect to them.

Maplestory, gameplay wise, seems to be hanging you between faster leveling crowd attacks or better boss-killing single target attacks. Usually you end up a bastard mix of all of them, and it seems like that's the track most classes are now moving.

Really, the only difference between most of these classes is their DPS and weapon of choice. While this one has to balance light/dark, this one rides on a panther, and this one is so adorably ridiculously pink, it doesn't make a bit of difference. You're either a bishop or a killer. Class synergy? Nope. Tanks and Strikers? Nope. I guess the best example of this are the boss battles, which just involve going down your attacks, drinking crap tons of potions, and watching a screen literally covered with colorful multi digit numbers. You do this for an hour, and if you can't do it under a hour, you lose. Fun.

There is so much to like about Maplestory, but even more to hate. Honestly, I play it for the community. I'm not saying the game is awful, I'm just saying it is intensely flawed.","Mixed63% of the 13,193 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"This is tough to write because honestly, Act 1 and 2 make this game THE Game of the Year. Heck, I was ready to put it in my top 5 all time favorite games. I have 100+ hours in this game now and just loved the story and choices and the combat.

And then Act 3 happened. I started having performance issues, I started having weird glitches were my companions would lose half their bodies and couldn't fight anymore, I've had 5 different quests completely bug out on me and even a main quest bug out that I can't even complete. Not only that, but the story choices of what is going on - the main bad guys and fights aren't as thought out as things were in the first 2 acts. It is very clear that Act 3 was completely rushed in my opinion to get the release out the door and does not have the same care that Acts 1 and 2 had.

All of that enjoyment of Acts 1 and 2 to just come up against the frustrations in Act 3 killed my enthusiasm for this game. I know Larian will likely fix these issues as I suspect as more people start finishing the game they will see/hear this criticism - and quite possibly they already know this. But I can't in good faith recommend someone spend 80+ hours in a game and then just run up against game breaking bugs that won't allow them to finish the game they way they want to.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Warning: Some language, viewer discretion advised. You read at your own risk.

Pros
-Fun gameplay (I wanna say it starts getting good around 30 but could be wrong)
-Useful Crafting
-Impressive story
-Marriage is a thing (LGBT friendly if you care)
-Visually impressive boss fights
-Easy to get into
-Player Housing (Limited plots) (These can be a bitch to get but it's gotten more fair to get recently)
-Guild Housing (Limited plots) (These can be a bitch to get but it's gotten more fair to get recently)

Either Or (Good or bad based on taste)
-PVP (It's instanced based completely, no open world PVP, everyone is level 30 at most in it (You'll get scaled down and your gear doesn't matter in PVP if you're above 30))
-Game store (Has a IRL$$ store, mostly cosmetic stuffs but there are level/story progress skips on sell and mounts (Which require you to have obtained your chocobo anyways first))

Cons
-Account creation needs better work
-Requires a subscription for later progression (Stormblood, Shadowbringers, Endwalker content onwards.) If you sub, you must be subbed to play. If you cancel, you can't play otherwise unless you're on a free trial specific account
-While impressive, the story content starts out a bit slow and can be a bit lengthy text wise and cutscene wise
-Player Housing (Limited plots) (These were a bitch to get but it's gotten more fair to get recently)
-Guild Housing (Limited plots) (These were a bitch to get but it's gotten more fair to get recently)

Don't let this be the sole source of your decision though as consider this... Final Fantasy 14 has a free trial available that you can download to try the game for free. It allows you to go through all the content of A Realm Reborn and even the award winning expansion Heavensward to let you enjoy all the content for free up to level 60 on all jobs and classes. And did I forget to mention that the free trial has no restrictions on play time? Well it doesn't! Keep in mind there are some restrictions though such as for example being unable to join a guild, using zone chat, etc. So use this review be a stepping stone, but also give the game a shot through the free trial to know for sure.

Also wanna note I'm not tackling all the features here, and I'm not even hitting all the ones I like too like the glamour system as some of these are self explainable in-game. I can't really explain my thoughts on this without going over the review text limit, but keep in mind with some of the stuff there are ups and downs.

Key things to note:
-If you subscribe to the game, you will have to have an active subscription to play it afterwards if you cancel for your account
-You can have every job on one character, can swap to them by simply changing the 'weapon' once you unlock it
-If you like dress up, there's such a system in the game (Works similar to a degree to how transmog in WoW first started)
-If you really enjoy the game you'll lose countless hours like I have and I'm losing countless more as you read.","Very Positive87% of the 71,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",warning language viewer discretion advised read risk pro fun wan na start good 30 wrong useful crafting impressive marriage lgbt friendly care visually impressive bos fight easy housing limited plot bitch gotten fair recently guild housing limited plot bitch gotten fair recently good bad based taste versus instanced based completely no_open world versus 30 scaled gear matter versus 30 irl mostly cosmetic stuff progress skip mount require obtained chocobo anyways con creation need requires subscription progression stormblood shadowbringers endwalker onwards sub subbed play cancel play unless trial specific impressive start bit slow bit lengthy text wise cutscene wise housing limited plot bitch gotten fair recently guild housing limited plot bitch gotten fair recently sole source decision consider fantasy 14 trial available download allows realm reborn award winning major addition add feature mechanic heavensward enjoy 60 job class forget mention trial no_restrictions play mind restriction example unable join guild zone chat stepping stone shot trial wan na note not_tackling feature not_even hitting one glamour self explainable explain thought text limit mind stuff ups down key thing note subscribe active subscription play afterwards cancel on_emphasizede swap simply changing weapon unlock dress s_emphasizeduch work similar degree transmog wow started enjoy lose countless hour losing countless read

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"Overall, a pretty great jrpg.

If you are already familiar with Shin Megami Tensei (SMT)/Persona/Soul Hackers (SH), etc. you'll feel right at home and this game is a nice iteration on those games. Like Persona, it's very dialogue heavy, but I would say the pacing is much better.

Combat is the same press-turn system as SMT/Persona/SH, but the overworld real-time combat is a nice addition, especially for 1-2 shotting low level trash mobs.

The music is some of the best in an Atlus game since SMT4 and really unique in a good way.

There could be some UI improvements (item menu sorting/filtering, skill inheritance sorting/filtering, etc), but it isn't a huge hinderence overall.

Difficulty wise it's similar to Persona, more-so than SMT, but still presents a challenge on Normal and Hard can be pretty brutal at times, especially if you get ambushed (enemy hits you first in the overworld). The difficulty also stays pretty consistent even towards the latter parts of the game. Dungeons are also varied, with smaller side-quest dungeons and main story long dungeons -- one in particular took me 4 hours to fully complete (picking up every item/chest).

The story is pretty solid overall, and the characters all feel pretty unique and grounded. Personally I think the story would resonate more with younger people, but I still enjoyed the majority of it at 40+.

The game took me ~60 hours to complete while doing all side content and fully exploring every dungeon, though I did skim through some dialogue at repetitive points.

tl;dr: Good jrpg, good music, good progression/pacing, wish it was longer. As an overall package, this is my favorite Atlus rpg since SMT4 (not including Unicorn Overlord).","Very Positive91% of the 10,386 user reviews for this game are positive.",pretty great jrpg already familiar shin megami tensei smt persona soul hacker sh home nice iteration game persona dialogue heavy pacing combat press turn smt persona sh overworld real combat nice addition especially 1 2 shotting low trash mob music best atlus smt4 unique good ui improvement menu sorting filtering skill inheritance sorting filtering huge hinderence difficulty wise s_emphasizedimilar persona smt present challenge normal hard pretty brutal time especially ambushed enemy hit overworld difficulty stay pretty consistent towards latter part dungeon varied smaller side task objective given non dungeon long dungeon particular took 4 hour complete picking chest pretty solid character pretty unique grounded personally resonate younger enjoyed majority 40 took 60 hour complete side exploring dungeon skim dialogue repetitive point tl dr good jrpg good music good progression pacing wish longer package favorite atlus role smt4 not_including unicorn overlord

When I first began playing which was in 2009, the Maplestory community was the best gaming community I had EVER experienced. The social aspect of the game was absolutely amazing. Back then, Factions weren't dead and every day I would find interesting people to play with and party up with.

[h2] Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review[/h2]
[h3]This part of the review is only about the [b]Singleplayer[/b][/h3]
For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.

This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.

[h1] Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it: [/h1]

[list]
[*][b]What is it exactly that you do in the game?[/b]

It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.

[*][b] Will it make my eyes bleed?[/b]

For $70 a game released in 2022… it’s not that graphically impressive… Sure the whole appeal of CoD is to run as light as possible so you can get 100+ FPS in the multiplayer and have low latency. But even if you max out the game it’s not that impressive. At release I found several low textures and the game still suffers from random popping on arbitrary objects for no rhyme or reason and… I don’t know if this is an AMD GPUs problem but I never managed to get rid of the film grain on my game. I even disabled image sharpening and antialiasing and I still had this effect on my screen:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6e5HSU0yfU
The cut scenes are by far the best part of the game. They are beautifully animated with amazing performance and great direction. But besides that, the game looks decent and at some points even impressive but… not $70 impressive.

[*][b]Does it have a good story?[/b]

I don’t know if I would call it “good”... To be fair I wouldn't consider it “bad” either. CoDMW2’s story is the excuse that the game gives you to travel around the world and kill terrorist and narcos. That’s it. 
You never learn much about the characters beyond surface level stuff and they never grow or change… and the plot is a bunch of random stuff that you’re not supposed to question. It feels like watching a youtube supercut of the “coolest” bits of a Michael Bay movie.

[*][b]Does it have a good soundtrack?[/b]

I don’t even remember if CoDMW2 has an OST and youtube only has the track for the main theme.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPrqIgVpYrk

Soo… I don’t know.

[*][b]Does it have replay value?[/b]

Only if you are an achievement hunter. CoDMW2 offers you really cool achievements for you to unlock. My favorite is the one you get by killing enemies with a riot shield.

[*][b]Does it run well?[/b]

Well, the game runs flawlessly most of the time. But this game doesn’t run as smooth as I would have liked. I already mentioned random popping. But there are random frame drops as low as 19 FPS when the game loads new assets. And I have to mention that an update broke my save file and I had to restart the campaign again.

[*][b]Is it fun?[/b]

Only if you like CoD games.

[/list]

[h1] So what is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2?[/h1]

It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.

Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.

All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.


[h1] Things that I like about this game:[/h1]

[list]
[*]Amazing gun play. CoD never disappoints with their gunplay.

[*]Great controller support.

[*]Decent yet a bit outdated graphics.

[*]Amazing cut scenes.

[*]Some missions are fantastic and so much fun to play.

[*]Great voice acting.

[*]The twist near the end is quite decent.

[*]The story is just “there”, it’s not bad but I definitely don’t hate it.

[/list]


[h1] Things that I dislike about this game:[/h1]

[list]

[*]A bit buggy and glitchy

[*]The characters are kind of bland.

[*]The AI is not great.

[*]I don’t like how this game thinks “challange” is throwing lots of armored enemies at you.

[*]I don’t like how the final boss is just an extended stealth section.

[*]The only boss in the game is a bit frustrating.


[/list]
[h1] Is this game worth my hard earned money?[/h1]

For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.

Rating: 7/10

1938090,Call of Duty®,"Why Current Call of Duty sucks:

Sunk Cost Fallacy Progression System

Skill Base Match Making

Tons of Micro-Transactions

Things you buy from the store look better than the Mastery Camos

Low Quality Game that Prioritizes the Store

Events are to sell you things

Pay to Win (getting worse over the years)

Drip Fed content (Game is finished 8 months after release, which is when Next CoD Hype is happening)

Content is either Reused or Remastered from previous CoDs (never new good content)

Takes out content to replace it with content no one asked for

""Fixes"" things that are not broken

Shill Community

Terrible UI, like a Streaming Service

Cater to Noob Players

Advertise New CoDs based of things that werent in the previous one (even though we ask years before)

Booting up the game takes literally 5 minutes with the new CoD Hub system

Terrible Servers, yet the store always works

Everything is settled to be Mid due to the communities low standards of gaming

Campaign is a 3 hour Warzone Tutorial with a pointless storyline

Zombies is a soul-less DMZ Knockoff with reused assets from Cold War and a copy/paste Warzone Map

739630,Phasmophobia,"It's not often that a multiplayer indie horror game takes off while still in the very beginning stages of its Early Access release, but man oh man has Phasmophobia done just that. Overnight it managed to jettison into fame, leaving the single developer stunned; he didn't expect for his humble little title to take off at all, much less so quickly. By now you may have watched your favorite streamer play it, or maybe you're just sitting back wondering what all the fuss is about. Well, whether you have a swath of friends to play with or you're always flying solo, Phasmophobia has some ghost-hunting fun to offer everyone.

The gameplay concept is one of the most unique designs to come along in years; perhaps since the birth of the modern asymmetrical horror genre which was propelled by modern monsters such as Friday the 13th and Dead by Daylight. You're a ghost hunter, and your whole purpose is to figure out what ghost you're up against by seeking out clues, such as ghost orbs, freezing temperatures, high EMF readings, and the most fun of all, getting the entity to speak with you through the spirit box. Once you've discovered the three present clues, you can opt to complete additional objectives for bonus cash and experience points. The catch being that the longer you stay, the higher your chances of death become.

Phasmophobia's fun is intertwined in both horror and hysterics, and if you're playing with a group of friends you're going to end up laughing just as much as you're screaming. Much of the hilarity is ingrained in elements that aren't exactly meant to be funny, such as the way the character models bend almost entirely backwards if you crouch and look up, or the weird glitches that occur. Other times, it's a combination of all of that along with how you can completely screw your friends when a ghost starts to hunt you. It all depends on your group of course, and if you're playing by yourself you're going to be in for a deeply atmospheric hellscape of jumpscares. From ghostly whispers in your ear that send a tingle down your spine, to poltergeist activity, and random flashes of the entity becoming visible, the game will make you start questioning if you actually saw what you think you saw.

That's another thing, not only are you a ghost hunter, but the ghosts will start to hunt you. There are three difficulty levels (amateur, intermediate, professional) where the higher you go, the faster the ghost will become active and the more aggressive it will be. If you get a shy ghost or are playing on a lower difficulty, you can say its name to start ramping up its activity and to force it to be more aggressive. Half of the game, and subsequently half of the fun, is communicating with the ghosts using the spirit box, whether or not they respond through that medium. Additionally, a ouija board has a chance to spawn in the level, which pushes the terror and communication even higher as the spirit will answer a more broad range of questions. Beware, however, as the board drains your sanity quickly, and the lower your sanity, the more often you will be hunted.

Through all of the fun, scares, and laughter, of course Phasmophobia has a long way to go. It's important to remember that only one person is working on it, and it only release in mid September of 2020. It would be nice to see some more maps, hopefully on the small to medium scale, as the larger areas just aren't that fun to play; especially on higher difficulties like professional, as it's incredibly hard to find where the ghost is hanging out. A more rewarding level up system is an absolute must, as the only thing this title is lacking is a solid hook. It has the simple gameplay, it's both repetitive and diverse enough at the same time to create addiction, and all it is missing is the substance of reward. Some hotfixes really need to happen first and foremost, as the longer one plays, the more broken the game becomes, namely with local push-to-talk breaking on the regular.

Whether you want to support it during Early Access or not, Phasmophobia is a horror game to keep your eyes on for the coming months and years. Hopefully, the developer will be able to get a small team together to work on this release so that consistent updates can be published and that this unique title can really flourish. Expect to see more competition in this new ghost hunting category, as this genre is ridiculously fun, fresh, and captivating.

1203620,Enshrouded,"I have really been enjoying this game quite a bit and actually taking my time with it.  

The Good

The landscape terraforming in this game is top tier, same with the building, seriously the building is so good and if you really experiment with the smallest block shape, you can really make some fantastic builds! The Lighting and shadows are fantastic, very realistic.  Gliders and grappling hooks rock. Exploration is key to advancing and being able to build/craft new items.  Combat can be alot of fun. I personally have an Nvidia 2070 RTX (not the super), on Ultra graphics settings, and this game runs amazingly smooth, no jittering, no lag, no frame rate drop and I have not had a single crash in 84 hours.  Simple truth. 

The iffy?  (it's early access so I won't say bad)

Player characters could use ALOT more customization and could be able to sit in chairs at least?  Seriously what good is a chair if you can't sit in it? Also.. maybe the ability to choose to identify as tall? What's a hobbit without their tall wizard friend? a dead hobbit. 

Some of the armor..  Helmets specifically, look like .. like when you were a kid and your mom, who has not a creative bone in her body, wanted to save money on your Halloween costume and made it herself and now you have no choice but to wear it out of necessity in order to get your candy, no matter how horrible it looks. Seriously, they are that bad.

No weather, at all.  The NPC's talk about building them a house with a roof in order to take them out of the elements. What elements? Where are the elements? Why do you need a roof, it's always sunny, it never snows or rains or storms! It's the perfect weather all year long! 

Lack of water on the map. Not lack of, there is not a single lake, pond, river or even a puddle. Where exactly is my water well getting it's water from? 

Day/Night cycle-  A vast improvement over the demo, I mean..At least there is a small transition now, could still use some work.  

Exploration- The loot can be just...awful..  A lot of the buildings you find are bland on the inside and you find yourself just rushing through things.  The landscape however is very good. It's just not exciting to find another village..camp..ETC. 

By the time I got the final few building blocks, I really lost the need to build anything at all, especially when buildings hardly have a function or purpose. 

Final thoughts- The game is very good as is and fully enjoyable as well as has a TON of potential if the developers listen to the players. Seriously, new additions/changes for the better to this game could make it fantastic!

2429640,THRONE AND LIBERTY,"Good game. Only complaint is: WHY ARE YOU MAKING IT SO LOOT IS DPS BASED. HEALERS/TANKS CAN NEVER GET ANY LOOT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T OUT DPS THE DPS CLASSES!!! Did you fall on your head when you made that system up?! FIX IT! 

Added complaint after much frustration (1 day after review): WHY DO I HAVE TO KILL OVER 500 CRABS FOR ONLY 1 SALT (only an uncommon rarity cooking ingredient, btw) TO LVL COOKING, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MINDS?! 

Edit: Amazon said there is a bug with Lucents (premium paid currency). If you bought Lucents and it shows 0 Lucents (like me), they say they will fix it. I lost 2800+ bought Lucents, so I hope I get them back and FULL COMPENSATION for not being able to use what I bought. Anyways, don't buy anything until they fix this. I have warned you all!

Edit 2: My Lucents are back, but the shop can potentially still be buggy. I don't recommend purchasing until they announce a permanent fix to this issue and hecc, if I was a healer/tank main, I wouldn't even spend on this game until they fix the drop system.

You might have thought the virus was bad for temporarily ruining your social life and turning you into a shut-in. This game will do that to you for good. There is no vaccine.

If you value having a partner, an income, kids, pets or anything meaningful at all, then just stay away from it. If you're determined to go through with it after all, you can expect your family to starve and be replaced by one consisting of role players and animals that don't need to be cared for. ESO will become your new, never-ending job where you're the one paying. The main tasks include scamming people for gold and murdering them for Alliance Points. The remainder of your time is mostly dedicated to inventory management, farming Champion Points and hoarding armor sets for all of your copied builds that are about to get nerfed.

Showing off your fancy gear, titles and houses that no one cares about will be your new pride in life. All your goals are replaced by meaningless in-game achievements. Recognition and wealth in the game will be all you desire. Don't bother trying to escape, they'll just bait you back in by flooding you with daily awards, weekly items, constant events, overpriced crown store items and a sea of DLCs.

Better log in right now and get to work. Your new life awaits.

2842040,Star Wars Outlaws,"I have a love/hate relationship for Ubisoft and Star Wars, however this game is not as bad as people claim it to be. It is not perfect, but it is a solid 6 or 7 out of 10 for a $60 game. 

Positives:
-Pretty good graphics.
-Not an over abundance on resources and not too grindy to get what you need.
-Plenty of replay-ability factor due to the large amount of quests and bounties as well as an occasional ""event"" happening while exploring.

Negatives:
-Some areas on planets feel kinda empty or don't feel ""alive"" as some other areas. You notice this once you are able to travel to other planets.
-The traversal capabilities feel like Assassin's Creed, but toned down in a way where you should be able to climb a rock, but the rock does not let you climb it.
-Some voice lines feels weird or has a weird tone, but nothing too bad.

If you are a fan of Star Wars, this game takes place on familiar worlds in an unfamiliar way, introducing the factions that run the underworld. Kay, the MC, is forced to take on a heist to clear her name. You encounter many different characters, some are friendly (enough) and most are not. 
If you're not a Star Wars fan, but enjoy shooters and/or an open-world game, this game offers both, but you may not be too keen on the story.

427520,Factorio,"This is probably one of the best games I've ever played. Keep in mind, I don't make that statement lightly. Factorio is one part real-time strategy game, one part management tycoon-esque game, and another part survival game. You start with some iron in your inventory and after about 10 hours in, you have an absolutely massive automated factory generally too big for you to see all on one screen yet for some reason you never forget what each part of the factory is doing. You'll go from coal powered machinery billowing out clouds of smog to electric furnaces buzzing with logistic robots. By the end you will see thousands of machine arms moving resources/goods to storage containers, furnaces or assembling machines and assuming you've done it right, it will all go off without a hitch. Trains delivering fresh ore to the main factory lines being unloaded in perfect unison onto conveyor belts to be refined into intermediate products which allow for research and more intense production. I don't even know where to start or end when discussing this game because it's just so damn well done and it's so much fun to play. If ever there was a game worth grabbing for 20 bucks and playing with friends, it was definitely Factorio. I promise you won't regret it.

Pros: 
-Great game for friends to play together. 
-Building mechanics 
-PVP & PVE (though its annoying at times)
-Good graphics that were just updated! Palm trees look great.
-Server versatility (Official, Community, Modded) gives multiple playstyles.
-Amount of map variation. 
-New content regularly. (Electricity, Hot air balloon, Minicopter, New weapons)
-Active Devs. 
-Community (Also a con) You can meet some pretty cool people on here. Ive made a few really good friends. 

Cons:
-Solo can be a struggle for a lot of people. Especially if you arent a PVP god. 
-Bugs still pretty common. Some that can ruin a wipe or hours of work if they happen at the wrong time.
-The devs priorities seem to be a little off of what the community is asking for. Instead of optimization and PVE 
  improvements (the aimbot scientists), they have been focusing on new content which creates more bugs. 
-Community - Almost as toxic as League of Legends. Racism runs wild even though most of them are literal children who 
  think they are being ""edgy"". Even the people that arent toxic are just intentionally annoying (Just dont keep your volume 
  all the way up if you want to have eardrums when you are done)

Despite the cons I honestly believe the Devs care and will address the issues eventually. And they are doing a really good job of keeping the game interesting and fun.

230410,Warframe,"Warframe is a great game, with a few issues surrounding it.

The pros, in my opinion are:
You never feel pressured to buy platinum, since trading is easy and so is getting credits.
Each Frame (Character) that I've owned have all felt unique and pleasurable to play.
The game looks gorgeous, hands down. It's use of lighting and such make it look fantastic.
The missions, while repetitive at times, are enjoyable. Especially if you have a friend with you.
There is a great variety of Frames, Weapons and Mods to challenge yourself to learn.
Co-op is easy, and lag-free as far as what I've experienced.

The cons are:
The game can bug out at times.
Missions can be slightly repetitive, as said before. 
Some players may just stand around doing nothing, or be bad at the game.

1203620,Enshrouded,"While I enjoy the systems and ideas Enshrouded brings forth, as of writing this Review I do not recommend the game due to issues plaguing the combat system. This is not a ""definitive"" Negative review, however, as these things might get patched. On to the review though:

While, yes, the building is phenomenal and a definite step up with the creative freedom it brings it is the danger enemies pose which sours the entire package. Whether gathering materials, food or going for quests, you are bound to fight. The trouble here, though, isn't the ineffectiveness of the playstyles (Magic, Melee, Ranged) but rather the enemies themselves. I play solo, so the following issues aren't derived from a poor connection or such issues:

- Wildly inaccurate tells for hits: Enemies' attacks can be learned and dodged, but there are times where their reach is clearly excessive or the hit-detection is not comparable to the visible model. A good example are boars, who have on one hand a predictible charge and a short-range double-swipe with their tusks...which does not deal damage after a wind-up but immediately on Frame 1 of the animation. Going into melee here guarantees almost a hit unless you count the time between their actions as you cannot visibly gauge when the first of the two hits strikes, resulting in a very cheap hit.

Another example is, in general, the humanoid enemies and how the parry-window isn't clearly defined. There are bear-like humanoids who can only be parried at the start of their attack's wind-up, while the actual attack itself is already in an unparriable state. Shroud enemies and Scavengers' parries tend also to be misaligned from their models, but here I have trouble getting consistent results as well.

- Being hit results in a light stun: One of the most frustrating things is that being hit does not mean ""being hit once"" but ""subjected to the rest of the attack sequence of the enemy"". The on-hit ston of any attack prevents rolling and blocking/parrying, ensuring one mistake is paid dearly for. Some enemies have such multi-combo attacks that you can lose over half your available health after being hit once...which is not ideal.

- The damage is at times excessive: Tying into the above, the damage dealt from those multi-attacks is brutal. In this game, healing is not as feasible outside of spells and potions, both of which require resource-gathering to provide sufficient numbers. The amount of healing provided is great, yet with being hit once consuming already the first type of potion's entire healing capability you go through these quite fast. Farming in this game takes time and the quantity of resources needed for the average person to deal with the damage will be considerate...and that keeps one stuck in the gathering stage rather than exploring the dangerous places for loot and progression.

- Difficulty ramping, armor and content gating: Workstations are unlocked by exploring and finding key components to make them. These are often in the next highest level region than the previous, as expected. The same goes for the resources...and that is where most of the previous issues combine into a major problem: The armour you can craft is limited by the stations you have and the areas where you find the next components has enemies appropriate for that station's provided benefits. Or, in other words, you have to get the means to make better armor in regions where you already need them to survive easier. In solo I am almost required to cheese enemies to not get hit as I intended to play a ranger, but this just feels cheap and not rewarding. Going into melee, however, results in dealing with the jank I spoke of before and that cost me plenty of deaths. Since a lot of progress is done in ruins and places with little elevation I regretted my choice to play a ranger rather quickly as their armor is, as expected, in an even worse position than the tank's own.


I will admit here that I am playing solo, that this is meant to be played with several people and such, yet I don't have the time to go online that often (or more specifically: In a consistent pattern). That means some of my criticisms are part of the way I play, but this doesn't cause them to no longer be an issue: Whomever is going to play a Fighter, on- or offline, will deal with the janky melee combat anyways. The places you have to go to remain as dangerous and while many hands gather more you are bound to consume a lot more too.

As others have said, the building and the rest of the game, especially the scope, are still impressive and will keep me personally interested for a good while. There is 100% a great time here, just at this time there are bugs and a lot of jank you need to accept for the time being. IF you read this far and are weighing your options, let me say this: I reckon these bugs and issues will get addressed in the future, so this negative review is just as temporary (hopefully). I will update this review once these problems have been dealt with, though even now one thing I need to say clearly:

If the above issues are nothing you are concerned with, I do recommend the game whole-heartedly.

Characters aside, the game also has an equipment system that much my previous praise is complex, but even if you are a novice to these type of games it recommends you what it feels would be best for your character. 

In addition to that the game also has abilities not tied to your character that can be looted while exploring the map and defeating camps and bosses.

1643320,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"[h1]You've waited this long Stalker, but you should wait just a bit longer.[/h1]
[b]Fans are praising a game for the IDEA of what it could one day become, but the game's state right now is rough.[/b]
I can't in good faith blindly recommend a game just because I'm a fan. Stalker 2 needs more time, it honestly needed some testing that would reveal all of the problems listed below. Underneath all that is a spirit of the original Shadow of Chernobyl, but just like that game had a rough launch and ran poorly, history repeats itself with the new one as well.

[b]Positives[/b]
+feeling like the original Stalker, random hidden loot stashes, side quests with rewards, roaming gangs of enemies and mutants attack you out of nowhere
+difficulty options, on hardest (Veteran) enemies are quite accurate, mutants deal a lot of damage, guns jamming in middle of fights make it bit more challenging (easy difficulty dumbs the game down for I'd say complete FPS beginners, aka what's shown in game trailers)
+a lot of different anomalies which are deadly, different weathers, even zone emissions that kill NPCs that for some reason stand outside, when they're right next to a house - free loot I guess
+story has been interesting so far, nothing eye rolling, I'm curious if there are actual consequences for the different actions you can take and if you'll get to see people that you've saved later on


[b]Negatives[/b]
-TLDR: poor performance - you must use DLSS or FSR to have playable FPS of 40-60, bugs, glitches, missing features, AI spawning out of thin air or forgetting that you're fighting them, low carry weight limit, very expensive repairs for damaged gear and weapons, no mixed audio of English and Ukrainian for main and side quests, so you either play completely with subtitles and miss key info because you were randomly attacked or you'll have American English for ALL NPCS
-when looting dead enemies, you don't see faction that the person belonged to or their rank either, just a name that's nothing saying
-unable to loot mutants for their body parts, to sell them later on
-using a uniform of a faction doesn't seem to protect against that faction, they still attack you
-can't see the standing with faction going up or down when doing certain actions, like killing the members of that faction
-bloodsucker on Veteran (hardest difficulty) runs towards me, attacks me for about 80% of my hp, then cloaks and runs away, giving me enough time to quick heal but not enough time to sometimes even reload my gun - and he keeps doing this over and over until either I kill him or he kills me
-bloodsucker on Veteran tanks about 3 mags of ammo from an AR - I've killed about 5 of them so far, in certain areas where his spawn is scripted and there's not enough room, I literally could just empty half a mag into him, quick heal, get attacked, heal attack and repeat - is it supposed be this way ?
-enemies seem to randomly spawn out of thin air, on several occasions they've spawn right in front of my eyes, I've even looted a bandit hideout's stash and then saw them teleport in like Scotty beamed them down from Enterprise or something
-enemies randomly forget that they're in a firefight with me, they'll stop attacking and go back to their routine of walking around, hilariously at this moment game allows me to Quick save because the threat is gone
-headshots from a pistol deal randomly more damage than headshots from an AR - I've cleared an entire army base and most of those kills were with a pistol, because it killed the soldiers sometimes in one hit, sometimes in two or three, vs several scoped in aimed hits with an AR, very strange
-a LARGE amount of healing supplies - on Veteran I didn't expect to have 25 medkits and 30 bandages just by going around and looting some bandits and stash or two, I've started to sell healing supplies because they increase total weight and I won't use so many, plus I keep finding more and more - is there supposed to be so much healing ?
-inability to remove attachments from weapons - I've had an AK from a stash with scope, it was for the first several hours the only gun with a scope that I've had, the repairs were too expensive and I couldn't just remove a scope that literally just slides at the top of the rails - bug maybe ?
-almost every gun that I loot from any enemy that was using it as broken and marked as red - I can't sell it, I can't do anything with it - wasn't there supposed to be maybe a dismantle feature or at least HUD overview of the gun's durability % when you mouse over it on the ground, since you can either loot the gun or empty it's mag by holding the button ?
-textures glitching in and out of existence, texture flicker - I'm on newest drivers but this problem is sometimes running wild, I've had a side character who got downed and his textures stretched out of existence when I've gotten near him, so I couldn't heal him, walls sometimes ""shake"" and flicker without any anomaly near it
-lighting in rooms - sometimes when looking into a room from outside, even when it's not sunny, the room is pitch black, like the lights forgot to work ? and when looking outside from a room, the whole outside is blown out like a sun erosion, extreme brightness
-gun sound sometimes not working, so you're firing a gun, see enemies get hit and hear nothing or they're firing but you don't hear it
-weight limit - the original game had quite a strict weight limit, but I swear in this game I can't figure out what's so heavy when half the time I don't have THAT MUCH on me and somehow I'm near a limit, even with a better gear
-from the 10 different types of artifacts I've had so far, all had Radiation as negative trait - wasn't there supposed to be some variety ? Also, shouldn't we have some artifact that reduces the radiation, so that we could effectively use the Extra weight artifacts ? cause otherwise I'm chugging energy drinks to keep moving faster, anti rads to reduce the radiation from artifacts and then get into gunfight under these conditions
-after the first kill, AI instantly knows where I am and even enemies that couldn't see me suddenly fire at me across half a map - the AI was supposed to not use aimbot and instead be more sophisticated, so why does it look and feel like it's using aimbot ? especially when sometimes they see me when I can't even see them and open fire at me, literally 300m away from my position is not a problem for them, how ?
-sadly you either play in one language or the other, so side quest NPCs and even random bandits will be either talking in English or Ukrainian, it's not mixed that main quest would be in English and rest in Ukrainian, either all or none
-no dynamic lighting - a key feature that was in the original Stalker and has allowed it to preserve its atmosphere well
-easy difficulty in my opinion makes the game so easy that it loses its own identity and essence, it was clearly used for production of several game trailers, where enemies miss shots like they're Stormtroopers in a tunnel
-lastly, game has crashed once, it has also forced me to reload last save several times due to bugs

To all the joke and fake positive reviews...Being a fan is okay, excusing everything because of your love for a franchise is not however. You're not doing your beloved game a good service by lying to others about the current state of it. People blinded by your review will try it, refund it and possibly never touch it again. The zone will not gain new Stalkers, it'll lose more of them this way. So please, consider writing fair, honest and helpful reviews.

To be honest, for how long this game was in development, how many times its release date was pushed back another year and what we've been shown in trailers, I was expecting a more finished and polished Stalker experience, than something janky that you could compare to game from 15 years ago.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Edit: TL:DR 
Best MMORPG I've ever played, definitely worth checking out. One character, ALL content including classes, jobs etc. BASE GAME AND FIRST EXPANSION ARE NOW FREE TO PLAY, with some restrictions. 

BTW. I have made some updates to this review to reflect patches.

I gave up WoW (or World of Warcraft) For this game. Why? You only need one character to play every class. [strike]The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs.[/strike] (Edit: They changed this feature not too long ago to make all classes self contained. They still level up into Jobs but you are no longer required to have a sub class to unlock the Job.) 

You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 95% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF! You don't have to be in a guild or part of a clique. The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive (on some realms...like Molboro!). 

Dungeons are part of a finder in game. There is also a personal/free company housing system that allows you to have a space to show off and decorate in. As of Shadowbringers, dungeons in end game can now be done with a Trust system where you run with NPCs. There was also an update to squadrons that let you do up to heavensward with a handpicked NPC group.

The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing. The (original) opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words. Square has really outdone themselves with this title and I can't wait to see how they wow me with FFXV!

Edit: As per a commented question, The sub options come in 30/90/180 day increments and can be set up as recurring (thanks Pasty858). 180 days is roughly $78.
As a further Edit: The sub is required to access the game and comes in two types, one that allows only one character per realm (all that is really needed) and one that lets you have up to 8 (I think) characters per realm (for the altoholics). The 1 character per realm Sub is less expensive.

Also, anyone who would like to share in the recruit a friend benefits, message me.

SO! Its been a while since I've played. after logging over 200 hours that weren't counted on here, and doing everything short of Savage content, I have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again. But this game. The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming. It was amazing! 

Edit as of Dec 12, 2020
I'm now playing on the Ps4 as well as Pc, have logged another 1000 hours and am almost endgame again, I was not thrilled with Stormblood but Shadowbringers is amazing so far!


If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month ([strike]or 14day[/strike] trial now goes up to heavensward content, see below) trial period!

A note to anyone new, the free trial is now available all the way up through level 60 and the first expansion Heavensward! I'm not sure how long the trial lasts, but it free to anyone and now is the best time to jump in! Exp has been increased, Main Storyline Quests have been optimized and new Jobs have been added.

I would like to add a note, now that I have finished MSQ for Shadowbringers, please don't level skip. If you do, please at least go back and learn basics. If you're not interested in the story, fine but don't let that stop you from being the best you can be at your chosen role.

The graphics looks like old from 20 years ago, i was exptected to be mindblowing, but its like a remastered of the first game. In the term of graphics looks bad. Performance is ok-ishhh i own a 4070, first i got 3 crashes in 1hr, after that i downloaded the new driver and it was ok, but still sometimes i got fps drops. The engine dude come on unreal engine, what a big let down. In game sometimes i die and i dont know what killed me, i see in town npc stuck in the walls. I see a puddle of water in town and i told myself wow would be nice to see my reflection, but crap i couldn't even see my shadow and my settings were on epic. On the veteran difficulty the invisible enemy 1 shot you and you need 1 clip or more to kill it, and dog jumps are like wth you can't dodge or nothing, everything you do they still hit you, its just lol. The voice acting in english was very disappointing.

230410,Warframe,"After 100 hours of Warframe, I thought I would write a review too. I should have enough knowledge by now.

The ""Free2Play"" system:

First of all, it has to be said that Warframe consists of almost 99% PVE / Coop missions. The PVP area is (in my opinion) not worth mentioning and is therefore ignored.

Even if there are always people who say: ""Warframe is Pay2Win"". NO IT IS NOT!!
1. One can only speak of Pay2Win if it would give one an advantage in the fight against other players. Since the PVE & PVP area are separate from each other anyway, this aspect is omitted.
2. Warframe is at most Pay2Fast or as I like to call it: Pay2Beautiful.
Everything there is in the game can also be imagined. Only cosmetic items are an exception. And even if you were to buy everything in terms of weapons, Warframes, etc. with real money, you would still have to level it yourself and improve it with mods. And that's not so easy to buy.

Conclusion: Everything you need to play and have fun can also be imagined. Some things are easier, some more difficult, but one thing is certain: YOU NEED TIME! So Warframe is not for people who only check it out once a week. If you start with WF you should be sure that you want to play this for some time.

The graphic

Bombastic! For someone who has seen the graphics development over the past few years, all I can say is that Warframe looks beautiful and is constantly improving. Just watch videos from 2013 and compare them with the current state. You will notice the difference immediately.
The only disadvantage: Your PC should have something on the box. Above all, the many particle effects bring some frame rates to their knees. But it's best to take a look at the recommended requirements to be on the safe side.

The story

I'm not going to say anything about that. I think everyone should find out for themselves and enjoy.

Warframes and weapons

A variety that is rarely found anywhere else. Dozens of warframes (the heroes you control) and weapons are waiting to be discovered. Each Warframe has 4 unique abilities. From the DMG dealer to the tank to the supporter, everything is covered.
Of course, there is always a primary, secondary and melee weapon. And there are plenty of them.
Each weapon plays differently and thus provides plenty of variety, just like with the Warframes.

The opponents

Of course, you have to test your newly built Warframes and weapons on someone. And that's where the opponents come into play. There are several types that differ greatly from one another. Which Warframe is particularly useful against which faction and which weapon does the most damage to the enemy, you will find out for yourself over time. But let me tell you: It's a lot of damn fun !!

Missions

Missions are divided into different types. Extinction, rescue, espionage, and defense, to name a few. Every mission requires good preparation. Which Warframe do I take with me, which enemy faction do I compete against, what kind of weapons do I have with me, etc.
No mission is like another and it takes some practice before you know exactly what to do.

Final words and tips

Don't start Warframe alone. Find a friend who starts with you and / or who has even played the game before you.
Warframe has gotten better at explaining over time, but it still likes to leave new players in the dark. Keeping track of everything at first can be difficult, and the amount of things you can do doesn't make it any easier.

So here's my tip: Find a clan early on and don't be stingy to ask questions. The more you learn about the game and its mechanics, the more fun you will have. Once you have understood the principle, the rest will come by itself.","Very Positive87% of the 598,811 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1203620,Enshrouded,"This is a wonderful game, the base building is top notch, exploration feels so grand and nothing feels un-obtainable. I dropped 80 hours and not quite finished but, i had a wonderful time. This game has serious potential and I'm eagerly waiting for the game to grow. The community is great and there's SO MANY SECRETS! Search everything! Bosses are challenging (if you want easymode play Mage lol) Just be mindful when playing archer, you're going to spend most of your time collecting branches. It wasn't egregious but, other areas should give more/less or something, or trees giving more. I'd love to see world bosses, challenge areas and team content you ""phase"" into. The first run through, it can be difficult but, if you're mindful of things around you, you'll be fine. 

This is a 9/10 EA game for me, easily can hit 100/10, the team here did a wonderful job and I'm waiting as patiently as possible.

Fantastic, if survival games and exploration are your thing, its great. Note: Its fun with friends but, it's common to see something and run to it, which with friends, doesn't go great but its not bad. 

Wishlist. 

1. Random Dungeons for replayability
2. challenge zones (always 10+ levels higher, have to be clever)
3. Scaling mode (1st zone +5, 2nd +6 and so on to keep a good challenge)
4. Larger loot pool
5. Multiplayer Lock Features
6. Base Lock Features
7. PVP/Wars
8. Would love to see some bosses come back hyper-corrupted later on w/ diff colors. (or crazy variants, like you never really ""defeat"" it)
9. Ability to drive back shroud, for a time of an area. or maybe shroud takes over other areas later? also, could be cool. 
10. random events, mirages, zombies pretending to be human, mimics, trapped chests, Meteors? corrupted shroud monsters, elites?. 
11. WEATHER! This would just drive immersion, maybe even Shrouded Rain?
12. megafauna/flora
13. more element types? Elemental Archer? Battlemage? Barbarian? Zerker?
14. more ways to do stealth (short range teleport stealth?, dagger throw, etc)
15. way more weapons! Crossbows, Tomes, dual shields, any thrown weapons
16. Coating your arrows in the field, maybe flower/bug discovery?
17. Ziplines? to go up and down? Sometimes shrouds are so big you have to know a way out and people resort to cheese tactics (Not mentioning because i dont want people to know)
18. Bosses with non damage mechanics. Dumping lava on them, Pulling wheels, ropes, cutting things,  debuff auras. 
19. Lots of people mention NPCs but I really like the desolate feel however, we should be able to release traders? Get supplies from one town to another, caravan protect maybe?
20. more jumping puzzles and more clever secrets! I LOVE what you did!
21. Pinnacle bosses/ascendencies?
22. Scaling respec costs
23. Hint system for finding new blocks or perhaps a treasure hunter skill point? (1pt find white chests, 2 find blue, 4 find silver, 6 find rare, 10 find troves, then skill points for how far this ability works? even if its a mana/stamina cost? would be neat.
24. I know there's a lot of game to go and I hope some of these ideas are on your plate. Expansions to the current systems would be great.
25. More in depth combat later on. Combos, enemy AI adjustments (Archer? They come looking or chase further, warrior? They pull out more range or set up barricades, Healer? Target them first. Assassin, once you disappear, they throw alarms/horns?
26. Better minimap icons or custom text/ naming your hideouts!
27. Dying armor?
28. Larger weapon crafting/more variability in chests?
29. Biome world bosses? That could be super cool!

Anyone can be an idea guy, I'm just tossing out things that i love in other games, I love the finesse yall put on the game and this was a truly wonderful time.

1643320,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl,"A very early review and a warning for anyone with accessibility needs that REQUIRE the use of key rebinding (Like myself)

The key rebinding system at the point of release is half baked at best. Whilst it allows for rebinding it doesn't cover 100% of the use cases. 

For example, the lamp quick access control is L and is not rebind-able. I rebind my left movement key to L doing so works you move left, but you also toggle your lamp on and off. Another issue which you run into very early in the game is ladders. Ladder actions are not rebound to your new movement keys. Definitely feels like the devs added the ability but nobody every did a play through doing so. 

This is a huge disappointment to someone like myself who has been very excited for the release of this game and make its very difficult for me to play. 

Additional points. The optimisation of the game really is as bad as the early reviewers say. I am running a 4070ti with the latest drivers and I have it on medium settings with DLSS on and I am wildly bouncing between 50 - 80 fps which feels AWFUL. Not had a proper play around with the settings yet as I wanted to get stuck into the game and I am sure I can make tweaks, but would of been nice if the auto detect settings had worked and not just put everything on epic. 

Overall I am really initially disappointed and I hope to update this review shortly as updates and patches role out, but for now I cant recommend it, based on my own experiences.","Mostly Positive79% of the 25,476 user reviews for this game are positive.",early warning accessibility need require key rebinding key rebinding release half baked best whilst allows rebinding cover 100 case example lamp quick access control l not_rebind able rebind left movement key l work move left toggle lamp issue early ladder ladder action not_rebound movement key definitely feel play huge disappointment someone excited release difficult play additional point optimisation bad early reviewer running 4070ti latest driver medium setting dl wildly bouncing 50 80 shooter feel awful not_had proper play setting wanted stuck tweak nice auto detect setting worked not_just epic initially disappointed hope shortly update patch role cant recommend based experience

As a long time magic player and a big fan of the game itself, I can't recommend MTG:A due to its terrible economy system. The game is very unfriendly for free-to-play players if they want to play constructed competitively. The wildcard system sucks and you will soon find you are constantly bottle necked on rare wild cards due to most mana bases eating them up. If money is no object then Arena is a fine place to play constructed.

If you are a limited junky and want to draft the latest set online, then this is the place to do it. Drafting is so easy on Arena and I can find a table and matches at anytime of day. 

If you are just getting into digital TCGs I recommend trying out other games that are more f2p friendly such as Legends of Runeterra

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"[b]Anime-GF Fantasy XIV:[/b]
First of all, there are many F2P players in FFXIV and, if you're wanting to be one of them, [b]DON'T PURCHASE THE GAME ON STEAM!![/b] This will force you into paying for a membership after 30 days of ""free"" play time, so I would recommend downloading through FFXIV's website first, you can always purchase the game on Steam afterwards. [b]Once you pay for a membership, YOU CAN NEVER GO BACK TO BEING F2P ON THAT ACCOUNT.[/b]

[b]Pros:[/b]
- The fanbase in-game is (usually) pretty nice, people are helpful most of the time.
- Socialising is huge in this game (in-game clubs, RP events etc), but it's all completely optional.
- Certain servers have boosts that help new players get to endgame quicker.
- The first two DLCs are free. I take my time with this game and, 447hrs in, I'm still at the 2nd DLC.
- The fashion options are pretty amazing.
- Most players are 18+, so you won't have to deal with annoying kids who grief (MOST of the time).
- A lot of different jobs to pick from and you can do every single job in the game on one single character, so no need to level up 15 different characters and switch whenever you feel like changing things up.
- A mixture of easy and hard jobs for those new to MMOs and MMO veterans.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- In order to get certain buffs, you HAVE to join a clan (in-game they are called Free Companies).
- A lot of characters tend to look the same.
- 447hrs in and I haven't been interested in the story once.
- A lot of people in clans (Free Companies) tend to be dead-set on creating drama (in my experience).

If FFXIV sounds even remotely interesting to you, I'd definitely give it a go, [b]but just make sure to download FFXIV from the website and don't purchase it through steam until you're 100% sure you want to commit to a paid monthly membership. Purchasing the game through Steam locks you into a paid membership, but you can play F2P (free to play) on the website download forever (until you decide you want to pay).[/b]","Very Positive87% of the 71,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",anime gf fantasy play_emphasizeders ffxiv wanting purchase force paying membership 30 day play recommend downloading ffxiv website purchase afterwards pay membership never_go play b_emphasized pro fanbase usually pretty nice helpful socialising huge club rp event completely optional certain server boost help player endgame quicker dlcs 447hrs 2nd downloadable additional released initial launch fashion option pretty amazing player 18 deal annoying kid grief different job pick single on_emphasizede single no_need 15 different character switch whenever changing thing mixture easy hard job mmos massively multiplayer veteran con order certain buff join clan called company character tend 447hrs interested clan company tend dead set creating drama ffxiv sound remotely interesting d_emphasizedefinitely b_emphasizedut download ffxiv website purchase 100 commit paid monthly membership purchasing lock paid membership play play play website download forever decide pay
1085660,Destiny 2,"It has been a hell of a journey, had some great times and some pretty awful times. It is sad to say this but it's time to move on.

Bungie has destroyed itself, Destiny is on it's knees and it's future looks bleak! even the top content creators have left.

As someone with almost 1.5k hours on PC and god knows how many on PS, I think my opinion deserves to be here. Going to keep this short and sweet!

The current story format, or should we say numbed down seasons is awful, there is no future for the game and if you are just starting out now, don't. A hell of a lot of content is no longer accessible, so much for vaulting it and rotating it in and out.

Look at all the lay offs, even the higher ups have gone, apart from the vile creature that brags about his cars.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"EA removes Linux support from perfectly working game to ""supposedly"" prevent smallest fraction of cheaters and effectively ban all players from biggest PC handheld and the only Windows alternative instead of improving backend cheat detection. The real reason is most likely them not wanting to spend more $ on supporting 2% playerbase and make sure the line goes up.

They do that instead of fixing literally myriad of issues:
- laggy and generally bad servers running on 20 tickrate.
- terrible SBMM that puts you against absolute bots the first game you play on the day to make sure you stomp them and get that dopamine burst, only to make sure you are bot next time in a full pred lobby.
- smurfs with <100 lvl account getting 20 kills per game.

2679460,Metaphor: ReFantazio,"I didn't know going in that this game would borrow so much of its structure from Persona 5.  I enjoyed this game quite a lot, but having already played (and enjoyed) Persona 5, I was hoping for something less similar.

Things I liked:
- Strong narrative with great characters
- Interesting job system implementation
- the balancing of dungeon crawling with activities that support dungeon crawling (much like P5)
- Great visual design and music

Things I didn't like so much:
- Sometimes exhausting level of repetition in dialog
- Unlocking new jobs is locked behind social links, which are arbitrarily time-gated
- There is a real-time combat system where you can hit (or be hit by) enemies to gain a massive advantage (or disadvantage) in turn-based combat.  I would prefer a system where the magnitude of the advantage/disadvantage isn't so large.
- There isn't a whole lot of depth to the dungeons themselves... compared to a game like SMTIII, where there were many unique effects in different dungeons (eg: portals, holes, dark areas, damage areas, mazes, puzzles), here a large majority of dungeons have no notable mechanics; you just run around, kill the enemies, and loot treasure chests.","Very Positive91% of the 10,386 user reviews for this game are positive.",borrow structure persona 5 enjoyed already enjoyed persona 5 hoping similar thing liked strong narrative great character interesting implementation balancing dungeon crawling activity support dungeon crawling p5 great visual design music thing exhausting repetition dialog unlocking job locked social link arbitrarily gated real combat enemy gain massive advantage disadvantage turn based combat prefer magnitude advantage disadvantage large depth dungeon compared smtiii unique effect different dungeon eg portal hole dark area damage area maze puzzle large majority dungeon no_notable mechanic kill enemy item reward dropped defeated enemy treasure chest

Their DLC approach is absolutely atrocious. CK2/EU4 have both got a couple dozen DLCs over the years with a combined price of soon-to-hit-300$ - expect the same to happen to this game too.

Besides that, Paradox has increased (up to 100% increase in some regions) prices in many regions without any announcement beforehand, right before the Steam Summer Sale 2017.

3097560,Liar's Bar,"Fun and simple game! However if you're looking to play as a random, you're gonna be frustrated a lot of the time. If you got a group of buddies willing to shell out 7 bucks then this isn't a big deal, but as a solo player, there's some things you should be aware of:

- Game is P2P, which doesn't matter but if the host leaves it doesn't transfer to the next person, it ends the game. If the host dies, the game is guaranteed to be ended.

- While it is fun and simple, the gameplay loop gets old fairly quick. I think the addition of voice helps this, but there isn't enough banter or player interaction to help keep the gameplay fresh.

- In addition to the loop getting old, the game can drag on for a long time depending on how many shots from the revolver it takes to kill a player. It is always interesting to see if you'll live or not in the roulette parts, but otherwise, you'll most likely see players disconnecting mid match once they're dead or even prior.

Like I said, a fun game that obviously is aware of it's flaws and I hope takes the opportunity to expand on itself instead of leaving it as it is for the public to get trendy with before throwing it away like other games (Chained Together, Content Warning, Lethal Company, etc). It's always a shame when games are made and used as mediums for content and clip farming instead of being actual games, and I think the potential for this is high enough for it to become something more than that.","Very Positive86% of the 14,683 user reviews for this game are positive.",fun simple play random gon na frustrated group buddy willing shell 7 buck big deal solo s_emphasizedome thing aware pay play matter host leaf t_emphasizedransfer next end host dy guaranteed ended fun simple loop get old fairly quick addition voice help banter interaction help fresh addition loop old drag long depending shot revolver take kill interesting live not_in roulette part player disconnecting mid dead prior fun obviously aware flaw hope take opportunity expand leaving public trendy throwing game chained warning lethal company shame game medium clip repeatedly defeating enemy completing task gain resource actual game potential high

Arena has some issues as far as money-grubbing, but when you realize a $20 Arena deck costs well over $400 in paper, it's a non-issue.

Arena is 100% worth playing and at least trying out. The tutorial gives you some basic packs and wildcards to build a starter deck, and if you do some research and spend wildcards wisely, you can have a competitive deck easily.

For people that want to take the game a little more seriously, you can spend $20 per season (usually 4 per year) for the battlepass, which spits out gold and gems to buy packs, as well as wildcards, very quickly. I have been playing for about 2 years and have spent maybe $100 total and reached Mythic a few times without too much issue. The game also has a TON of events that you can participate in, such as tournaments, deckbuilding challenges, limited release sets, and more.

TLDR: It's a fun game with friends and sometimes randoms too, but get it early based on your tolerance for the issues below
+Graphics, effects, the game looks nice
+Plenty of weapons and utilities to unlock
+Situations get quickly hectic with swarms of enemies
+Satisfying bombardment support, with large explosions, minigun, napalm, laser and even a nuke
+Death can be quickly countered, with limited revives though
-only 2 enemy factions, with different enemy types yes, but it needs more variety
-shooting is arcady, aiming and response needs some work, especially first person perspective is quite bad
-bugs, glitches: getting stuck on terrain, getting stuck while picking up items, glitching through textures of your own ship and having to quit and join up with friends again, hard crashes of the game, failing to join players through match making, getting stuck on forever loading screen even while solo traveling to your ship
-unfinished features: random selection of leader of the squad, no ability to promote to leader so you have to quit and join together again after match making, missing markers on important upgrades in the ship for starters, unlocks system is very basic and at the start quite grindy, your ship feels empty, on the planets - long distances to run with often nothing to do meanwhile (The Division flashbacks), rescue missions are so far the most annoying as three of you stand next to buttons, sending waves of dumb humans to run through hordes of enemies (they even climb on top of the enemies or run right into them), certain enemies feel almost indestructible with your limited weaponry in the early levels, poor explanation of difficulties and really strange difficulty spike very early on, customization of your character is extremely basic - 2 body types, 4 voice packs and no face/hair etc (strangely, no male / female, it's Brawny / Lean body and then Voice 1-4, plus your female character is just a smaller guy model) - strange for a game with strong comedy and parody themes
-voice chat with open mic, you can mute it - sometimes it's funny, other times not so much

If you have some friends to play with, this game can be a fun experience. Just a bit repetitive, with only two enemy factions and after certain point, there's nothing to spend your resources on. They've added several new paid weapon passes, but majority of the important stuff is unlockable just by playing the game, so you'll be missing out on just some new weapons.

// So the updates seem to focus now on adding more paid warbonds, there's 7 in total, 1 can be unlocked by playing and others have to be purchased ($10 per 1) and contain unique weapons like explosive, electric and chemical ones. In a paid coop game, putting new content behind paywall while nerfing regular weapons constantly, not a fair deal for players.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"Simply put, this game franchise has become trashy shovelware and is pumping out new titles that are not worth even a fraction of the price. There is nothing new here. They took all the terrible elements added to COD gameplay over the past few releases and simply doubled-down in their efforts to make them more prevalent. This release is the equivalent of buying a Madden game every year with nothing new to offer other than new player rosters. It's the same exact over-produced, unsatisfying game you already have in MW1.

This game doesn't know what it wants to be. Do you want to be an arcade shooter, or do you want to focus on realism? Gunplay is low-effort and with unrealistically easy recoil control, yet weapon swapping during reloads renders the reload ""incomplete"" to place a focus on immersion and realism? Getting up from prone position takes longer than your average geriatric, but players can slip-n-slide around corners at warp speed? To make matters worse, the game was released at launch with no way to turn off crossplay to combat the overpowered aim-assist offered to console players, not to mention having to listen to comms coming from console headsets whose quality is barely a step above a Campbell's soup can on a string. The increased emphasis on aim-assist makes even your average console gamer outgun top PC players with absolutely no effort (watch some videos on the enhancements to aim-assist if you want proof).

The maps are unimaginative and provide little to no opportunities for fun, long-range gun fights. Focus is 100% on extreme CQC where stringing together more than just a few kills is a rarity due to how quickly players can maneuver around the map. Spawn points don't matter as the maps are so small enemies are already up your ass within seconds of spawning. They may as well have released a game that only included the Shipment map since that's the direction they're going in anyway.

I started with multiplayer, then played the campaign, and ultimately waited until the Warzone release to leave this review. The campaign was stale and timelines were once again murky by relying on the same characters over and over. Only the new characters provided any real interest. No mission comes even close to providing the shock value of No Russian or other popular campaign missions, but you can tell they're trying their damned hardest (and failing) by bringing the fight to US soil. Warzone is another huge disappointment. All the elements of a satisfying, realistic battle royale are completely missing in COD's multiple attempts.

If want you want is completely disorganized chaos with a low skill ceiling, unimaginative gameplay, and nothing new to offer, go for it. I think you're wasting $70, especially if you're a PC gamer. The real money is in the controller crowd, not M&K, so this company will never focus on gameplay and quality-of-life aspects for PC gamers.","Mixed58% of the 653,780 user reviews for this game are positive.",simply franchise trashy shovelware pumping title not_worth fraction price took terrible element cod past release simply doubled effort prevalent release equivalent buying madden offer roster exact produced unsatisfying already mw1 want arcade shooter focus realism gunplay low effort unrealistically easy recoil control weapon swapping reloads render reload incomplete focus immersion realism prone position take longer average geriatric player slip n slide corner warp speed matter worse released launch no_way turn crossplay combat overpowered aim assist offered console player not_to mention listen comms console headset quality barely campbell s_emphasizedoup string increased emphasis aim assist make average console gamer outgun top pc player no_effort watch video enhancement aim assist proof map unimaginative provide no_opportunities fun long range gun fight focus 100 extreme cqc stringing kill rarity due quickly player maneuver player enemy enter world point matter map small enemy already as second spawning released included shipment direction anyway started mode multiple player interact compete real series connected mission level form storyline waited warzone release leave series connected mission level form storyline stale timeline murky relying character character provided real interest no_mission come close providing shock value no_russian popular series connected mission level form storyline mission trying damned hardest failing bringing fight soil warzone huge disappointment element satisfying realistic battle royale completely missing cod multiple attempt completely disorganized chaos low skill ceiling unimaginative offer wasting 70 especially pc gamer real controller crowd not_m k company never_focus quality life aspect pc gamers
730,Counter-Strike 2,"CS2: A Symphony of Screams, Spinners, and Slurs (But Hey, at Least the Skins Work)
Let's be honest, stepping into CS2 feels a bit like time-traveling to a gamer gulag where the only language spoken is a furious blend of Russian curses and guttural screams. Sure, you might encounter the occasional gifted individual spinning in circles while somehow clicking heads (impressive, I guess?), but mostly you're dodging cheaters who make Tinder look like a haven of trust and honesty.

Valve, my dear billion-dollar company, how can you replace a perfectly good black chair (CS:GO) with a yellow armchair (CS2) and call it an upgrade? And don't even get me started on the server browser – it's like a digital wasteland from 2011, infested with more fake Russian servers than actual players.

But hey, at least the microtransactions and gambling features are always working flawlessly. Priorities, right? Oh, and did I mention the racism? It's so abundant, you'd think you stumbled into a history museum dedicated to the 1700s.

On a serious note: While the screaming children and newfound multilingual cursing abilities might make me a better father (according to some), the lack of a proper anti-cheat, the removal of beloved features, and the blatant dishonesty of merging CS:GO reviews into CS2's are just unacceptable. Bring back CS:GO, fix the rampant cheating, and maybe, just maybe, CS2 can live up to its potential. Until then, I'll be over here practicing my Russian and Brazilian Portuguese, dreaming of the good old days of surf maps and 400 fps.

2358720,Black Myth: Wukong,"After 20 something hours in the game I think I finally have a better grasp on what the games about now. If you want the TLDR of it then I'd say the game is worth picking up, whilst the game certainly has its quirks, it also has really solid gameplay, amazing graphics and a surprisingly compelling story-line for those willing to look deeper into the game. I'd say those reasons make the game worth trying if nothing else.

For those interested in hearing me ramble for a bit, I'd say that this game really wasn't anything that I expected it to be, someone likened it to Chinese God of War, and I’ll admit I can understand why, the levelling system and limited weapons options are very reminiscent of God of War 2018 with attacks and movies being very weighty and full of depth. Personally, I initially thought of game like lies of p with its linear map design and story chapters but the longer I’ve played this the more I’ve realised that Black myth Wukong is a game that subverts expectations.

In the beginning I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of challenge that enemies presented, I thought that the enemies died too quickly and that you had way too much stamina to really strategize with your moves, so combat felt button mashy with no real depth since “ you could easily dodge everything, like,  it wasn’t as if you’d run of stamina anyway” and this made the otherwise cool levelling system useless since I already felt overpowered. Then I encountered wandering wight (the second mini boss) and realised that you needed to have that much stamina otherwise you can’t even participate in the battles much less win.

Then I felt that the game just had too many boss battles, so much so that with how linear the game was it felt like it was a boss rush game with very little to explore or lore to encounter, just boss battle then cutscene a then further boss battles, but this couldn’t be further from the case. While the game has a strong focus on boss battles, it also has many storylines, quests, even hidden lore, cutscenes and entirely new maps to explore for anyone interested in looking. The thing is though, the game is more than happy to have you miss these huge bits of content, the lack of an in-game map and the many invisible walls also make it a little challenging to notice initially but when you do you realise there is a lot more to the game than initially seems with content far more engaging than you’d have thought.

The game subverts these expectations over and over until you start wondering if the flaw you notice in the game is really a flaw or if it's something that's been addressed and you just haven’t gotten far enough or looked deeply enough for it to be resolved. This is the reason that I thought I had to play for a bit before I could comment on it and after so many hours, I think I get finally get it. 

I can honestly recommend this as a game worth trying and many only real complaints with it are the often-obnoxious invisible walls and the lack of a player hub of some sort that's unanimously safe. that and the sharpening feature on fsr that makes the images look so much worse. but overall game of the year

2669320,EA SPORTS FC™ 25,"Hmm, where should I begin? Normally, I don't write game reviews, but in the case of FC25, I couldn't resist.

Is the gameplay smoother and more refined? Yes.
Are there new game modes and features? Yes.
Does it feel like a brand-new game? No.

The updates feel more like a phone software upgrade—adding a new slide bar but not much more. I’ve always wondered why EA doesn’t just make the game free-to-play and adopt a season pass system. That way, we could keep our players and the progress we've worked so hard (and spent so much money) on, instead of resetting everything to zero and charging another $100 for minimal improvements!

Like PES, EA could easily make the game free and generate revenue through packs, season passes, and other in-game purchases. Just let us keep the players we've invested so much time and money into!

But since I know EA won’t see this, and even if they did, they wouldn’t care, I can only hope that one day a more honest company will take notice and build a game that truly values its players.","Mixed45% of the 21,642 user reviews for this game are positive.",hmm normally write review fc25 resist smoother refined yes mode feature yes brand no_the update phone software upgrade adding slide bar not_much wondered play adopt season pas player progress worked hard spent resetting zero charging 100 minimal improvement pe easily generate revenue pack season pass purchase player invested care hope honest company notice build truly value player
1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Look, I've played games for about 25  years and as such have had my fair share of disappointments. That being said, I'd like my review to be objective and not 'DUR GAME BAD!'

First off... Cyberpunk is not a bad game. 

It has many technical issues and can be repetitive at the best of times, but this is a passably enjoyable open world game. The likes of which we've seen many times in recent years. This may, in fact, be part of the problem. Cyberpunk, for its part, is gorgeous and some of the characters are even enjoyable. Parts of the story genuinely had me curious as to what would happen next. While character customization is lacking, the equipment, weapons and vehicles are not. 

What Cyberpunk truly suffers from however, is a lack of heart. At its core, this game feels empty. The world, to me, feels like a video game world. Which is the opposite of what you want. Contrast it with CDPR's Witcher 3 or Rockstar's Red Dead series and you'll see just how lifeless the game is. The NPCs are background filler. They aren't even pretending to be real people. While the map is genuinely amazing, its bogged down by its populous and technical mistakes. From atrocious pop-in, broken quests, to some of the strangest bugs I've ever seen in a triple A game, Cyberpunk does itself no favors technically. Despite the potential to do a million things, I would compare it to a Far Cry game. All those things are repeated a thousand times over each district. Truthfully the formula is fun for a solid 50-100 hours, depending on your stamina. I personally was disappointed in it because I expected more for a full price game from a professional studio. Yes all games have a level of repeat-ability, but from a studio who prides itself on making rich game worlds...this wasn't that. 

Personally, I wouldn't recommend the game right now. Maybe when modders get into the bones and make a world actually worth exploring it will be worth it. Or if the game drops to $20. For now, I'd wait for your next big title. This one just didn't live up to what it wanted to be.","Very Positive84% of the 693,658 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.
