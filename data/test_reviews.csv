569480,Kingdoms and Castles,"For the $10 price tag, I can recommend this game. However, any future increase in price must be accompanied by new content, in my opinion. 

What I like about the game is that it is very relaxing. In-game music is soothing, and it's interesting sitting back and watching your townspeople complete their everyday tasks. It's a simple game, making it very easy for you to get the hang of very quick. 

What I don't like about the game is that it lacks depth. While this might be a plus for someone who's just looking to blow off some steam in a casual/relaxing video game, there's just not enough here to keep me interested. Every building can be built within the first hour of gameplay. Aside from watching your town grow, there's no incentive such as advanced buildings to keep on playing. The game strikes me as Tropico lite in block form. Since I own Tropico 4 and 5, two games that I really enjoyed, I can say that this game is nowhere near their caliber, especially Tropico 5.

In conclusion, this game is a quintessential example of ""you get what you pay for"". It's a simple game for a simple price.",10 price tag recommend game however future increase price must accompanied new content opinion like game relaxing game music soothing interesting sitting back watching townspeople complete everyday task simple game making easy get hang quick like game lack depth might plus someone looking blow steam casual relaxing video game enough keep interested every building built within first hour gameplay aside watching town grow incentive advanced building keep playing game strike tropico lite block form since tropico 4 5 two game really enjoyed say game nowhere near caliber especially tropico 5 conclusion game quintessential example get pay simple game simple price
270880,American Truck Simulator,"Imagine this:  Its 3am and you are rolling into Portland with a load of grapefruits.  It has been raining all day and the fog is so thick you couldn't cut it with a butter knife.  The sounds of the twin turbos on your Peterbilt are making your eyes heavy and your thoughts are on sleeping.  You are cruising along at 45mph when a bozo runs a stop sign and pulls right out in front of you.  Now you are wide awake, stomping on the brake pedal, and downshifting that 18 speed transmission.  Somehow you avoid crashing into that SUV and continue on to your destination.  You enter the gate of the distribution center and find out where you are supposed to drop the trailer.  After maneuvering the trailer to the dock you drive over to pick up another trailer full of lettuce and you're off to Cheyenne, Wyoming.  

That's just a sneak peek into one of the most immersive video games I've ever played in my life.  This game gets in your blood and soon you'll start talking in trucker lingo and using words like ""tanker yanker, reefer, smokey, and chicken coop.""  Your spouse, children, and coworkers will start to think you've lost your mind when you keep talking about those miles you've clicked off, the loads you've hauled, the places you've seen, and the people you've met.  

If you are looking at a relaxing game to help you escape reality then look no further.  American Truck Simulator is where it’s at.

2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"It took me some effort to finally get into this series. I bought Dominions 5 back when it released but never played more than about 2 hours, until 6 was on the horizon. Started watching some videos by DasTactic, Battlemode and Lucid Tactics and those got me hooked. 

I finally got over my 'retro graphics' fear and took the plunge. The game really is more accessible than most people think. True, you need a bit of patience, but don't fear about not doing things perfectly. Just start recruiting some troops, throw them into battle and analyse what happens. 

There's still lots of things to learn for me, but I'm having a ton of fun figuring it all out. Setting up my armies, research and other stuff each turn feels impactful and when you press end turn it's always exciting to see what reports come up the next turn. 

The further you get into the game the cooler the spells become. I love conjuring stuff and there's some crazy stuff you can summon! 

Next to that there's so many factions, that you'll never get bored trying them. And finally there's already some great mods.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"After Shadowbringers:

If you are into MMORPGs, this game has the best polish and production value of any MMO, and that includes above World of Warcraft.

If you're into combat in MMORPGs:  This game has the most insane adrenaline pumping boss fights you'll ever fight.

If you're into story in MMORPGs:  There is simply no other game.  In most MMOs, the story is part of the game.  In this one, it is the game, and everything you do surrounds the beautiful tale they tell.  Unlike some games *cough* WoW *cough* where characters just play their stereotypes, this game has expert-level writing with characters that behave out of character, with characters who don't follow stereotypes, and with interesting and often twisted back stories.

If you're into end-game content:  This game doesn't have the best top tier content, but because it is so polished and hand crafted it doesn't even matter because the limited content is much more engaging and a thrilling experience that is far more memorable than the ""choose your gear grind"" of other games.

If you're into PVP, it exists.  That's all that can be said about it.  The content loosely follows a story but only loose and it's not that refined nor is it updated very often, and suffers from a lack of population.

If you are into crafting / gathering, this game has the best themepark MMO crafting system on the market.  The only MMO that does it better is Eve Online, only because it is a full simulation.  This is not a simulation of supply chains or spreadsheets.  This game is more about simulating getting down and dirty.  Mass produce a ton of low quality items or strive for high quality at the cost of time and materials.  Everything from crafting to gathering has mini games attached to it where you have to maximize your chance to gather an item and/or make it high quality.    

If you're looking for a community, this one is all about love and laughs.  This is because the game has a built in mentor system where veterans can teach newbies, who have clovers over their heads to tell the party that they are relatively new to the game and haven't completed the main storyline.  The game has a vibrant fan community with reddits and Discords as well, and the attitudes are almost always positive.  People are usually forgiving of mistakes in dungeons and boss fights and won't try to start fights.

If you ever wanted to try a game you thought you'd never see yourself playing, this is the game for you.  No, the style of this game is not for everyone.  The lack of PVP and the lack of end game content variety is something at face value people would not want.  But just keep this in mind.  This game contains hundreds of hours of main storyline quests, and that's not including the side quest chains, normal quests, unlock quests, Special dungeons and higher difficulty modes for boss fights.  Even getting to the end game is an accomplishment for one who has never started.  It is also the best time to do it.  For your money you will get these hundreds of hours of story which will take you perhaps 2-4 months to complete even if you play every day.  This game transcends its weaknesses because of things like this, the sheer polish of everything that is done.  PVP can be forgiven because the PVE fights get very hectic at higher levels and on higher difficulties.  Lack of end game content can be forgiven because of those intense fights as well and because the game is so incredibly long to begin with.

Anyone remotely interested in RPGs should work their way through this game.  It is a masterpiece, and Shadowbringers makes it one of the better games ever made.",shadowbringers mmorpgs game best polish production value mmo includes world warcraft combat mmorpgs game insane adrenaline pumping bos fight ever fight story mmorpgs simply game mmos story part game one game everything surround beautiful tale tell unlike game cough wow cough character play stereotype game expert level writing character behave character character follow stereotype interesting often twisted back story end game content game best top tier content polished hand crafted even matter limited content much engaging thrilling experience far memorable choose gear grind game pvp exists said content loosely follows story loose refined updated often suffers lack population crafting gathering game best themepark mmo crafting system market mmo better eve online full simulation simulation supply chain spreadsheet game simulating getting dirty mass produce ton low quality item strive high quality cost time material everything crafting gathering mini game attached maximize chance gather item make high quality looking community one love laugh game built mentor system veteran teach newbie clover head tell party relatively new game completed main storyline game vibrant fan community reddits discord well attitude almost always positive people usually forgiving mistake dungeon bos fight try start fight ever wanted try game thought never see playing game style game everyone lack pvp lack end game content variety something face value people would want keep mind game contains hundred hour main storyline quest including side quest chain normal quest unlock quest special dungeon higher difficulty mode bos fight even getting end game accomplishment one never started also best time money get hundred hour story take perhaps 2 4 month complete even play every day game transcends weakness thing like sheer polish everything done pvp forgiven pve fight get hectic higher level higher difficulty lack end game content forgiven intense fight well game incredibly long begin anyone remotely interested rpgs work way game masterpiece shadowbringers make one better game ever made

686810,Hell Let Loose,"My very first game on HLL: I join a server, select the Allies, enter an open squad (yes, they can be locked) and select a machinegunner. As soon as the match begins the squad's officer asks via voip if there are any new players. I answer ""me"", ask him and my other squaddies to forgive me if I make mistakes, and the squad leader just laughs it off and tells me ""no worries, just follow my directions, keep your eyes sharp and your ears sharper and you'll do fine"". And then, we start moving towards a quaint French town called Carentan. 

""See that church at the center of the map?"", the squad leader tells us. ""Our orders are to occupy it and defend the area no matter the costs. Watch out for windows and rubble because there'll be Krauts everywhere."" And there WERE lots of Krauts in the area. I run forward in the open like a headless chicken, and a German rifleman shoots me in the torso. I crumple to the ground, as the noises all around me grow duller and duller and my vision starts to blur as life abandons me. 

""Don't let go and hang in there mate!"", the squad's medic shouts. So I wait, while the medic tosses a smoke grenade to conceal his movements, reaches my dying frame and brings me back to the realm of the living with a quick morphine shot. ""Now dive for cover! Go behind those barrels over there!"", he tells me, which I eagerly do, still bleeding out. Once behind cover, the medic pulls out the bandages and starts to apply a field dressing, while the squad leader checks the surroundings with his binoculars.

""Enemy infantry in those windows! Shoot, damn it!"", and before I ask him exactly which window, he points me a specific one in the distance. I squint my eyes as hard as I can, and notice that there are indeed a couple of indistinct shapes looking at us. I then deploy my mighty M1919 heavy machinegun, ignoring the gunshots that plink all around me, and start laying down a withering hail of suppressive fire against that and nearby windows. I doubted I ever got a single kraut, but that wasn't what mattered - what mattered was that the jerries had no way of peeking out of those windows without getting mulched. With me supporting their advance, the remainder of my squad moves towards the building under the cover of smoke grenades, while our riflemen toss as many grenades inside the windows as they can. I hear gunshots coming from the buildings, a couple of players curse as they get downed while the squad leader shouts ""I've got 'em, I've got 'em! Come here gunner, we need your mg!"" 

I make a mad dash towards the building right as a hail of enemy machinegun fire is poured into the smoke, not aiming at anybody in particular but still managing to hit me - again - and cause me to bleed. Nevertheless, I manage to get inside the building and get the medic to patch me up again. ""This is becoming a habit, mate. I should start to charge you for every dressing"", he jokes. We both laugh, at least until a kraut tosses a grenade inside a nearby window, something the medic does not notice. ""Grenade right behind you! Run!"", I yell at him. We both run as far away from that room as possible right as the grenade goes off, I emerge unscathed from the blast but the medic is hit and starts bleeding. ""Cover me while I patch myself up"", he asks me, but right at that moment one of our squaddies who was garrisoning the building's ground floor yells ""OH s**t, they're insi-"" before an SMG burst causes him to scream. Realizing that there's only one way up the building and that I am right in front of the stairs, I lay on the ground and deploy my machinegun yet again. A kraut climbs the stairs and runs right in front of my machinegun, getting riddled with bullets and falling on the spot. Two more krauts enter after him, both of which get similarly cut down while I yell ""they're coming! Right up the stairs!"". A friendly rifleman arrives, tosses a couple of grenades down the stairs, and I see torn human limbs flying everywhere. ""Germs're sanitized"", he shouts back. The squad leader laughs it off, congratulates us both, and then orders us to keep marching towards the church at the center of Carentan. It's only 100 meters away from our position, but due to a german Tiger parked right in front of it and at least two German platoons, it might as well be miles and miles away.

The Tiger is relentless in its attempts to kill every single yank its spotter sees. At least until a Sherman outflanks and destroys it with its powerful 76 mm gun. Suddenly the tide of the battle has been turned, and the germans are the ones desperately scrambling away from that hulk of steel on tracks, falling back inside the church. Around the church, artillery fire starts falling on the battlefield like rain, tearing to pieces any soldier unfortunate enough to get hit. Undaunted, our assault specialist throws a couple of smoke grenades before getting cut down by submachinegun fire. His heroic sacrifice allows us to enter inside the church in relative safety and engage the last kraut holdouts in a desperate close quarters battle they are hopelessly outmatched for due to their bolt-action rifles and the elevated number of automatic and semi-automatic firearms we possess. 

At long last, the church of Carentan has fallen into Allied hands, but we do not even have the time to pat on each other's shoulders that a massive artillerly barrage rains all around the church. Allied soldiers who aren't quick or lucky enough to get inside are pulverized by the concentrated explosive fire, the sherman that was covering us gets blown to smithereens, and all that's left to defend the capture point is our 5-men squad and a rifleman from another platoon who somehow made it to the church by the skin of his teeth. 

""They're couterattacking. Run for the bell tower!"", our squad leader orders us. We dash for the church's bell tower like madmen, while the rifleman straggler tosses a couple of grenades to cover our retreat. Finally at the top of the bell tower, I realize that it is spacious enough to give us ample room for manoeuvers, gives us a very nice overlook of the entire town, and has only one way in or out. ""Defend the bell tower at all costs, G*ddammit!"", I hear the squad leader scream. Thus, I pick a spot with a clean line of sight to the stairs and deploy my trusty machinegun again. 

Kraut soldiers start coming our way, in unorganized waves that get mercilessly scythed down at first, and in coordinated attacks with grenades, smoke grenades and submachinegunners later. Me and the straggler get shot again, but the medic in our team quickly bandages up again. It is only in that moment that I realise my machinegun is completely out of ammo. ""Out of ammo!"", I yell to my squaddies, which prompts the straggler to drop an ammo box right next to me. Thanking him, I proceed to restock while the Germans keep on assaulting our position. The situation grows more and more desperate until, at long last, it happens.

Allied reinforcements arrive, three whole platoons of soldiers supporter by a Sherman Jumbo. Realising that they have been beaten, the krauts cease their attempts to storm the bell tower and focus on the attackers. It is at that moment that our squad leader orders us on the offensive. With the desperation that only a cornered animal can muster, we toss the very last two grenades we have down the stairway and catch the german defenders in a devastating pincer attack. The church of Carentan is now ours once again, for real this time. The squad leader congratulates us all, me in particular. ""You did very well for a first timer, mate"" - he tells me - ""now try to keep it up with the two remaining capture points. Let's go!""

+ Most of the guns, while there are some questions about drops and what not most of the guns from green quality to legendary feel pretty good to use.
+ The humour, a nice portion of the same tasteless, base-line, foul and ridiculous humour the franchise is loved for. (This one will be returning in the bad though.)
+ The DLC. The DLC has hard carried the storytelling for this game by giving it some. Also the gameplay and concepts are fun. Several times throughout Love Guns and Tentacles particularly, it felt like I was playing an upgraded version of Borderlands 2 which is rather what I was hoping for from the main campaign.
_______________________________________________________________
The bad. Hoo boy... There is sadly a lot here.
_______________________________________________________________
- Story is exceedingly poorly written, and in many places your actions within it seem to be of no consequence. 
This infuriating tendency is most prevalent in sequences where the player is present to intervene and yet due to ""Plot cutscene"" are unable to. The game chooses more often than not to focus on the actions and feelings of NPC main characters in major scenes where input from the player character would seem more appropriate due to the obviously greater amount of work put in.
- Another symptom of the poor writing is that it has rather spoiled the humour I liked from the game by using it at such inappropriate times and I don't just mean for Tannis. (the one for who the argument can be made that it is in character for her to do)
-While Tyreen and Troy are very good at being villains, they utterly dreadful at living up to the legacy of the lovingly, hate-able Handsome Jack. Their story as you learn it at the end of the game has no relatability as their upbringing was no justification in any way for their actions or transformation to monsters. You have no empathy for them because their motivations are so weak and attitudes too despicable.
- Some poor voice acting and animation.
- Gearbox and balancing the end game. Oof guys, just oof.
- Ava... No brainer for this useless, obnoxious, Mary Sue, shitty self insert. Whoever this character is based off at Gearbox/T2 and which ever moron on the writing staff decided that she would replace a certain favourite character. Fire them both please. Preferably out of a man cannon at the circus... They are clowns.

-Still launches through Origin. Buying on Steam just adds another layer of DRM.
-If you previously purchased through Origin, you will need to redownload any DLC, even if you already had it installed
-Your DLC carries over, the base game does not, which means you'll have to purchase the base game again.
-Your DLC doesn't 'unlock' through Steam's store, if you purchased it on Origin (because of course it doesn't)

1151340,Fallout 76,"The game itself is real good. Could be good, that is, if it wasnt literally strangulating you on your very step with LIMITS on every breath.
1. It's a buy to play game, where you feel like in worst f2p if you dont subscribe to premium account, you will be ultimately drown in crafting meterials, which overflow your meager storage chest and overencumber you almost instantly.
2. You want to sell your junk, but there's a LIMIT on cash you can get per day shared between all vendors in game.
3. You constantly find a lot of legendary eq, which weights tons, but useless for you. You can sell them for lottery scrips for a (small) chance to win something more useful, and guess what? There is a LIMIT on those scrips you can get per day, so the burden drastically increases every day, if you play at least semi-actively.
4. There is a LIMIT on what you can build in your camp, but at least it increases with your leveling, so it's acceptable. But. You can build a good big house, with an underground personal vault... and all you can store there is one aforementioned meager chest. No, you can build tens of different-looking storage chests, but they all share that same meager storage space.
5. Cherry on top: there's a LIMIT on money you can keep on your character. And it is so small that no one will sell you something decent for money, nor there is a point for you to sell anything to another player. Everything nice comes via barter only on third-party internet resources. Should I mention that cash LIMIT overflows real fast?
6. There are other limits, like on total scrips or gold amount, but those can be managed, and not a problem to me at least for now.
7. There is no way by intended game means to transfer valuables between your characters. Yes, there are workarounds to do so, but they are unsafe, or require to use help from OTHER PLAYERS.
Got real tired from constant overencumberment. I'm wasting more time to figure how to keep my loot than actually playing.

230410,Warframe,"[h1]Player(s)[/h1]
[  ] Singleplayer
[X] Multiplayer
[  ] open world

Most missions can be played with up to 3 other players online. There are singleplayer sections as well as some open world areas, but most of the game is for 1-4 players.

[h1]Story[/h1]
[  ] has no story
[  ] not interesting/important
[  ] decent story
[X] good story
[  ] emotional rollercoaster

The game starts out with hardly any story, but gets better the more you get into it and the more you read item descriptions and little details. After that you have a pretty good story in many aspects.

[h1]Long term motivation / play time[/h1]
[  ] very short (<5h)
[  ] relatively short (5-10h)
[  ] decent length (10-20h)
[  ] long (20-50h)
[  ] very long (50-100h)
[X] endless (>100h)

So many different things to do and farm, you can spend thousands of hours if you want to

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
[  ] very easy
[X] doable for everybody
[  ] might be somehow challenging
[  ] very hard
[  ] Dark Souls hard

Not that challenging, you just need to dedicate time

[h1]Controls[/h1]
[  ] few buttons
[X] average amount of buttons
[  ] might need some time to get used to
[  ] wait... which button again?

Besides your movement keys you just have to shoot and use 4 abilities. You need to memorize everything to be fast, but it's nothing particularly difficult.

[h1]Time investment / Grind[/h1]
[  ] relies purely on skill
[  ] need to invest some time, but skill will help
[  ] a lot of grinding
[X] lock yourself up in the basement

you better get ready for some long a** grinding

[h1]Diversity[/h1]
[  ] same thing over and over again
[X] sometimes a little monotonous
[  ] a lot of different levels
[  ] Surprise Motherf***er!

You have a lot of different planets and random generated maps for every mission, but the basic gameplay stays the same.

[h1]Characters customization[/h1]
[  ] none
[  ] few possible changes
[  ] a lot of ways to upgrade your character
[X] essential for the game

Basically everything you do comes down to leveling, designing, modifying your character.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
[  ] complete garbage
[  ] very bad
[  ] okay
[  ] looks nice sometimes
[X] good graphics but nothing special
[  ] visually stunning

[h1]Music / Soundtrack[/h1]
[  ] none
[  ] my ears are bleeding...
[  ] I'll just listen to my own music
[X] can be quite nice
[  ] absolutely beautiful

Definitely hase some good soundtrack that is worth listening to

[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]
[  ] shitey
[  ] yeah, looks good
[X] stunning

The game creates a very good atmosphere especially due to its variety of planets and locations. You really feel like you are part of that universe (well you actually are) and many places like the moon (called Lua in game) or the Void look just super gorgeous.

[h1]In game purchases[/h1]
[  ] pay 2 win
[X] pay 2 skip (everything can be acquired by just playing the game)
[  ] no real money can be spend

You can spend soooo much money, but at the same time everything can be completed by playing the game. As I said before, this game has a lot of grinding, which can be skipped by paying, but it's not p2w.

[h1]Personal thoughts:[/h1]
This game is definitely not for everybody, if you don't like spending a lot of time, grinding and doing some things multiple times, this game is nothing for you. But if you do like those things, this game is excellent. Especially the movement is just so addicting and you have so many different weapons/warframes/companions/planets/gamemodes.
If you're not sure whether to get it or not, just try it out, especially since it's free. Have fun!

548430,Deep Rock Galactic,"In a world full of cash-grab AAA titles and half-baked indie ideas, Deep Rock Galactic exemplifies what can happen when a group of talented and passionate people come together and decide to redefine the industry standard of multiplayer co-op shooters.

There is a...heart to this game, and its developers, that becomes immediately apparent once you've spent any amount of time in their universe. A fair amount of collectibles exist merely to be brewed into beer, most of which provide no function beyond being silly and entertaining. Management yells at you to stop kicking around (achievement-related) barrels while in the pre-game lobby. After failing a mission, you respawn in a hospital gown and can choose to embark upon the next mission in that getup instead of your usual colorful raiment. The choice is yours as to whether you pet docile, loot-containing bugs...blow them up...or both! There is a button specifically for yelling nonsensical and camaraderie-inducing voice lines.

Beyond all of this lies a surprisingly well-balanced framework for your experience in-game that can be tweaked in a multitude of different ways, catering both to those who enjoy a more casual cooperative experience, as well as those who have a deep-seated masochistic streak! With hundreds of hours' worth of functional content to unlock - and even more cosmetics - this is one of the few titles I would deem truly special, and worth just about everyone's time.

If you've friends that play? Hop in, grab a beer both IRL and in-game, and you'll have the time of your life. If you don't, well, DRG's community is one of the most wholesome and entertaining that I've experienced in decades of online gaming.",world full cash grab aaa title half baked indie idea deep rock galactic exemplifies happen group talented passionate people come together decide redefine industry standard multiplayer co op shooter heart game developer becomes immediately apparent spent amount time universe fair amount collectible exist merely brewed beer provide function beyond silly entertaining management yell stop kicking around achievement related barrel pre game lobby failing mission respawn hospital gown choose embark upon next mission getup instead usual colorful raiment choice whether pet docile loot containing bug blow button specifically yelling nonsensical camaraderie inducing voice line beyond lie surprisingly well balanced framework experience game tweaked multitude different way catering enjoy casual cooperative experience well deep seated masochistic streak hundred hour worth functional content unlock even cosmetic one title would deem truly special worth everyone time friend play hop grab beer irl game time life well drg community one wholesome entertaining experienced decade online gaming

First: Dont expect to be good at this game when you first start, it takes time to learn about the gods. every god has specific builds and mechanics.
Second: Watch professional smite players on twitch or YT they will teach you how to play every roll for smite conquest.
Third: play arena first and learn every god in smite and how to use all their abilities. 
Fourth: Dont worry if people call you trash, tell them you are new to the game and they will understand.
Fifth: go on https://smitesource.com this site will help you learn how to build gods
Sixth: Play gods that you feel COMFORTABLE with. 
Seventh: once you are ready play joust, its a smaller conquest against 3v3. but it has some mechanics as conquest.
Eighth: PLAY ASSAULT its fun and its a random god pickers to play a 1 lane 5v5 
Ninth: Once you are ready play conquest
Tenth: listen to your teammates and also learn Vgs system

- Dung beetles still fall through foundations into the rocky abyss

- The alpha and large dinos will still phase through and become one with your dinosaur, trapping them, mauling them to death while all you can do is whistle desperately and cry as they die in front of you.

- Official servers still crash and roll back every 15 minutes after playing for 15 minutes so you get to play even more! :)

- Official servers also still stutter and lag like i'm stuck in 2015

- Dino 'follow' AI still makes me want to scream violently 

- Fatal Error x 100

- Nothing is decaying fully on official so there's thatch and abandoned bases everywhere that no-one can do anything about

- Volumetric clouds and fog cannot be turned off in settings so you have to use ~ 

- Optimisation? no.

- The new dino tracking system is just so bugged, i cant get rid of tracked people and the icons fly around the map constantly or theres double icons.

- As i was writing this my ptera on follow just clipped through someones base i sat on to gain stamina safely and is now one with their base, trapped, ripped from my arms and into the base of a random. 


and im sure theres many more i can find if i just play the game for 10 minutes more.

This unreal engine update was supposed to be a free upgrade to those who purchased ARK. Then they went back on their word and said they wanted it to be sold for $90 bundled with ARK 2. Then changed their minds again and are selling it for the current price minus ARK 2. We're on track for all expansions to be also, paid content YIPPEE!

For a studio that's made well into the millions and still wont fix problems i've been experiencing since 2015. thats a no from me chief. Don't buy this. Glad I got this as a gift, part of the reason i enjoy this game is because it has the potential to be an amazing game to play if they just you know, fixed 6 year old bugs idk


Edit: 

-People can still force crash servers using rocket launchers to roll it back. 

-If you go into the Alpha dragon fight its invisible and you're stuck there waiting for the timer to count down and everything to die.

- People who are not in your tribe or alliance can still sneak into the boss fights with you, raising the difficulty multiplier and waiting for the boss rewards to spawn to steal them ;)",really like kept nostalgia every single bug ark survival evolved take back like way back way game 2015 3 kind dung beetle still fall foundation rocky abyss alpha large dinos still phase become one dinosaur trapping mauling death whistle desperately cry die front official server still crash roll back every 15 minute playing 15 minute get play even official server also still stutter lag like stuck 2015 dino follow ai still make want scream violently fatal error x 100 nothing decaying fully official thatch abandoned base everywhere one anything volumetric cloud fog turned setting use optimisation new dino tracking system bugged cant get rid tracked people icon fly around map constantly there double icon writing ptera follow clipped someone base sat gain stamen safely one base trapped ripped arm base random im sure there many find play game 10 minute unreal engine update supposed free upgrade purchased ark went back word said wanted sold 90 bundled ark 2 changed mind selling current price minus ark 2 track expansion also paid content yippee studio made well million still wont fix problem experiencing since 2015 thats chief buy glad got gift part reason enjoy game potential amazing game play know fixed 6 year old bug idk edit people still force crash server using rocket launcher roll back go alpha dragon fight invisible stuck waiting timer count everything die people tribe alliance still sneak bos fight raising difficulty multiplier waiting bos reward spawn steal

648800,Raft,"2023 update: Finished the game with two friends. All the earlier points still apply (maybe not the ""grim story"" bit - the later chapters are more easy-going than the first few), the play-through was lots of fun and quite literally a journey. I'd say this is what makes Raft different from the other ""Build & Survive"" games - your base camp is mobile, so you get to build permanent stuff AND explore places at the same time. Thumbs up!

The start can be very misleading for the impatient among us: it might seem like your only goal is to throw the hook around and gather junk. It isn't. Once you expand your raft and get the basic needs (water and food) somewhat covered, the game will slowly start expanding before you, and it usually manages to offer some nice surprises as it does.

It also has the best first-person base-building system I've ever seen so far (coming from a person scarred for life by vanilla Fallout 4 base-building). If you want to place something somewhere, you usually can, or there is a clever way of doing so.

The story (at the time I'm typing this, only the first Chapter was released) is... okay, considering it's revealed to you by means of notes, static objects and locations. Oh, and it's quite a lot more grim than the colourful visuals suggest.

And it's not a (very) easy game. If you're not planning ahead and paying attention, you'll get eaten, you'll drown, you'll get stomped, mauled or die of dehydration. I'd say difficulty-wise this is somewhat similar to The Long Dark, but quite a lot more forgiving.

Definitely looking forward to Chapter 2.",2023 update finished game two friend earlier point still apply maybe grim story bit later chapter easy going first play lot fun quite literally journey say make raft different build survive game base camp mobile get build permanent stuff explore place time thumb start misleading impatient among u might seem like goal throw hook around gather junk expand raft get basic need water food somewhat covered game slowly start expanding usually manages offer nice surprise also best first person base building system ever seen far coming person scarred life vanilla fallout 4 base building want place something somewhere usually clever way story time typing first chapter released okay considering revealed mean note static object location oh quite lot grim colourful visuals suggest easy game planning ahead paying attention get eaten drown get stomped mauled die dehydration say difficulty wise somewhat similar long dark quite lot forgiving definitely looking forward chapter 2
2399830,ARK: Survival Ascended,"After being promised a ""free update to Ue5"" it turns out instead its paying for the same content we already bought in a new engine, don't get me wrong there indeed other changes as well, UI changes, building changes etc.

However, the performance is terrible unless you're willing to turn off a bunch of features.

Also for an official PVP player this is what the first day has looked like so far

Servers came up at 6am Eu time, after 3 hours the entire network was taken down and rolled as they had literally left the admin menu on by default.

After the servers came back on at 9am we got maybe 3 hours on and now its been down for 4 and half hours.

Wildcard hit the jackpot with the concept of the game, they well and truly did, but their own arrogance, lies to the community and half baked approach has been consistent since Ark:SE went into early access, it persists to this day. 

I want to play a dinosaur open world survival game, the concept is awesome but with wildcard running its a constant horror show of lack of diligence in development and an absolute arrogance towards its userbase.

I would avoid this game, like the plague maybe in 6 months (of more development time) it might be half decent but as it stands right now ? its not worth the money no where near it, just go play Ark:SE instead and at this point maybe the only way to stop these developers from showing the outright contempt they do for their user base.

1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","Alright Fatshark, you could have struck gold with this one. You had it handed to you. The setting, the previous experience making not one but two of these games already, you guys had this game in the bag from a conceptual standpoint already. But, you BLEW IT. Your core gameplay loop during missions is spot on, you nailed it. But you only gave us 4 maps to play on, and yes, there ARE different missions for those maps. But it's still the fucking same map, it all looks and feels the same most of the time. You just reversed the way you run the map. So who cares. 

At Vermintide 2's launch, we got 15 classes. Now you give us 4. FOUR. WHY FOUR. You're working with the 40k universe and you BARELY did anything with it in terms of classes. Why? Why so little when you could have done so much? It's disappointing to say the least. The Veteran goes PEW PEW and that's it. Great. Fantastic. 

This game is in no way as good as Vermintide 2. And what sucks is I wish it was. I really do, I was beyond hyped for this for months.

756800,Contraband Police,"The best way to describe Contraband Police is a dash of Paper's Please mixed with plenty of action and a bit of sim/management thrown in to give you something to do with your downtime. 

Contraband Police caught me completely off guard; there is way more game here than I was expecting for my ~$20. 

Is it perfect? No. Is there jank? Of course.  However, the quality of this game and the passion and hard work that the Dev put into it shines through, and really makes this something unique and fun. 


The story and side-missions so far are quite good and they are paced well. Just when you start to feel the monotony start to set in from the daily grind of checking paperwork, catching smugglers, turning in prisoners and contraband, you get a call telling you that there has been a murder at a local establishment and you --as the closest thing to proper law enforcement-- are being called in to investigate.

Another thing that really stands out is how much this game actually makes me care about my actions. I was expecting to just fall into the role of the compassionless guard ""just doing his job"". But, somehow, even with the fairly sparse dialogue and only having short summary of my subordinates backgrounds I found myself actually caring about how I went about my job. 

The system I serve my be rotten and the rules I enforce sometimes arbitrary and pointless, but the job I am doing is important and has an affect on the people I interact with every day. 
I quickly found myself happy to accept the fine for not turning someone away in order to help them. I even ended up foregoing an upgrade to my living conditions to ensure I had the cash reserve to let asylum seekers through who would have otherwise  been turned away because they had a spelling mistake on their paperwork. 


The only real complaint I have about Contraband Police is the roadside ambushes when you are out driving around, they are far to frequent and only really serve as an annoyance when you are trying to get some of your busy-work done. I think they would be much better if they were tweaked to be much less common but far more dangerous, make them something that can actually surprise you rather than something you expect.

If anything about Contraband Police seems like something you might be interested in, don't hesitate, it will at the very least meet your expectations. But, it is far more likely it will surpass those expectations just like it did with me.",best way describe contraband police dash paper please mixed plenty action bit sim management thrown give something downtime contraband police caught completely guard way game expecting 20 perfect jank course however quality game passion hard work dev put shine really make something unique fun story side mission far quite good paced well start feel monotony start set daily grind checking paperwork catching smuggler turning prisoner contraband get call telling murder local establishment closest thing proper law enforcement called investigate another thing really stand much game actually make care action expecting fall role compassionless guard job somehow even fairly sparse dialogue short summary subordinate background found actually caring went job system serve rotten rule enforce sometimes arbitrary pointless job important affect people interact every day quickly found happy accept fine turning someone away order help even ended foregoing upgrade living condition ensure cash reserve let asylum seeker would otherwise turned away spelling mistake paperwork real complaint contraband police roadside ambush driving around far frequent really serve annoyance trying get busy work done think would much better tweaked much le common far dangerous make something actually surprise rather something expect anything contraband police seems like something might interested hesitate least meet expectation far likely surpass expectation like

1326470,Sons Of The Forest,"I love the game so far, so I will recommend it. As it is in EA, some issues are expected. Do note that I am new to the game, so I will most likely be doing some things wrong or missing it. This will most likely evolve into a more detailed review, so stray away if you can't stand long reviews instead of the usual one-two sentence comments gamers put on a review.

Current things to expect ATM:
(Played on normal difficulty)(Basically a bug report at this point)
-
-
*Giving Kelvin orders while holding logs throws it at him, hurting him in the process. Apparently, interacting with anything at all with logs on you throws them in front of you, whether it's hurting your friends or butchering bushes of fruits.

**You get tired/sleepy way too fast (Not sure if it's a bug or just how the settings are). Needs to sleep again 3 minutes after waking up. Currently one of the biggest things holding us back.

*Kelvin's AI pathing is a bit odd. He will run around certain areas away from you to get where you are rather than just follow directly behind you.

*Difficulty can use more settings to adjust to player preferences. But I love how they have this here in the first place, greatly appreciated. Additionally, difficulty settings can use some details as to what it does when you scroll over it. Settings for the drain on food/thirst/sleep would be nice. The way I see it, Flexibility is key to many games.

*Things fall under the world. Kelvin just deposited a log nearby me and it went underground into the water. Continues to hear constant splashing at that one spot now.

*Animal AI doesn't look much different than the ones from The Forest. They're basically.. Stupid.

*When items or corpses fall into the water, it becomes much harder to interact with them.

*Kelvin seems to be targeted first most of the time and always gets pounced by cannibals, especially when he's gathering.

*Unless I've missed something, haven't figured out any forms of log transportation. Hope they add back the log sled. Building and gathering logs takes forever.

*Logs disappearing? Threw probably 20+ logs down a hill so Kelvin could pick them up, while I went to chop more trees. Came back to check on it and they've nearly all disappeared. Not sure if there's a log limit and they despawned or if they all fell under the world.

*Kelvin can down you by throwing logs at you if you're at the point where you set him to deposit logs.

**Quick inventory access is much more flawed compared to The Forest. Despite it being much more immersive and interesting, you can't move when interacting with it and it's just plain slow. Considering the cannibals in this game are much harder, since they seem to be 1-2 shotting me recently and have a much more difficult combat approach, we need to be able to switch and utilize weapons and heals faster. I find it odd how I can't just grab my knife holstered onto my backpack w/o first taking it off of me then grabbing it. In a sense this is also a combat flaw of the game, not just an inventory one. I find this as a major setback for me.

*Let us set the character skin we want. It's always odd how your character changes everytime after you join. Simply would be nice to have.

*Just like The Forest, food sources seem to become easily obtainable, once you've grasped the game. Although I still feel it's mainly due to the stupid animals that are free meals. Kelvin might also need a bit of a nerf on that fish gathering. Pretty sure this dude was world star renowned master-class fisherman before he changed occupations.

+Game runs smoothly most of the time on mid-graphics (AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-CoreProcessor 3.80GHz, 16gb Ram on a SSD)
+Kelvin is KOOL as **** Also walks like an oversized penguin, which is a plus.
+Still haven't recruited the girl yet, looking forward to it though.

As some reviews have mentioned, this game is nowhere near done. When compared to The Forest, the more I play, the more I realize what needs to be fixed and added. Despite all of that, I am still having fun right now. I'd only recommend getting the game as of now if you're going to pitch in and help with the development of this game, or simply if you want to try it out regardless. Looking at it from a brighter perspective, it's already fun as it is and there's still more to come. I will continue to update as I play. Thank you for reading.

381210,Dead by Daylight,its like a love hate relationship,like love hate relationship
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I play MMOs. It's my thing. It's what I like to do. I've tried many. Most disappoint me. This one did not, as you can probably tell by my ever-increasing total playtime. 

The game most comparative to [b]Final Fantasy 14[/b] (FF14), to many people's annoyance, is [b]World of Warcraft[/b] (WoW). They are both 'theme park' style MMOs, and they both use simple, action-based, 'TAB-targeting' combat. The similarities are vast, I can assure you, but they are also obvious. I can split hairs, talk about WoW's reactive, fast paced style versus FF14's slow, prepared style, but to anyone who has played both at the higher levels, it's fairly self-evident. The games are very similar as massively multiplayer online role-playing games, with simple mechanics and easy-to-enter natures (as well as raised cost-of-entries).

I think one of the only things I can offer to the discussion involving this game is my perspective. I have experienced as many aspects of this game as I can. I played the story attentively, I watched every cutscene, I leveled a healer, tank and a dps to 80 (the current max), and I gathered and crafted for way too long. 

This is a [i]weird[/i] game. The community is strange, in that they are as helpful as they are awkward. People will gladly help you for nothing, then ask that you visit them in their home (which is often just a hot tub next to a bed). They have odd customs, like saying 'o7' at the start of dungeons (which is supposed to be a salute). Everyone cares how they look, but doesn't care what you think about how they look. Playing songs in the plazas, erotic roleplay in the alleys, and bots asking you to buy gil are common sights. 

The story is set into whats called the Main Scenario, split by expansion. You have to play through [b]all the present and past story[/b] to catch up. This is [i]incredibly[/i] time consuming. If you play like I did over the last year, it is unlikely you can get to Shadowbringers (the current expansion) within one month of game time. Luckily, [b]the free trial is extremely good now[/b]. They recently changed it to be that you can play through the initial release content (A Realm Reborn), all for free, forever. 

Speaking of [b]A Realm Reborn[/b] (ARR), it's painfully average. The story is as well paced as paint drying, and because of the way item/level scaling works, there is no meaningful challenges. Granted, there aren't [i]supposed[/i] to be, but it is disappointing. The plot comes to a grinding halt a number of times, and sometimes there isn't even a plot, just you doing weird, forgettable jobs for weird, forgettable people. If you tried this game and left because of how slow ARR is, I can't blame you. It's a slog. But if you stick around, [b]the last arc[/b] of ARR was relatively enjoyable, finally arriving at some of the crazy style Final Fantasy is more known for. 

After ARR, (and after you pay for the game), comes [b]Heavensward[/b] (HW), the Wrath of the Lich King of this game. I cannot express to you how surprised I was by the sharp quality increase here. It's remarkable. The story picks up in a new kingdom, dropping most of the old characters for a story about an oncoming dragon war, set in a genuinely interesting nation. The first time I truly took notice of the music in FF14 was when I entered this expansion, it's phenomenal, and consistently so throughout. The quests become stripped of tedious 'Slay 10 _', and are paced very well, keeping a feeling of tension as you progress that was never present in ARR. If you've ever heard someone say 'stick around FF14, it gets good', this is why. Unfortunately, it is followed by...

[b]Stormblood[/b] (SB). If Heavensward is like WotLK, then Stormblood is like Warlords of Draenor. Everything I just praised HW for took several steps back during this story. Old characters are brought to the light screaming and kicking, some given literal rewrites to force them to fit in, and newer characters struggle to make an impact. The music fails to keep me engaged as well, matching equally uninteresting environments Plots are jump-started, then the brakes are cut as they tumble down a hill. While the questing is still better than ARR, it's not by much anymore. The truly cool moments are so few and far between a deep, deep ocean of truly unfulfilling questing. It's really unfortunate, I really liked a few of the characters they introduce here, and 2 of the zones they introduce are among the best the game has, with a small plot about a rebellion I truly enjoyed. Those aspects are just mashed inside of a larger, more boring plot about a different rebellion.

Fortunately for me, [b]Shadowbringers[/b] (ShB) was everything I hoped for. If HW is WotLK, and SB is WoD, than Shadowbringers is, I guess, kind of like Legion. Honestly, the WoW expansion comparisons start to break down here. If you are looking into this game, at some point you probably heard that Shadowbringers is good. You probably also have some healthy skepticism and some tempered expectations. I'm here to assure you that Shadowbringers is not so good that it's worth playing through all of what I just described, AND a $60+ price tag. But it's pretty close. This expansions reworks a lot of old characters and plots into a surprisingly touching and insightful story, making one of the most trite and lifeless antagonistic forces in the game into strangely sympathetic villains. The themes through the story are strong, and conveyed in honestly intuitive ways. [b]The music[/b] is unbelievably good. One or two areas have some weaker themes, but the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5qx583Uys]dungeons[/url] and raids have absolutely stunning scores. The area designs are lacking, in my opinion, but they are easy to traverse, and, well, it's very subjective. 

A few closing remarks, organized in no particular order.

The [b]class design and feel[/b] is pretty good. Each class feels very distinct, and the meta is tight, with, and I know this is hard to believe, every class performing well. It's very well balanced on the PvE side.

The [b]PvP[/b] in this game is, and this is being generous, [i]awful[/i]. It's poorly balanced, it's map design is shoddy, and it's not very rewarding in terms of character progression, if at all. It can be fun in short doses because it is chaotic, but playing it anymore than that is frustrating. 

The [b]fashion[/b] in FF14 is one of the main aspects of the players who stick around. It's easy to track down what you want, and there is a wide variety of styles to pursue.

The [b]cash shop[/b], also known as the Mogstation, is quite prevalent. Not in the sense that you are forced to visit it, or that you have to to get an advantage, just that many, many people use it. Premium costumes and emotes are frequent, as well as sales.

Yes, it's still fun to play simulation football and to play as your favorite players. Yes, some of the new physics stuff and celebrations are cool. But at the end of the day, I did not heed others' warnings about the fundamental faults of the game.

At its core, Madden is BROKEN. Players will get stuck on opponents and not know what to do, just run in place and screw up routes. There is a huge interception problem where defenders will come out of nowhere to pick you off, even if you made the correct read. A lot of the times, offensive and defensive AI are just absolute braindead idiots that do not react to plays like an actual human would. All of these problems are IMMERSION BREAKING.

1240440,Halo Infinite,"Steam member for 15+ years and this is my 1st and probably only review that I'll make.

Been playing halo since it's launch in '01. And I can say, with certainty, that halo died with bungie and halo reach. 343 has had the reigns for over a decade, and after 3 original halo titles, they still sh*t the bed somewhere along development ""one step forward, three steps back"" will be 343's legacy when it comes to the development of their games. Infinite has the core mechanics locked down, even the art style, similar to the bungie era titles. Your spartan is quick and maneuverable, like H2/H3/HR. But not stupidly fast like the cracked out junkie spartan you had in H4/H5. The insider flight tests were amazing, feedback was great, and as millions would say, ""halo is back"". And then the multiplayer actually came out, in beta form, and was so ass backwards from everything they said it would be in the marketing and teasing of the game. Its a desperate cash grab at this point, and everyone knows it.

6 years of development, 100+ employees and 500 million in funding, and yet infinite still, to this day, has less content than that of a $40 game like aliens: fire team elite. They made half of the game ""frEE tO pLaY"", but still charged full price of $60 for the other half of the game. They claimed ""halo reach levels of customization"", yet a good 85%+ of all cosmetics are locked behind pay walls and based on FOMO. I've had the same blue & red armor colors since H2, and jolly roger emblem for 18 years. And yet I can't even get that color combo/emblem in infinite. And even if I could, I wouldn't be surprised if 343 tried to charge me for them.

The campaign is actually very good, and for the 1st time in 12 years, I actually enjoyed playing a halo campaign. It took me probably 4 or so years to actually muster the energy to force myself to play & beat H5's campaign. But I beat infinite's in just a few days, and enjoyed it doing so. I absolutely despised fighting the prometheans in H4 and especially H5. It felt like a chore fighting against them, but fighting against the banished in infinite was like how it always was in the 10 years of halo under bungie...actually fun and enjoyable.

I have zero motivation to play halo infinite. I only come back when they have the special events going on, as to try to unlock all the cosmetics. And during that time, I just hate it. All the desync issues are absolutely killing the enjoyment for me. Grenades keep disappearing immediately after you thrown them. Grenades never stick, or they do stick, then just vanish into thin air. Rockets don't shoot or explode. You'll get melee'd in the front, with full shields, yet somehow get insta killed anyways from a ""back smack"" or assassination. You hit someone point blank with a grav hammer, they don't die, but they can swing it 20ft away from you and still kill you somehow. 

Halo infinite is so far beyond broken and unfinished, its unreal. I thought they couldn't do any worse than than H5...but here we are. 260k players on steam, at launch, to less than 7k daily. They should have just delayed it for another 2 years. 343 have sh*t all over the halo franchise in the 12 years they've had it. They had everything going for them this time around, but still managed to colossally f*ck it up. Thanks for sh*tting on mine, and millions of others childhood, 343 industries. Maybe infinite will be good in 3 more years, until then, its a disgrace to the halo IP.",steam member 15 year 1st probably review make playing halo since launch 01 say certainty halo died bungie halo reach 343 reign decade 3 original halo title still sh bed somewhere along development one step forward three step back 343 legacy come development game infinite core mechanic locked even art style similar bungie era title spartan quick maneuverable like h2 h3 hr stupidly fast like cracked junkie spartan h4 h5 insider flight test amazing feedback great million would say halo back multiplayer actually came beta form as backwards everything said would marketing teasing game desperate cash grab point everyone know 6 year development 100 employee 500 million funding yet infinite still day le content 40 game like alien fire team elite made half game free play still charged full price 60 half game claimed halo reach level customization yet good 85 cosmetic locked behind pay wall based fomo blue red armor color since h2 jolly roger emblem 18 year yet even get color combo emblem infinite even could surprised 343 tried charge campaign actually good 1st time 12 year actually enjoyed playing halo campaign took probably 4 year actually muster energy force play beat h5 campaign beat infinite day enjoyed absolutely despised fighting prometheans h4 especially h5 felt like chore fighting fighting banished infinite like always 10 year halo bungie actually fun enjoyable zero motivation play halo infinite come back special event going try unlock cosmetic time hate desync issue absolutely killing enjoyment grenade keep disappearing immediately thrown grenade never stick stick vanish thin air rocket shoot explode get melee front full shield yet somehow get insta killed anyways back smack assassination hit someone point blank grav hammer die swing 20ft away still kill somehow halo infinite far beyond broken unfinished unreal thought worse h5 260k player steam launch le 7k daily delayed another 2 year 343 sh halo franchise 12 year everything going time around still managed colossally f ck thanks sh tting mine million others childhood 343 industry maybe infinite good 3 year disgrace halo ip

It genuinely baffles me how the game can get buggier and worse every year with the marketing being 'we fixed everything wrong with the game and added things that were in FORKING MADDEN 05 for your nostalgia'.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"I bought this game upon recommendation of a friend of mine. I never really played other Paradox titles before except for a little bit of Cities: Skylines. I'll be honest: I did not get this game at all when I first started. It felt overwhelming and I was sort of just clicking on things. I mostly started by playing with my friend so I could ask questions along the way. I had small victories here and there, but I still never truly understood the game.

One day I boot up the game and decide to give it another go. I won't lie—I was determined and did some prep. I watched a few CK3 YouTube videos before I embarked on this journey and read a little bit about strategy (seriously, shout out to [url=https://www.youtube.com/@SnapStrategy] Snap Strategy [/url] for turning this game into digestible content). I started out as a mere Duke and spent time to think before I made decisions. I thoroughly read the in-game pop-ups for words or phrases that I didn't understand. (The UI helps explain a concept if you just hover over the word with your cursor.) 

My Duke had a son, he became a King. Descendant after descendant, my realm's economy grew more and more. Eventually, I was able to successfully bribe anyone that stood in my way. Before I knew it, it was 3AM and I was elected Holy Roman Emperor due to my economic power, prestige, and bribery. With one click of a button, I revoked the election laws of the Holy Roman Empire. Yeah, I had some resistance from my important vassals and not so loyal subjects. These are problems that can be fixed with money or an excellent spymaster. I was at my peak. I worked my way from a lowly Duke to become the Holy Roman Emperor, flush with cash. Until I wasn't.

You see, as I alluded to earlier, you play as an individual ruler in this game—not an entire country or kingdom. When you die, you play as your heir. Well... if no one likes the heir, or if the heir is incompetent, then empires can crumble. This can sometimes be ""fixed"" by changing your succession laws, disinherison, or killing them (yes, killing your son/daughter—this game can be brutal). I had one son, took a gamble, and I died a little too soon. So be it. My empire crumbled because my heir was an idiot that nobody liked and neighboring conquests came knocking on my door. When it was all said and done, the Holy Roman Empire dissolved. I was broke, incompetent, inbred, had no allies, and owned a tiny tract of land hundreds of miles from my original realm. But holy hell what a fantastic ride it was straight to the top and a plummet to the bottom. 

I started to ""get it"" after that playthrough. The replay value is insane and I will be playing more. I really respect the hell out of this game. CK3 can be punishing, but oh man can it be so rewarding too. It will be overwhelming when you first start this game. It can also be a time commitment. But I absolutely recommend you give it a chance—or two—or three. Be curious, read stuff, and follow the game's advice when it tells you to do something. It is a good time.",bought game upon recommendation friend mine never really played paradox title except little bit city skyline honest get game first started felt overwhelming sort clicking thing mostly started playing friend could ask question along way small victory still never truly understood game one day boot game decide give another go lie determined prep watched ck3 youtube video embarked journey read little bit strategy seriously shout url http www youtube com snapstrategy snap strategy url turning game digestible content started mere duke spent time think made decision thoroughly read game pop ups word phrase understand ui help explain concept hover word cursor duke son became king descendant descendant realm economy grew eventually able successfully bribe anyone stood way knew 3am elected holy roman emperor due economic power prestige bribery one click button revoked election law holy roman empire yeah resistance important vassal loyal subject problem fixed money excellent spymaster peak worked way lowly duke become holy roman emperor flush cash see alluded earlier play individual ruler game entire country kingdom die play heir well one like heir heir incompetent empire crumble sometimes fixed changing succession law disinherison killing yes killing son daughter game brutal one son took gamble died little soon empire crumbled heir idiot nobody liked neighboring conquest came knocking door said done holy roman empire dissolved broke incompetent inbred ally owned tiny tract land hundred mile original realm holy hell fantastic ride straight top plummet bottom started get playthrough replay value insane playing really respect hell game ck3 punishing oh man rewarding overwhelming first start game also time commitment absolutely recommend give chance two three curious read stuff follow game advice tell something good time
381210,Dead by Daylight,"""Nothing is meant to be fair, and apparently by design"" - Mathieu Cote (Game director On Dead by Daylight)
I will try to explain why I write a negative review despite having a lot of hours and constantly playing this game to this day.
[b] The game lures people into gambling addiction!!! [/b]
If you're online enough, you could have seen people complaining over the fact that they don't really appreciate Dead by Daylight but they are unable to quit it. The fun fact is the game that is based a lot on RNG factors, aka luck, and tries to look ""competetive"" develops gambling addiction. 
You win, then you lose, after that you go for another match to show off your skills of defeating the unfair events and survive or killl every survivor. It's addiction is based on a constant feeling of irritation, the developers acknowledged it during one of their interviews. Gambling addiction funnily comes from losing, not winning. You will be annoyed by everything. By one of the most toxic communities, by poor balance decisions, countless bugs. Despite bringing the feeling of satisfaction sometimes, your mental state overall will be worse by the end of most play sessions. You won't play this game because you like it, you will play it because you're addicted to the constant feeling of surpassing the irritation. And the worst part is that you will feel rewarded because of the fact that you outsmarted players who are there to mock you and verbally abuse you by the end of a game. It's not healthy no matter how you look at it. Even if you have ""thick skin"", it's simply unenjoyable to waste your time on such people when you think about it.

Talking about the other reasons why I can't recommend this game: 
- It requires you to waste too much time grinding and paying. Licenced characters can only be purchased via real money and if you want to get original ones for free, you need to put 100 hours for each character. And there are so many of them, it may take 1000, if not more, hours to gain them all for free. 
- The developers work on their game when they WANT. The reason for that is the fact that this game does not have any competition. This brings flaws and small patches that do not really feel drastic and entertaining. Moreover, if the upcoming changes are disliked by the community, they will be rolled anyways since what can people do, find another Dead By Daylight? Money were put into creation of the things players didn't like, get it or leave. Oh, wait, you won't. 
- The game feels dull. We have no new content despite new killers and perks that kind of change gameplay. The issue here is that the perks don't do much, currently the game has a few strong perks that the community takes and the other perks are not being used at all unless a player wants to feel less powerful for some reason. And the killers often feel dull as well. Instead of constantly working on the previous perks and killers the developers prefer to make new perks and killers for the sake of pumping up money. They rarely change anything, it's lucky to have a patch with some big interesting changes at least once a year.
- The developers obviously lean towards the side that brings more money with the help of the cosmetics. It's not a secret that killer issues take much more time to be solved than the survivor ones. It brings unfairness into the game in certain cases.
- Moderation on the Steam and the official forums will literally ban you for showing any concern about the game's health. If you complain too much, well, stop spreading negativity. This creates a false sense of positivity when the community is furious at BHVR.
- The support isn't really helpful and deals with many issues quite poorly. The in-game report system only flags certain players, they won't get banned if you press a few buttons there. To have a person banned for sure you need to take extensive amount of steps and most of the times you need proof. So if you don't have your games recorded, you can't sumbit tickets to support effectively. 
- They have started doing limited time payed content, they even took out certain cosmetics that existed before that decision. Feels icky, you can see how they try to pump the money out of you. 
- You will have to close your comment section. I've never seen a community being this obsessed with leaving toxic comments on your profile. 

Please, do not support this mess. It looks fun on the outside but it's a mess.

----
I would like to mention one pretty significant thing about the game's developers that had happened at some point.
The community asked for colorblind setting for more than 4 years. This request had been dismissed until some point when the scandal occured because of it.
One of the developers called the whole thing boring. Clearly they aren't interested in wasting resources on something that won't bring them much income. The game has lost it's initial charm long time ago and has nothing passionate about it.

1062090,Timberborn,"I rarely leave reviews, but I'm making the effort here because Timberborn is hands down best Early Access game since Factorio (IMO, YMMV).

This game is a rock solid colony sim with a unique twist: it revolves around water resources management.  Not simply making sure that you have sufficient infrastructure to supply water, but actually managing a seasonal and limited water budget.  There are no shortcuts around it.  While this might sound a bit tedious, it makes for an absorbingly refreshing twist on colony management sims.  The fact that it's only in EA means that the game can only get better.

Don't let the EA tag frighten you off, I had exactly zero glitches playing this game.  Research, expansion, and planning are all integral parts of the game.  Like any good colony sim, there are a ton of ways for things to go off the rails.  In this game more than most, long range planning will pay off.

My critiques are few and have little to do with anything fundamental:  
* First, while I think the the game has a well developed early and early-mid game, there's not much in the way of a ""late-game"" feel.  I like colony sims/resource management sims where there is a clear transition along the lines of ""survival >> establishment >> incremental expansion >> administrative/logistic mastery >> technological mastery >> environmental mastery >> monument achievement"".  Factorio, Rimworld, KSP, and a few others have this progressive feel.  Timberborn sorta halts at incremental expansion, and the clearest ""win"" condition that I can see is for the player to completely overcome drought as a limiting factor for survival/expansion.  The fact that this game is still in EA means that there is a chance that his might be addressed as the devs continue to work on the game.  I want to underline, though, that this critique is not a black mark for the game at all; it is the opposite.  Despite ""higher"" levels of gameplay not really existing (at least in terms of my model above), the game remains engaging and fulfilling.  Within the bounds of the game, the only real limit is your imagination and ingenuity.

* Second, (and possibly only important to me because I am a water resources professional) there are some concepts of water resources management that could be implemented but the devs either haven't gotten there or have decided not to go there.  Some of these concepts are mechanical: automated weir crests, dam bottom outlets, water pumps, etc.  In the case of water pumps, there is a strong chance that the devs might be afraid that a water pump would make the game vulnerable to infinite energy exploitation (though I can see ways around that as well that would not involve rejiggering game physics).   In those other cases, I hope to see the devs release them as new features in the future.  Other concepts would take more effort to introduce to the game: pollution, groundwater, evaporation management, seasonality, ocean-water/salinity, etc.

To conclude, Timberborn wholeheartedly deserves the ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews it has received in the first two weeks since its EA release.  It presents all the colony sim challenges that builder-gamers like me crave, and does it with a twist that is unique in my experience.  I very much look forward to continuing to play this game, and I can't wait to see where the devs go with this most excellent game.",rarely leave review making effort timberborn hand best early access game since factorio imo ymmv game rock solid colony sim unique twist revolves around water resource management simply making sure sufficient infrastructure supply water actually managing seasonal limited water budget shortcut around might sound bit tedious make absorbingly refreshing twist colony management sims fact ea mean game get better let ea tag frighten exactly zero glitch playing game research expansion planning integral part game like good colony sim ton way thing go rail game long range planning pay critique little anything fundamental first think game well developed early early mid game much way late game feel like colony sims resource management sims clear transition along line survival establishment incremental expansion administrative logistic mastery technological mastery environmental mastery monument achievement factorio rimworld ksp others progressive feel timberborn sorta halt incremental expansion clearest win condition see player completely overcome drought limiting factor survival expansion fact game still ea mean chance might addressed devs continue work game want underline though critique black mark game opposite despite higher level gameplay really existing least term model game remains engaging fulfilling within bound game real limit imagination ingenuity second possibly important water resource professional concept water resource management could implemented devs either gotten decided go concept mechanical automated weir crest dam bottom outlet water pump etc case water pump strong chance devs might afraid water pump would make game vulnerable infinite energy exploitation though see way around well would involve rejiggering game physic case hope see devs release new feature future concept would take effort introduce game pollution groundwater evaporation management seasonality ocean water salinity etc conclude timberborn wholeheartedly deserves overwhelmingly positive review received first two week since ea release present colony sim challenge builder gamers like crave twist unique experience much look forward continuing play game wait see devs go excellent game
414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"How best to enjoy Hellblade

1. Stop Reading reviews on this game. 
2. Get a set of good headphones set up.
3. Don't read any guides
4. Go nuts.

But if you INSIST on reading a review I will try very hard to relay some fine points of the game in order to help you decide if you would like it without giving anything away. That by the way is a very difficult task.

1. The pace is very slow, you will have long periods in between combat. 
2. The sound and graphics are the best I have played in years.
3. The combat is completely devoid of ornementation. No skill points to earn, no weapons or inventory to upgrade/manage, no quick time events (thank god), and only one special power. Essentially it's just your skills of observation and reflexes against some tough enemies that want you dead. 
4. The puzzles are a large part of the game and rely on non isometric level design (think of a dumbed down antichamber).

None of that is why I consider this the best game I have played this year. It's the story, and the deep immersion in the way the devs manage to connect you with the character. It is one of those games that shows that a game can transend just being fun, and become meaningful art. 

If you want a great hack n slash....skip it (the combat is good, but better can be had). If you want to enjoy masterful storytelling, this game is a must play.",best enjoy hellblade 1 stop reading review game 2 get set good headphone set 3 read guide 4 go nut insist reading review try hard relay fine point game order help decide would like without giving anything away way difficult task 1 pace slow long period combat 2 sound graphic best played year 3 combat completely devoid ornementation skill point earn weapon inventory upgrade manage quick time event thank god one special power essentially skill observation reflex tough enemy want dead 4 puzzle large part game rely non isometric level design think dumbed antichamber none consider best game played year story deep immersion way devs manage connect character one game show game transend fun become meaningful art want great hack n slash skip combat good better want enjoy masterful storytelling game must play

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"Techland built themselves on being the game developer that's committed to listening and implementing community feedback.

A majority of DL2 updates in early 2023 are prime examples of this. Gut feeling, good night good luck, etc. While some had issues and needed work, we understood and stuck with them. Techland...You fixed certain things and worked through it, even gave us new and awesome stuff we didn't ask for like those Katana animations! We want to see this game succeed just as much as you do. You seriously did a good job and were turning the tide in your favor. Things were looking bright, and I was excited about the future.

I don't know what it is or what's happening behind the scenes, but you truly blew it all when you implemented DL points. Not only did the community echo and cry out to you to not implement something like this, but you did exactly what we feared. Response to DL points a few weeks back was easily the most backlash this game has seen. Despite knowing exactly how we felt, you still went ahead and implemented a tedious, half working monetary shop that is designed to be incredibly predatory to nickel and dime your fanbase even more.

I always looked up to Techland as the developer to set examples and break standards in the gaming industry. Like seriously... what other developer would go and make us a lighting filter so that its like E3 2018??? No one! Only you would!

Or would go and support the original Dying Light for YEARS. Not many would. That was you.

Unfortunately, you just fell into the giant list of yet another company of everything that's wrong with modern day gaming... and people have a right to be upset. While its nice to see you are committed to ""fixing"" this. I hope you do know that after years of building up your reputation, you practically just hit a reset button. You knew what you were doing, knew the respond that it would give, and still decided to press the red button.

I agree with another reviewer. There is a lack of heart and satisfaction with HF2.  I feel stymied to do what I want or find what I need. The end product feels  ""meh"" at most.

397540,Borderlands 3,"I waited for the Steam release, so this is a fresh take. With about 100 hours in BL1 and 700 in BL2, I think this one falls somewhere between the two in terms of quality.
+The guns are the best in the franchise--each feeling unique and worth experimenting with. I actually find some early game greens and blues INTERESTING to use, where once I was solely condemned to using them until I could afford a DPUH & Grog. Rarity also seems to have been given a boost; not only do legendaries drop at a more generous rate, but purples are also noticeably better than common stock, where they used to inspire the thought, 'aww, why didn't RNG just give me an orange instead?'
+Vehicles are fun and not quite as finicky as the previous entries.
+All four characters seem worth playing and potentially viable late-game.
-Matchmaking needs a tuneup before it can even be compared to the perfection of BL2 in that respect.
-The bias towards co-op (at least in the early game) is very noticeable. Little effort was given to balance the experience of a solo player vs the experience of a four-person squad.
-No offence to the gentleman who took over voice acting Claptrap--but it just ain't the same. Gearbox's magician sure knows how to make friends disappear.
-The writing is as weak or weaker than BL1, with many attempts at jokes falling flat and the reprised characters in general coming across as imitations of themselves rather than the real deal. While many lay most of the cringe at the feet of the main villains, I actually find them passable. We were never going to get another Handsome Jack, and the cringy d-baggery they embody is at least intentional and self-aware. All in all, it is clear that gameplay mechanics were given the lion's share of the energy, with the writing as an afterthought. This was BL1's approach, so it's only a letdown in comparison to the awesome balance struck by BL2.
+-Humanoid mobs' movement speeds are greatly increased. For the first time playing the franchise, I had to turn my mouse sensitivity up to consistently land shots.
-Early game, mobs are way more dangerous than bosses.
=Worth the $50 for the whole shebang, and to fans of the franchise will probably merit at least 100 hours.

 I absolutely ADORE pretty much everything ESPECIALLY if you are a warhammer nerd. I have played this game until my eyes hurt and I have to remind myself to touch grass. 

that's why it sucks so hard. especially because it could be so so great and the dev team IS trying hard to fix these things. hell there is a hotfix every other day now. but I cant recommend it at this time and im going to be signing off for a couple of months and hopefully coming back and things will be fixed by then.

I cant recommend anyone play it because I don't think anyone can. I'm saving every 15 mins and have 25 backup saves to try and avoid getting bricked. but everyone is tiptoeing around breaking the game so much you cant just play it. 

not to mention a good 10th of my time actually playing is filing a bug report. i know that they are trying and its not good to expect every game to be up to a completely bug free standard at launch.... but I honestly have not played a game since the 90's that soft locks you so much.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Been here since day 1, and I am someone who came from the PS4 version of the game. This has been quite the journey from its horrendous launch to where we are today. Ever since launch I have enjoyed the game, though I do acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable how this game launched, and no video game should launch how Cyberpunk 2077 did. I'd say that this game has been ""playable"" since its 1.3 updates, but it wasn't in a state where I could fully recommended this game to others due to it still being in a worst state than early day Skyrim or the likes. Now here we are, the 1.5 relaunch update has brought us the ""next gen"" update to the game. Whatever you want to actually call this update, it brings the soft overhaul to the game in terms of stability and actual feature and mechanics rebalance to make the game far better in its design, and thus making it feel better to play, along with its far improved stability. The game is now at a state where I could fully recommend it.

The game is still far from being perfect, as certain play styles far outclass other play styles in terms of combat, especially melee combat, as its still pretty stiff and a bit of a button masher at times. Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really. 

There is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.

I really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now.",since day 1 someone came ps4 version game quite journey horrendous launch today ever since launch enjoyed game though acknowledge completely unacceptable game launched video game launch cyberpunk 2077 say game playable since 1 3 update state could fully recommended game others due still worst state early day skyrim like 1 5 relaunch update brought u next gen update game whatever want actually call update brings soft overhaul game term stability actual feature mechanic rebalance make game far better design thus making feel better play along far improved stability game state could fully recommend game still far perfect certain play style far outclass play style term combat especially melee combat still pretty stiff bit button masher time content still feel weirdly distributed around map area far dense term content others complaint would nitpicking game really lot like game character feel genuine role play combat stealth area feel good great mechanically execution traversing world never really chore given amount different vehicle type large number fast travel location general movement speed ground thanks terrible stamen amount along basic parkour system get access decent variation quest mix combat detective work even stealth retrieval sometimes multiple style depending skill tree spec actually change lot approach quest go stealthy go gun blazing fist swingin quest allows driving alright 1 5 update incredible much better feel control 1 5 update given new type driving option large variety car motorbike obtain even need buy good option good good selection vehicle main campaign really genuinely like game lot far perfect really fun play unsure game thinking jumping update coming play highly recommend game lot fun far acceptable state

1240440,Halo Infinite,"[h1]As of the new roadmap revealed today, this game is absolutely NOT worth your time.[/h1]

As a very long time fan of Halo, this game is an incredible display of how incompetent 343 is as game dev, the lack of content almost a year in is absurd, them completely canceling the inclusion of couch co-op is unironically the final nail in the coffin. It's taken them 1 YEAR to add FOUR maps 2 of which aren't even here yet, and we have to wait until March 2023 to see ONE new gun. The balance of this game is one of the worst I've ever played, controller is a direct upgrade to M+KB with the ridiculous aim assist, the pistol is the least fun gun to use and fight against since it can out DM a BR/sniper at any range for whatever reason, the maps are the most basic boring 3 lane ""competitive"" focused things I've ever played in a Halo game. I genuinely regret all the time I put into Infinite to have such a negative time playing this garbage, them bowing down to every complaint some YT/Twitch ""influencer"" you've never heard of has made killed this game, their focus of competitive first rather than fun is the worst thing that's ever happened to Halo.

343's outright refusal to add old fan favorite content from previous games in favor of being ""fresh and new"" shows just how much they do not care what people say, the lack of content could be so easily fixed if they- I dunno- added the maps people love from the previous games, you know the thing that the previous games did as well? No way, that'd be too much of a good idea.

This isn't even mentioning the absolute egregious monetization they have going on in the game, they proudly claimed that there isn't going to be any kind of FOMO before the game launched, but then proceeded to base every limited time in-game event on FOMO. Sure it may be ""free"" but you're forced to do some of the least fun challenges in their limited time gamemodes to progress in the battlepass, and there's a limited number of challenges you can do in a day, so you absolutely have to wait until the next day to continue the miserable grind. If your idea of a free battlepass is to force the player to do daily ""chores"", it's an awful idea.

There's too much to talk about, I'm sure you can go look at a number of other reviews that list just how much is missing from this game, I'm too tired to talk about it all.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn't want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.

The dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.

People who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won't replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don't use the boxes.

PvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules ""No healing potions, no ultimates"" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it's my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can't do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I'll leave it as ""I'm new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being"".

Addressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don't feel it's a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That's pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don't have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it's not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.

Classes. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won't be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren't available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I'm not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn't' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.

So to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on.",went 0 expectation sunk 20 hour alpha want burn also idea game actually launching took gunlance class level 40 think game fantastic excited launch dungeon interesting though far many mini cutscenes character slowly climb ladder walk across skinny beam story decent found spam clicking level 20 get back action able respec talent free nice allowing try different ability different modifier progressed people saying game easy give weapon box give high item level weapon replace anytime soon made obvious completing first dungeon hard mode drop lower item level weapon one get gate level 10 think good thing otherwise level progression would slow spongy enemy result want authentic experience whatever use box pvp side met group player dueling consistently alpha time level 30 gunlance dueled artillerist level 28 player participating level 15 rule healing potion ultimate z v ability generate time perhaps lack knowledge game ranged class several ability stagger lock artillerist flame thrower caught anywhere massive cone anything flinch take damage diminishing return saw warlord dodge ability unique back hop absolutely hated giving small dodge rarely took danger ability give super armor leave new game ranged class kick as time addressing pay 2 win concern feel pay 2 win model traditionally could see upcoming top guild recruiting player platinum founder pack rushing 50 spending premium currency load character rolling map pure speculation understand pay upgrade gear game time could pretty frustrating knowledge guild war actually priority several streamer state play country 100 free play sell stuff people paying real money perpetually allowing bonus without spending dime good thing imo class class balance seems strange 5 class released launch available country access 14 power house class available scouter demolisher lance master arcanist seem desired based general chat feel like gating player dump time first character pay gear new class release fan game content ready slowly introducing cash grab 14 class still plenty find something like gender lock really major issue outside wanting character look like waifu wrap someone went 0 expectation 0 knowledge game really enjoyed think market serious need new mmo format game gamble
1336490,Against the Storm,"I don't remember now what I thought of originally when hearing ""rouguelit/ke citybuilder"" but this game obliterated whatever it was and fully cemented itself as the gold standard going forward. 

I've been following this game's development through early access to release for quite awhile and it's been impressive the entire way. 

The devs behind this game are rockstars, consistently putting out updates at a regular rhythm, they're responsive to feedback, they're unafraid to make major tweaks and changes to the game to keep it in a healthy place. You don't often see a team that's okay with scrapping a feature that isn't working, iterating on it, and implementing something new, so swiftly. I have a lot of respect for them, honestly. And the game itself shows so much of their care, dedication, and skill. I'm excited to see where they go from here (both with this game and any others they have planned). 

So, what's so great about Against the Storm? Why so much praise? 

Citybuilder games have a lot of great bits to them but there tends to be a point where things get bogged down and get tedious. Against the Storm's settlement system avoids this consistent issue with the citybuilding genre. The settlements tend to reach a point of completion before it hits that tedium. It doesn't overstay its welcome. 

Your goal as the player is to meet the demands of a distant but powerful Queen by building settlements out in the forest wilderness, in the relatively calm years between massive, devastating storms. You're effectively building supply lines for the last stronghold of civilization in an extremely hostile world, turned that way thanks to events in the long past involving forsaken gods, forbidden magic, etc. 

Each settlement/city is different thanks to the roguelike elements at play: the different possible biomes (each with differing resources available); the potential villager species that will be present in the city; which resources the caravan brings with them; what resources you pick to embark with; which building blueprints you have available at your first blueprint draw; what effects will be active in the different seasons for the duration of your city; etc. 

And that's just in the first minute or so of starting a new settlement. 

Things get more complicated as your woodcutters hack their way through the hostile forest to discover what's hidden in the fog-cloaked glades beyond. Will there be desperately needed resources? Allies to join your ranks? Riches? Or maybe devastation? 

Almost every challenge you face has multiple ways to meet it, with rewards that differ based on which way you choose to solve it. Do you choose to satisfy the needs of your people or the demands of the Queen? Every settlement you govern will require balancing those two aspects: you need happy people to survive but you also need to allay the Queen's Impatience. She's not very forgiving, you see. 

Making her too mad is one of the ways to fail a settlement: if her Impatience maxes out and you're unable to salvage it in the countdown grace period afterward. There are other ways to lose a settlement, but they tend to spiral in a way that leads to an angry Queen.

If you want to almost always avoid an angry Queen situation, the flexible difficulty system has you covered. Though it will take longer, you can just play on easier difficulties and still enjoy the game. Cities take less time overall, but even if you've met the requirements to complete the settlement, you can still continue afterwards. You won't get further meta-progression experience for that, but hey, sometimes you just wanna open more glades, explore, and relax. 

Other times, you may want to seek out a more brutal experience. With 24 levels of difficulty, Against the Storm has you covered. And it's not difficulty that's tacked on by inflating numbers or making everything just take longer like a citybuilding equivalent of a bulletsponge wave of enemies. After the first handful of increases in difficulty, you unlock the Prestige levels, each of which adds on a different effect that makes balancing things harder. You need flexibility and a strong foundation of managing the flow of the game to succeed consistently, but it's very rewarding. 

This review already very long and I could talk about this game for hours (and honestly, I have). But some other things I love about this game: 

- The UI is so good. Nearly everything you would want in a citybuilder UI is there. If you wonder ""Hey, it'd be neat if I could do X"" it's probably already implemented. 
- The music is great. Each biome has its own set of music, with some overlap and it's just great
- Art direction is so good. 
- The world lore is great and I want to devour more of it. 
- Foxes won the poll and they're my favorite species by far. They're a bit delicate but treat them right and they're run away with a victory every time. 
- The rain and storm sounds are so good. It's definitely a factor in why I have so many goddamned hours in this game

And now for the cons: 
- I do wish there was just a very chill, low-difficulty mode that requires a lot of Reputation, so it takes forever but is just low key. Like, maybe custom parameter modes or something. Basically, I want a Settler/Pioneer-difficulty level settlement but with the game length of Prestige levels or something. 
- Frogs and Bats lost the poll to Foxes and I'm sad they're not (yet) in the game. 

If any of the above piqued your interest, then get this game. It's great. 

Oh, one last thing, and a bit of advice: Harpies seems like pathetic, delicate flowers that wither the second you're not looking at them, which basically IS true.

2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"[b]TLDR for new players[/b]: Dominions is an outstanding game series, my favorite in fact, and it's pretty much what it says in the box. For a new player, if the list of contents seems even remotely interesting, then you'll almost certainly love it - its potential shortcomings are pretty apparent and no one should be surprised upon playing it that, for example, it has low production values - and within that series Dom6 is unquestionably the version you should be getting.

[h1]What is Dominions?[/h1]
So, to be clear, Dominions is a fantasy wargame. It's not 4X: there's effectively no mechanics to model civilian economy or technological development or anything of the sort. Instead, it's purely focused on military operations, maneuvering forces and directing them in battle. For that matter, the player doesn't have direct control over their forces either: instead, you can deploy your forces and give them basic scripted orders, but no direct control over battles. If that doesn't sound exciting for you then that's unfortunate, but as a matter of fact I think that's one of key strengths of the game as this (as well as logistics), contrary to omniscient direct control seen in games like Total War, captures the essence of historical generalship. (And this enables simultaneous turns format, which works wonderfully for multiplayer)

You might not be able to execute Cannae double envelopment, first of all because the unit scripting options aren't that powerful, but above all because this is a magical setting and the use of magic often is decisive. But you are absolutely trying to predict what the opponent will do, counter that in advance (often with magic, a key way tactics tie to strategy), and aim for robustness because everything might not go exactly as you envisioned. And this ties neatly to the operational-strategic layer: you can recruit all basic units since turn 1 but you don't start out with a full repertoire of magical capabilities and these spells need to be researched - magic research playing the role of a tech tree. But you use the same resource (mages) to both research and cast the magic which creates a strategic dilemma, and this is also responsible for many great dynamics like big defender's advantage: a player fighting for his life can suddenly deploy a huge force multiplier by mobilizing their research mages.

I have a hunch most of this mechanical brilliance is unintentional, but since we're on topic of Dominions being a wargame, I'll take an opportunity to praise its ""DRN""  system of rolls (opposed rolls with exploding 2d6) that I consider the gold standard of dice-based systems: I'm an ardent critic of games like D&D and when asked about what you could do better, it's ""basically just copy Dominions"". One of the reasons why, despite having hundreds of combat factors, it remains surprisingly manageable and intuitive: all combat calculations use this same system.

That's for the mechanics, but the strong point of Dominions is the fluff. It has various problems which often come down to the fact that the developers treat it as a sort of art project ignoring stuff like MP balance, but it's also its main selling point. Like, how can one not to be excited about a game where Undead Romans, Spanish Inquisition, Incan necrocracy and Biblical giants duke it out? In a high-magic setting in which you canWish for more wishes and it's not even very good compared to other endgame magics?

And it's not just that this kind of Battle Royale is cool conceptually, it's actually well-researched, has outstanding mechanical implementation of fluff details, and makes for great emergent narratives within the matches, but curiously, thanks to the factions being split to three playable eras, there's also the history of the setting to be deciphered from these snapshots. Plus, despite their missteps sometimes the worldbuilding focus on the developers pays dividends by acting as a creative constraint: that happens to make unique mechanical designs, too.

[h1]So what about Dominions 6?[/h1]
Okay, there's the criticism that Dom 6 is the same game as Dom 5. Well, that's kinda the point! It didn't get to its current state by reinventing the wheel five times, but iterating upon the previous version. In my opinion games by large don't do this nearly enough: strategy gamers for instance might appreciate the point about Civilization, where each of Civ 4, 5, and 6, were finally coming to their own with their final expansions, and in my opinion it's a tragedy that they didn't get one additional expansion each. Iteration is a reliable way, precondition even, to truly achieve greatness, and Illwinter's business model of releasing a major update every half a decade and then supporting it with free patches and content additions sure beats many alternatives like a game with its DLC bundle costing 300€.

That being said, with the current price, for returning players (for new players it's like getting two decades worth of DLCs at price of the base game), it nevertheless has a taste of a raw deal because the game itself as it is now is a bit raw. The problems relating to current state include but are not limited to:
[list]
[*] Entirely missing sprites
[*] Lazily done hack job sprites like a horse sprite with rider's legs still there, or mounts that change appearance when dismounted
[*]UI functionalities having disappeared (for instance, the button to load prepared pretenders is missing, although the hotkey C-l does work - pro tip for the new players, always press '?' on each new screen)
[*]ZERO maps included with the game (the game might have been moving towards random maps, but come on)
[*]Many interactions with e.g. new glamor path bugged
[*]MP lobby has bugs like ""wanted map got crap"" when starting game (client restart fixes?) or all players being able to mess around with message
[/list]

This is in addition to various changes that aren't unfinished per se but aren't necessarily for the better, including things like:
[list]
[*] Generic, unfitting music: Bring back Dråm!
[*] A lot of the UI stuff. Some of the additions like drag selection in tactical screen or ritual movement mapmode are really good! And I can't tell from first principles of accessibility design if the UI elements moved around are just bad or if I'm looking at wrong places out of habit (although I suspect it's bad). But e.g. key features like magic research appearing as an unassuming icon in a row of a dozen at the corner of the screen is simply BAD.
[*] Dom 5 meta wasn't fully settled even in the end, but I can make informed guesses, and I have a hunch that current tuning of indies requires too much early game investment from nations that aren't inherently strong at expanding, and that a lot of ritual spells are way overbuffed to create a good experience
[*] Pretender balance has major issues.  For example, pure imprisoned rainbow bless is gone and good riddance. But it's still more economical to gain bless points for big blesses from taking extra paths on Dom 1 chassis than to take the blesses on a chassis that has high access to that path.
[*] Items often seem overnerfed, especially compared to many of the buffed ritual options.
[/list]

Right now, Dom 6 on account of these issues and others is preferable to Dom 5 mostly for the sake of novelty. Is this enough?

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"I've played a lot of games for a long time this one is most impressive! 
And being a 57 year old man that grew up in the days of Cowboys and Indian Movies & Shows I tell you if we had this to play as well those times would never had died and be just as popular today. 
I thought I knew a lot about our great country and the animal and bird life as well as plant life here but this game has taught me even more as well as even more apreciation for what we have and the beauty that needs to be explored. 
This is the first Red Dead game I have played and I just started playing it a few days ago and can hardly stop each day and can't wait to get back to it is the best compliment I can offer above and beyond what I have already mentioned! 
You don't know what your missing until you try it! 
Everything is truly alive from the people in the towns to the animals and wild life and the horses you learn to take care of and bond with and all go on with their lives with or without you. The stories you hear and become a part of or just soak up and listen to are well written and entertaining as well as the music in the background or being played by people around you! 
So much to experience and explore it's unbelieveable!

Take the time to watch the world around you see the Eagles and Hawks swoop down and grab a rabbit running or a fish out of the water or see the vultures and crows and ravens come and feed off a kill. See the fish jump for bugs or the Cyotties or a fox chase down and kill an animal. 

And see the human ugliness as well of the times the start of the KKK after the Civil War the burning of cross's 
and slave quarters and poor areas outside of towns for Blacks of the times outside of the plantations of the South. 

The attention to detail is off the scale the sounds and the visual beauty as well as the ugliness too!

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"[h1] Welcome to the wizarding world [/h1]

[i]I keep getting asked by people on my friend list what I think about the game, so I'll drop a pre-emptive review/thoughts about the game so far.[/i]

[b] The world [/b]
I could gush about this forever. The world is so well crafted and there was so much love put into it, it's kind of absurd. You start off in the castle, it's bloody massive, very faithful to the template you know, it's clear they tried their best to do a 1:1 replica. Walking through the halls and rooms in ecstatic, never did I feel that exploration is in any way forced, I was encouraged to explore and I have yet to properly utilize fast travel, it just doesn't get old and I still keep bumping into corridors that eluded me, still finding new things. And that's JUST the castle, the moment you look past the castle and take in the sheer scope of the world, it is possitively jaw dropping. The world is ginormous and the developers found clever things to sprinkle everywhere you go. Every now and then you bump into a small village out there, each one is different and again, very detailed and even tho they keep the same aesthetic, it never felt like exploring more of the same. It is honestly kind of overwhelming how much there is to find and play around with, this is a real work of art that even if you do not fancy the world of Harry Potter, should give you plenty of enjoyement to travel through.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
I jumped in on Hard difficulty as I was seeking some challenge out of this, however not much challenge is really provided. I keep being capped on my healing potions, rarely having to reach out for them. There are moments that test you certainly, large group of enemies are fun to tackle and the higher difficulty does not allow you to make many mistakes. Combat is satisfying, you generally play with a selection of 4 main spells you chose, from what you have learned, but you're not limited to them. You get up to 4 spell tabs for a total of 16 spells at the ready that you can switch between during combat at will. You'll learn combos of spells that work well together and swinging your wand around will feel really good. Enemies attack back with attacks you can protect against and ones you can only dodge, always visually apparent by a different colored circle around your head, it's a simple nuance but you'll trip up here and there, game doesn't make you feel invincible. Enemy variety could be larger, but it's not absolutely terrible, what's a bit of a shame is that you rarely battle more than 1 enemy type at the same time, maybe that's something that will be happening more later on, I can imagine that could spice up combat a bit. Every enemy type has some kind of weakness for you to discover and you'll be keeping mental notes.
Beyond your spell selection, there is not really much else you can do to build your character differently, all gear slots are basically stat sticks that you can eventually augment a bit for specific situations but I feel like it's nothing too significant. Still they made the best out of what they had, maybe gearing being more casual was the goal here.

[b] Story and questing [/b]
The story is intriguing but nothing ground breaking, so far it stands on its own pretty well, without spoiling as this is in the opening scenes, you learn that your character can see traces of ancient magic which leads you on a path to pursue this calling, but there's a faction of goblins and their leader who are after the same thing, the knowledge of great magic that's only rumored to exist, very few people in the past knew of its existence and could wield it. The game presents sense of urgency while also intentionally slowing you down, but you can argue it is doing so for you to slowly master this magic and uncover the whole truth so I give it a pass. 
As for sidequesting, you have the usual fetch quests most of the time, that are made interesting by the possibilities a world like this can present. I never felt annoyed doing a side quest that was simply ""deliver"" or ""find and bring"" as it pointed me to places to discover, this is very much carried by the setting and the amazing world. 
Some side quests are more convoluted and eventually lead you to what could be described as collectible chains. The game slowly introduces collectibles and series of puzzles for you to complete through side quests and it kind of feels natural. The only time I wasn't happy with this was when the unlocking spell ""alohomora"" was locked behind one of those, multiple tiers of it even, as someone who wants to unlock every door, I felt forced to go on collectible hunting but in the end, again, I was happy doing so as it led me places... Did I mention exploration is fun yet?

[b] other systems [/b]
Flying! My god, getting your first broom and taking to the skies feels surreal. You could fast travel, sure, but why would you when you can fly? Game places very few restrictions on where you can and can't fly, practically the whole world is traversable on a mount, it's amazing.
Room of Requirement. If you like creating your own space or ever found yourself lost in building a house in The Sims, this will be right up your alley, everything is customizable and by exploring you will find more items to place down,, but this feature got overshadowed for me by taking care of your own beasts. I damn nearly cried grooming and feeding the creatures, it's so adorable, I could spend hours just watching them in the space you get for them, this is my single most favorite feature.
Beast catching. You have to catch your beasts so better go out there hunting, many types of beasts to catch and bring home out there in the world. Some are easy to catch, some harder, always having to find the best approach, it's honestly fun.

[b] Missing this [/b]
Reputation system, honestly, the game allows you to cast unforgivable curses and nobody seems to care you do so. You can fling avada kedavra next to dozens of witnesses and most you may get is a couple of comments. I wish there were some drawbacks, if not in ""reputation"" then at least visually, think Mass Effect 2 where Shepard would look more scarred the more evil you'd be. I'd take anything.
Points system, it's Hogwards, part of it is winning points for your house and while during some quests you get the ""points to *your house here*"" comment, it isn't reflected anywhere. There's virtually no rivalry between the houses as a result.
Quidditch, please... The game comes up with an excuse to not have it but man, what a shame.
And lastly, I would like to see some deeper relationship feature, building friendship with some important characters, outside of main quests. Doing things for them and maybe being able to take them with you on your exploratory adventures. When I think Harry Potter, I also think of the friendship the main group had going for them, it sometimes feels a bit lonely in this giant world.

[b] The bad [/b]
Performance is rocky, the game drops frames unexplainably, in cutscenes and in a few areas, this is something that can be fixed with patches so hopefully it'll improve.
Voice pitch? Don't even bother, leave it on the default spot when creating your character. It makes your voice robotic, echoey and just plain weird.
[strike]And lastly... Why in the seven hells in a game with 4 houses you think it's enough to give players 3 character slots, at least give the damn 4.[/strike] Been resolved, you now get 10 character slots.

[b] Conclusion [/b]
This game makes me feel like a kid again, I don't remember the last time I was this happy and eager to explore a world, this is coming from someone who grew up on HP, this is all practically a wet dream made real. I am overjoyed the be part of all this and despite knowing this could be a much better game, both improved in what it offers and in some of the glaring issue it has, I can overlook it because so much of this game has been crafted with a lot of love.

1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","In-mission gameplay is quite fun. The music is nice. Sound is spot on. Visuals are great. This is where any praise I have for the game ends.

I would not recommend Darktide to most people, the only exception being those who have played the hell out of Vermintide 2 and are looking for something new. Anyone else should stay far away. Despite Vermintide 2's small but dedicated playerbase offering a tidal wave of feedback over the years, Fatshark, the developers of the -tide series and several other prior games that no one cares about anymore, thought it prudent to ignore it all and instead slap together a mess of predatory player-retention tactics. Darktide launched missing key features from the most recent title, chief among them the ability to select a level of your choosing at whatever difficulty you'd prefer, the ability to fine tune weapons and equipment to your liking, materials and equipment being shared between your characters and the ability to craft an item from scratch.

Fatshark expects players to put up with a poorly-made shop system reminiscent of mobile trash. The odds of getting your weapon exactly as you'd like it to be are astronomically low. Merely acquiring the weapon you want to use in the first place leaves you at the mercy of an hourly RNG reset. This is by design to try to boost player metrics, which given the player retention numbers according to Steamcharts, backfired horrifically.

Of the crafting currently available, players are able to change one property on an item. The rest become locked. This is a poor system when several properties are worthless for a variety of reasons on any given item, and can effectively brick an item. Speaking of bricking, there's at least one weapon trait that effectively makes your weapon worse if you're unfortunate enough to roll it. Fatshark promised the rest of the crafting system to swap up blessings would be added in December.

Negative reviews begin to pour in. Fatshark claims they'll listen to feedback and try to course correct, slowly. Further communication with the community reveals the new plan with crafting (which still isn't fully implemented at this point). Properties being locked are still on the menu, with the traits (or blessings as they're called) also becoming locked after you switch one on your weapons.

Essentially, the system as proposed is the same RNG-laden mess players were supposed to get in December, just two months later (at best) and without requiring quite as many items to select your weapons blessing.

To put it briefly, Fatshark is deadset on these odd gacha-style mechanics that strip players of almost all agency in their equipment. They say they care about feedback, but nothing is changing regarding player's issues with the progression system, merely being added at a snail's pace.

There are a plethora of other issues, of course. The game's real money cash shop was fully functioning when the game released despite the missing aspects. Bot players are beyond useless, likely on purpose. Numerous enemies are janky at best, broken at worst in terms of their AI and reactions to the player's actions. Several properties in the game, tooltips, stats and the like are obscured, incorrect or hidden from players. Performance is a mess for many people and optimization is in the gutter.

As I mentioned near the beginning of the review, I can only recommend this game to people woefully bored of Vermintide 2, which was sadly neglected as Fatshark prepared this absolute trashfire of a game. If you don't own Vermintide 2, I'm not going to suggest buying it unless it's on a massive sale, so that Fatshark gets as little money out of it as possible. Instead, perhaps look into Deep Rock Galactic or Left4Dead 2.

UPDATE: 4/4/2023
You may see numerous negative reviews around this date. This is due to Fatshark nerfing numerous (admittedly overpowered) weapons. I can only sympathize with the people who had their weapons nerfed, as building weapons is still a really fucking stupid and arbitrary slot machine, and it may very well have taken hundreds of hours for people to get one that doesn't have garbage stats, then perks, then blessings. At any given moment, you're one patch away from your weapon becoming a brick and there's nothing you can do about it due to perk and blessing locks.

UPDATE: 5/25/2023
As of today's community update, Fatshark still has no intention to fix the poorly received crafting mechanics that are essentially putting more and more bullets into this game's corpse every time an update slides on without rectifying the issue. In fact, the next update will reintroduce the MTX store to the game, so you can give Fatshark more of your money with which they will not use to fix the game or address player concerns.

UPDATE: 8/3/2023
Fatshark has released new plans to target some issues players have brought up with the core games systems.

Regarding mission selection, there will be a new type of difficulty that features more modifiers, swifter turnaround on available missions, server selection and added bonuses for engaging in quickplay. Not quite mission selection, but this helps people who are after higher end challenges.

Currencies will soon be account-bound, not character-bound. Perfect, should have been this way from the get go, glad it's happening.

Crafting is still a mess with the proposed changes. Once again, locks are going to remain on items, with virtually no changes to weapon locks, only curios are slightly alleviated of the issues surrounding the lock system. Why this of all things is something that a stubborn member of the dev or management team is digging his heels in over is a mystery to me, it's the most complained about aspect of the game, and has served to functionally kill the massive playerbase that this game boasted its first week as compared to Vermintide's peaks.",mission gameplay quite fun music nice sound spot visuals great praise game end would recommend darktide people exception played hell vermintide 2 looking something new anyone else stay far away despite vermintide 2 small dedicated playerbase offering tidal wave feedback year fatshark developer tide series several prior game one care anymore thought prudent ignore instead slap together mess predatory player retention tactic darktide launched missing key feature recent title chief among ability select level choosing whatever difficulty prefer ability fine tune weapon equipment liking material equipment shared character ability craft item scratch fatshark expects player put poorly made shop system reminiscent mobile trash odds getting weapon exactly like astronomically low merely acquiring weapon want use first place leaf mercy hourly rng reset design try boost player metric given player retention number according steamcharts backfired horrifically crafting currently available player able change one property item rest become locked poor system several property worthless variety reason given item effectively brick item speaking bricking least one weapon trait effectively make weapon worse unfortunate enough roll fatshark promised rest crafting system swap blessing would added december negative review begin pour fatshark claim listen feedback try course correct slowly communication community reveals new plan crafting still fully implemented point property locked still menu trait blessing called also becoming locked switch one weapon essentially system proposed rng laden mess player supposed get december two month later best without requiring quite many item select weapon blessing put briefly fatshark deadset odd gacha style mechanic strip player almost agency equipment say care feedback nothing changing regarding player issue progression system merely added snail pace plethora issue course game real money cash shop fully functioning game released despite missing aspect bot player beyond useless likely purpose numerous enemy janky best broken worst term ai reaction player action several property game tooltips stats like obscured incorrect hidden player performance mess many people optimization gutter mentioned near beginning review recommend game people woefully bored vermintide 2 sadly neglected fatshark prepared absolute trashfire game vermintide 2 going suggest buying unless massive sale fatshark get little money possible instead perhaps look deep rock galactic left4dead 2 update 4 4 2023 may see numerous negative review around date due fatshark nerfing numerous admittedly overpowered weapon sympathize people weapon nerfed building weapon still really fucking stupid arbitrary slot machine may well taken hundred hour people get one garbage stats perk blessing given moment one patch away weapon becoming brick nothing due perk blessing lock update 5 25 2023 today community update fatshark still intention fix poorly received crafting mechanic essentially putting bullet game corpse every time update slide without rectifying issue fact next update reintroduce mtx store game give fatshark money use fix game address player concern update 8 3 2023 fatshark released new plan target issue player brought core game system regarding mission selection new type difficulty feature modifier swifter turnaround available mission server selection added bonus engaging quickplay quite mission selection help people higher end challenge currency soon account bound character bound perfect way get go glad happening crafting still mess proposed change lock going remain item virtually change weapon lock curio slightly alleviated issue surrounding lock system thing something stubborn member dev management team digging heel mystery complained aspect game served functionally kill massive playerbase game boasted first week compared vermintide peak

1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","In the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, there are only games released a year too early. 

Darktide is one of the best looking, feeling and sounding interpretations of the Warhammer 40,000 universe that has ever been released. Yet, it came out clearly too early and had many bugs and a poor progression system, with an in-game shop prioritised over promised features. That being sad, 10 months post release and after many, many patches, including the recently released complete rework of the class talent tree, it finally feels like Darktide is where it should have been at launch. 

Darktide is incredibly fun to play, as you slaw hordes of heretics with probably the most satisfying horde combat in a game yet, with the incredible soundtrack playing over the carnage and a near perfect rendition of a hive city it is incredible. The melee is an upgrade on Vermintide 1 + 2s, the shooting thankfully also feels incredibly weighty (especially Ogre weapons or the bolt pistol and the depth of the new talent trees, coupled with so many new abilities add a lot of depth to the game, especially at higher levels. The missions also feel very distinct visually and whilst there are shared mechanics between some missions they never feel like a copy paste of each other, likely due to the AI director and diverse location themes. 

Whilst I now feel comfortable recommending Darktide as a very good horde shooter, £50 is a high asking price. I would still recommend picking it up on sale, as you will get much more bang for your buck. Equally, it's a game best enjoyed with friends. I am very excited for the future of Darktide, now that it has found its feet and going by their record I am sure Fatshark will only further enhance this game to be one of the best horde games ever, which it really has the potential to be.",grim darkness 41st millennium game released year early darktide one best looking feeling sounding interpretation warhammer 40 000 universe ever released yet came clearly early many bug poor progression system game shop prioritised promised feature sad 10 month post release many many patch including recently released complete rework class talent tree finally feel like darktide launch darktide incredibly fun play slaw horde heretic probably satisfying horde combat game yet incredible soundtrack playing carnage near perfect rendition hive city incredible melee upgrade vermintide 1 2 shooting thankfully also feel incredibly weighty especially ogre weapon bolt pistol depth new talent tree coupled many new ability add lot depth game especially higher level mission also feel distinct visually whilst shared mechanic mission never feel like copy paste likely due ai director diverse location theme whilst feel comfortable recommending darktide good horde shooter 50 high asking price would still recommend picking sale get much bang buck equally game best enjoyed friend excited future darktide found foot going record sure fatshark enhance game one best horde game ever really potential

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Seriously the best WW2 shooter (aka PTSD simulator) I've ever played. COD WW2 and Battlefield V were absolute jokes and this game puts them to shame. This game is for everyone: milsim lovers, casual players, WW2 history buffs, etc. Do yourself a favor and get it.

Note: To make the game run better you need to do 2 things:

1). Click on the Settings cogwheel to the right of the game's Play button in your Steam Library --> Properties --> General --> in the Launch Options put: -dx12 -USEALLAVAILABLECORES

2).*Do this step AFTER already setting all your in-game graphics options* 
Go to C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\HLL\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor and open GameUserSettings.ini. with Notepad. Find the FrameRateLimit value (you can search for it by pressing CTRL+F) and change it to whatever your monitor's refresh rate is (mine for example is 165hz, so I would change it to 165. This will tell the game to run at a maximum of 165 fps). Then click File --> Save. After this you need to right click the file and go to Properties. Next to ""Attributes"", checkmark ""Read-only"" and click Apply.

The reason for doing this is every time the game starts up it tries to set the framerate limit back to 60 fps, so if you don't do this step you are just gonna be locked at a maximum of 60 fps. Also, when you change GameUserSettings.ini to be Read-only the game can't change the framerate back to 60; it can only read the file and then it will use whatever you put in for the framerate limit. If you need to change any of your graphics settings you will need to uncheck Read-only so the game can save the settings to the file. Make sure the framerate limit is correct before re-checking Read-only.

Optional bonus fix: Watching the intro movies every time the game starts up is annoying, so if you want the game to skip them go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hell Let Loose\HLL\Content and rename the Movies folder to ""Movies (rename to just Movies to enable intro movies)"". Alternatively you can just delete the folder.

949230,Cities: Skylines II,"If you want to pay full price to participate in an early beta test so you can use the improved road tools and mixed use residential/commercial zoning, then this is your game. The headlines point to the many performance problems the game has, but there are numerous bugs in the simulator and in the gameplay as well. A lot of smaller bugs can be overlooked, as the game is playable—but as you progressively expand your city you realize that the economy is not working properly (chiefly import/export), and garbage does not work properly either...which makes developing any serious strategy pointless since the balance may get thrown completely off when bugs get fixed.

Colossal Order did an awesome job bringing us the first Cities: Skylines, but I don't think we should reward them or especially their publisher, Paradox, for failing to finish the game before full release. Right now this is a broken game and it should have had a much larger and longer beta test—by months. At least wait until modders can come in and fix what the developers haven't gotten to, as even some of their design decisions were silly too...like not allowing us to turn off the weather.",want pay full price participate early beta test use improved road tool mixed use residential commercial zoning game headline point many performance problem game numerous bug simulator gameplay well lot smaller bug overlooked game playable progressively expand city realize economy working properly chiefly import export garbage work properly either make developing serious strategy pointless since balance may get thrown completely bug get fixed colossal order awesome job bringing u first city skyline think reward especially publisher paradox failing finish game full release right broken game much larger longer beta test month least wait modders come fix developer gotten even design decision silly like allowing u turn weather

1627720,Lies of P,"This is by far one of the ""closest"" Souls-like game out of all the Souls-like, and I say this as a huge compliment. It's obvious where the game takes its inspirations from, but where other games have failed this game has certainly managed to achieve a great deal.

Is it perfect? Hardly, but then so are Dark Souls 2 & 3. However, the game's tight combat system, high level of polish and general vibe ties together so well that, without prior knowledge, if someone told me that this was a From Software game I would have believed it. The game also has superb performance and I didn't run into a single bug playing since early access - this is pretty crazy given buggy releases in recent years.

Out of all the Souls-like games I've played however, this turned out to be the most difficult Souls-like I've ever played. The bosses are difficult, unique, but mechanically fair. Some fights will feel unfair, but for the most part it just means that the player needs to get better at parrying or use the appropriate gear.

Overall very impressed with this surprise hit, and would definitely be on the look out for future games from these devs.",far one closest soul like game soul like say huge compliment obvious game take inspiration game failed game certainly managed achieve great deal perfect hardly dark soul 2 3 however game tight combat system high level polish general vibe tie together well without prior knowledge someone told software game would believed game also superb performance run single bug playing since early access pretty crazy given buggy release recent year soul like game played however turned difficult soul like ever played boss difficult unique mechanically fair fight feel unfair part mean player need get better parrying use appropriate gear overall impressed surprise hit would definitely look future game devs

1063730,New World,"I have played this game 3155 hours and would have given in a thumbs up until recently.  I am not your typical player as I am a 52 year old father of 4 teenagers.   One of them played with me and we had some unforgettable times.  I have played MMO's for 25 years when Ultima Online came out.  New World started off a bit slow once you got to 60 but I believe the devs put their heart and soul into the game over the past year and it shows.  First it is a gorgeous game from a graphics stand point.  There was times I am out running around and I would have to stop to watch the sun go down.  It was incredible!  Some of the changes the devs put in was it cost less azoth to fast travel, you can get to all your storage from any storage, the umbral shards became a lot easier to grind you gear score up, OPR, new Expeditions, soon to be new lands that you do not even have to pay extra for, and many other changes.  I was incredibly excited about the future of the game.  

I really enjoyed all the professions and had them all at 200+ except for Weaponsmith that was at 187.  Wars and OPR were a lot of fun and challenging especially for more of a PVE type player like myself.  50 on 50 going at each other what is there not to like?  Expeditions and Invasions were fantastic especially with friends and company mates. Farming for resources on full servers was difficult because it seemed that there was more players looking for resources then resources available but it is something I still enjoyed doing.  Sometimes I had good runs and others not so much as others beat me to it.  In the end over time I was always able to get what I needed but you could tell others were not able to as they would get upset if you beat them to a resource node.   With the new lands and more space I think this will be corrected though.  

Obviously I really enjoyed this game and even with it's flaws I felt it was one of the best overall MMO's I have ever played!   In all the years I have played MMO's I have never even been accused of cheating let alone suspended or banned from a game.  That came to an end in New World as I was first suspended for 'cheating' on 5/20/22 for a week.  That is the only description they give you and you can only appeal as you are locked out of any other way to communicate.  I followed the appeal process that day and appealed the ban.  A week later I still had not received a response so before logging in I went to the New World forums and explained what happened trying to figure out what to do.  An admin on the forums was empathetic and told me to appeal again and showed me how to add the logs stored on my computer to my appeal.  So I appealed again.   In the end I figured it was a mistake so I jumped back into the game I so enjoyed.  I never received a response to either appeal except for a canned response that they are working on my appeal and one of them thanked me for playing Lost Ark.  Not sure how they messed that up as the appeal was for New World.  At this point I was 1900 hours into the game. 

I put in another 1200 hours until I was permanently banned on 9/21/22.  I appealed immediately thinking after all this game time how can this happen to me?  Within 8 hours I received a canned response that I have seen all over the forums that I had 'cheated', my appeal was denied and any future replies would be ignored.  I tried to email them back to find out what I specifically did and within a minute I got the same response. 

So after 25 years and untold hours of playing MMO's with a perfect record here I am banned from a game that I was loyal to, enjoyed immensely and I have no idea what I did to deserve this.  How can I support a game that treats it's player base like this especially a loyal player who stuck with them during the tough times when so many players did not?

My apologies it got long.  If you made it this far thank you for listening.

***An update on 9/25/22 - I was told to try and appeal a few days after the initial appeals by multiple people so I tried it this morning.  I included 8 logs (rather large files stored on my computer and the most I could fit in the space provided), a Steam forums post explaining everything (also long winded) and the official NW forums post from May when I was first banned for a week along with other information and within 5 minutes I received the canned denial.  No way could have they looked at anything to make a determination if my appeal was warranted or not.  I did reply to that email and I got two emails they are looking at my appeal.  Maybe I will get lucky.  

So to keep track my first two appeals from the week ban I sent on 5/20/22 and 5/28/22 were never responded to.  On the permanent ban from 9/21/22 the first one without logs was responded to and denied within 8 hours and the second one that same day with logs was not responded to.  The third appeal with 8 logs on 9/25/22 was denied within 5 minutes.  The fourth appeal made on 9/26/22 also with my last 8 logs was not responded to.  So far I have appealed 6 times and only two were even responded to.  

My appeal today, 9/28/22, with the last 8 logs and two forum posts that are again rather lengthy to get more information to AGS was denied in 3 minutes!  So the only 3 appeals responded two were denied in 3 and 5 minutes.  Those two had 8 large log files stored on my computer that can prove my innocence where are the other appeal that did not took around 8 hours to deny.  

I would hope what we all can agree on is that AGS's appeal process is an embarrassment.  I feel for the innocent players that are still suspended that bought a dupers item on the trading post because if they have to go through the appeals process many others who are innocent will be banned permanently.

***10/8/22 update:  On 9/26/22 the dev Katy K said on twitter that AGS is investigating the dup and housing trophy issue and once the investigation is done and you are still banned to appeal.  I am not part of that as I had not traded anything recently and i keep my trophies separated in my three houses.  I appealed again on 9/28/22 and it was denied in 3 minutes.  Really AGS are you taking this seriously at all, 3 minutes???  She said  the investigation was concluded on 9/29/22 and since I was still banned I sent another appeal.  There was never a response.  On the same day a friend contacted Amazon about a return and spoke to Antiqa.  He asked if she could unsuspend my account and agreed to and that I should be able to login in 48-72 hours.  It was still banned 72 hours later so he contact them again.  Mohommed helped this time and sent an appeal to AGS stating that I should receive an email within 48-72 hours.  He also had a manager call my friend and they spoke about the dilemma I was in.  She transferred him to a direct line with AGS but they never answered.  I had heard this before from others trying to get there accounts unbanned.  Both reps tried to be helpful  but were not able to help in the end.

The patch notes from updated 1.6.7 New World on 10/4/22 that said they adjusted an in game penalty message to provide additional clarity and context.  Finally I had been asking for this since I first was banned! Know what you are banned for will at least help you defend yourself.  I logged in all excited and it still says I was banned for 'cheating' with no additional clarity or context.  Back to square one as they fail to even get the patch right.  I appealed on 10/5/22 and again I never received a response.  Today on 10/8/22 I just made my 8th appeal.

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"Game was and still is so cool, but what's more remarkable to me is how easy is to look for/install/use the mods this time.
I usually play the standard mode, sometimes due to my laziness, but this game has quite a few excellent mods, especially if you are looking for a nice immersion and realism, a couple of things that you couldn't find at the original skyrim. This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyable, even when you role-play warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pit.
Mods i use:
- Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition: this fixes most of the bugs of the game
- Campfire: Lets you build a campfire and different sorts of tents
- Vivid weathers: Over 500+ Weathers with different sounds and adjustable brightness, shadows, etc.
- Frostfall: Depending on how difficult you want it, you can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder faster
-  Wet and Cold: Same thing but mostly for NPCs. Also includes some other features like blurry screen when you look up while it's rainning or snowing.
-  Point the way: Since i'm looking for some realism i avoid fast travelling, this is why i got this mod, which shows me the way to every city at every crossroad.
- Lampposts of Skrim: Lamp posts on the main roads, but just what is necessary, not plenty of them.
- Waves: Now beaches with waves :D
- Better horses: Now horses go faster than you by foot, something that makes kind of sense.
- Less agressive animals: Just makes less agressive small animals like rats or crabs. Was kind of ridiculous to see a crab trying to fight imperial soldiers.
- Hunter's Reward - Better prices: Able to skin and sell pelts for a reasonable price in case you wanna play as a hunter.
- iNeed: To eat, to drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardable.
- Holidays: Skyrim has special days like our christmas and all that stuff
- Expanded Carriage Service: Carriage service in places where you couldn't find them before, like Morthal or Dawnstar.
- Rich merchants of Skyrim: Merchants have more money to buy, meaning that you don't need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff. (1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBH)
- Run for your lives: When a dragon attacks people run off instead of trying to smack the dragon.
- When vampires attack: Same with vampires
- The Paarthurnax Dilemma: Lets you spare his life. 
- Hold border banners: Banners from different holds are placed on their borders, pretty simple but cool enough for me.
- Immersive patrols SE: Since there's a civil war going on, it's weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war. With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around. Make other kind of patrols available, like the dawnguard.
- Practice Dummies: You can use them to improve your skill till level 30 out of 100. That means that you don't need to deal with badass foes with the skill ""i barely know how to hold the sword"".
- Mammoth Pelts: You can skin mammoths, something that i still don't get why it wasn't allowed in the original game.
- Dog followers are Huskies: Makes it cooler and makes sense too since Skyrim is the north.
- Whistle: Lets you whistle to the horse to make him come over, avoiding to search for the damn horse every time he flees from a battle.
- NPC's Run and Walk at your pace:  exactly what the mod says.
- Animal poverty: Animals don't drop gold. Like they have a bank account or something...
- Immersive armors: adds different kind of armors and shields. The more smithing perks you got the more armors will show up. (Showed in auxiliary armors)
- MamTuskPowderGrind: You can grind  mammoth tusk to make its powder, an ingredient that was so hard to find and wasn't allowed (don't know why) to make it out from the normal tusks.
- Fantasy Soundtrack Project: Replaces the original music OR adds its songs to the original music. Just necessary if after all these hundreds of hours you got tired of the original one.
- Enhaced blood textures: MORE BLOOD!
- Skyland: Landscape texture overhaul
- Static Mesh Improvement Mod: Better textures for interiors.
- Skyrim better roads: More and better textures for main roads.
- Verdant: Better textures for grass.
- Blacksmith forge water fix se: Makes the water from the blacksmith look real. Yeah... once you realize you need it.
- Realistic water two: Improves A LOT water textures and effects.
- Open cities Skyrim: No loading screen when you get into a city (this needs a patch to work with Ineed mod)
- Immersive Citizens: their behaviour and dialogues are more real. (needs a patch to work with Open cities)
BTW, i got them in this order and all of them work properly

Some of the mods are only available on nexusmods, which leads me to my final advise: Download the mod ""noble skyrim"". Improves SO MUCH the city textures and buildings. There's just one problem, it has been ported to special edition but still remains on original skyrim from nexus: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/? 
There are two options, wait till it's completely ported to SSE or download it manually from original skyrim and install it manually from Nexus Mod Manager as well. It won't show up on the list, but it will be there, so don't worry. There's a patch as well to work properly with SMIM mod (Static Meshes).

EDIT: I strongly recommend another mod that i just found out! it's called: Amazing Follower Tweaks SSE, and i found it on nexusmods. Short description: you can have more than 1 follower (which is nice since Campfire mod adds tents up to 4 people) and it's possible to tweak each follower as you wish, like creating different sets of outfits depending on if they are outside or inside a city, setting primary spells, weapons, THEY CAN EVEN RIDE HORSES NOW!! and some other stuff. Check it out here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4340/?

1. Bobby and Co want to grab as much money as possible before being kicked to the curb on January 1st, 2024.
2. The game was lackluster on the Battle.net client, so they figured they'd ask Steam users for their credit cards.
3. To get reviewed and slammed by the Steam community.
4. To pay for their attorney fees and the tens of millions they lost against the state of California due to worker rights violations.

And they thought putting the Blizzard games on Steam would give them a fresh start.

P.S. Why is it that EA and Ubisoft can link accounts, but Blizzard cannot? Because they want players to double-dip.

Since Steam isn't saying I refunded. You can read it for yourself

The depth of customization of skills alone is unmatched, but not only that, it is incredibly accessible and beginner friendly. Skills and nodes are clearly tagged with related stats and attributes, letting new and veteran players know what their gear should look like in order to get the most out of them. 

I believe this game straddles the fine line between Path of Exile's overwhelming passive and skill system and Diablo 3's underwhelming simplicity of both gear and skills with considerable grace. 

I would recommend this game to anyone who feels potentially alienated by the mainstays of the genre, or who is looking for a fresh and rewarding experience.

1063730,New World," New World: A Promising Game Marred by Unfair Bans and Unhelpful Support

I recently had the opportunity to delve into the immersive world of New World, and I must admit that the game initially captivated me with its engaging game play mechanics, enjoyable fishing activities, and stunning graphics. However, despite my initial enthusiasm, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game due to the unjust ban I received, the toxic community, and the disappointing support experience I encountered.

Firstly, let me begin by highlighting the positive aspects of New World. The game play mechanics are solid, providing a satisfying mix of exploration, combat, and progression. The fishing feature, in particular, stood out as a relaxing and enjoyable pastime, allowing players to unwind and appreciate the game's detailed environments. Additionally, the graphics are undeniably impressive, showcasing the game world's beauty with stunning visual effects.

Unfortunately, my positive experience came to an abrupt halt when I was randomly banned from the game for allegedly using a ""known cheating program."" To my bewilderment, there was no explanation provided for this ban, despite using only my regular computer programs during game play. What compounded my frustration was the discovery that many other players had encountered similar issues, facing bans without any concrete evidence or explanation.

Venturing into the New World community in search of answers, I was disheartened to find a toxic atmosphere rife with individuals blindly defending the game's anti-cheat system, insisting that it could never make mistakes. This lack of empathy and understanding from the community only served to exacerbate my frustration and sense of injustice.

Turning to the game's support for assistance, I had hoped for a resolution to my predicament. However, my experience with the support team proved to be deeply unsatisfactory. After submitting a ticket detailing my ban and providing the necessary information, I received a copy-pasted email response within a mere 30 minutes. To my dismay, the reply simply stated that my ban would not be lifted, offering no clarification or opportunity for further dialogue. It was clear that my case had not been adequately reviewed, leaving me feeling dismissed and unheard.

Regrettably, despite the many positives that New World has to offer, my ban and subsequent disappointing interactions with both the community and support team have left me with no choice but to strongly discourage others from investing their time and money into this game. While it has great potential, the unfair banning practices, toxic community, and unsupportive customer service overshadow the positive aspects of the game, leading to an overall unsatisfactory experience.

I sincerely hope that Amazon Games Studios addresses these issues promptly, as New World has the potential to become a truly remarkable MMO. Until then, I urge everyone to exercise caution and consider the risks associated with investing their time and resources into a game that may not provide the fair and enjoyable experience it promises.",new world promising game marred unfair ban unhelpful support recently opportunity delve immersive world new world must admit game initially captivated engaging game play mechanic enjoyable fishing activity stunning graphic however despite initial enthusiasm good conscience recommend game due unjust ban received toxic community disappointing support experience encountered firstly let begin highlighting positive aspect new world game play mechanic solid providing satisfying mix exploration combat progression fishing feature particular stood relaxing enjoyable pastime allowing player unwind appreciate game detailed environment additionally graphic undeniably impressive showcasing game world beauty stunning visual effect unfortunately positive experience came abrupt halt randomly banned game allegedly using known cheating program bewilderment explanation provided ban despite using regular computer program game play compounded frustration discovery many player encountered similar issue facing ban without concrete evidence explanation venturing new world community search answer disheartened find toxic atmosphere rife individual blindly defending game anti cheat system insisting could never make mistake lack empathy understanding community served exacerbate frustration sense injustice turning game support assistance hoped resolution predicament however experience support team proved deeply unsatisfactory submitting ticket detailing ban providing necessary information received copy pasted email response within mere 30 minute dismay reply simply stated ban would lifted offering clarification opportunity dialogue clear case adequately reviewed leaving feeling dismissed unheard regrettably despite many positive new world offer ban subsequent disappointing interaction community support team left choice strongly discourage others investing time money game great potential unfair banning practice toxic community unsupportive customer service overshadow positive aspect game leading overall unsatisfactory experience sincerely hope amazon game studio address issue promptly new world potential become truly remarkable mmo urge everyone exercise caution consider risk associated investing time resource game may provide fair enjoyable experience promise

252490,Rust,"Once upon a time in Rust, in less cringy format, recollected to the best of my memory.

Together with the help of a random friend, I made a small, simple base and proceeded to work on gathering resources for I'd say about 20 hours, upgrading said base along the way as it was my intent to turn it into a farm.

I was getting harrassed by a small group of people every now and then but they didn't seem really interested in raiding, just camping or taking whatever kits they could get from our exchanges.

After a small conversation in outpost, I realized something very important about landmines, something that seemed very unused at the time.

Out of spite from the exchanges that got nowhere, I decided to put all my efforts into crafting possibly over a hundred landmines, surrounding the area around the base with them. There were many bushes and grass around the area, making it easy to hide those mines.

After that, I started armoring the base, changing specific stone walls to metal walls, and more important (and some fake) walls with high qual.

A couple of hours later when working on furnaces I started hearing the sound of certain landmines popping, often chain detonating as one detonated the other. A couple more exchanges later and some kits I took and another group of people got entangled into the mess, a larger clan, which also ended up getting killed by the landmines, several times. The explosions and constant fights however, seemingly attracted more and more people, nakeds, smaller groups, duos and people trying to cash in by getting kills and kits from others.

I had upgraded what I could, with whatever resources I had left. Occasionally using what kits I could salvage to do a little bit more shooting, but most of the time as a solo you're not getting anywhere when there's such a large amount of players expecting you. Wipe was almost at hand, so I didn't really mind.

The honeycombed walls didn't last long, and it certainly wasn't longer until they got through to where they wanted. But even then, people still kept dying to more landmines. I had honestly lost count of how many I had placed around, of how many resources were used. But boy did I have a smile on my face, knowing that as soon as they got into the TC, there was really nothing I had in terms of resources other than a couple stacks of high qual and metal scrap. And I'm more than sure that the amount of gear lost to the landmines, as they [b]destroy items[/b] in one's inventory if they die to one, was not worth what was found there.

TL;DR I used every single resource gathered over a wipe to make a large amount of people most likely lose an enormous quantity of their work and resources for almost nothing.

11/10 would do it again.

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"[h1][i]This game is a work of art, simple as that.[/i][/h1]

[h2][i]-[u]Overview[/u]-[/i][/h2]
[i]Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice[/i] is a shining example of how to tell a story through a video game. 
Accompanied by the ever-present voices in her mind, players follow Senua on a journey through her own personal hell, spawned from her twisted psyche. [i]Hellblade[/i] makes excellent use of very subtle elements to immerse the player in the experience, and to provide just a small, personal glimpse of what the protagonist is experiencing. 

[quote]🎮[i]Hellblade[/i] can be played adequately with both keyboard/mouse and controller.🎮[/quote]
[h2][i]-[u]Gameplay[/u]-[/i][/h2]
[h3]Combat:[/h3]
I played on the “Auto” difficulty setting, which made enemy and player health vary somewhat between fights.

[i]Hellblade[/i] isn't really a fighting game, so combat is fairly sparse. When it does occur, I found it to be a mixed bag. Combat controls are fairly basic; you have a light attack, heavy attack, shove, block/parry, dodge and a special contextual ability. These are quite satisfying to use and have very nice animations, though the targeting system can be a burden. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2132738726 
The game camera automatically locks on to whichever enemy is attacking Senua, and cannot be unlocked. Players can manually switch between targets, but it's still quite awkward sometimes, especially in confined spaces. 

There are a small variety of enemies with different attacks, which is enough to keep combat interesting, though their spawning can be an issue. Enemies will spawn in set places in the combat area, even if the player is standing on that exact spot. This can lead to Senua getting whacked before the enemy has even fully spawned in, which is annoying considering she can be quite squishy. 

One aspect of the game's combat I particularly liked was the hints and cues given by the voices in Senua's head. They will often yell “Behind you!” or “He's finished!”. It's a clever bit of design, and one that fits very well.

[h3]Level Design:[/h3]
Levels in [i]Hellblade[/i] are linear and often feature clever puzzle elements. A prominent one requires players to use aspects of the environment to form a symbol that matches the one present on a door. This can be debris viewed from the correct angle, a shadow cast on a wall, and more. I very much enjoyed it every time it appeared in the game. 

At some points Senua backtracks through previously explored areas, which provides a stark contrast; where her original journey was twisted by her psychosis to make areas dark and foreboding, the return trip presents a warm and peaceful atmosphere. 

[h2][i]-[u]Story[/u]-[/i][/h2]
[i]Hellblade's[/i] focus is entirely on Senua's psychosis. Ever-present voices follow her, judging, scolding and encouraging, and they're all hers. Senua's goal is to save the soul of her deceased lover Dillion, and she travels through battlefields, mental and literal, to reach the goddess Hela, whom she believes holds his soul. 

Throughout the story, Senua suffers severe symptoms of her psychosis such as vivid hallucinations in which she witnesses everything from changes in the environment to people and events from her memories manifesting before her eyes. These provide backstory on Senua and the events of her past, offering insight into the factors influencing her severe mental illness. 

Subtle efforts are made to trigger an emotional response to in-game events, for example, one section of the game features darkness that will kill Senua should she stay in it for too long. To avoid this, she carries a torch. Upon entering a dark area, one of the voices shouts “The torch is going out!”. 

This instils a moment of panic in the player; fear of a danger, though maybe there never really was one. This reflects Senua's psychosis; her fear of the horrible experiences that aren't really happening.

[i]Hellblade's[/i] story and themes are fascinating, bizarre, scary and beautiful at the same time, and make for a truly unique experience in an interesting world inspired by Celtic culture and Norse mythology. I'm left wondering if Senua's world is really a fantasy one with monsters and gods, or if it's all just her perception of it, influenced by her culture and beliefs.

[h3]Visuals:[/h3]
[i]Hellblade[/i] is a very pretty game, with beautifully crafted environments and great atmosphere. A particular aspect I was very impressed by was the sense of temperature; in one instance, Senua was exploring a pleasant grassy area in warm sunlight, only for it to suddenly shift to cold and overcast. The contrast almost made me shiver. 

Senua's character model and animations are excellent. A lot of time is spent looking at her face in cutscenes, and her expressions and facial detail are outstanding, as are the detail and physics on her hair.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2132741343 
Despite being very pretty, there were some aspects of the graphics I didn't like as much. Film grain and motion blur are quite heavy and do not have corresponding settings in the game options. I assume this is due to the effects being part of the artistic vision, and the way the developer intended the game to be experienced.

Regarding the U.I, I took issue with the lack of button prompts; the game does not teach the player the buttons or when to use them. I realise on-screen prompts aren't good for immersion, but I missed an optional lore item in the beginning of the game because I didn't even know that I could interact with it, let alone how to do it. Only upon coming to a ladder and nothing happening did I realise I'd have to work it out myself.

Some of it can be learned by looking at the keybinds in the options menu, but other aspects are more obscure. For example, when Senua is knocked down in combat, players can repeatedly press a button to make her get up and keep fighting before she is killed. I did not know this during my entire playthrough, and only discovered it when doing research for this review.

[h3]Performance:[/h3]
Using the specs listed above, I got a stable 60fps on high settings, though something about the game's graphics often made it feel like it was running rough, as if I were only getting 40fps.

[h3]Audio:[/h3]
[i]Hellblade's[/i] audio design is outstanding. Music is subtle and fits the atmosphere perfectly, voice acting is superb and the binaural audio is incredible with headphones. The voices can whisper right in your ears, creating a chilling and unsettling experience, and adding another level of immersion.

[h3]Issues:[/h3]
I encountered a couple of annoying bugs during my playthrough; the first being the game not saving after I exited on one occasion, leading to me having to do a boss fight twice. The second was mechanics triggering incorrectly in said boss fight, which was fixed by a trip to the main menu and back.

[h2][i]-[u]Summary[/u]-[/i][/h2]
[i]Hellblade[/i] is a unique and beautiful game. The storytelling and audio design are outstanding, and its exploration of the subject matter is fascinating and unsettling. The combat is rough around the edges, but puzzles are unique and enjoyable, and the game's length felt appropriate.

[b]This game is work of art, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in the themes it embodies.[/b]

1245620,ELDEN RING,"Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:
- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.
- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world
- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign
- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.
- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.

There are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:
- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.
- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.
- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.
- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as ""respawn only"" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.
- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...
- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.
- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.

As with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.",medium performance issue 2 28 22 goty game game amazing absolutely dripping content fromsoft make dark soul 4 game dark soul 4 5 6 one absolutely massive game open world part feel like attempt pad game like game picking item open world pickup animation might seem like lot go play something like dragon age inquisition know talking pick item horseback also animation greatly speed looting open world summoning pool make getting summoned boss easier ever general overworld location pool location get summon sign sooooo many bonfire location also fast travel almost anywhere using game map packed stuff rarely walking riding long period running dungeon bos camp npc etc every single side location something discover plus never know going get feeling discovery unlike game lot improvement previous installment well particular order standouts powerstancing back babyyyyy always favorite thing ds2 slottable weapon art taking weapon art system ds3 making even better system also tied weapon affinity system allows switch scaling weapon bonfire committing specific element stat open world make game accessible hit wall one zone go somewhere else come back stronger sekiro little game extremely pronounced statue marika make runbacks boss nearly grueling statue work respawn bonfire choose respawn back usually outside bos fight room lengthy run rest adjust build prevent grueling runback allow smash face bos minimal downtime dedicated jump button keep power jump attack risky usually also used counter low swinging attack also add next system poise breaking enemy done heavy attacking jump attacking guard countering add even move type game make every weapon totally different playstyle add replay value guard counter successfully blocking attack follow special heavy attack high poise damage allows critical hit might think make easier take skill think time riposte always feel good game everyone love soul game disservice missing one never played soul game best one try accessible far crazy hard tutorial boss new ashen summoning bell give great support difficult area fact always leave harder fight come back later make rarely run situation know booting game mean gon na brick walling either bos dy give

1085660,Destiny 2,"The end of an era. I've wrote two reviews for this game, because of how much I enjoyed it.
One during Witch Queen's release, one during Lightfall's release.

Whilst I never recommended the game, it was purely due to the monetisation of the game, and how challenging it was for a new player to get into the game.
I have always praised the gameplay within these reviews, because to me, Destiny 2 is a very enjoyable experience, mechanically speaking.

But now I cannot recommend this game at all, due to the upper management of Bungie killing the dev team and their passion for this game.

Upper management will refuse to listen to what the devs want to implement, whilst forcing more monetisation in. They will refuse to let the devs tone back microtransactions, or focus on what the community wants, because they want to chase a bottom line.

Recently, 100 Bungie employees, 8% of the total company, were laid off because Lightfall didn't meet inflated revenue projections.

Upper management is killing this game, slowly but surely. And until that changes, I cannot recommend this game.
Because until that changes, this game will only get worse, not better.",end era wrote two review game much enjoyed one witch queen release one lightfall release whilst never recommended game purely due monetisation game challenging new player get game always praised gameplay within review destiny 2 enjoyable experience mechanically speaking recommend game due upper management bungie killing dev team passion game upper management refuse listen devs want implement whilst forcing monetisation refuse let devs tone back microtransactions focus community want want chase bottom line recently 100 bungie employee 8 total company laid lightfall meet inflated revenue projection upper management killing game slowly surely change recommend game change game get worse better

The game does a lot of things very well. The writing and characters are excellent. The world is moody and dark and grotesque at times. There's a lot of side content, and I enjoyed travelling around the expanse system by system. Exploiting and colonising like a space age Brit. I thought the combat was great fun. Everything has a low time to kill so combat has a good tempo to it, though later on some fights can drag on a bit. 

The game does have a few things working against it. It's an Owlcat game so yeah, there are bugs and stability issues.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I played the game for 445 hours. I had fun playing the game. I purchased multiple founders packs, even purchased the vanquishers pack because I was enjoying the game. One day I went to log in and found I was banned and the only information I had was a ""Code of Conduct"" violation. I submitted an appeal and after 4 days heard nothing back. I submitted another appeal and was informed that my account was commerce locked for refunding a founders pack and that the ban would not be lifted. I checked my purchase history to confirm because I didn't remember refunding a founders pack and I have no refunds for Lost Ark. I appeal again and am told the matter is closed and no further responses from AGS CS are warranted. I look at the forums and find that people are being banned because they purchased skins on the in-game auction house from people that later refunded their founders packs. I was banned because someone else refunded an item after they sold it on the auction house because the skin I purchased and equipped is linked to an account that was banned. AGS is the worst gaming company I have ever worked with. They were horrible at managing New World and now they are completely botching Lost Ark. I will not recommend ANY game that AGS is involved in.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"Still being worked on for sure, multiplayer update caused a lot of game breaking issues for a while, but they seem to have a handle on it.  I'm enjoying it at times, but then i'm reluctant to recommend until they've completed all large updates based on how the last few have gone.  Seems to be a pretty small team, so when major issues pop up, seems to take a while to fix.  They do seem to be working hard though, this isn't an updates once a quarter game, they seem to be getting them out pretty fast at times.  

Game play is good for the most part, the city management crossed with a survival game style can be very rewarding when enough time is invested.  Again though, updates can cause a lot of problems here.  The devs tend to tweak the required resources and time required to build items quite a bit, as well as selling prices.  This can lead to a lot of extra tweaking on your end every time you open the game.  Again, hopefully when completed it will be fine.  

Hunting needs to be improved in my opinion, as it sits now, animals have a bit too much health and take way too many attacks to kill without a head shot.  There is an option to adjust this however, but again... that was broken for about 2 month after the multiplayer update.  

The new 2nd map seems to be a little more interesting than the original map.  Towns have a lot more detail and feel more alive.  Potential town building locations seems better as well.  Would like to see the same care applied to the original map in some sort of revamped version.

All in all, it has tons of potential, a ton of bugs, and tons of potential upcoming issues : )  

Just wait for them to complete the game.  They've got enough beta testers like me.

- Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split
- All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players
- The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets -  for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again

2344520,Diablo® IV,"What’s really unpleasant with the sunk-cost fallacy is when you know you’re engaging in it but is too stupid and stubborn to stop. Anyway, Diablo IV is the most miserable time I’ve had with any action RPG in my life and I’ve still wasted 55 hours on it. I really should’ve refunded it in the first hour, but… I mean, it’s “Diablo” and I have positive things to say even about the third game, as it can be very enjoyable if shallow. But this… oh boy, this was horrible.

Who doesn’t know what Diablo is? Blizzard, apparently, but as far as the players go, you usually know what to expect. Action RPG with top down view, dark fantasy setting, lots of enemies to kill, experience to get, loot to grab. After the simple but strong beginning with the first game, that is still my personal favorite, Diablo II established lots of canonical elements that are still used with little change across numerous games of numerous genres. While the often criticized (mostly for good reasons) third game made each playable class feel truly unique, something that is mostly continued with this newest game.

The different builds within each class can also be very different. Although, arguably, the choice is more limited than with the previous game. This has been done, seemingly, in the attempt to answer the criticism of the skill system of Diablo III, where you just unlocked new abilities and could switch them on the fly, thus removing any choice and commitment to how you build your characters. But in reality, the change is mostly in terms of presentation – while you have to commit to a build, you can also refund anything at any point (it just costs gold to do so). Nonetheless, the basic premise of the skills and how they fit into 6 specific slots remains exactly the same – I think it’s perfectly fine, but there might be people who prefer the classic freeform approach instead.

Some of the ideas from Diablo II that were either absent or limited in the previous game return as well, although often in a changed form. Time of day is yet again dynamic, something that was limited to post-campaign in the third game. Instead of the run and stamina from II we get a dodge move that works on a cooldown and in the later part of the campaign you unlock horses you can ride. The overall presentation is yet again more subdued and dark fantasy, after the extremely exciting and explosive epic adventuring of the third game. The music is made to be reminiscent of the classic soundtracks by Matt Uelmen and sound pretty good at times. The potions are yet again limited, but restock in towns or from the enemy drops and work as an ability, not an item. They actually feel closer to one of the variations that were attempted with Diablo III, before it was switched to just one infinite ability on a cooldown. And, frankly, I feel that this change back to a limited number is mostly pointless in practice.

Some things have been changed or removed. The hirelings/followers mechanic is now completely gone. You don’t lose experience or money upon death – instead the item durability serves as the “punishment” and items only ever lose durability to deaths now. Enchanting and crafting has been reworked a lot and an item upgrade mechanic has been introduced. All of the combo mechanics from the previous game are gone while the Paragon system has been reworked into something that is vaguely reminiscent of the License Board from Final Fantasy XII.

But the biggest and most destructive change to everything is in the way the world now works. Every Diablo game until now had completely random locations with specific key rooms or areas that these random roads connected to in-between. And the pace of a Diablo game has always been to move forward. You mowed down enemies, completed quests, explored all on the way to your next goal. Never backtracking, never getting lost even in the most confusing and open levels of Act III in Diablo II. It was a focused experience. Diablo IV is not. It’s structured like an open world game or an MMORPG. And it’s designed without any understanding of what makes a good open world game or a good Diablo game.

The world is huge, not random and full of constant and most tedious backtracking imaginable. But at the same time, enemies and events respawn almost immediately after you go far away from them. Dungeons? Random, extremely long, tedious, full of instantly recognizable boring randomized patterns and tasks that are always exactly same. There are over a hundred dungeons in the game and about a dozen possible task variations they require and, I think, less than 10 possible boss fights in them. Oh and if you complete a dungeon, then find a quest that sends you to this dungeon, the dungeon is reset again.

I’ve never ever played a Diablo game where I wasn’t killing everything in my way. Up until this one. In this one I was running away from enemies 80% of my time with it. Not because there was any difficulty with fighting them, but because it was boring. I couldn’t imagine in the 90s that I would ever play a Diablo game and upon finding a new group of enemies, my reaction would be “ugh”. But that’s what Diablo IV is. There’s no permanence or meaningfulness to anything you do in the world for you to want to engage with anything in this open world. There’s no reason to explore dungeons that you find, because they’re boring and you might need to do this boring thing again later if a quest requires it, so there’s no joy in discovery. Map opens in giant chunks to prevent any clear understanding of where you were and where you weren’t to find hidden collectibles. And all at the same time, the main Diablo gameplay loop feels tedious when there’s no clear line, when enemies are not in your way because there is no way, just open spaces to get bored in.

And it’s not like we don’t have good action RPGs with a similar structure, as even going back to the Diablo II days there was Divine Divinity or Sacred that had an open world structure and Diablo-like gameplay. But they knew better to use Ultima as example for the world and Diablo for the fun mechanics. While Diablo IV uses tedious grind of a generic MMO as an example for all that it brings.

And yes it is, yet again, always online. And it’s inexcusable and pointless as it was with Diablo III. Except now you can’t even have a private playthrough as the other players are always present in some way in “your” world and this whole MMO-like aspect is baked into the basics of the game. And it sucks.

To give the game some credit – even though the story isn’t particularly good, it is trying and sometimes it even has great moments and main story quests. The focus on the orthodox church teachings in contrast to the catholic church from the previous games isn’t as interesting as the developers seem to think, but I suppose for players from certain parts of the world it would at least feel novel. And it does look nice – this visual style is far closer to how one would’ve expected the first two Diablo games to be if they were fully 3D than what Diablo III attempted.

But it’s just so so horribly boring. And every single design decision that it has seems to be based on the desire to make things slow, to make things grindy. And no update or expansion or anything can fix what is, at its core, and extremely unfun game. I despise this game and cannot in good faith recommend anyone to play it. Play anything else instead, including Diablo III – at least it tried to be exciting and not miserable by design.",really unpleasant sunk cost fallacy know engaging stupid stubborn stop anyway diablo iv miserable time action rpg life still wasted 55 hour really refunded first hour mean diablo positive thing say even third game enjoyable shallow oh boy horrible know diablo blizzard apparently far player go usually know expect action rpg top view dark fantasy setting lot enemy kill experience get loot grab simple strong beginning first game still personal favorite diablo ii established lot canonical element still used little change across numerous game numerous genre often criticized mostly good reason third game made playable class feel truly unique something mostly continued newest game different build within class also different although arguably choice limited previous game done seemingly attempt answer criticism skill system diablo iii unlocked new ability could switch fly thus removing choice commitment build character reality change mostly term presentation commit build also refund anything point cost gold nonetheless basic premise skill fit 6 specific slot remains exactly think perfectly fine might people prefer classic freeform approach instead idea diablo ii either absent limited previous game return well although often changed form time day yet dynamic something limited post campaign third game instead run stamen ii get dodge move work cooldown later part campaign unlock horse ride overall presentation yet subdued dark fantasy extremely exciting explosive epic adventuring third game music made reminiscent classic soundtrack matt uelmen sound pretty good time potion yet limited restock town enemy drop work ability item actually feel closer one variation attempted diablo iii switched one infinite ability cooldown frankly feel change back limited number mostly pointless practice thing changed removed hireling follower mechanic completely gone lose experience money upon death instead item durability serf punishment item ever lose durability death enchanting crafting reworked lot item upgrade mechanic introduced combo mechanic previous game gone paragon system reworked something vaguely reminiscent license board final fantasy xii biggest destructive change everything way world work every diablo game completely random location specific key room area random road connected pace diablo game always move forward mowed enemy completed quest explored way next goal never backtracking never getting lost even confusing open level act iii diablo ii focused experience diablo iv structured like open world game mmorpg designed without understanding make good open world game good diablo game world huge random full constant tedious backtracking imaginable time enemy event respawn almost immediately go far away dungeon random extremely long tedious full instantly recognizable boring randomized pattern task always exactly hundred dungeon game dozen possible task variation require think le 10 possible bos fight oh complete dungeon find quest sends dungeon dungeon reset never ever played diablo game killing everything way one one running away enemy 80 time difficulty fighting boring imagine 90 would ever play diablo game upon finding new group enemy reaction would ugh diablo iv permanence meaningfulness anything world want engage anything open world reason explore dungeon find boring might need boring thing later quest requires joy discovery map open giant chunk prevent clear understanding find hidden collectible time main diablo gameplay loop feel tedious clear line enemy way way open space get bored like good action rpgs similar structure even going back diablo ii day divine divinity sacred open world structure diablo like gameplay knew better use ultima example world diablo fun mechanic diablo iv us tedious grind generic mmo example brings yes yet always online inexcusable pointless diablo iii except even private playthrough player always present way world whole mmo like aspect baked basic game suck give game credit even though story particularly good trying sometimes even great moment main story quest focus orthodox church teaching contrast catholic church previous game interesting developer seem think suppose player certain part world would least feel novel look nice visual style far closer one would expected first two diablo game fully 3d diablo iii attempted horribly boring every single design decision seems based desire make thing slow make thing grindy update expansion anything fix core extremely unfun game despise game good faith recommend anyone play play anything else instead including diablo iii least tried exciting miserable design

281990,Stellaris,"After sinking in almost 500 hours into the game across multiple playthroughs, I have finally decided to post my honest review of Stellaris in time for the tail end of the Winter Sale, to give some insight into any potential buyers if they want to spend the cash. In a brief sentence (for those who aren't keen on sifting through the rest of this review), Stellaris is a game you would like to pick up if you're a fan of 4X games AND have some patience for the game to develop. As it sits now, the game lacks a few key features that would greatly benefit basic functionality and also fixing and improving other parts of the game.

Stellaris plays a lot less than traditional Paradox games like Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron, and Europe Universalis. In the aforementioned games, the player takes control of a pre-determined country and plays in a historical fashion and progression of events. Stellaris, on the other hand, is a randomly-generated galaxy with random placements of not only the player's empire (anywhere from near the galactic core to the fringes of the galaxy), but of the AI-controlled empires. In addition, the placement can be manipulated through a few in-game options, like clustering empires together or randomly dispersing them, and also determining how many ""advanced start"" AI-controlled empires will be present in the game, including ""Fallen Empires"", which act as a major galactic obstacle and a potential mid-late game target to take down.

The random nature of the game sometimes goes too far, in my opinion. Research is based on a pseudo-random card selection, where some researches are weighted to be produced during the card shuffle more than others. The chance is also weighted depending on what research leaders you have assigned to the respective laboratory: for example, a New Worlds researcher has a higher chance of drawing a New Worlds research every shuffle. While generally fair in it's card dealings, the random nature of research can lead to long periods of irrelevant researches. For example, my very first game, I never got the research card to increase ship energy production, leading to my military being severely stunted throughout the game.

On military, there are two components of military combat: naval and army. Army is, for the most part, straightforward: produce either an immobile defence army on a planet or an offensive army capable of boarding landing craft and invading hostile worlds. Naval combat is a lot more diverse, and features a ""ship designer"", wherein the player and AI can handcraft their flavor of ships to their needs, including using kinetic ballistic weapons, laser weapons, plasma weapons, long-range missiles, torpedoes, point-defence guns, attack aircraft, and spinal-mounted mega weapons, which all have strengths and weaknesses relative to each other. It also allows equipping shields, armor, and auxilary components like afterburners.

Since the empire you play as is not based in history, it also allows you to completely edit or create a new brand of empire, including how cities look, ships look, and even how your people look, with the ability to customize the phenotype of your people (ranging from humans to space foxes to space elves, and even fungoid creatures that have infected other spaceborne empires),  how your people behave from an ethical standpoint, which influences how the game can be played, who can be allied with, and what researches can be acquired (the 6 dichotomies being Individualistic, Collectivist, Materialist, Spiritualist, Xenophilic, and Xenophobic, each with their own playstyle), and how your species evolved (which includes a whole slew of evolutionary traits; the default Human start paints human evolutionary traits as Nomadic and Quick Learners, with a Continental habitat preference).

This wraps up the main points of Stellaris without going in too far. While I have enjoyed my time in Stellaris, it definitely is not for everyone, especially with such a healthy selling price.

1336490,Against the Storm,"A fun and interesting take on the colony-builder genre!

You only have access to a subset of the buildings each game, which you draft during the game, so the strategy and difficulty are around making the best of the limited tech tree and resources you've got. It's quite hard at first because you need to learn all the resources and systems, but once you're familiar with them the game really shines. There are so many interesting variations and challenges to overcome all in a ~2 hour per game timebox. It took me maybe 2-3 hours to get comfortable enough with the game and systems to start seeing this side of it.

I tend to have two problems with similar games that Against the Storm cleverly addresses. First, I tend to restart my town pathologically as I learn more about the game mechanics. With Against the Storm this is *baked in* to the gameplay loop as you're pretty much always starting a new town each time you play (this also fixes the ""I can't ever load my savegame because I've lost too much mental state"" problem!) The second is that once I learn what the whole tech tree is, the game stops being interesting. Against the Storm solves this with the limited building selection and drafting mechanics, as well as various challenges and events to shake up the gameplay. In Against the Storm, once you learn the mechanics, that's when you really get to *start* playing, it's actually fantastic.

Against the Storm is strictly solo and there's nothing like a ""battle"" mechanic. The environment resists you with effects and there are challenges to overcome (typically of the ""deliver X resource here and devote Y manpower for Z time otherwise $CONSEQUENCE), but you won't find any units with weapons, armor or combat in this game. I think it's a very strong game without anything like unit micro or combat, but just pointing it out for anyone looking at screenshots wondering where the archer units are.

Very strongly recommended after 40 hours or so of play - everyone at Eremite Games should be really proud of this gem they've built, thank you all!",fun interesting take colony builder genre access subset building game draft game strategy difficulty around making best limited tech tree resource got quite hard first need learn resource system familiar game really shine many interesting variation challenge overcome 2 hour per game timebox took maybe 2 3 hour get comfortable enough game system start seeing side tend two problem similar game storm cleverly address first tend restart town pathologically learn game mechanic storm baked gameplay loop pretty much always starting new town time play also fix ever load savegame lost much mental state problem second learn whole tech tree game stop interesting storm solves limited building selection drafting mechanic well various challenge event shake gameplay storm learn mechanic really get start playing actually fantastic storm strictly solo nothing like battle mechanic environment resists effect challenge overcome typically deliver x resource devote manpower z time otherwise consequence find unit weapon armor combat game think strong game without anything like unit micro combat pointing anyone looking screenshots wondering archer unit strongly recommended 40 hour play everyone eremite game really proud gem built thank
1313140,Cult of the Lamb,"[h1] Hands down the best indie game of 2022 [/h1]

[hr][/hr]

Shortly speaking: it is amazing. And since there is an 8000-character restriction for steam reviews, I’ll better get down to business and tell you why:

[hr][/hr]

[h3] The cool stuff [/h3]

[list]
[*][b] Amazing multigenre gameplay: [/b] The reason why I LOVE indie games - they are risky, innovative and have their unique ideas over the commercial attractiveness. Noone expected rouge-like and sandbox to be mixed in one cauldron and it is just beautiful! The presence of 2 different gameplay loops, which require you to use different parts of your brain in a causal base-building routine and fast-paced dungeon runs is key to the creation of a truly enjoyable and addictive (in a good way!) ingame experience. To sum up: it is Don’t Starve X Hades with a dark religious narrative from Blasphemous standing in the background.

[*][b] Visuals and music: [/b] I said this already a billion times and I will say even more: I adore 2D hand-drawn visuals in games, and this one looks totally astonishing! In general, it looks pretty much like the abovementioned Don’t Starve, but much brighter and juicer: backgrounds of some locations like Anura and Anchordeep sometimes really made me stop during my dungeon run just to enjoy the art a bit. The soundtrack is pretty cool as well: in my opinion, it’s what we could have got if Sidewalks and Skeletons (RUINER OST) attempted in making lo-fi, “Start a Cult” is my favourite one, ideal for spending your time at the base, thinking of some designs.

[*][b] Attention to details: [/b] The game is filled with tiny details, which are the best proof that it is made with love. Starting from a knucklebones and fishing minigame, ending with boss trophies, secret follower skins, easter eggs and the ability to make time run faster.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2956990358

[*][b] Customisation options: [/b] There are a loooot of them, as for base, as for your fella cult members. I personally spent a good 6-7 hours of gameplay just to decorate my base properly, and what to say, I am pretty happy with the result - the game gives you enough options to turn your hub into an absolute eye candy!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2956989849

[*][b] Intense gameplay: [/b] It took me 30 hours to complete this game 100% and unlock all achievements, counting the fact that I played without a hurry, at a pretty relaxed tempo and spent a good amount of time on decorating. But if you are seeking a more rapid experience, you will easily complete it in a half shorter period of time, also still being able to enjoy most of the content that the game affords.

[*][b] You can move already constructed buildings: [/b] Thank god I do not need to destroy all of these if I decided to refresh the look of my base a bit.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2956989972

 [*][b] You can BAAAAA! by pressing b: [/b] No ƒucking joke, if you are still not concerned about buying this one - I guess it is just a time!
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h3] The not-so-cool stuff [/h3]

[list]
[*][b] Target group issue: [/b] I have a strong feeling that developers were aware of it, but I still want to talk about this topic. As I already said, the game is multigenre, so it dips its toes into 2 separate gamer communities: gigachad sandbox appreciators and gigachad rouge-like enjoyers. Some people, like me, can call themselves a part of both these communities, and some… do not. And here is where the problem starts. One of my friends, who mostly enjoys rouge-likes and strategy games, denied playing this one because it feels a lot like a “kindergarten simulator” - your cultists are feeling dumb and helpless creatures: a lot of players who came here for action would be not happy with perspectives to clean shi⸸ of some pretty dumb NPC’s who are lacking any individuality and ability to stand for themselves. On the other hand, thanks to Google, I am aware that a reasonable amount of players are trying to complete this game without sacrifices since they are sentimentally attached to their cultists. It might be some “animal crossing” dudes and dudettes, who came there to hang out in the company of the cure creatures and slaying them in the name of Satan just not feels right for them. And… This is actually even sadder, since the game heavily forces you into being a cold-hearted dark overlord, thinking of its flock just as another kind of resource, because if you will not sacrifice them now, they anyway will die later… Devs tried to fix that by introducing us to some opposite branches of rituals and doctrines, like for those who are about to care about their cultists and for pragmatic violent a$$es like me, but… The problem persists.  And the only thing we can do is acknowledge it.

[*][b] Lobster bug: [/b] Long story short: there is a bug where one kind of rare fish just not spawns in your save, and guess who is the lucky ƒucker in there. I became suspicious right after I got an achievement for catching all types of fish without catching a lobster, but I decided that the game maybe just not consider it as a fish and continued my attempts. After 100 ingame days of struggling with a rod, I decided to ask the Internet for help and found everything on this bug. The most beautiful is that this bug can easily be bypassed by using an Ocean’s Bounty ritual and guess what? I did not choose it, having that useless harvest-growing one instead! God save Pentalex and his save file decryptor, so I was able to fix the problem just by messing with my save file a bit by changing rituals, but… Well, ƒuck, if you are a completionist and you are running into such kind of problem it is definitely NOT fun.

[*][b] Can’t change doctrines: [/b] I have no idea why there is no such an option in this game, especially since most of the players have all doctrines unlocked somewhere in the middle of the playthrough. The ability to reset or edit some doctrine branches could have made gameplay more diverse, made stone plates useful up to the late game and also gave me a valid option to bypass that ƒucking lobster bug without editing my save file manually!

[*][b] Can’t remove graves and bodies: [/b] For some reason, graves are unremovable structures and built once, they will persist on your base forever. Moreover, if you misclick and accidentally prepare a dead body for burial instead of butchering it for meat you will have no undone options for that - the game will force you to bury it, building a grave that you never wanted and would not be able to remove further.

[*][b] Can’t re-fight final boss: [/b] Fun stuff, in Metroidvanias like Hollow Knight or Blasphemous, the only boss you can re-fight in your save (without boss-rush DLCs) is the final one. Here the situation is completely opposite and it disappointed me a bit - I already have prepared myself morally to have a good ol’ hitless run vs The One Who Waits.

[*][b] Mushroom cultists: [/b] Since I am a person with a biological education, specialised narrowly in the conservation of rare fungi, I guess that this one is only my personal obsession (I am also a fun-guy of a sort, hehehe…) But god, look at those Mushroomos, these little mumbling bastards are such cuties! It is a shame that there is no Mushroomo cultist skin or at least an enamel pin at the Devolver merch shop.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2956989682

[hr][/hr]

To conclude, it is a great game which is worth its money even without a discount. And despite I wrote pretty much text in a “Not-so-cool stuff” block there, do not be distracted by it - most of that is just healthy criticism or my dreams of unadded features. So, if you consider yourself a fan of sandboxes, roguelikes, or some unique indie projects as a whole - jump in, you won't regret it!

[hr][/hr]

[b] I give this game 9/10

Thank you kindly for reading this one to the bottom!

Halo Infinite is The Girl that Ghosted You:

You hit it off great at first, almost perfect.
She promises you a great time and a major commitment.
Immediately, you notice some red flags.
But she promises to work on them.
Issues continue to mount fast, and you're wondering if this is really worth your time.
She reassures you she is working on it and promises to be better.
After months of waiting, you hardly see each other anymore.
Things are stale and all those promises become a shell of what they were.
She comes up with an idea to take you out to eat at a fancy restaurant.
But she ends up taking you to Mickey Moaburgers instead........and makes you pay.
You keep telling yourself things will get better, but you know they wont.
She wont keep up on her end of the bargain.
It's time to let her go Chief.",halo reach released 9 14 2010 3 year gap halo 3 launched campaign campaign co op splitscreen multiplayer w 14 map 5 forged 23 gametypes firefight w 8 map 3 gametypes special gamemode invasion forge custom game fileshare theater post launch support nobel map pack 3 new map 2 month launch defiant map pack 3 new map 6 month launch anniversary map pack 7 remade map 1 year 2 month launch halo infinite released 11 15 2021 6 year gap halo 5 launched campaign campaign co op splitscreen multiplayer w 10 map 4 gametypes firefight special gamemode forge custom game broken fileshare theater broken post launch support lone wolf 2 new map 2 new gamemodes 1 returning gamemode king hill 7 month launch edited halo infinite girl ghosted hit great first almost perfect promise great time major commitment immediately notice red flag promise work issue continue mount fast wondering really worth time reassures working promise better month waiting hardly see anymore thing stale promise become shell come idea take eat fancy restaurant end taking mickey moaburgers instead make pay keep telling thing get better know wont wont keep end bargain time let go chief

1190000,Car Mechanic Simulator 2021,"This was a hard review to make, I didn't want to hurry into conclusions but with over 25hs in-game I think its about time.

Thing I didn't like:
* It has the exact same issues that all previous variations had, from the annoying part swapping (where the condition of a part even if the part was extracted from the same car is slower than the required is marked as incomplete) to the ridiculous auctions where its (close to) impossible to get a good deal.
* The scrapping mechanic (which I think is new) is absolutely broken in a bad way. Each part you scrap gives at least 1 scrap and up to 3 scrap if you hit the correct marker. If you want to max a vehicle out with 3 star parts you have to upgrade each part (individually) 3 times. For the sake of argument I tested this out and I ended up needing 25000 scrap, yeap... 25000. This means you would need to scrap PERFECTLY 8300 part before you can completely max out a vehicle in terms of quality of parts.
* PlayWay added some sort of crates that are given to the player for free, each crate gives 5 cards and the player gets to choose 2 of them. This mechanic is simply bad... just give me a random drop every time I finish a job or something, opening annoying crates with bad animations is terrible.
* If you are planning to drive a fast car of the speed track to test how fast it actually goes, well... good luck... Without a joystick, whenever you try to accelerate the car will go on max power and will start slipping everywhere which makes virtually any fast car ""un-drivable""
* The car pool seems quite smaller than CMS2018, maybe I got unlucky so take this point with a grain of salt. Hopefully this is not a tactic to sell stuff on DLCs in the future and holding back just to do so.
* WHO thought it was a good idea to remove the examine parts and instead replace it with the grouping examination? The old part examination mechanic was simplified into groups of part (engine, suspension, etc) which makes the process a lot more forgiving and easy to do, but in term we lost the possibility of examining easy and visible parts like the suspension caps. Maybe a key to change between grouped and single mode would be a nice to have.
* Interior customisation is still missing so don't even worry about that one
* The parking was removed (or I didn't find a way to physically go there), I really liked that feature to take screenshots :(

What I liked:
* The shop was simplified with a shopping list and part lookup, its far from perfect but its a great addition
* New mini-games makes grinding more bearable
* All feature related DLCs from previous versions seem to be there (tuning, garage customisation, etc)
* Most cars look stunning!
* The story quests have some interesting back story that can be really cool. Relating the job to the story told by the owners it fun!

========================================

Suggestions to fix the above:
* I read some people can get annoyed with the minigames but I love them, maybe make them optional, by playing them you can get extra XP or better part condition
* The part swapping should be an easy fix, if the part originates from the same car it wasn't asked to be replaced then I should be allowed to put it back in anywhere.
* The scrapping requirements needs to be tuned down, A LOT.
* Regarding the crates I'm not sure what to say, I don't like anything that looks like gambling, its just a personal thing but I know some others will probably think alike.
* If you are playing with keyboard, the game should be able to calculate how fast it can press the throttle so the car doesn't slip and goes everywhere (some users aren't lucky enough to have joysticks)
* Car pool can be improved, Im sure workshop will make sure this is balanced anyways, but I really liked some cars from the DLCs in 2018.
* Bring back the old examination tool PLEASE, or at least some way to test all parts of the car without having to remove them completely.
* Interior customisation <3 a man can only dream...
* Parking FTW! :D

1144200,Ready or Not,"Before I started playing this game, there was quite the divide between my wife and I. She wasn't a big fan of video games, but I spend a decent amount of time playing them. I always tried to get her to play with me, but she always refused. She'd say, ""It's just not fun for me. I'm not good.""

But then I downloaded ""Ready or Not,"" and everything immediately changed.

The gameplay is smooth, and the graphics are much better than I expected. The gun mechanics are the most realistic I've ever seen in a game. There is a surprising variety in types of enemies and civilians. It's always a rush when you have to make a split second decision on whether you're about to shoot a person in defense, or take an innocent civilian's life. It has been a long time since I enjoyed a game this much.

The grind in the game was hard but when you got them levels you earned them and it was amazing hearing the stories of guys like Tiger making top Teir and Wizet really loved it's community. Normally in the old maple story you would see admins walking around talking to members as they passed by and it was exciting to see the community with their passion for the game making content like Dray86's Maple Kombat. 

Then came Nexon who montized the hell out of the game, took the world that everyone loved and threw it all over the place then they made these hero classes that made the orignal classes completely useless of which had the most insanely high damage you've ever seen. Many of the cool dungeons in maple story became empty which is really sad because they was excellent. 

Sadly maple story degressed into this sub par kind of game. I want Wizet back, I want my maple story. 

Do I recommend it to you? No, Nexon is a greedy company but you won't really noticed how screwed up the game is unless you was there from the start. You won't notice all the cool stuff taken out because they'll try to blind you with high numbers and stupid classes to ego stroke your dick.

If you want to win in this game you must work together, this means running with your squad, listening to your Squad Leader and communicating often, lone wolfs generally have a lower overall score than someone who plays with his squad, kills do not count for many points but are satisfying nonetheless, especially the *tink* sound of headshots.

Before you start your HLL experience make sure you have a functioning microphone, communication wins games and you don't want to be having to stop every 10 seconds to type something.

Building ""garrisons"" in this game is super important, they are the static point at which your entire team can spawn at, they require a Squad Leader and a support player to build, the support drops ""supplies"" and the SL builds the ""garri"".
Each Squad Leader can also build an 'Outpost or OP', this is a mini garrison that only your squad can deploy on.
Enemy garrisons can be destroyed by blowing them up with  bazooka/panzerschrek/tank rounds or just dismantling them manually. Removing an enemy garrison is very important because they can only be built every 200m and thus giving your team greater map control.

You can either play as Infantry, Armour, Recon or Commander.

Infantry is the main source of aggression and defence in the game, they push the objectives, protect your tanks and cap points while also defending positions while other squads attack the point. You are awarded points when you are in enemy and friendly territory so staying back and defending captured positions nets you just as much points as attacking while also allowing you to have the defenders advantage of the enemy pushing right infront of your gun.

My personal favourite is Armor, you play as a 3 man squad (Driver, Gunner and Spotter) it is your task to eliminate enemy tanks and support the infantry, it is adrenaline filled fun and hugely exciting.
 
The driver role is much more than just ""driving"" you need to listen to your spotter who will be telling you where to position the vehicle and you also have a hull MG for infantry suppression, it is your responsibility to keep your frontal armor facing the enemy. 

The gunner is more self evident; you shoot things, but it also takes skill and patience to place a shot from 700m+ and hit the right spot to do the most damage, especially if you are outgunned by a heavier tank.

Lastly the spotter, this position is very important, you have a periscope which enables you to see the enemy from long ranges, this means you may be telling your gunner to shoot somewhere so far away he/she cannot see the target and are relying on you to use the marking system (called pinging) to see targets. The driver also relies on you to help find a path through the countryside because he only has a small window slit to see through, so again, communication is key. 
You are in overall charge of the tank and it is recommended you play the ""Tank Commander"" role from the Spotter position so you can mark targets swiftly and communicate with other leaders effectively. 

Tanks on the German side are the Puma Armored Car(50mm), Luchs light tank, (armed with 20mm autocannon) Panther medium tank (very mobile but hard hitting medium tank with a 75mm gun) and the Heavy Tiger tank (slow and methodical beast with it's massive 88mm gun)

Tanks on the Allied/Soviet Side are the Greyhound armored car (37mm gun), Stuart Light tank (37mm) the 75mm and 76mm Sherman Jumbo's, BA-10 recon car, T-34/76 and IS-1 Heavy tank. 

The recon role is a two man team consisting of a Spotter (binoculars) and a sniper who has either a 4x scope (Americans, Soviet) or a 8x scope (Germans). While there is a massive difference in zoom between the two scopes, the smaller zoom on the American/Soviet rifle allows for quicker and more aggressive up close play (100m-250m) while the german scope is cumbersome therefore encourages you to finding a nice position and picking the enemy off from 250m-500m. Recon is responsible for either helping your team push by taking out high value targets such as MG's, officers or other Recon Squads but can also slip behind the lines and destroy enemy garrisons and resource nodes (more on those later). 
Unlike regular Squads which can only place their OP two ""red squares"" back, recon can place theirs anywhere which enables deep flanks and stealth missions. 



The Squad Leader role.
Playing the SL role is rewarding but does come with a lot of responsibility, your 6 man squad is relying on you to make informed and quick decisions on a tactical level, i.e. Do you move to the exposed flank and hold it from a vantage point such as a farmhouse and prevent the enemy from streaming through, or do you be more aggressive and try to flank yourself while having to worry about your comrades being hit from that exposed flank? 
At first it can be a bit overwhelming (you have Command chat and squad chat in your ears). I would suggest you try the other roles (especially the Support role) before you attempt to play as an SL. The key to this role is communication, patience and also making snap decisions as well as taking advice from other squad members. Your main role is to push the points with your squad, flank the enemy, mark enemy movement on the map, build garrisons to support the push and communicate with other SL's and the Commander constantly, all while under fire and trying to figure out where the enemy are.


The Commander role.
The Commander is responsible for major Strategic decisions and influencing the flow of battle. The role can be played in a few different ways, some prefer to get down and dirty building defensive or offensive garrisons and being closer to the front line, whereas others prefer to sit further back and direct traffic from their map (more like an RTS game) and micromanage.

For the Commander to be effective he/she needs resources, and the only way to acquire them is for SL's to have 2 members of their squad (support for the supplies, and an engineer to build) build "" nodes"", these consist of munitions, manpower and fuel.
Munitions are used for artillery and anti-tank gun shells as well as enabling the Commander to drop ""supplies"" on a chosen position (as well as other abilities). SL's and their Squads can use these supplies to build nodes, garrisons or just to fortify a chosen area (engineers can build bunkers etc with supplies, anti-tank can build AT-guns). Manpower enables the Commander to use specific offensive/defensive abilities while fuel allows the Commander to spawn in tanks, and recon vehicles.

Naturally, if the Commander has no resources because players have not built nodes they cannot do these things, and as anyone who has played an RTS knows, No resources= no win.
It is highly advisable that you DO NOT play Commander until you are very comfortable playing the SL role, because it is much more nuanced and does require you to be a stingy bugger, you need to make hard decisions and prepare to take the blame if it back fires in your face. 
You need to delegate tactical responsibility to the SL's via the command channel, and focus on the greater strategical picture. My advice is to be firm but not a tyrant, every SL will be telling you ""we need supplies here"" or ""we need a bombing run here"", it is up to you to decide whether they actually need those things or if they could be better put to good use and send them another squad to help out instead.

You can also earn XP (and support your team) by driving supply trucks to and from the front line laden with supplies for the engineers.

This turned out to be a mammoth review and I hope it helps anyone who was sitting on the fence about buying the game, it is 100% worth it and the community (Australian at least) is very welcoming and helpful.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"Enjoyable but flawed. This game fell short of being something incredible.
I don't believe I'm one of many with this perception of Hogwarts Legacy but it may prove interesting to some nonetheless.
Long review below:

The Good:
+ It's a nice visual game, some parts of it look ""magical"" indeed.
+ The gameplay works and functions well from start to finish.
+ The story has a few interesting moments but nothing that will blow you away. There won't be anything you won't see coming.
+ The spells feel great, combat was one of my favourites aspects of the game. The devs did their job right on this front.
+ A magical adventure for Harry Potter fans, it IS the best of all Harry Potter games, really immersive in some parts, fun in others and an overall good game. All in all, your money won't be wasted here. There's plenty of content to go around for everyone.
+ Soundtrack and sound in general is authentic to what the Wizarding world should be.

The Bad:
It's a shame that many RPGs  that are open world learned nothing from Skyrim, Witcher and Red Dead Redemption.

- Everything is so scripted to the point of comedy. As a result of that, it won't take more than several hours to realise how bland and empty Hogwarts is.
The best way to describe this is by comparing it to the tv series: Westworld (for those who have seen it). You feel like you're really trying to role play in a fake world.
The same animations will play in the castle over and over, the same NPCs with the same lines.
You get to experience all yearly seasons but besides some changes in the castle and around it, the NPCs react to nothing. Their garbs won't change according to the weather.

- Immersion breaking.
When you go outside of the castle in summer, you'll spot two students playing a game. That's a very nice moment to see the NPCs have activities around the castle. However, you'll reach winter and the same students are playing the same game, in their same outfits outside in the courtyard even at night time at 0 degrees C temperature. The same orchestra music that you first hear when you go across the hall will be playing throughout all seasons, through all day/night cycles. It goes from a wondrous, special moment to a tedious, run faster so it'll bother you less.
For an RPG, one of its priorities should be to establish or at least try to make something remotely natural for the NPCs to do. There's many more such situations but I won't go further into that.

- Progression is tied to the main story.  You cannot interact with your dorm colleagues or anyone around the castle unless it's a quest or a silly side quest. The house you pick doesn't matter. You'll only get 1 quest per house and it'll vary the looks of your outfit. I chose Ravenclaw but was shown around by a Weasly. I was expecting to have someone from my own dorm to be my friend/guide to lead me through the castle. 

- Your choices in the game have no consequence. Cast avada kadavra wherever you want because nobody cares. It's hilarious at times.

- I understand that the developers are trying so hard to be ""progressive"" but in their pursuit of fulfilling an agenda they made the setting of 1800s Scotland feel like 2023 woke Hollywood. You'll hear the name of ""Sirona"" and how special she is more times than you'll enter her tavern.

- Enemies around the world: 
You'd expect the ""Forbidden forest"" and ""any other place in the world"" to be somewhat different from each other since it's an RPG.
The enemies around the castle would be of a lower level while the forbidden forest would have tougher or more dangerous enemies. That's not the case.
You'll fight: humans, spiders, frogs, wolves, trolls, goblins and That's it. There won't be a special enemy type anywhere in this world.

- No interesting side quests or random events. Hogwarts Legacy doesn't have a natural side quest in it. You're exploring and suddenly you come across something - well, kinda... Some merchant who needs his pet rescued or kill more poachers. That's all you'll get.
The motivation to do these menial side missions is even lower due to the interchangeably awful voice acting and writing. It feels like if it’s not the writing that’s off, it’s the acting and vice versa. I would say the acting isn’t as bad as it could’ve been, but the writing reaches lower echelon Bethesda more often than not.

- The HUD is cluttered and breaks immersion.
- No memorable characters besides Sebastian.
- No matter the graphical settings, the game has issues around Hogwarts and especially Hogsmead. Lots of stuttering, textures loading in late, so on and so forth. It's got technical issues still as of June 2023.

Conclusion:
Despite most of its flaws and shortcomings Hogwarts Legacy is a strong game that many people will grow fond of. 
It does the main part right: gameplay, decent story, graphics and depicts the world of Harry Potter better than other harry potter games.
I strongly believe it wouldn't have been as successful if it weren't for huge controversies or if it didn't have the Harry Potter theme around it.

It's a 7.8 / 10",enjoyable flawed game fell short something incredible believe one many perception hogwarts legacy may prove interesting nonetheless long review good nice visual game part look magical indeed gameplay work function well start finish story interesting moment nothing blow away anything see coming spell feel great combat one favourite aspect game devs job right front magical adventure harry potter fan best harry potter game really immersive part fun others overall good game money wasted plenty content go around everyone soundtrack sound general authentic wizarding world bad shame many rpgs open world learned nothing skyrim witcher red dead redemption everything scripted point comedy result take several hour realise bland empty hogwarts best way describe comparing tv series westworld seen feel like really trying role play fake world animation play castle npc line get experience yearly season besides change castle around npc react nothing garb change according weather immersion breaking go outside castle summer spot two student playing game nice moment see npc activity around castle however reach winter student playing game outfit outside courtyard even night time 0 degree c temperature orchestra music first hear go across hall playing throughout season day night cycle go wondrous special moment tedious run faster bother le rpg one priority establish least try make something remotely natural npc many situation go progression tied main story interact dorm colleague anyone around castle unless quest silly side quest house pick matter get 1 quest per house vary look outfit chose ravenclaw shown around weasly expecting someone dorm friend guide lead castle choice game consequence cast avada kadavra wherever want nobody care hilarious time understand developer trying hard progressive pursuit fulfilling agenda made setting 1800s scotland feel like 2023 woke hollywood hear name sirona special time enter tavern enemy around world expect forbidden forest place world somewhat different since rpg enemy around castle would lower level forbidden forest would tougher dangerous enemy case fight human spider frog wolf troll goblin special enemy type anywhere world interesting side quest random event hogwarts legacy natural side quest exploring suddenly come across something well kinda merchant need pet rescued kill poacher get motivation menial side mission even lower due interchangeably awful voice acting writing feel like writing acting vice versa would say acting bad could writing reach lower echelon bethesda often hud cluttered break immersion memorable character besides sebastian matter graphical setting game issue around hogwarts especially hogsmead lot stuttering texture loading late forth got technical issue still june 2023 conclusion despite flaw shortcoming hogwarts legacy strong game many people grow fond main part right gameplay decent story graphic depicts world harry potter better harry potter game strongly believe successful huge controversy harry potter theme around 7 8 10
1063730,New World,"Unfortunately after 2050 hours of playthrough after the game's official release and about 300+ in Preview and closed beta, I find myself after being one of the warmest supporters of the game throughout all the bugs, all the misdoings of the devs and all the broken and not working stuff like the eternally non working perks, to be one step before my personal farewell.

BY ALL MEANS MAKE YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T BUY THE GAME!
DON'T GET LURED IN IT WITH EMPTY PROMISES AND FUTURE ""CONTENT""

Unfortunately this dev team has proven to be ""lesser"" in all fronts with their greatest inability is their inability to address code/server and network related issues within the game which is also what plagues the game at its current state.
So let me help you understand why I am one step before saying farewell once and for all.

let me start by emphasizing that I am not a casual player and I find myself with all tradeskills maxed out & aptitudes up to 111+ lvls, all dungeon mutations on LvL 10 all gold, 625 on more than one sets, all quests done, 65% of overall completion, owner of virtually every single weapon and armor in the game & long story short, I am a person with full clarity on anything related to the PvE aspect of the game.

As far as PvP goes now, you name it and I ve been there done that, after leading a guild for the first 4 months I have been consul and officer ever after, in a series of guilds, preparing wars, strats, builds, leading flanking teams and helping people learn how to pvp. I am pretty darn aware of every single detail related to pvp and thank god my skills also up to that lvl too. 

So, I am who I am and if a person like me who is that invested into a game ends up eventually saying that you should not buy this game, then you better consider it!

THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE ON ALL FRONTS 

(and every next patch they come up with makes it even worse because instead of them actually addressing the issues, they just stick with manipulating the game's client to address major issues and hide the actual issues under the carpet until they resurface soon, after every next patch with even more new frustrating bugs and issues on top of the old ones, as a result, of them never solving issues to the core)

The tombstone of the game's fluidity was the big February patch

- Currently you can't even DPS with light attacks a mob standing still in front of you doing literally nothing 
as the character will never start applying light attacks due to a bug keeping you from actually starting a light attacks sequence. Just consider the level at which this is present on PvP to understand what I am talking about here.

- Servers behavior/performance are at least a bad crafted joke.
Stuttering and desyncing even just by walking into the world doing literally nothing else. 
You will find yourself playing in wars with 150ms server response time (ADD that to your actual ping and try to play with that) and especially due to the server client design, the childish netcode and the actual server tik rate which matches that of an online Chess game, you will find yourself unable even to register damage on opponents with way better or way worse ping than yours!
And all that on top of the constant rubber banding, desync, stuttering, inability to dps due to the light attacks bugs, skills getting consumed without ever going out, skills triggering on their own whenever they like and the list goes on with numerous of issues!

- PERKS STILL NOT FUNCTIONING SO MANY MONTHS AFTER THE RELEASE

- LOOT/GATHERING LUCK UTTERLY BROKEN with devs unable to actually understand as to why this is and they keep on repeating intellectually how luck works on paper but they never put out a transparent proof of luck functioning as intended, which is not.

- EVERY NEXT SERVER MERGE OR BIG UPDATE MAKES THINGS VANISH OUT OF YOUR STORAGE and they never give a dime of returning these items(I am still waiting 2 months later to get back or even get an acknowledging response, for 3 legendary weapons I lost from within my storage and these are just 3 I did manage to spot missing

So long story short,

the PvE of the game is repetitive AF and even that is bugged as hell where fighting a single 30 lvl wolf can become frustrating because of the eternal desyncs (wolves are squishy mobs which are constantly on the move triggering that behavior). On top of that there are still items listed but missing from the world and the games descriptions are all over the place. 

UI IS A JOKE! You can't even tell how much critical % you have and even the tracking of your progress is not working properly, not even that will register your progress right!
(and then you have a Devs team celebrating that they will deliver the ability to be able to open your inventory on the move and they state accomplished because of that when the game suffers MAJOR ISSUES!)
Just consider their level of professionalism and their ability to relate with the actual game's issues! 

PvP IS THE BIGGEST JOKE OF ALL!
YOU CAN'T DPS with light attacks, they bug out and you can't even start a light attack sequence in order to DPS even when you have GRIT
YOU CAN'T REGISTER DAMAGE OR SKILL EFFECTS
YOU CONSTANTLY DEAL WITH RUBBER BANDING (like playing an FPS game with 400ms PING!)
MOST CRUCIAL PERKS DON'T WORK and those that do ... they do it in a speculative way having you lost in translation when you try to apply a build or even grind for it through crafting or any other means

BALANCE IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND! I don't believe that this dev team even knows what PvP means! I honestly believe that nowadays!
it is like if you took Indie game devs to work for a project like New World and you expect them to know how to do, how to fix and how to approach plus calibrate certain stuff. 
You will play a game in which
*  in order to kill a healer you need 10 guys on him for 3 mins doing nothing else than trying to kill that healer
* the heal is actually Immunity to death as long as you stand inside a sacred ground.
* an Ice shower is enough to trigger the desync/stutter/rubber banding fest. 
* the meta never changed from the beginning of the game. Everyone walks with a GA and a Hammer on their back.

WEAPON SWAPPING IS A JOKE, even after all they did to guarantee that, with their last patch, which literally ""F-ed"" up the game's client overall behavior, is still broken where if you find yourself swinging a GA, good luck with swapping it.

SKILLS QUEUE IS A JOKE! As they will never do based on your strokes order but based on how they feel like behaving due to all the cool stuff mentioned above. You will also have skills triggering simply by swapping your weapon if you eventually manage to do it.

WARS AND OPR ARE BEYOND UNPLAYABLE BECAUSE OF ALL THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ISSUES COMBINED and especially if you play from eastern Europe, good luck with that! 150ms server response FFS! Leading to a 6 fps behavior on the client on an OCed 3090 with 5Ghz on the CPU on a DX11 game! NETCODE? TIK RATE? ARE YOU THERE? oh sorry! I forgot! Unless you play with minus 50 ms ping, forget about playing this game! AMAZON SERVERS? That is the biggest joke of all! Their greed is the only constant thing here and the servers are set to deal with a card game like HS!

TL;DR 

I loved this game and I was all in for it up until now! I did support this game in any given way from its Alpha days until their last patch landed and revealed their ABSOLUTE INABILITY to make this game function the very basics properly!

So you don't need to realize yourselves all I say above after 2K hours of playing it and these are just the tip of the iceberg, because the issues list is virtually endless and you have devs celebrating that they managed to make the inventory to open while you walk or run - F F S!

JUST STAY AWAY AND DON'T BUY THIS GAME!

THERE IS ONLY FRUSTRATION - DISAPPOINTMENT - RAILLERY and a carrot stick waiting for you!

1336490,Against the Storm,"This game is a gem, a marvel of game design. I can clearly see the studio behind it has experience not only as programmers, but as gamers; they have a seasoned understanding for what does—and does not—make a game fun. There exists challenge without headache nor gimmick, the learning curve is moderate and well-paced, the UI hides no information from you whatsoever, and the game respects your time.

At it's core, this is a logistics game. Closer cousin to Factorio or Tycoons than to SimCity or Skylines. The rogue-like elements are the buildings and resources available to you each run. You start each map with basic resource gatherers and must choose your available production buildings via card draw as you progress. Risk/reward comes into play- taking a bakery is a gamble if you cannot yet make flour, and moreso if you cannot yet grow wheat. Your main antagonist is the force of nature; as you explore and grow in population, so do the debuffs the forest weighs upon you. These negative effects are re-rolled for every map, and you are informed of the full extent of their effect at the start of each run, allowing you to plan and prepare for them.

Let it be known that i did NOT ONCE have to leave the game to find information on something. Whether via the tutorial, tool-tips, or atlas, this game's informational resources are *thorough*.

And here's a short list of specific game design choices i must rave about:
-You can highlight all buildings by production or workers, AND FAST-INTERACT WITH THEM while highlighted!
-Unassigned villagers == builders by default
-Simple/starter/resource buildings can be moved instantly, freely, forever
-Every choice-making menu can be closed and later re-opened without consequence
-Each map provides a limited variety of resources, yet most recipes offer multiple possible ingredients
-You can search any ingredient/product to show all currently-available options within your settlement
-The condition for victory is direct and obvious, however the roads to getting there are many, and the detours can be treacherous.
-(From my experience so far..) Luck has been balanced to help and hurt, but not make nor break.",game gem marvel game design clearly see studio behind experience programmer gamers seasoned understanding make game fun exists challenge without headache gimmick learning curve moderate well paced ui hide information whatsoever game respect time core logistics game closer cousin factorio tycoon simcity skyline rogue like element building resource available run start map basic resource gatherer must choose available production building via card draw progress risk reward come play taking bakery gamble yet make flour moreso yet grow wheat main antagonist force nature explore grow population debuffs forest weighs upon negative effect rolled every map informed full extent effect start run allowing plan prepare let known leave game find information something whether via tutorial tool tip atlas game informational resource thorough short list specific game design choice must rave highlight building production worker fast interact highlighted unassigned villager builder default simple starter resource building moved instantly freely forever every choice making menu closed later opened without consequence map provides limited variety resource yet recipe offer multiple possible ingredient search ingredient product show currently available option within settlement condition victory direct obvious however road getting many detour treacherous experience far luck balanced help hurt make break
892970,Valheim,"In a span of 2 months, I have put 230 hours into Valheim, solo. I would highly recommend this game to anyone reading this review; to play alone or with up to 9 friends. I have not encountered a single bug and, while this is an early access game, this is a full experience. Some key features that drew me in and resulted in my slight addiction are below:

Soundtrack and graphics - The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and chill af. There were times i found myself working on my laptop with valheim running in the background, just so i could listen to the calming melodies of the soundtrack and the soft crackle of the fireplace in my base. The lighting and atmosphere are really top notch. The low resolution style was almost a turn-off for me when researching this game and watching videos. However, once inside the Valheim world, i saw it is truly beautiful and worth experiencing. 

Discovery - The second thing that really drew me into Valheim was this feature where once you pick up a new inventory item for the first time, you will then discover crafting recipes associated to that item. This, as opposed to being awarded items for leveling up, felt very enticing. It made me want to explore to find new items, and to push into more unforgiving lands for the rewards the items there may have. This left me feeling like there was always something more out there to discover. There are items in the game which currently have no function, leaving some excitement to see what they are used for once that becomes available. Even after defeating the 5 current bosses and thinking i had complete the game, there were 2 biomes i had never even seen and more items to discover. 

Development - The Devs have a roadmap that is widely accessible and clear on their plans for the future of the game. Personally, I have no social media accounts, but even through steam they post development blogs to keep the community in the loop with their plans.  To the prior point on discovery,  after seeing what valheim has to offer now, it is constantly changing. Even in the short 2 months i have had my hands on the game they have introduced a new enemy, new armor set, several QOL updates. They have near-future plans to add caves in the mountains and updates for the mistlands biome; with far-future plans for the ashlands and possibly others. 

Difficulty - The game is just hard enough. Like Darksouls, once you die, there is a marker left at the location of your death where you must return to get your items. However, this didn't feel too punishing as you can have unlimited death markers with no time limit to recover them. There were some times my items were stuck in a location that i couldn't immediately run there to recover them and knowing they weren't lost forever was enough to keep me from getting (overly) frustrated by death. Furthermore, the amount of resources obtained from a source vs the resources used in crafting felt very encouraging to building. For one tree, you get 10 wood, which is enough to build 5 walls. 


1:1 Resource Return - When dismantling a structure, the game returns the full resources used to build it. This means (assuming you had room in your inventory) you can demolish a base and rebuild it somewhere else without any additional grind. Similar games i have played in this genre typically give only a partial return. With Valheim, i felt much more free to try things and then just delete them if they didn't look right or work how i expected. 

Building -  Lastly, after spending 200+ hours in this world, defeating every boss, discovering and crafting every item, and upgrading all current items to their highest tier, i STILL spend time in this game because the building is fun and satisfying and easy. Chop one tree and you can build 5 walls. Clipping is easy and forgiving, even round walls and roofs look great once constructed. And <spoiler alert> the devs make it very easy to 'cheat' and enable debug mode. This allows the user to fly which makes gathering resources for building awesome structures much easier. They even permit using this in official building competitions. 

All in all, great experience. Highly recommend.

2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"For starters, you can be a fountain. Yes, a fountain. 

The game offers an utterly unique experience. Especially in multiplayer. 

- One game you invest heavily in undead. You wipe out entire provinces and raise the dead into shambling armies. Your opponent tries to hold back the tide, but you simply out number them. Then they produce ghosts who can only be slain by magical enemies just before you crush their last province. Your undead swarm don't have magic weapons. You can't make any because you KILLED everyone. 

- One game you throw magical demons into the dreams of your opponents. They can't sleep. They keep selling their souls to hell. You recruit troops through mystical cross breeding of animals and blood sacrifice. Your opponent creates mystical forges. Their troops fly, throw lightening from hammers, and regenerate. Your strategies become increasingly ridiculous, at one stage someone turns off the sun. THEY TURN OFF THE SUN and attack you with EYELESS MONSTERS. 

The graphics are simple, the combat is somewhat hands off, the balance can be hit and miss... but each game will tell an interesting story. Building armies is similar to constructing elaborate auto battles but with a depth that out strips the majority of games in the genre. If you've played Total War or similar games and wished the battles had a little more to them than positioning and flanking, this game certainly offers that with an elaborate magic and item construction system. For those of us that like micro management, there simply isn't any. It's set strategy and watch the outcome. This isn't an RTS.

The game is deceptively simple to learn once you understand the movement, economy, and magic system. Turns from veteran players can be swift making it an ideal multiplayer game. However, the sheer scope of options can lead to situations where your strategy can be hard countered by an opponent. You may find yourself in an unwinnable situation quite quickly and mistakes can be unforgiving. 

The largest downside to the auto-battle and elaborate magic system is that the AI will never give you the same competition as a human. The AI will often fall for specific strategies and, 6 games into the series, this is still a problem with Dominions 6. That said, mods and a great community are sure to follow this game. The developers also have a proven history of updating and patching their games.

Highly recommended, especially if you have a small friend group to play with. It's a great game to play between lunch breaks as it offers a delayed turn system somewhat similar to chess. 

Watch some YouTube videos if you are uncertain, or find someone in the community to teach you if you're unsure. The game is FAR simpler to play than people let on with common sense working for most strategies. Slingers aren't great against armor. Mages don't like being stabbed. You should probably tell your Green Knight not to charge at the start of any given battle. Also... you should be a Fountain. A teleporting Fountain filled with blood that makes everyone age at an accelerated rate and constructs a Well of Misery. A sleeping Fountain that wakes up a year into the game and hungers for souls. 

Don't you want to be a Fountain yet? 

... 

There's a Bone Dragon too. You can do that if you need to. Still... Fountain?

Questions:

What's multiplayer like? It has lobbies. You don't need to connect manually.

What are the differences between 5 and 6? 

There is a list on the forum, but there are new features related to under ground areas, more units during battles, more races, some better balance features, trees for some reason... If you've never played Dominions before, you could play Dominions 5 and still be a fountain.

not even 10 seconds after raider kills Ratatouille, the raider passes out from blood loss (and later dies) just from the sheer amount of rat bites/scratches

Ratatouille risked his life to save my tiny little colony that was just starting out. When you play this game, make sure to get yourself a real one like Ratatouille.

221100,DayZ,"I was looting the barracks in Zelenogorsk when I hear a gate being opened behind me, I turn and see a well-equipped player dealing with a zombie. I have a gun in hands and the advantage, but my entire current playthrough has been rather peaceful, so i opt for a non-violent solution. I duck behind the corner of a barrack and yell over direct chat that I don't want to kill him, and i circle around a stone wall trying to avoid line of sight. He answers, but it is intangible. I can't see him anywhere but I assume he went to the barracks. (1st person server btw) I try my best to not get in an awkward position and run up into the second floor of a house overlooking the military site. By the time I get there i can see that he has indeed closed the door in the prison building.

The reason i was looting military sites was to find some AK74 mags. That was my entire reason for being there. I'd trade my M4 for a couple of those. I think about the chances of being killed versus the chance of him might having such a mag for trade. I know it's risky, but fuck it. I run up to the prison building and say I'm friendly and just wondered if we could do some trade.

He accepts and tells me to come into the prison with my gun put away. This smells rotten eggs all the way to Rify, but I'm determined that my friendly intentions will serve me well.I enter, he is pointing at the door with an AUG. It's when i get closer to him that i see a second man with an AUG in the staircase. I explain what I'm trying to get and mid-sentence, a friend of theirs come in. He was likely watching the entrance. After a little meet&greet the say 'sorry, don't have any mags'. I say that's okay, and we agree that we wont go the same direction afterwards lest we run into each other again.

I drop a black skull balaclava that i wasn't using as a token of gratitude for the friendly encounter and I'm on my way to Mishynko. Half way there, somewhere in the forest, I'm shot in the leg. Pants ruined, but legs not broken. I very briefly get some vietnam-level flashbacks to the time my roommate taught me the basics of ARMA and combat, and I jump behind a tree instead of just turning around. I count down from 10 and regain my breath. My M4 is equiped with an ACOG, and the shooter must have been about 100-150 meters away.

I peek from the tree and see a man getting down on the ground by a bush. There's no peaceful solution to this conflict. My breath has gone down and I brace myself. peaking a second time with my rifle and shoot three rounds.

One of them hit.

I wait 4 seconds for him to likely have gotten behind a tree of his own to bandage. I start making a wide arch around him, moving as quickly and safely i can while preserving breath. I finally get to him and see he's unconscious.

That's when i noticed it was the third guy from before, donning a black skull balaclava. I'm angry, but not disappointed. this is the nature of the game. While i still have him alive and able to hear me, all i can get myself to yell was ""I TRUSTED YOU"" before I shot him. Looting his body, I find 3 ak74 mags, an ammo box full of the right ammo, an LRS and some decent stores of food.

569480,Kingdoms and Castles,"UPDATE:
The game changed a lot since I wrote my review, so here's a little update. They added A LOT of things and there's still a lot to come, they update it quite often and are very clear with their plans for the game. I recommend it!

OLD REVIEW:

I was actually going to recommend it, because the basics are great and I thought that with time it will only get better, but after I've read the roadmap I'm a bit disappointed. The next thing that will be added will be Ports and Merchants, which is great, but the next steps are Twitch integration and VR. Really? I'm a huge VR fan and the Twitch integration sounds good, but that's not what this game needs right now.   


Like I said, the basics are great, but that's what this game is, basic. It needs much more things to do, more buildings, more production chains, more strategy, more ways to defend, more ways to be destroyed; it's just not there right now. 

I hope it will get better and I will change my review then, but for now, I'm on the edge. It's a good start but the developers seems to prioritise making it popular first by adding Twitch and VR support, instead of focusing on expanding gameplay and actually finishing the game.",update game changed lot since wrote review little update added lot thing still lot come update quite often clear plan game recommend old review actually going recommend basic great thought time get better read roadmap bit disappointed next thing added port merchant great next step twitch integration vr really huge vr fan twitch integration sound good game need right like said basic great game basic need much thing building production chain strategy way defend way destroyed right hope get better change review edge good start developer seems prioritise making popular first adding twitch vr support instead focusing expanding gameplay actually finishing game

There is so much stuff to do, and so many quests, my quest log is constantly filled to max capacity.
I really like this game. It's the only one I play.

I haven't hit a paywall yet, and I haven't felt the need to get a subscription.
You want a mount? You get a mount. 
You want more storage? Buy more storage. 
You want a house with furniture? Buy a house with furniture. 
You want to fast travel? Fast travel via waypoints for free.
You want to create numerous characters? You can create up to 8.
You want to delete one and make a different one? No problem.
I have yet to find something I require, for which I need to pay real money.
You get free daily items. Some of these are crates containing items only available in store.
Dont like the items you got? Trade them for gems, save up gems and get what you want.

If you have the money to spend on subscription gaming, perhaps there are better options out there.
For a gamer on a budget, like me, this is by far the best value I have ever got from any game.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"Coming into CK3 as a longtime CK2 and EUIV player, I was slightly concerned about the content and playability of CK3. After all, CK2 in its initial stage was very limited, and it was through the course of very many DLCs that fleshed out CK2 to what it is today. CK3, being brand new, and (rightfully) with no expansions, felt like it would be in danger of being a pale imitation of its predecessor. 

However, now with over 40 hours in CK3, I can safely say this game lives up to everything that CK2 brought to the field and more! The UI is much, much more intuitive and new player-friendly. Furthermore, content that was added over a long period of time through expansions/DLCs like India and Tibet are in the game right off the bat and immediately playable! There are also many new, welcome mechanics, at least for people like me who like to roleplay their dynastic legacies or 'jump ship' so as to speak. Let me explain!

To start myself off in CK3, I decided to go with an old favourite, the Magyars. Leading the fore as Almos, I led the Magyars to migrate into the Carpathian Basin, snatching it from Bulgaria. Following this, I attempted to conquer enough lands to reform the Taltoist faith, but combined pressure from the Carolingian Kingdoms and the Byzantine Empire led to the death of Almos and poured cold water over my dreams of reformed Taltoism. As Almos's son, Arpad, I turned Catholic, and used 'holy war' as an excuse to conquer all my heathen neighbours despite being pagan just years ago. With Hungary formed and its borders secure, Arpad finally passes on. As the 3rd-generation King Szonuk, I noticed Bavaria was no longer in the hands of the Karlings, thereby breaking their tripartite alliance. I bide my time, building prestige, formed alliances with West Francia and the Byzantine Empire, and proceeded to invade and conquer Bavaria, creating the Austro-Hungarian Empire centuries before its supposed to exist. 

As Szonuk dies and my 4th-generation Arpad II takes the throne, I notice I am, in fact, able to claim the West Francian throne for my mother. So I invade my former allies without further ado and put dear mum on the throne. As my mother passes on and the throne of West Francia comes to my greedy little hands, the Austro-Hungarian Empire has surpassed even Charlemagne, and stretches from France to Hungary. My son, Szonuk II, through careful eugenics, is a genius, and my grandson, Arpad III, a HERCULEAN genius! Nothing can stand in our way now!

But wait. A killer roams the castle. I am shocked and horrified to discover my herculean genius grandson dead. Dead before he even has a chance to fulfil his glorious legacy. I vow to find the killer myself. Clearly, it must be a Karling loyalist, or maybe even a Byzantine spy trying to undermine my power. As I investigate, I get ever closer to the truth... and then receive a letter, from none other than the killer! The killer says they have been living under my nose this whole time, and that the truth will only bring me pain. I push on nonetheless... I must know the truth! And when I confront the killer... its...

... My son, Szonuk II! 

Why?! How?! it's your own son! My grandson! 

I am aggrieved. I disinherit him and put him in jail immediately. My successor changes to one of my other, more virtuous, less kinslayer-inclined sons. As I ponder what to do with my insane genius kinslayer of a son, the Pope's messenger arrives. A crusade, he declares, is to be launched into Jerusalem. Being the pious Emperor that I am, I of course, agree. To my surprise, my son qualifies as a beneficiary of the crusade, due to being disinherited. Hm. So be it. I free him from jail, force my son to be in the frontlines as a knight, and send him off to lead the imperial armies and hopefully die a virtuous death despite living as a sinner. 

The crusade against the Abbasids goes swimmingly. Too swimmingly. In a twist of fate, my sinful son becomes monarch of the holiest kingdom, Jerusalem itself. Well. So be it. He'll probably die defending the holy city once the Abbasids recover and launch their counter-assault. I have no inclination to help him. So, I click past the notifications, and...

... I accidentally click ""I wonder what kind of King he'll be?"" 

And now all of a sudden I'm the kinslaying villain disinherited by the Emperor, and sent to be king of a forsaken holy kingdom that i have no chance of holding. With a single demesne, with all my vassals and everybody in my family hating me because I'm a kinslaying nutjob. FFFFF-

Just as I consider ragequitting, I figure... Hang on, this might be the most interesting character to roleplay as yet. A kinslaying, lunatic-genius exiled from home and sent to die fighting for the cross to atone for himself. 

So I lean into it. I become the most insanely fanatical holy king ever. My first order of business is to imprison and revoke the titles of all my vassals from the contributing houses of the crusade. Now my demesne is full and my coffers are slowly filling up. Then, I befriend the Byzantine Emperor, bribing him with huge amounts of gold, most of it given to me by the Pope despite my lunacy due to my renowned piety (thank you, Your Holiness!) and swaying him with my evil charisma. 

I see that he has three sons. I marry my daughter (thank god I didn't kill YOU too) to the youngest matrilineally. Now we have an alliance. With the aid of the Byzantines I survive in the land of the infidels, and slowly expand by absorbing the smaller Islamic emirates around me, never lifting a finger and simply burning prestige to let the Byzantines do their thing and wipe out my enemies. Following this, I systematically kill off the very helpful Emperor's older sons. The first murder goes unnoticed. The second, unfortunately, is traced back to me. The Byzantine Emperor is very understandably heartbroken and furious with me. So I assassinate him too. 

Now my son-in-law is Byzantine Emperor, and he hates me for killing off basically his entire direct family. Sure, understandable. I check my daughter and see she already has two sons born to our house. Cackling madly all the way and out of my mind with stress, I commit suicide. 

Now I am my daughter. Over the years, I watch as my husband drinks himself to death, leaving the Byzantine Empire to my oldest son, who I groom into another herculean genius. By the time I pass on and play as my son, the Herculean Genius, Hungarian Catholic, Byzantine Emperor and King of Jerusalem Szonuk III, I look to the west and see our ancestral legacy, instead of imploding like I thought, has remained intact, and blossomed towards England and Scandinavia as well. As I look at the sea of Arpadys covering the map, I vaguely realize I've recreated the Western and Eastern Roman Empires.

569480,Kingdoms and Castles,"A stylized but simplistic citybuilder. A good introduction to the genre but likely to be too simple for experienced players. 

Pros: 
+ Great music, I can't stress enough how much I love it. 
+ Artstyle, it looks great and has a unique personality. 
+ Relaxing

Cons: 
- Not a lot of options / micromanaging 
- Lacks tools for optimising your city, for example finding which household lacks access to a church, can be a real pain of just looking very closely at the ground of the whole map, or finding out what farms are too far away from a grainary to store their food.
- The pop-ups from your advisors get super annoying when you just can't find out where the problem is, like mentioned above. 

Have you played Banished? In comparison this is a lot simpler, less realistic, but more relaxing. It has a better UI than Banished but no tutorial, and if you've already bothered to learn the UI from Banished this will feel lackluster in it's options. 
Haven't played Banished? I would recommend it over Kingdoms and Castles but if you like this artstyle or are new to the genre this is for you. 

TLDR; Baby's first Banished/Citybuilder.

216150,MapleStory,"You know when you see the family at dinner at a restaurant and all of the kids are on their iPads and no one is talking? That's a lot like this game now. It's all about instant satisfaction, and a completely dead community. Yes, I did play Maplestory back in its prime (2005-2008), and yes I am bias, but this game is not for you if you are looking for the original Maplestory. Who knows, maybe if I never played this game before, I would think it is great. It's up to you, there are still some cool things about it. You do your own thing, level up super fast, do some bosses. I love the art style still, but Maplestory now feels super lonely, and nothing you do is rewarding anymore. I haven't died a single time (and yes i have more hours than you see on steam here, I've played 70+ hours a year back not through steam). Nothing is challenging, the game is total instant gratification that dissipates very quickly. There are no specific roles to the class you choose because every class does a ton of damage and has mob control. I digress... You can still have fun on this game, but if you are coming back expecting this game to be the Maplestory you knew back in the day, do not try it (this is an opinion not a fact, do what you want). If you're looking for a lonely grind game that is calming and comforting, this may be a game that you like. Try it and see. It's free to play, so try it and make your own opinion.

BUT

I am on the same page as many others. As an early adopter of this game on Steam, we Beta tested the game for them, and then essentially suffered through beta-phases of every mechanic in the game as they ironed things out before the console releases over a year later. FatShark has now spit in our faces and compensated us nothing for the play-testing while giving away more than 10x the amount of MTX currency for new adopters of the game. They offer us a paid upgrade for 1/10th of the currency they're giving new, console players for simply purchasing the game. I absolutely love this game, but I feel FatShark has treated the Steam players that have supported them from the beginning poorly while trying to appeal to the players who could be a fresh revenue stream for them.",great game add fact 40k universe even better page many others early adopter game steam beta tested game essentially suffered beta phase every mechanic game ironed thing console release year later fatshark spit face compensated u nothing play testing giving away 10x amount mtx currency new adopter game offer u paid upgrade 1 10th currency giving new console player simply purchasing game absolutely love game feel fatshark treated steam player supported beginning poorly trying appeal player could fresh revenue stream

949230,Cities: Skylines II,"[b]Update: After the recent update, I have been able to play this game. At least now I can adjust some settings to high. However; the city in my savegame is very small, with 2k cims. So I don't know for how much long it will stay stable. Stuttering isn't gone, but now it's definitely not as frequent as it was, but maybe it's because the city is very small. Only time stuttering keeps happening noticeably is when loading a save game after launching the game, which probably means game takes time to load textures. Nevertheless, the number of issues that occurred after the release shouldn't have happen in a full released game. [/b]

This review will probably not get any attention. Paradox or CO probably will not even notice this review or may not even bother at all. In fact, probably no one will notice this review among hundreds. But I'll share my honest feelings about the game anyway.

I do not have thousands of hours of gameplay on CS1, but I did enjoy playing it a lot. I've used tons of mods to make my cities look cool. Even though I have not been playing CS1 recently, I was actually excited for CS2. Bought the standard and then refunded to buy the Ultimate Edition, because I was sure I would love it so why not get the entire package?

I saw videos popping up claiming bad performances of CS2, I became skeptical, but I still hoped that I would be happy just to go with some medium and low settings. I just wanted to have fun.

Turns out I'm just another idiot who really believed Paradox/CO and prepurchased this game, despite the warnings. Having a 9900k running at 4.7GHz, a RTX 3060 Ti and 32GB ram running at 3600Mhz with 1080p display seems to be not even close enough to enjoy this game even with low-medium graphics that I had hoped. 

I keep seeing reviews and comments from people claiming they are getting better performances with similar hardware, I keep adjusting my settings according to their comments, and I do see an increase in fps, but even after tweaking my settings to mostly low, my game keeps heavily stuttering way too frequently. I keep wondering how people who have similar hardware like mine are playing this game and managing to build their city while my city is just at the start with no cims because I'm struggling to manage the stuttering. 

Most of my play hours consist of fiddling with the settings and seeing how the game performs. I could not manage to even get a city going because the stuttering wouldn't make it possible for me to play it.

People at Paradox or CO, whoever is responsible for this disaster, how can you release a game with such an unoptimized state and then claim that this game was meant for future hardware in mind? Like even your recommended hardware struggles with higher settings.

I paid to play a game so I could enjoy it since my hardware at least meets the minimum standards. I don't mind the lack of a steam workshop, I don't mind that the game would probably look uglier and I lowered my expectations seeing all the negativity, and now my rig struggles to run it even with lower settings. I did not pay you to get a product that I would be spending time with to adjust the settings and be disappointed every time.

If anyone at Paradox or CO actually sees this review, I kindly ask you to stop releasing your game in such a messy state. Yes you admitted that the performance did not meet your expectations, but instead of postponing the release, you let this trainwreck happen. I'm sorry if I sound bashful, but we all paid real money during these hard times to buy your product and all we got was disappointment.",b update recent update able play game least adjust setting high however city savegame small 2k cim know much long stay stable stuttering gone definitely frequent maybe city small time stuttering keep happening noticeably loading save game launching game probably mean game take time load texture nevertheless number issue occurred release happen full released game b review probably get attention paradox co probably even notice review may even bother fact probably one notice review among hundred share honest feeling game anyway thousand hour gameplay cs1 enjoy playing lot used ton mod make city look cool even though playing cs1 recently actually excited cs2 bought standard refunded buy ultimate edition sure would love get entire package saw video popping claiming bad performance cs2 became skeptical still hoped would happy go medium low setting wanted fun turn another idiot really believed paradox co prepurchased game despite warning 9900k running 4 7ghz rtx 3060 ti 32gb ram running 3600mhz 1080p display seems even close enough enjoy game even low medium graphic hoped keep seeing review comment people claiming getting better performance similar hardware keep adjusting setting according comment see increase fps even tweaking setting mostly low game keep heavily stuttering way frequently keep wondering people similar hardware like mine playing game managing build city city start cim struggling manage stuttering play hour consist fiddling setting seeing game performs could manage even get city going stuttering make possible play people paradox co whoever responsible disaster release game unoptimized state claim game meant future hardware mind like even recommended hardware struggle higher setting paid play game could enjoy since hardware least meet minimum standard mind lack steam workshop mind game would probably look uglier lowered expectation seeing negativity rig struggle run even lower setting pay get product would spending time adjust setting disappointed every time anyone paradox co actually see review kindly ask stop releasing game messy state yes admitted performance meet expectation instead postponing release let trainwreck happen sorry sound bashful paid real money hard time buy product got disappointment

i have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online 
Tactics, and now Arena. 
MTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years
Magic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..
Magic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)

MTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years. It may have just arrived on steam but it has been a beta then stand alone client for years (i was accepted into the beta 3/2018 and beta wrapped up 9/25/2019 to give an idea) They are releasing sets and keeping in line with standard releases, they offer a ton of formats and you can earn your cards and decks. i have earned thousands of cards and hundreds and hundreds of packs for free, 1-2 packs per day is easy, and yes it takes time but each month the ladder resets and you work your way up in ranked or you can just play another format or unranked to earn gold/xp,coins which translate into packs, save your gold for drafts and open packs and pick cards or just buy a ton of packs and earn them for free with exp! Also every 6 packs you open you get a choose your own blank rare gold wild card, and every 30 packs a mythic wildcard , also you get blank commons and uncommons in packs and by playing.  and PS there is a ton of people playing all the time, you never have to wait long for a match or even a draft to kick off.

(New Account info and Instructions)
New Accounts have to play and complete 5 mini matches to unlock 12 free cards and 5 free starter decks, then upon completion you will enter into the client and see color challenges..skip that, click on the mail icon (top right) to claim 21 free packs (as of writing) from different recent sets, then click the home button (top right) to get out of the color challenge screen to the actual deck builder and match entry

Here is a list of codes that will give you a ton of packs, cards and cosmetics, the packs, also count toward your free rare and mythic wildcard count you get by opening every 6 packs. by opening these you should have enough to craft your own starter decks and even pick quite a few blank rare mythic and common uncommon wild cards ( i just tried to make a new account and i got 69 free packs total that translated to 18 common 25 uncommon 12 rare and 4 mythic wildcards and a ton of actual rares mythics and hundreds of other cards (your mileage may vary depending on how many wildcards you find in the packs as well)

281990,Stellaris,"I`m 313 hours into Stellaris.  I haven´t completed it, but I believe I can give a pretty good impression of the game.

This review includes ALL the DLCs, up to and including Utopia.

Stellaris is one of those unique games where random shit happens so often that one game can feel like several new playthroughs. Over 300 hours into the game, I still often find brand new things happening  in single player and multiplayer modes.

You start with a single planet and a few people.  From there, you go off to take over the universe. You will encounter everything from space dragons, horrors of the void and pirates that will try to kill you. For that matter, half of the universe will also attempt to kill or devour you. The rest wanna make friends or simply breed you out of history.

Going into Stellaris, it is important to know that this is NOT a game you will finish in a day or a week.  It's a game where you should take your time and really learn and understand what is going on. It´s a game where every choice you make for your population affects the outcome of the game.

Reasearch, building, military and social aspects of your population are by your command. There are a million tools to reach your goal, so you get to pick whatever you want.
You wanna be a insane warmonger ? Sure, go ahead, 
You wanna be a spiritual leader who believes in peace ? Sure, go ahead. 
You wanna be the most tech-savvy scientist and have every population below you ? Sure, go ahead.
You wish to enslave the entire world and feel like a king with slaves ? Sure, go ahead.
You wanna be a complete asshat and purge people who disagree with you ? Sure, go ahead.

Stellaris lets you truly customize according to your whims and rule the universe as you like, which is great.
Design your own race, from appearance to values.
Design your own ships, with weapons, shields, and FTL drives.
Design your own planets with terraforming and much more.

Gameplay and graphics are amazing, complemented by a soundtrack that promotes relaxation on your journey into space.

Stellaris is strongly recommended for people who love complex, long-running GRTS games.",313 hour stellaris completed believe give pretty good impression game review includes dlcs including utopia stellaris one unique game random shit happens often one game feel like several new playthroughs 300 hour game still often find brand new thing happening single player multiplayer mode start single planet people go take universe encounter everything space dragon horror void pirate try kill matter half universe also attempt kill devour rest wan na make friend simply breed history going stellaris important know game finish day week game take time really learn understand going game every choice make population affect outcome game reasearch building military social aspect population command million tool reach goal get pick whatever want wan na insane warmonger sure go ahead wan na spiritual leader belief peace sure go ahead wan na tech savvy scientist every population sure go ahead wish enslave entire world feel like king slave sure go ahead wan na complete asshat purge people disagree sure go ahead stellaris let truly customize according whim rule universe like great design race appearance value design ship weapon shield ftl drive design planet terraforming much gameplay graphic amazing complemented soundtrack promotes relaxation journey space stellaris strongly recommended people love complex long running grts game

1623730,Palworld,"Most of my game time is on Gamepass since i have friends in both places but mostly play on there.

I wonder what Game Freak and the Poke'mon Company must be thinking right about now. About how this game just took the world by storm as something with clear and present MAJOR parallels to their work. About how something new and refreshing has been desperately needed from the franchise for years now and this game just came and ate their lunch. it's too soon to tell if Palworld will be able to rise to the challenge of being as great as it has the potential to be, but it couldn't have asked for a better foundation. The following will be more of a first impressions and a wishlist for what should come in the future. Palworld is VERY Early Access, especially on GamePass where it's a few versions behind Steam, and writing a formal review for such a game is silly.

At it's core, Palworld is no different than the likes of Ark. You level up and gain points you can put into new recipes and skill points to increase health, carry weight, damage dealt and so on. You start with nothing and collect rocks and twigs off the ground to build your first bit of gear and then set off to build a base. You even beat creatures near to death and then tame them. All the familiar trappings are here, and the execution is solid but could use some polish. 

The difference, of course, is in the aforementioned clear and present parallels to everyone's favorite children's JRPG starring adorable anime creatures. Pals are, without question, the best thing about Palworld for a myriad of reasons. Just like in Poke'mon you can make apparatuses to catch Pals, and a Paldex to keep track of the ones you've seen and caught, and the addictive ""gotta catch 'em all!"" feeling is here in full force and it feels great to do it in a game that feels decidedly different from what is essentially the same game we've been getting for years. But another one of those reasons is the acknowledgement that the initial Poke'mon audience in the days of Blue/Red/Yellow Version are grown adults. Palworld isn't afraid to tackle some of the more grim and darker topics surrounding our cute and cuddly friends that Poke'mon halfheartedly tried to do with Black & White but ultimately, in my opinion, failed to really do anything with. 

The game also does suffer a bit from tonal issues that can hopefully be cleaned up. I get the feeling the idea is that you as the player are meant to make the choice for yourself, will you abuse your Pals for your own selfish ends, or will you find a better way that doesn't involve you being a piece of human trash. But this doesn't come through clearly, and it's hard to tell if Pocketpair are making fun of Poke'mon for not doing this, are memeing in their own game about these more grim topics, or are genuinely trying to tell a darker story than Poke'mon is willing to and just aren't there yet. I hope it's the latter most option and we see development occur that pushes this idea further. The game also seems to suffer from a lack of identity. Beyond the designs of the Pals, you can see a lot of influence in other games taken and placed here. This ranges from the aesthetics of the HUD (The Breath of the Wild temperature meter) to things that exist in the game world. One of the game's field bosses (a Penking) is trapped in a straight up Evergaol from Elden Ring. There's also a church that bares a striking resemblance to a location in Limgrave, and the gigantic tree that can be seen in the north gives me Erdtree vibes. The mining animation is straight from Fortnite, the list goes on and you get the idea. I'd like to see Palworld move towards it's own unique style. It's ok to make references and easter eggs and homages and I actually love the idea that the Evergaol boss is a thing. But there's a difference in making an homage and ripping off of another work, and right now Palworld does feel somewhat like it's leaning to the latter, especially with Elden Ring (I don't care that some of the Pals look all too similar to actual Poke'mon, when Game Freak and The Poke'mon company develop some respect for their aging IP and actually do something interesting then we'll talk, for now they're just sitting on what are essentially unused assets and wasted potential).

A lot of what I think would be good additions have already been mentioned by the devs; arena fights, bosses that require Guilds to take down together, and updates to existing systems all sound good. Beyond that, seeing more of this world wouldn't go amiss, new maps like Ark that become available once you've beaten the bosses and more civilization wouldn't hurt either (there's at least one small village in the game you can visit).

I'm recommending Palworld because that's the best chance it has for success, for everyone to jump in and give voice to what they want to help make this game realize it's potential. And it's success would be important not only to it, but also to Poke'mon. Game Freak and The Poke'mon company have no incentive to take any kind of risk, to do really anything other than continue to pump out the same tired JRPG every two years like they've been doing since I was roughly 7 years old, with very little in the way of meaningful change. That CAN change, but only if they're given a reason to do so.

569480,Kingdoms and Castles,"“An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity"" - Terry A. Davis

Kingdoms and Castles is a great game with a lot of replayability that is easy to pick up and master. It plays very similarly to a game like Banished but is not a clone of that game. 

Everything great about this game comes from the simplicity of its mechanics. The core of it is that you need happiness to get peasants to immigrate to your city and get more peasants each year after reaching population milestones. Happiness must then be balanced with taxation that is necessary to fund services and defenses. There are many ways to get happiness and not all of them are necessary to get 100% happiness. The players get many options regarding how to build up their villager happiness and do not have to do things in any particular order. This means cities will be different every playthrough depending on resource availability, map terrain and the whim of the player. 

The game is obscenely simple to get an understanding of and master and it is also not particularly that difficult. After the early game the game is simply expanding the city while fighting increasingly more difficult invasions of dragons and raiders. However, the mid-late game is about the same difficulty as the early game due to the player having more wealth and options. The Survival difficulty has harder invasions and a bigger emphasis on trading due to resources like stone and iron being limited, but even with that the game is still pretty relaxed. 

Not every game has to be complicated and stressful.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.

1248130,Farming Simulator 22,"So… after three years for a company who’s business-plan seem to be to release a new game every two years I had high hopes for this one. Low expectations, but still… high hopes. 

Sadly, Giants delivered as expected. In recognizable form they made sure to leave any real visions and improvements on the drawing-board and release what feels more like a free update or a cheap DLC than a new game. 

New features:
    • Seasons. More or less just copy/pasting a good mod from FS19. Instead of showing us what a professional developer can do with a good idea, they just payed (I assume) the modders and called it done. 
    • Production chains. As with seasons they took a mod(s), streamlined it a little and that’s it, done.
    • Sound and gear-system. This is in my opinion the only real improvement to the game, but it still need some polish and I would like a bigger variety in the engine-sounds. 
    • 3 new crops. One is just another combinable crop and two orchard type crops. A bit of a gimmick, but I guess they tie into production chains so that’s fine. 
    • New build mode. Improved, but the terrain editor it’s very basic and it’s impossible to smooth it out to look close to real. Even the developer can’t do it right, check out the ground close to the cow-pasture in Erlengrat.
    • New worker features. Workers can now be sent from A to B, sent to a field to do a job and carting. I only tested this a few times and it work ok, but the path-finding is far from perfect. 
    • AI traffic. AI cars drive faster, I’m sure that had to take a month or two to change, right? They are still on rails and it’s still like hitting a brick wall if you drive into them. There is no pathfinding, no avoidance. To call it AI is an insult to AI’s everywhere.
    • Used equipment and separate maintenance and paint condition. A good idea, but again, very basic. Also if you repair but don’t repaint you vehicles the condition-bar next to the speed-o stays at about a quarter full(might have been changed/fixed).
    • Character creation. It’s fine, but there is no sliders for body-shape or skin-colour and just 16 predefined faces. 
    • Fieldstone. Stones show up in fields after plowing and cultivating. Sure,  but I suspect most player’s will turn it off after a short time so why bother. In my experience the workers have no idea what parts of a field is done and not if you stop them half-way through. 
    • Changes to the UI. Sure, but was that the most important thing to improve?

Physics:
The physics seems to have gotten little to no love. 	
    • Machines and equipment still have no real feeling of weight. No change in centre of mass when accelerating or braking, no rocking and rolling on big rubber tires when you drive on uneven terrain or come a sudden stop. 
Remember, even the smallest tractor in the game weighs 2,9 tons, more than twice the weight of a compact car. 
    • The physics of bales, pallets and logs are still horrible. If you bump into them they slide around like on ice. They still glitch into pallet-forks, bale-spike and log-claws and many other objects. 
Hitting the “sweet-spot” for pallets feels like a lottery. Round-bales are perfectly round and will roll away on the slightest gradient instead of compressing slightly under their own weight. And the logs… the logs can make even the most level-headed of us turn to violence. 
    • There might be a traction-system hiding somewhere deep inside the game, but it mostly seams to have little to no impact on gameplay, it’s just cosmetic. Where is the reason to choose wide or dual tires? Why change away from narrow’s after fertilizing? Why add wheel-weights? 
Adding rolling resistance might give us a reason to use communal tires to a vehicle mostly used for carting, especially if that is the only way to reach top speed.  

Terrain:
    • The terrain poly-count can’t have changed much since the first game.
    • How can a game released in 2021 have roads with sharp angles like you find around some bridges and (un)loading-stations?
    • Otherwise the roads are smooth as glass, with no bumps, cracks, pot-holes or imperfections at all. Most times you cant even tell if you drive from asphalt to grass. 
    • It would be nice to have a reason to want to stay on the roads and dirt-tracks when moving from A to B but since the grasslands and fields are almost as smooth as the rest of the map most people just cut across. 

Workers:
The workers are as useless as ever. On a perfectly square field they do ok as long as there are no trees or building near by.
On a slightly unevenly shaped field they leave little missed bits most times they turn. They will come to a field edge, turn around and line up perfectly to continue before deciding to go home. 
I created a field with a plow, seeded two full laps of headlands and set this dumbbell off on his own. He managed a few rounds and the proceeded to seed 30 meters into the grassland next it before he quit.
It can’t possibly be that difficult to make the worker-AI aware of what they are doing, where they’re supposed to do it and if they are finished doing it. It’s been like this since at least FS15, there is no excuse!!

Maps and Gameplay:
Other then the addition of production lines, which are minor gameplay-wise, there are no changes. It’s still farm, sell, repeat. 
The economy is as basic as ever. In the new price-overview it looks like it would be possible to predict when to sell, but from my experience this is either bugged or useless.
There are three maps with one starting location on each, nothing new, nothing to be excited about, but they might be slightly bigger than in FS19. 
It would be nice to have more options when you start a new game instead of starting with the same machines, on the same farm, with the same budget every time you start a map. How about:
    • Different starting budgets.
    • A variety in starting vehicle-packs to choose from. 
    • A choice of several different farms on each map, varying in size and feel.
    • Rule-sets? 

I’m the type of person who should love this game, but I don’t. Instead I get frustrated over bad mechanics, I’m disappointed in the lack of creative thinking and development and angry that obvious bugs and flaws stays in the game release, after release. 
I hope to some day play a good or even great farming simulator, but at this rate though, with statistically only 30-40 year left to live, I don’t like my odds. 

The Farming Simulator community is big(for a work-sim) and full of supportive players and modders who have been conditioned to lower their expectations for years. It’s about time they are rewarded with a developer that at least aspires to get up to date with modern technology.",three year company business plan seem release new game every two year high hope one low expectation still high hope sadly giant delivered expected recognizable form made sure leave real vision improvement drawing board release feel like free update cheap dlc new game new feature season le copy pasting good mod fs19 instead showing u professional developer good idea payed assume modders called done production chain season took mod streamlined little done sound gear system opinion real improvement game still need polish would like bigger variety engine sound 3 new crop one another combinable crop two orchard type crop bit gimmick guess tie production chain fine new build mode improved terrain editor basic impossible smooth look close real even developer right check ground close cow pasture erlengrat new worker feature worker sent b sent field job carting tested time work ok path finding far perfect ai traffic ai car drive faster sure take month two change right still rail still like hitting brick wall drive pathfinding avoidance call ai insult ai everywhere used equipment separate maintenance paint condition good idea basic also repair repaint vehicle condition bar next speed stay quarter full might changed fixed character creation fine slider body shape skin colour 16 predefined face fieldstone stone show field plowing cultivating sure suspect player turn short time bother experience worker idea part field done stop half way change ui sure important thing improve physic physic seems gotten little love machine equipment still real feeling weight change centre mass accelerating braking rocking rolling big rubber tire drive uneven terrain come sudden stop remember even smallest tractor game weighs 2 9 ton twice weight compact car physic bale pallet log still horrible bump slide around like ice still glitch pallet fork bale spike log claw many object hitting sweet spot pallet feel like lottery round bale perfectly round roll away slightest gradient instead compressing slightly weight log log make even level headed u turn violence might traction system hiding somewhere deep inside game mostly seam little impact gameplay cosmetic reason choose wide dual tire change away narrow fertilizing add wheel weight adding rolling resistance might give u reason use communal tire vehicle mostly used carting especially way reach top speed terrain terrain poly count changed much since first game game released 2021 road sharp angle like find around bridge un loading station otherwise road smooth glass bump crack pot hole imperfection time cant even tell drive asphalt grass would nice reason want stay road dirt track moving b since grassland field almost smooth rest map people cut across worker worker useless ever perfectly square field ok long tree building near slightly unevenly shaped field leave little missed bit time turn come field edge turn around line perfectly continue deciding go home created field plow seeded two full lap headland set dumbbell managed round proceeded seed 30 meter grassland next quit possibly difficult make worker ai aware supposed finished like since least fs15 excuse map gameplay addition production line minor gameplay wise change still farm sell repeat economy basic ever new price overview look like would possible predict sell experience either bugged useless three map one starting location nothing new nothing excited might slightly bigger fs19 would nice option start new game instead starting machine farm budget every time start map different starting budget variety starting vehicle pack choose choice several different farm map varying size feel rule set type person love game instead get frustrated bad mechanic disappointed lack creative thinking development angry obvious bug flaw stay game release release hope day play good even great farming simulator rate though statistically 30 40 year left live like odds farming simulator community big work sim full supportive player modders conditioned lower expectation year time rewarded developer least aspires get date modern technology
594650,Hunt: Showdown,"Alright so this was my second experience in the game and I can say it was one of the most epic, intense and emotional rollerocasters I have ever experienced in a game. I will split this in two parts, BOSS RUN and EXTRACTION

--PART 1 -- BOSS RUN ---

> launch spider mission in the night with a random partner
> get matched with a dude who didn't have a mic and was just nodding his yes/no answer
> start the game pretty slowly
> since it's night we are extra sneaky
> find first two clues
> everythingisokaysofar.jpeg
> find third clue, have small gunfight with players who eventually disappear
> after third clue we make our way to the boss
> we hear gunshots in the distance
> oh shit ""we need to kill them after they got the boss for us"" - say I to my mute friend
> he nods his head in argeement
> get close to boss walking on a makeshift plank-bridge above the swamp, and tensions are already building up
> as soon as we can see the boss room, the last gunfire echoes from the boss chambers and everything goes silent
> only creepy music in the background
> ""this might be a trap"" - I tell my friend
> as soon as I look him in the eyes he gets shot and falls down in the swamp
> OHSHITOHSHIT.webm
> I jump down, go to beneath the boss room and hide in a corner for some time
> should I evacuate or should I revive my buddy? 
> spend the next 5 minutes contemplating 
> I can't just leave him hanging.
> I wait for a few minutes, so they don't camp his body anymore and I run to him to get him up
> manage to revive him as we both now hide in a corner
> ""okay, we can fight the boss or haul ass - it's your call"" - say I to my friend
> he takes some time to think this over 
> in the end he nods his head in an ecstatic manner pointing up to the boss room
> we climb up the ladder and enter the boss room - the boss is at 30% health
> boss spits poison and shit at us, I take out my dynamite stick and with a price bait from my friend, I throw it directly in it's mouth, obliterating the remainder of it's 30% in one shot.
> feelsgoodman.tif
> begin banishing process, and the next 3 minutes are the longest in existance
> just before the boss is banished a guy storms in to steal our bounty
> with a set of precisely calculated bait and switch maneuvers we manage to kill him(luckily he was just one guy)

---PART 2 --- EXTRACTION ---

>as the boss completes banishing I collect our bounty and call my friend "" GET YOUR F BOUNTY AND LETS GET THE F OUT OF HERE"" - say I while hearing gunshots in the distance
> we take it, open the second floor door and jump down the river, not looking behind us
> ""oh shit we made it"" - say I while taking a breather. My friend nods his head in approval. I look at the map to discover the nearest extraction point some 500 - 1000 meters from us.
> ""okay we need to circle around it"" - and we spend 10 minutes going around to evade campers, but as soon as we approach the point we get shot upon
> ""RUN RUN RUN"" - I scream at him while struggling to zig zag in the swamp which slows your movement speed down
> I hear people shooting at us and bullets darting near my head
> we manage to double back to near the boss room
> ""the only plan now is to go across the entire map to the opposite side and take that point, it's too risky here""
> the next 20 minutes were spent avoiding rabid dogs, not startling the crows and killing some minor zombos while always paranoic that someone might shoot us in the back of the head
>my mute buddy was always there by my side, looking out for me
> each time I turn around he had my back
> we would check corners, cover each other and generally became best buddies over the course of the  game
> as we reach the extraction point, I see the horses there, and the next 10 steps to the location give me the most notorious feel of relief - ""WE MADE IT"" - I scream - ""NO ONE IS HERE, SURELY NO ONE DARTED ACROSS THE ENTIRE MAP JUST TO CAMP HERE""
> countdown timer begins 
>20 seconds
> 10 seconds
> I see my buddy getting anxious, as he can taste the sweet deserved victory closing on us
> my teammate cautiously waits behind some boxes, while I run around - ""good game my friend, we did good we m...""
> at the 5th second I hear a shot and I fall flat on my back as I see the horse carriage right above me
> OHGODNO.flac
> I hear gunshots as I see the distance from my friend is increasing - 5 meters, 10 meters, 20 meters.""
> sigh and lean back on my chair - ""that was it, he's gonna die, it was all for nothing"" - I think to myself as I keep hearing gunshots in the distance
> ""hes probably going to abandon me and take his loot, thats what i'd do""
> as I lay there contemplating whether or not I should leave the game, suddenly the gunshots stop, as I see the distance from my friend closing
> coulditbe?.jpg.jpeg
> friend hovers over my body reviving me from underneath the horse carriage, I immediately pull out my syrenge as he takes cover and starts shooting covering shots towards the forest where we got shot from
> I start zigzaging around as I heal myself - ""THANK YOU FRIEND"" - I shout in the mic while healing
> 10 seconds
> I HOPE THEY DONT SHOOT ME AGAIN
> ""YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME BEHIND"" - I scream in the mic
> 3 seconds
> ""I HOPE WE MEET AGAIN MY FRIEND"" - I say while the last covering shots echo out
> 1 second
> You live to die another day text comes up
> WE MADE IT WE ACTUALLY MADE IT
> It seems actions do speak louder than words

I enjoyed the fight system, not so intituitive maybe, but once you master it, can be a blast. 
Puzzles aren't too hard, still enough challenging to not be boring or too easy.
Visual effects, graphics, voice acting are so well made that I struggle to understand if it was a game i was watching or a film.
I played it on medium graphic quality, still was stunning and beautiful to watch. It's not too long, but it's worth every minute.
Defo a must play if you ask me.

1151340,Fallout 76,"[h1]Season 3 just started, so you might think, that Bethesda had enough time to fix their game, right? In meanwhile they managed to implement paywall similar to what you can find in F2P games, so that mean game is working like it should, right? Well, NO, and I am writing this review, to warn as many people as possible, so they wont pay for this broken software. Amount of positive reviews this game got now, is literaly incomprehensible. Especialy when we consider technical side of whole experience and how ugly this game is.[/h1]

The most positive thought in the context of Fallout 76 is that we should be glad, because Bethesda produces computer games and not, for example, software for respirators.
Just imagine that vision of some parallel universe, where what I just said is a reality and everyday life, especially when we consider it's 2020 right now. 
We should all put our hands together in a prayer (you too atheists!), because in the end our lives are not in danger, only mental side of our health is somehow exposed, but in this case solution is simple - just don't buy Fallout 76, no matter how big discount is, no matter how much Todd Howard is waving at you, smiling, telling you that ""it just works"" and you should try it on your own. 
No, you shouldn't, because this whole thing is simply not working. 

I avoided Fallout 76 for a long time after it was first released, and I started playing it when it was launched on Steam. I got baited by positive reviews pretending game is now fixed, and it's safe to buy it. 
No, it's not and never will, because engine used to make this Fallout is simply too broken and too old to handle multiplayer game.
There's a large pool of bugs and glitches, and Bethesda is pretending that they're fixing them, but in reality every single fix is bringing back old bugs. 
It's always the same scheme -> something is not working -> after two months (or even more) they apply fix (which break something else) -> week later new update break it to previous state for another two months -> then they release another fix... this circle never ends. You stuck in dialogue with NPC and can't progress your daily quest? Your turrets attack your own structures? Your perk/mutation is not working? Game is perma-freezing on loading screens and you have to restart it every 30 minutes? You lost progress because servers stability is a joke? Welcome in Fallout 76, where in endgame you will face bug every two minutes! I could make a very long list of bugs and other problems players face, but it would be just too long and it's hard to guess which bugs are active now, because like I said previously - Bethesda mastered bugs rotation in this game.

Optimization in this game is just like everything else - how it work (when it work) is depending on various circumstances and changes every patch they apply. If you just made new character, and you run trough early game in 60fps, then in endgame you will have 30fps with regular stutters. It is like this, because amount of items you carry and store in stash directly affects your framerate, and to be honest I've never seen something that much broken in any other game. Fallout 76 in a nutshell. 

But let's talk about something positive this game has to offer, and in this case first thing coming to my mind, is community this game has. People are friendly and very helpful, they will explain everything you want to know, no matter how long it will take. They will craft gear for you, give you materials, help with quests, build structures you can't build on your own yet. 
But there is a dark shadow hiding behind all those friendly faces. I am talking about small group (but very loud) of players, fanatics, trolls and sect-like minority. To understand what I am talking about, you can just browse Steam forums of Fallout 76 for 5 minutes and you'll see it on your own. Why I am mentioning them? I am doing this only because Bethesda is doing nothing about problem, they are allowed to keep offending and attacking people who dared (how dare they?!?!) to criticize Bethesda. They'll keep striking on you and reporting your posts, and you might end up warned/banned for speaking your opinion in mannered way. Yes, Bethesda has their own ""freedom of speech"" standards, and it's very close to what you can face in People's Republic of China.

Imagine you can build various items in your camp, and then you can use them to get buffs for your character. Great idea, right? In theory, yes, but you have to use each item for 40-50 seconds to recieve specific buff, so if you want to get all of them you waste 5 (!!!) minutes of your time, and one hour later you have to repeat whole process. Everytime you want to craft/repair/build you have to manualy change your perks loadout, which takes a lot of your time, and when you're done you have to manualy switch to your main build. Bethesda promised to implement perk loadouts system months ago, but it's not just about that. The thing is, that whole perk system lack any logic and common sense, because perks should be splitted into two categories - active and passive, and crafting ones should not steal slots. When you want to buff yourself using items from your inventory, you have to scroll trough whole menu to find them one by one. Every few quests/events, you have to do general cleaning of your inventory, because game keep throwing useless (and heavy) stuff at you as ""reward"". Every single system this game has is unintuitive, frustrating and not rewarding, and every simple thing you want to do takes ages to complete. 

At first it seems interesting, because you discover new places while hiking, do various quests, and simply enjoy it. But this phase ends pretty fast when you hit midgame, where grind begins and you realize how many limits this game has. In order to reach endgame you have to grind, everyday. How much you can store is limited, how big you camp can be is also limited, daily quests, daily currency gain, everything is made in a way to make sure you'll play game everyday to reach your daily cap, and make just a slight or no progress at all. Everything from events on map to daily quests is repetitive and boring.

Game is designed in a way, where player feel hounded and forced to play everyday in order to reach daily limits, and if someone play everyday, that mean there's higher chance he will spend real cash to get additional stuff or to buy premium. Fallout 76 preys on basic human instincts, the desire to show off, being noticed, generaly speaking - need to be ""cool"" in other people eyes. Everything in this Fallout is built like a wall surrounding all these behaviours and feelings. They might tell you, that you don't need all that stuff, but believe me, you want it. That's how human brain works. Atomic shop is a masterpiece when it comes to psychological manipulation, fake feeling of items availability being ""limited"" by time, so you have to buy them before they're gone, discounts lasting for limited time, great deals for premium owners. Atomic shop, seasons, game mechanics, boring daily/weekly challenges, everything this game offers in the end has just one common goal - to make sure you're attached enough to play everyday, so at some point you might start thinking, that it wont be a crime if you spend additional money to make your in-game life easier and more colorful. 

I understand servers do not run on fresh air and companies want to earn money, and there's nothing wrong with that. But this is paid game, not some F2P title for android. It's also impostant to mention, that every new feature (like the newest thing available in game - shelters) is hiding 90% of new content and fun behind a paywall. Bethesda is literaly moving border to see how far they can go, and how much they can earn before this $ fountain dries up. 

In the end it's up to you what you'll do with your money, just think twice before you give them to Bethesda.",h1 season 3 started might think bethesda enough time fix game right meanwhile managed implement paywall similar find f2p game mean game working like right well writing review warn many people possible wont pay broken software amount positive review game got literaly incomprehensible especialy consider technical side whole experience ugly game h1 positive thought context fallout 76 glad bethesda produce computer game example software respirator imagine vision parallel universe said reality everyday life especially consider 2020 right put hand together prayer atheist end life danger mental side health somehow exposed case solution simple buy fallout 76 matter big discount matter much todd howard waving smiling telling work try whole thing simply working avoided fallout 76 long time first released started playing launched steam got baited positive review pretending game fixed safe buy never engine used make fallout simply broken old handle multiplayer game large pool bug glitch bethesda pretending fixing reality every single fix bringing back old bug always scheme something working two month even apply fix break something else week later new update break previous state another two month release another fix circle never end stuck dialogue npc progress daily quest turret attack structure perk mutation working game perma freezing loading screen restart every 30 minute lost progress server stability joke welcome fallout 76 endgame face bug every two minute could make long list bug problem player face would long hard guess bug active like said previously bethesda mastered bug rotation game optimization game like everything else work work depending various circumstance change every patch apply made new character run trough early game 60fps endgame 30fps regular stutter like amount item carry store stash directly affect framerate honest never seen something much broken game fallout 76 nutshell let talk something positive game offer case first thing coming mind community game people friendly helpful explain everything want know matter long take craft gear give material help quest build structure build yet dark shadow hiding behind friendly face talking small group loud player fanatic troll sect like minority understand talking browse steam forum fallout 76 5 minute see mentioning bethesda nothing problem allowed keep offending attacking people dared dare criticize bethesda keep striking reporting post might end warned banned speaking opinion mannered way yes bethesda freedom speech standard close face people republic china imagine build various item camp use get buff character great idea right theory yes use item 40 50 second recieve specific buff want get waste 5 minute time one hour later repeat whole process everytime want craft repair build manualy change perk loadout take lot time done manualy switch main build bethesda promised implement perk loadouts system month ago thing whole perk system lack logic common sense perk splitted two category active passive crafting one steal slot want buff using item inventory scroll trough whole menu find one one every quest event general cleaning inventory game keep throwing useless heavy stuff reward every single system game unintuitive frustrating rewarding every simple thing want take age complete first seems interesting discover new place hiking various quest simply enjoy phase end pretty fast hit midgame grind begin realize many limit game order reach endgame grind everyday much store limited big camp also limited daily quest daily currency gain everything made way make sure play game everyday reach daily cap make slight progress everything event map daily quest repetitive boring game designed way player feel hounded forced play everyday order reach daily limit someone play everyday mean higher chance spend real cash get additional stuff buy premium fallout 76 prey basic human instinct desire show noticed generaly speaking need cool people eye everything fallout built like wall surrounding behaviour feeling might tell need stuff believe want human brain work atomic shop masterpiece come psychological manipulation fake feeling item availability limited time buy gone discount lasting limited time great deal premium owner atomic shop season game mechanic boring daily weekly challenge everything game offer end one common goal make sure attached enough play everyday point might start thinking wont crime spend additional money make game life easier colorful understand server run fresh air company want earn money nothing wrong paid game f2p title android also impostant mention every new feature like newest thing available game shelter hiding 90 new content fun behind paywall bethesda literaly moving border see far go much earn fountain dry end money think twice give bethesda
2198510,New Cycle,"There is NO ability to build while paused. why would you soft lock a SINGLE player game and remove the build while paused feature? This is the second time I've been duped into buying a game from an indie developer who thought this made sense. I'm asking for a refund, I'll consider buying it again once I can build while paused. who the fuck would want to play a city builder you can't build while paused??? maybe if all I did was game. 

Edit for response to developer comment: building while in slowmo is NOT the same as building while paused. This isn't a multiplayer game, there's literally NO reason to prevent players from building while paused. The buildings aren't constructed immediately, so there won't be an impact to performance. From a coding perspective, it's actually less code to allow players to build while a game is paused. This is the standard for single player city builders. 

Less of a deal breaker, but super annoying thing. the ability to zoom out is arbitrarily capped. there doesn't appear to be any good reason to prevent a player from zooming further out to look at the whole map... the scrolling around the map is sooooo slow.

Final thing. you can't save during the tutorial phase of the game. likely a method of tricking you into playing for 2 hours so you can't get a refund. tbh, I honor the hustle. not even upset they did that, kinda impressed actually.",ability build paused would soft lock single player game remove build paused feature second time duped buying game indie developer thought made sense asking refund consider buying build paused fuck would want play city builder build paused maybe game edit response developer comment building slowmo building paused multiplayer game literally reason prevent player building paused building constructed immediately impact performance coding perspective actually le code allow player build game paused standard single player city builder le deal breaker super annoying thing ability zoom arbitrarily capped appear good reason prevent player zooming look whole map scrolling around map sooooo slow final thing save tutorial phase game likely method tricking playing 2 hour get refund tbh honor hustle even upset kinda impressed actually
1151340,Fallout 76,"game is cool and all, but the performance is not; here's a quick guide to make your game run better:

Disable fullscreen optimizations for the Fallout76.exe in the games main directory. (Optional but can help many games that use DX11 or older)

Set bVolumetricLightingEnable=0 (disables God Rays for performance increase; not an option in-game), and set iPresentInterval=0 in ""Documents\my games\Fallout 76\Fallout76Prefs.ini"" - Which will uncap your FPS and disable Vsync reducing input lag. (Massively improves performance for many people for some reason; uncaps FPS, so have an external method to cap your FPS)

Launch the game and set it to Fullscreen in the settings, it may ask you to restart the game.

Use the ""Medium"" preset for graphics, the presets also changes some extra settings the user can't access from the games graphics options.

Manually set Textures, Water & Lighting to the max settings.

Set Shadow quality to (High) and Shadow distance to (Low).

Set ""Depth of Field"" and ""Field of View"" to your preference.

Max out ""Actor Fade"" so you can see enemies from far away, but leave all other sliders alone.",game cool performance quick guide make game run better disable fullscreen optimization fallout76 exe game main directory optional help many game use dx11 older set bvolumetriclightingenable 0 disables god ray performance increase option game set ipresentinterval 0 document game fallout 76 fallout76prefs ini uncap fps disable vsync reducing input lag massively improves performance many people reason uncaps fps external method cap fps launch game set fullscreen setting may ask restart game use medium preset graphic presets also change extra setting user access game graphic option manually set texture water lighting max setting set shadow quality high shadow distance low set depth field field view preference max actor fade see enemy far away leave slider alone

594650,Hunt: Showdown,"This game has always looked interesting, but i'd read about the hardcore playerbase destroying everyone else and kind of put it on hold to play other stuff. Recently i finally made the plunge, and it's been fantastic. The beginner experience has not been nearly as bad as i expected, and we have killed teams and extracted with bounties plenty of times so far, and it's always exhilarating.

Hunt: Showdown is a badass design package with very clear vision behind it. The visuals are gritty, gloomy and monstrous, with amazing 3D design and 2D art for things like perks. The gameplay is relatively slow and methodical, and you gotta weigh the value of your actions like shooting and running before you perform them, while still keeping pace. This is pronounced more by the long reload times, and the amazing audio design. Everything you do makes noise to varying degrees, which makes you a player magnet if you decide to run and gun or fuck up and make noise by accident. Sound in this game is your best friend and your worst enemy, and learning how to use it to your advantage is super cool and will improve your chances the most. 

There's a lot more to say about this game but there are plenty of good reviews out there. I'd recommend checking out [url=https://youtu.be/7olAZyoO6cs] this video SkillUp made [/url] for a solid impression. I'd love to see the playerbase grow and the franchise expand, so this is just me trying to peddle it to you. Big recommendation.

2198510,New Cycle,"Honesty, at first I was a little reluctant to like this game.  It seemed like a shallow city builder, boy was I was wrong. There is a lot more to this game than initially meets the eye, with a wealth of mechanics to make building your city a lot more interesting. Growth of your city can feel slow at first but once things start to kick off mismanagement of resources can bite you in the ass hard.

Give this game a solid 10 hours before giving up on it. Are there bugs? yes but nothing entirely game breaking at the time of this review.

2399830,ARK: Survival Ascended,"I have been a faithful player of Ark (Evolved and now Ascended). I’ve logged over 18k hours on Evolved alone. I’ve always loved the concept of the game and it’s always kept me coming back for more. However, I just can’t recommend this game to anyone because of the developer team at WildCard Studios. I’ve never seen a studio so out of touch with their player base and just so blatantly disorganized and have absolutely no foresight at all. It has just become to frustrating that my tribe and I have finally given up. 

We’ve sat through hundreds of bugs, delays, unplayable servers, but after this launch it’s just been too much. We were ready day 1, and waited around all day refreshing on PC to be one of the “first” in and try to get a good location. We were lucky enough to get one of the best spots (herb island) on a official server (PVE). Wouldn’t you know it, some how the dev team enabled GOD MODE so anyone could spawn whatever they wanted in. After about 2 hours after launch, they did a complete rollback to day 0 and all was lost for us. By the time servers were back online, we had to log off and never had a chance at getting the island again. Immediately, all of the servers were capped (70/70). They didn’t make NEARLY enough servers for the amount of users attempting to play. It was an insane lack of planning that really makes you wonder how a decision like that could possibly be made. Almost immediately, the servers began crashing hourly. Generally speaking, the first few weeks of any map launch had smooth running servers. It was only after people were established and tribes built mega bases did server performance start to suffer. That wasn’t the case here, as the servers began crashing hourly with a 15 minute roll back over and over daily. Still, we suffered through it. Playing the game 30-40 minutes at a time and tried our best to plan around the inevitable crash and roll back just hoping eventually wildcard would find a solution. This went on for WEEKS with no real resolution. 

They then made matters even worse when they decided to implement a “join server queue system” that wasn’t really a server queue system but simply an auto clicker that was much slower than any actual auto clicker. This made all of their capped servers (which they all were) way harder to get into. Their logic was laughable, they wanted to save us on “clicks”. All they did was make us have to click more to get around a prompt that made the game even harder to access. The discord was flooded with users pleading to have it removed and of course nothing was done about it. It seems eventually the system works better than previously, although I’m not sure if that’s a case of less players actually trying to get into the servers. 

The next huge error (IMO) was when Xbox and PS5 launched weeks after release. Our server (Steam) was advancing well. There were hardly any places to build (This is official PVE pillar hell, mind you). We were constantly at server population cap. When Xbox released (and PS5 shortly after) our old server was FLOODED with these players looking to start fresh on a already overbuilt map with players at a much different stage of progression. Overnight, our capped server just become completely unplayable. The console players just kept joining, even though there were boosted “new” servers for them to play on. They kept saying that these servers were impossible to get into so they had to come to the older servers just to get started. It created a HUGE mess. All of the older servers were overrun in days and we all hit SERVER tame cap. We couldn’t do anything during the much anticipated Afterlife event. Turkey trails has now started and we can’t tame, breed, or do anything of worthy progression in the game other than farm materials. 

The game, now in it’s current form, is completely useless. We should talk about WHY wildcard would launch a game like this. How ANYONE there that it would be a good idea to not include CRYOPODS that help so much with server stability. Now, all of us who were “first in” are paying the price of these laughable decisions. 
I’ve been playing since release back in 2015. But, I am done at this point.

 We can talk about the issues above and sure that played a big role in my decision (and my tribemates and tons of other former players I’ve talked to). However, the BIGGEST reason I’m calling it quits is because of the DEV team. Specifically Dollie and Cedric. Cedric is suppose to be the “community manager” and it’s just an absolute joke. He’s rarely active on social media or the discord. Never getting ahead of any issue. Never advocating for the community or keeping us up to date. Go check his X right now and see the laughable amount of information he puts out. This game is an abject failure as a community manager and the fact that he can operate in his role without actually doing his job tells you all you need to know about the managing team behind him. 

That brings me to Dollie, who loves to masquerade as a community manager when it’s convenient for her. The lack of communication from Cedric pushes Dollie to the front of the “Communication” line (mainly on discord) where she is generally the one answering questions. The issue? She uses it as her personal venting platform where she cares more about her witty 1 liners and shaming the few trolls who say inappropriate comments. She scrolls by hundreds of legitimate issues, recommendations, and even messages of support and targets in on the few 12 year old trolls who are making inappropriate comments. It’s so disingenuous that she does this so she is constantly viewed as the victim, not the thousands of paying customers who are BEGGING to be heard by ANYONE at the company about all of their valid complaints. This is a view shared by EVERY SINGLE player I’ve spoken to about it in game. 

Don’t be like me. Don’t invent your time and energy into this game. The dev team does not care about you and have no foresight at all. This game will pull you in and then frustrate you to all hell. Take my advice and avoid it.

1551360,Forza Horizon 5,"[H1] Forza Horizon 5: Stunning Visuals, Yet More of the Same and Underwhelming DLCs[/H1]

[H1]So what's it about?[/H1]
Forza Horizon 5 is the follow-up to Forza Horizon 4, now taking us to Mexico. Where FH4 shines with better stories, FH5 supports newer technology making the game look better. 

[H1]The good[/H1]
This is one the best-looking arcade racing game I know of. Most of the great mechanics from FH4 are still there - what this series does well is divide the cars into tiers so to have more fun you can always go for a lower tier and the opponents are scaled accordingly. The game is impressively optimized, with an incredible level of detail. A vast collection of customizable cars awaits, ready for tuning, improve the appearance and the tools are really easy to use. If you don't feel creative then with a few click you will be able to download designs from other players. 

Online is isn't obligatory - it's perfectly fine to play offline and most of the game features will still be there. I like that the creative tools from FH4 return so you can play tracks other players put together. The map will be absolutely cluttered with icons of races, events and much more. Thankfully there is a good filter with which you can hide the events you don't want to see.

There are so many activities and achievements / accolades to achieve; if you want to do it all you'll be busy for quite some time. Weekly and monthly missions offer attractive rewards, including rare cars. You can even adopt the role of a car dealer in a way, purchasing sought-after vehicles at low prices and reselling them at auction which then allows you to buy houses and more expensive cars.

[H1]The not so good[/H1]
Even if you bought the Premium edition, developers require additional payments for two DLCs that introduce cars unobtainable through in-game means. The wheel spins and timed exclusive cars subtly encourage loot boxes and virtual currency. Consequently, logging in daily becomes routine; I wonder if at one point FH moves to an EA loot box model where you have to spend more money to have a chance to win something. 

FH5 plays it safe with no real gameplay improvements; actually, it's worse as there is no longer a racing track and there is no atmosphere. The endgame is plain and boring. While beautiful, the world doesn't feel alive at all. It also feels there are fewer human players on the road compared to FH4. In the end FH5 feels similar to FH4 but then the boring version of it. It also doesn't help there is no real difference between seasons unlike FH4 nor that there is any form of meaningful progression. You get rewards and prices for just about everything - this means it loses all value. There is such an overwhelming number of cars and many are similar that none really stand out. 

The stories are annoying - why anyone thought Spanglish is a great idea remains a mystery. 

Online cars can teleport back and forth especially at the beginning of the race. Sometimes the AI is also rubber banding. 

The soundtrack / music / radio gets old quickly. I ended turning it off completely and just play my own songs. I never felt that need in FH4 - (I was even reminded how much better the songs of FH4 were, while playing the FH Origins Story).

As a PC player, I wonder why text chat isn't available as an alternative to the clunky link system for player communication. I don't understand why we still need to use the Xbox overlay when we purchased it on Steam. 

[H1]Bugs and glitches[/H1]
While the game in general is stable, the game occasionally experiences Crash to Desktop (CTD) while in the auction house (AH). The AH occasionally prevents new bids after being outbid, and bids may fail even after refreshing the page. Claiming funds before bidding seems to fix the issue.

At times your connection with the FH5 just drops even though your internet connection is still alive. Usually, connections restore automatically, but occasionally, restarting the game is the only option. 

Some of the achievements are buggy - if you know for certain you achieved it but the notification doesn't show up then it's best to completely leave the game and restart. I also experienced that some achievements popped up before I achieved the goal.

In the last mission of Drift Club there is still a bug present where you lose all control at the beginning of the race for a minute; there is nothing you can do just wait and hope there is enough time left after you gain control. This bug, present for over two years, remains unresolved.

Occasionally, my car fell through the game world.

[H1]The DLCs[/H1]
Of the 45 DLCs, most offer cars or limited car selections. Some DLCs offer minor benefits:

[list]
	[*][b]Expansions Bundle[/b] [no longer available]: immediate access to the Rally DLC and the Hot Wheels DLC. 
	[*][b]The Premium VIP[/b] [no longer available]: offers some additional content.
	[*][b]The Welcome Bundle[/b]: some extras to start out with - as everything is so easy to come by I would not recommend to buy it separately. [SPOILER]you will get one car voucher - I would highly recommend to use it on the £5M+ cars [/SPOILER].
	[*][b]The Treasure Map[/b] works similar to FH4: reveals all the secrets from the start, instead having to go through a guide as the locations will be shown on your map. 
[/list]

Additionally, two DLCs introduce storylines, new cars, and locations:
[list]
	[*][b]Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels[/b]: I wish you were not so stuck to the orange tracks as it gets old quickly. To have the HW cars is OK but the rest of the DLC is forgettable and the story feels like a commercial from Hasbro. You only get a handful of HW cars and online racing is limited to just a couple of tracks which all look the same. The DLC is artificially extended at the end by having you win 20 races on tracks you already played on. 
	
	[*][b]Forza Horizon 5: Rally DLC[/b]: in this DLC you will play for three different teams. It's lacklustre, it's small and the worst DLC of FH I played. I didn't feel it was a rally theme. To prolong the duration, objectives are added like having to break three different kinds of boards, crates etc for each team and races have to be done twice. The helicopter flying in front of you and obstructing your view during the races doesn't make sense. 
[/list]

[H1]Summary[/H1]
FH5 is beautiful and has a lot to offer, but it didn't raise the bar for the series and after a while it felt more of the same and started to feel boring. There is no endgame and the lack of progression hurts the game.  Finding human players can be a challenge and the DLCs aren't great, the stories are poor and the music choice gets old quickly. It's bad business practise that even when you purchase the Premium edition or Car Pass you still have to buy extra cars if you want to have everything. 

That doesn't mean that FH5 is a bad game but comparing it to FH4: FH4 has more entertaining DLCs, stories and events; FH5 looks a little better by offering the latest technology but is more of the same. If you can get a good deal on FH4 - play that first; then get FH5 on sale if you still want more. 

Note: I would highly recommend using a controller - it is a much better experience than mouse and keyboard.

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"I started Dying Light 2 having been a huge fan of Dying Light 1. Let me refresh your memory about Dying Light 1:
Dying Light 1 was a wonderful experience that I put about sixty hours in to, and I enjoyed almost every second of it. 

The dialogue was cheesy, the plot had holes, yes, there are legitimate criticisms you can easily levy at DL1, but I would still overwhelmingly recommend it because, above all else, it was fun. 

The combat felt fantastic, with real weight to your swings. The parkour made you feel agile and, once mastered, gave a real freedom to your movements. There was variety in the environments, with a pleasing amount of verticality. You were free to ""grind"" to increase your power almost to an unlimited level. And night time felt different - you were genuinely at risk at night, because it brought out much scarier, seriously powerful zombies who would tear you limb from limb if they caught you.

It's worth setting the scene like this, because Dying Light 2 let me down on almost every count.

I didn't expect the story to be any good; there's no pedigree of decent storytelling here. But the devs have shoehorned in an arbitrary choice system so you can ""fundamentally change the world"". But there isn't actually a branching story tree, they tell the exact same story regardless of your choices, but they have to work the plot around whether you decide to let a few characters live or die - the result of this is that you are left with an impossibly generic story with utterly forgettable characters. 

Sure, the story is terrible, but DL1 wasn't exactly good. It made up for that with fantastic gameplay. So how does that compare here?

In short, not well. DL2 manages to miss the mark in both combat and parkour. The combat feels cartoonish; slapping a zombie or a person with a wrench makes a light bonking sound and often barely staggers the target. It feels a little bit like you're hitting people with foam weapons - until you randomly land a critical hit (which is in no way influenced by an accurate strike, such as to the head, and so doesn't feel rewarding), at which point you will decapitate them, or literally cut them in half with the same weapon that they were completely ignoring a moment ago. 

I think the developers were concerned about how powerful it was possible to get in DL1, and to compensate, levelling now requires picking up a collectable (inhibitors) rather than purely being earned from experience. And they gate the availability of these inhibitors behind map progression, and thus story. Enemies in each subsequent area therefore get harder at the same rate you do, and so this removes any actual sense of progression or power scaling - it takes the same number of hits to kill a zombie at the end of the game as the start. Except it sort of made sense it took three to five hits to kill a zombie with a rusty pipe you've picked up in desperation at the start of the game, and doesn't make much sense that a ""legendary"" rarity machete that you've modified to both shock and burn takes up to five hits to kill a VISUALLY IDENTICAL zombie. The only difference is that the small number at the top left of their health bar is higher. At least in DL1, as tougher zombies were introduced, they were visually distinct (and you were free to scale as you wished).

The parkour is unfortunately not a redeeming feature here either. In DL2, the movement feels wrong, somehow. You're too floaty, you have no inertia at all. You can jump too high, you can spin 180 degrees at full sprint. It just doesn't feel like any of your movements are particularly deliberate or consequential. 

The streets are just a little too wide; you can't jump across them without having to catch yourself on the edge without using a specific skill, and using that skill drains your stamina, so you can't string freerunning across the city without stopping. 

In DL1, freerunning across the city was a joy; the buildings within a district were usually of subtly different heights, so you're navigating vertically whilst moving across rooftops quickly - this kept the running engaging and fun. In DL2, the buildings are the exact same height. You only have to actually do any parkour to jump across a street when the row of buildings you're on has run out. 

In the second area, buildings are suddenly extremely tall, and this feels immensely promising. But they then immediately introduce the hang glider... This tool (until upgraded) is immensely slow and unresponsive. It leaves you floating slowly in the air as you drift towards your target, but you have absolutely no option of getting around any other way. And once it IS upgraded, you can fly at a reasonable speed more or less indefinitely. So movement has gone from DL1, where you would climb a building, run across rooftops, leaping between them, navigating up and down as you went, with buildings also built on hills and slopes, with destructible roofs and surfaces that make noise and attract risk, to DL2, where you take a lift to the top of the nearest building, then glide directly to your target in an uninteractive way. 

Techland has tried to make DL1 again. They've changed very little about the game and added a few additional features, that, on paper make it more fun.
But all they have succeeded in doing is removing the joy from the experience of playing the game. 

Fans of DL1 will absolutely be able to play through the game. I did, it took me 30 hours of sporadic play. But when I got to the end, I was disappointed, and all I could think was ""man, Dying Light 1 was a fun game"".",started dying light 2 huge fan dying light 1 let refresh memory dying light 1 dying light 1 wonderful experience put sixty hour enjoyed almost every second dialogue cheesy plot hole yes legitimate criticism easily levy dl1 would still overwhelmingly recommend else fun combat felt fantastic real weight swing parkour made feel agile mastered gave real freedom movement variety environment pleasing amount verticality free grind increase power almost unlimited level night time felt different genuinely risk night brought much scarier seriously powerful zombie would tear limb limb caught worth setting scene like dying light 2 let almost every count expect story good pedigree decent storytelling devs shoehorned arbitrary choice system fundamentally change world actually branching story tree tell exact story regardless choice work plot around whether decide let character live die result left impossibly generic story utterly forgettable character sure story terrible dl1 exactly good made fantastic gameplay compare short well dl2 manages miss mark combat parkour combat feel cartoonish slapping zombie person wrench make light bonking sound often barely stagger target feel little bit like hitting people foam weapon randomly land critical hit way influenced accurate strike head feel rewarding point decapitate literally cut half weapon completely ignoring moment ago think developer concerned powerful possible get dl1 compensate levelling requires picking collectable inhibitor rather purely earned experience gate availability inhibitor behind map progression thus story enemy subsequent area therefore get harder rate remove actual sense progression power scaling take number hit kill zombie end game start except sort made sense took three five hit kill zombie rusty pipe picked desperation start game make much sense legendary rarity machete modified shock burn take five hit kill visually identical zombie difference small number top left health bar higher least dl1 tougher zombie introduced visually distinct free scale wished parkour unfortunately redeeming feature either dl2 movement feel wrong somehow floaty inertia jump high spin 180 degree full sprint feel like movement particularly deliberate consequential street little wide jump across without catch edge without using specific skill using skill drain stamen string freerunning across city without stopping dl1 freerunning across city joy building within district usually subtly different height navigating vertically whilst moving across rooftop quickly kept running engaging fun dl2 building exact height actually parkour jump across street row building run second area building suddenly extremely tall feel immensely promising immediately introduce hang glider tool upgraded immensely slow unresponsive leaf floating slowly air drift towards target absolutely option getting around way upgraded fly reasonable speed le indefinitely movement gone dl1 would climb building run across rooftop leaping navigating went building also built hill slope destructible roof surface make noise attract risk dl2 take lift top nearest building glide directly target uninteractive way techland tried make dl1 changed little game added additional feature paper make fun succeeded removing joy experience playing game fan dl1 absolutely able play game took 30 hour sporadic play got end disappointed could think man dying light 1 fun game

552990,World of Warships,"I'm going to be honest, multiplayer games are something I steer away from in general, toxic communities and being headshotted by people way better than me are not my idea of fun.

Hello WoWS, tempted in by the loving care given to real historical ships I thought, hell, what's the harm in giving it a go.

100 hours later I'm addicted. The only game I've ever played where I choose full PvP every time. In over 300 battles so far I've yet to see anyone do anything other than take the game seriously and try to help their team, and the rants in the ingame chat are simply non-existent for the most part.

It's also anti-twitch, this is moves played out over minutes not seconds, and the joy of pulling it off, and the slow agony of getting it wrong and knowing you're doomed, all adds to a superb atmosphere.

A special mention too to the way the game opens up modes and sections as you progress through your first hours, never overwhelming, always exciting, and perfectly paced.

Also, loot crates done right imo. You can't buy them, it's not hard to earn at least one per day after 1-2 battles, and in 4 weeks I've had two super containers drop containing real world valuable items.

Finally, no pay to win. Yes, you can pay to advance quicker (premium increasing XP and Credits awarded) but all premium ships come with drawbacks to balance them out (just check the wiki for each). Nothing is a game winner by default, and yes a day one player can buy a high tier ship and jump into 'end game' battles but they won't have fun and they won't do it for long. The road to success, and the fun of the game, is learning to fight effectively through the tiers.

If you acknowledge the learning curve and take the time to learn how to play each class you're interested in at each level, there is a ridiculous amount to do here, with every battle unique, and a ton of campaigns and time limited events to focus on, what's not to love?

(edit: 227 hours in now and nothing has changed, this might just be the best game I've ever played on Steam)

(edit: Well over 500 hours in now, ok, this is the best game I've ever played on Steam :) )

(edit again: 1,125 hours logged, 3 years of solid play without any significant breaks and still so much to do and achieve, incredible...)

(edit 2022: 1,625 hours now, nothing has changed, this is an amazing game. I haven't bought ships for some time as I'm having a blast with tech tree Tier X and coal ships, the only game I've ever played daily for over 4 years now)

1062090,Timberborn,"I've played a few other build-things-from-nothing games recently, and Timberborn is so far ahead of those in terms of enjoyabililty it's not funny. Even with the game being far from finished, you can pick out your own goals, and get there however you please, with a wide and ever-increasing number of options.

The interface is not perfect, but it's much better than the other games like this I've played.  It could use hotkeys for a few of the most common actions (like building a path), but generally, two clicks gets you to anything you want to do.

And the AI for operating the beavers DOES things. I recently played Foundation, and it was incredibly frustrating how the vast majority of the population stood around in the center and did nothing, even after they'd been given jobs.

Another place Timberborn shines is the tech path. For every building, you are told how many science points you need to unlock it, and it's quite straightforward how to get more science points. (It might not be nearly as easy as you'd like in the beginning, but what you need to do is obvious.) If there are prerequisites (which are always building materials, not other buildings), those are shown, too.

I had some concerns about the golems, but they quickly came out with a legitimate use for them. In general, the designers seem to have a decent idea of what makes a good game (something a depressing large number of games seem to lack.)",played build thing nothing game recently timberborn far ahead term enjoyabililty funny even game far finished pick goal get however please wide ever increasing number option interface perfect much better game like played could use hotkeys common action like building path generally two click get anything want ai operating beaver thing recently played foundation incredibly frustrating vast majority population stood around center nothing even given job another place timberborn shine tech path every building told many science point need unlock quite straightforward get science point might nearly easy like beginning need obvious prerequisite always building material building shown concern golem quickly came legitimate use general designer seem decent idea make good game something depressing large number game seem lack

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"I remember hearing about Cyberpunk 2077 around when it was announced. I was interested because I could tell that it would be a tough game to run - performance wise, and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Then when it came out... It was everywhere, and everyone said it sucked. It was a broken mess of a game that wasn't even finished, so I vowed to myself that I would never buy such a hunk of garbage. 

2 years later... 
I'm bored, it's a Saturday. I'm on Netflix wondering what to watch; I had watched A Silent Voice & Breaking Bad a few days earlier, they were both great in their own ways. Then, on the main screen of Netflix I see: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. I think to myself, oh it's going to just be an advertisement by one of my favorite animation studios (Studio Trigger) that got paid to make this. I was wrong, the story swept me in like a storm and I was 200% engaged in all 10 episodes. 

1 day later...
I can't stop thinking about that show, the characters, and even more that was in it. I look on YouTube to people playing some Cyberpunk 2077. ""It looks decent and actually pretty fun now,"" I said to myself. I saw on YouTube that you could get Rebecca's shotgun, David's jacket, etc. in Cyberpunk 2077 and I thought that was dope. I want this game now.

2 days later...
I see everywhere how the player count has increased to 50,000 concurrent players on Steam; just crazy, and the game was on sale at the time, right after patch/update 1.6, so at 10:15 P.M. I bought the game and sold some Counter Strike cases to pay for tax. I let it download and got on the game after I was done with everything I had to do the next day. 

Present day... 
This game is insane, I love everything about it, the details put into the game, and the constant care that CD Projekt Red has given it after the game's launch up to today & onward. They fixed their game, and made a true piece of art. I've played a lot of story-driven games in my day, but none come close to the absolute experience that this game has given me: emotionally, mentally, etc. I love this game and trust me when I say that the game is fixed now & it is my favorite game of 2022 so far. (even though it came out in 2020, patch 1.5 - 1.6 has made it a new game with all of the features and bug fixes that they've added) Also, they got over 105,000 concurrent players just a day and a half later!

Some thoughts:
This game has too much to do other than the main story and (at the time of writing this...) I've sunk almost 40 hours into it already after only 7 days. It is an open-world experience to level the fun and quality of games like: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto: V, and much more. This game is amazing and I 100% recommend buying it. 

P.S.
Also watch the anime, even if you don't like anime that much, but you like this game... It's so great and the story in both the game and the show are breathtaking. 11/10.",remember hearing cyberpunk 2077 around announced interested could tell would tough game run performance wise keanu reef came everywhere everyone said sucked broken mess game even finished vowed would never buy hunk garbage 2 year later bored saturday netflix wondering watch watched silent voice breaking bad day earlier great way main screen netflix see cyberpunk edgerunners think oh going advertisement one favorite animation studio studio trigger got paid make wrong story swept like storm 200 engaged 10 episode 1 day later stop thinking show character even look youtube people playing cyberpunk 2077 look decent actually pretty fun said saw youtube could get rebecca shotgun david jacket etc cyberpunk 2077 thought dope want game 2 day later see everywhere player count increased 50 000 concurrent player steam crazy game sale time right patch update 1 6 10 15 p bought game sold counter strike case pay tax let download got game done everything next day present day game insane love everything detail put game constant care cd projekt red given game launch today onward fixed game made true piece art played lot story driven game day none come close absolute experience game given emotionally mentally etc love game trust say game fixed favorite game 2022 far even though came 2020 patch 1 5 1 6 made new game feature bug fix added also got 105 000 concurrent player day half later thought game much main story time writing sunk almost 40 hour already 7 day open world experience level fun quality game like legend zelda breath wild grand theft auto v much game amazing 100 recommend buying p also watch anime even like anime much like game great story game show breathtaking 11 10

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"I have 766 hours in this game and have been playing it almost exclusively every evening since October 2020.  I'm hoping the developers see this review because I have a few things I keep hoping they'll adjust.

Praise: Summarily.. it's beautiful and the minutia of the game-play transports a player into that time and that existence.  Side-note to the devs.. thank you for not including corn, potatoes, or tomatoes in 9th century (?) Europe.  Well done.  Most of all, I like this game because it feels like a perfect blend of so many cats of games.. FPS, RTS, strategy, survival, etc.  At start it's completely a survival game, but every so gradually becomes more and more of an RTS game where you're managing resource production/consumption, NTC assignments based on their skills and availability, identifying deficiencies and surpluses and making administrative changes to optimize your little town's efficiency.  And I love the feeling that I'm playing what feels like an RTS game while in first person view.  I also love that each time I start a new game, I can choose anywhere on the map to set up my village.  It definitely makes each play experience different from the last.  After all this play time, I only recently discovered that choosing a flat area near a river makes for better efficiency and closer access to buildings I have to travel to, but that it also makes my town look like a Communist settlement.  So this most recent play I chose to go to the hills.  I love that there's that option in this game.

Criticism is more for the developers.  To new players I'd say get the game, but don't bother reading on..................

I'll only say one negative thing about the game, and then I'll make broad suggestions for further development.  But the negative is frankly very obvious how it's not been corrected with all these updates is mind-boggling.  The UI is terrible.  I give it a 3/10.  It's badly organized, too little info in one page view, and lacks easy access links.  For example, I would love to have one hotkey for 'buildings' and see a list of all my buildings with MAX info about who works it, what it's producing, its damage level, etc right on that first summary page.  Then I click that building, and on ONE page can change its production, workers, etc.  As it is, I have to click 'N' to bring up management tab, then I have to click again for buildings, I can't see what it's producing so then another click to open that building, then another click to see what its production priorities are.  And on that page, I have to click again to remind myself who's working there.  Bottom line, need more info on a single page and less clicking/tabbing.  With the hyperlinking.. ideally for example, I click on the barn and I can see what its producing, who works it and its condition, etc.  there I should be able to change its production, but also the worker (for example) is Beth.  I should be able to see her info, and also hyperlink her name so that I can click it and change the worker, move her to another building, etc.  Ultimately, this awkwardness with constantly changing building production and sometimes moving workers from one building to another really slows things down.  

I wanted to be descriptive in my criticism, but mean it to be productive criticism.  That is, this game is phenomenal and unique and I love it.  This is one player's opinion about how to make it even better. 

NTC politics: You deal with one merchant and gain brownie points with him/her and lose some with his rivals.  Maybe your prices with him are more favorable, but less so with his competitors.  This could be applied to quests too.  Even broader.. maybe family politics and factions?  In general, more human interaction with opinions and influence, would be awesome.

More buildings: a well (for locations you might choose which are further from water).  An apothecary when villagers become ill, with that skill, herbs to supply it, etc.  Also more items would be neat.  

Man-to-man combat: Maybe bandits, trading wagons and such.  

Day Counter: This one is a big deal to me... you show the year, season and time of day.  But I have to keep a separate MS Excel file that I use in conjunction when I play so that each time I sit down to continue my game, I know that I'm 4/6 days into the season (for example).  How much time you have to plant seeds or accept quests or not is crucial to the game-play and prioritizes what you do.  Therefore it should be included into the UI.

Road and fence building: Give the ability to make a road (or fence) which along the way can change direction rather than one linear section at a time. It would be neater-looking and easier to customize to your village layout.

If the scale of further development were to cost more time and money.. I, for one, would be willing to pay more for the game than $20.  This is easily one of the best cost-to-enjoyment games I've ever bought as it is.",766 hour game playing almost exclusively every evening since october 2020 hoping developer see review thing keep hoping adjust praise summarily beautiful minutia game play transport player time existence side note devs thank including corn potato tomato 9th century europe well done like game feel like perfect blend many cat game fps rts strategy survival etc start completely survival game every gradually becomes rts game managing resource production consumption ntc assignment based skill availability identifying deficiency surplus making administrative change optimize little town efficiency love feeling playing feel like rts game first person view also love time start new game choose anywhere map set village definitely make play experience different last play time recently discovered choosing flat area near river make better efficiency closer access building travel also make town look like communist settlement recent play chose go hill love option game criticism developer new player say get game bother reading say one negative thing game make broad suggestion development negative frankly obvious corrected update mind boggling ui terrible give 3 10 badly organized little info one page view lack easy access link example would love one hotkey building see list building max info work producing damage level etc right first summary page click building one page change production worker etc click n bring management tab click building see producing another click open building another click see production priority page click remind working bottom line need info single page le clicking tabbing hyperlinking ideally example click barn see producing work condition etc able change production also worker example beth able see info also hyperlink name click change worker move another building etc ultimately awkwardness constantly changing building production sometimes moving worker one building another really slows thing wanted descriptive criticism mean productive criticism game phenomenal unique love one player opinion make even better ntc politics deal one merchant gain brownie point lose rival maybe price favorable le competitor could applied quest even broader maybe family politics faction general human interaction opinion influence would awesome building well location might choose water apothecary villager become ill skill herb supply etc also item would neat man man combat maybe bandit trading wagon day counter one big deal show year season time day keep separate m excel file use conjunction play time sit continue game know 4 6 day season example much time plant seed accept quest crucial game play prioritizes therefore included ui road fence building give ability make road fence along way change direction rather one linear section time would neater looking easier customize village layout scale development cost time money one would willing pay game 20 easily one best cost enjoyment game ever bought

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.

There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. 

More tips:
-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. 
-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. 
-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. 
-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. 
-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. 
-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.
-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.

281990,Stellaris,"After hours of gameplay spread across two steam accounts, console edition (Which runs a modified 1.7) and a cracked version of Pre-2.0, I wanted to give out a review that tries to accomplish three things.

1. Give a pretty basic ""what to buy guide"" for people looking to purchase the game
2. Give new insight for all 2.0+ changes to any returning players who were disappointed with the new changes to the game.
3. Laydown ways to improve performance in game



[h1]""I'm a New Player. What should I buy?""[/h1]

[list]
[*]The Game on sale. It's pretty pricy and I honestly don't find the base features currently worth it. However, the game is SUPER cheap on sales and you can pick it up then. [b]Optionally[/b] if you have friends interested in 4x games or who currently own Stellaris, I'd recommend trying a multiplayer session in the game, space is always better with friends!

[*]Utopia DLC. Just like the base game, it comes super cheap when on sale due to it being older. Adds a ton of fresh mechanics in the game that makes midgame more enjoyable.

[*]Distant Stars. Before 2.2 I would have just recommended Leviathans and Distant Stars for later. With some new additions in 2.2, Distant Stars is pretty on top of Leviathans I feel and adds a big amount of mechanics for Early/Midgame.
[/list]

[b]NOTE:[/b] If you have a friend who owns Stellaris AND some of its DLCs, you can safely skip buying the DLCs all together and just do a multiplayer session with your buddy hosting. Stellaris, like other Paradox games, supports DLC Sharing in Multiplayer.

I also heavily recommend your games to be played on a Medium Galaxy. Huge/Large Galaxies are pretty overwhelming with the amount of empires and chug later in the game unless you have a strong computer. I've found Medium perfect for both performance and enjoyment, as it's the perfect size to be involved in most affairs and a good amount events have a fair chance to trigger. 

[h1]""I've just bought the game and some of its DLCs. I liked my first couple games and have been enjoying it so far. What should I buy next?""[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Leviathans. Adds some new ""boss fight"" monsters that you can take on in Midgame. Also adds a new lategame event that's pretty wack. Usually very cheap.

[*]Synthetic Dawn. Adds playable robots, which is about it really off the top of my head. Also adds some new voice advisors which is nice.

[*]Ancient Relics. Makes Early/Midgame even more spicy with new events for your science ships. Would have added it higher but due to it being a newer expansion, it won't be as cheap on sale.

[*]Apocalypse. Expensive but much cheaper than before on sale. Adds raiders, titans, world crackers and some other stuff. It sounds cool but all of this stuff either has the chance of being cool or comes at a time where it isn't cool.

[*]Megacorp. If it wasn't newer, I would have put it above Apocalypse. Prices MIGHT have changed for it on sale since it's almost a year old now but don't know really. It adds Megacorpations, which are REALLY fun in multiplayer and fun in singleplayer, along with the Slave Market, Space Vegas and other things.

[*]Plant/Human-pack. Unless you wanna play as a Space Potato/Orc/Cactus, I'd just avoid getting these. Humanoid pack does add three new advisor voices and some new remixed music of other tracks though.

[*]Galaxy Edition. Look, unless you REALLY love space spiders, don't get it at all.

[h1]""I've stopped playing since X was removed or changed. What's changed and why should I play again.""[/h1]

I myself miss some of the old 1.9 mechanics and do still prefer some of the mechanics back then. BUT, I've come to appreciate some of the changes or at least understand why they were changed for the better looking into previous versions of the game again.

So what's changed and why?

[b]2.0 Changes[/b]
[list]
[*]The most controversial I felt was to FTL Travel. Before 2.0, you could take Warp/Gateway travel for your starting form of travel instead of Hyperlane. I felt the change to unifying it to just under Hyperlane was needed with the new Galaxy Generation and the encouragement of the new claim system. It allows players not to worry about three different entry ways in their systems and just focus on one. 

[*]Starports replaced Frontiers/Planet Starports. This made influence more of a form of currency rather than monthly drain you need to spend. Starports could also be upgraded to house certain functions and were no longer limited to just being over a planet. This made border gore less of a problem I felt and made more flexible choices in planning. I do miss some of the old Planet Starport functions though.

[*]Wargoals. Before they worked... strangely. You could declare at any time and had to reach certain thresholds for demands. This meant that when an empire declared on you, you wouldn't know what you had on the line and what needed to be done. The newer system DEMANDS a goal, giving an idea for what you need to do to win/not lose. Humilation War? Don't take heavy losses. Conquer? Keep hold of the systems they demand. Ideology War? Planets are the most important thing to hold onto here.

[*]Ship builder. Did anyone really like the old ship builder? Like I missed it a little but going back and comparing it then to now makes me question the complaints about the new one a little.
[/list]

There's probably something I'm missing for 2.0 changes, but I hoped I covered the big ones here

[b]2.1 Changes[/b]
I don't remember much about what changed in 2.1. Only thing that cross my mind is the anomaly change, which I was angry about a little but understood it later how getting a Precursor to spawn literally 20 years in game and anomalies were super easy to cheese and rush.

[b]2.2 Changes[/b]
The only big negative change besides Performance/AI (which I'll dig into a bit below) was the planet/trade changes/new resources, if there was anything else changed please do tell me. 

[list]
[*]Planet: This was the change that I feel people say it's a huge downside when it's really just the Tile System but with some extra bits in it. The tiles have just been replaced with unlockable buildings at certain pop numbers and you occasionally need to build a district/house inbetween said certain numbers. Other then that it's the same thing, just need to manage two other (pretty easy) resources. 

[*]New Resources. Alloys and Consumer Goods. To give a quick rundown on what they do, alloys are the thing that build ships now, not minerals, while Consumer Goods are just spicy food tbh. Both are exactly like energy from before, you run a bit low at first but some new planning/growth/tech shoots the production up and you sudden have excess. This time you have a new galaxy market to sell your excess goods on. Speaking of Spicy Food, food itself was changed so it's more than ""I just need 1000/5000 and I get the max amount of effects"", national plentitude is the new Pop-Growth Boost and it drains your food more monthly. It's a great change tbh.

[*]Trade Routes. Oh fucking boy, this is a monster. I kinda wanted to die when I first saw trade routes, ""I have to manage my ships to patrol constantly or I lose money?!"". It seems so overwhelming at first, but you'll eventually learn a great way to manage trade routes. You'll be making sick profit AND training your admirals (Patrols do this now!) outside of wartime real quickly! Takes a few decades to get used to and everyone has their own creative methods to manage it well.

[h1]""Alright, what are these performance issues you mentioned?""[/h1]

[b]Performance/Ai[/b]. It's been noticeably poorer for some people in recent updates, ESPECIALLY at the launch of 2.2.

552990,World of Warships,"Should start by saying the ""600"" hours logged here is FAR FROM how many hours I have invested in this game. I would assume my actual play time is somewhere between 2,000-3,000 hours in total (Maybe even way more. I could be so far off on this number). I've basically unlocked the majority of T10 ships as well as a good number of freemiums and hell, I've even spent money on the game (though my wallet regrets that.)

So where do I start with this one. 

World of Warships is a game that I think everyone who plays it REALLY wants to love. Let's face it, you are in control of big boats and shooting big guns at other ships. It's a blast and mechanically the game is MOSTLY (Important here) sound. So we'll go through a quick pros and cons.

Pros:
- Art Department. I can't stress this enough. If there is one division of WG that has their stuff together it's these guys. The game looks great and the ships are AWESOME.
- The core gameplay itself. (Assuming you have a team that works together it can be pretty rewarding to set up crossfires, angle your ship correctly, have great brawling drive-bys in battleships. It's a blast when it works.)
- It's not a hard game to pick up and learn the basics. (More to note here)

Cons:
- On the note of it being a easy game to learn the basics. It's a difficult game to master. This results in some VERY poor play at higher tiers where people pay their way to get there. 
- Meta shifts. Currently the game is going through a frustrating shift where stagnant gameplay/static gameplay is becoming more commonplace. HE (High-explosive) shell spam, CV (Carriers), and the upcoming submarines all limit the ability to utilize tactics and work correctly as a team. These three things really damage the core ""tactical"" gameplay that makes the game great. 
- Balancing. Holy hell... You can look this up on the forums and see how brutal this really is. It's a lot to go over and I'm not going to fill this review with it. The balancing is bad and is only set to get worse. (Tip: Look up Carrier Rework, Smolensk, Colbert, Russian Battleships, Russian Heavy Cruisers, Stalingrad, SAP...) Yeah, there is a lot here. Some has been somewhat fixed but a lot is still problematic and this is parasitic mess that isn't being solved faster than it's being expanded.
- Cash Shop. Yeah. ""Free to play game."" But not really. If you play this game without spending money you are in for the grind of your life. It'll be frustrating and at higher tiers you won't break even on credit loss as high-tier ships cost more. Everything costs money - not just a little bit either... Premium time, Ships, Converting XP, Buying Doubloons, Buying Credits, yadayadayada. There is a lot of monetization in this game and it's REALLY important for people to be aware of this before jumping in.
- Probably the BIGGEST con of this game is Wargamings disconnect from the playerbase. This game could be great if WG would sit down and listen to some of the playerbase and actually consider their opinion. Recently they had a QNA on their discord which ended up being more of a ""Ask us questions so we can tell you to piss off."" This, unfortunately, sums up most of the interaction with WG and their staff. It's a dodgy company with horrible public relations.
- A lot of fantasy ships. Some of which aren't what really need to be added to the game. This goes back to balancing and WG's disconnect. (Looking at you USN Split BB's and Smolensk. WG just doesn't want to listen.)
- Competitive is absolutely dead and the rewards aren't worth the pain of taking part. 
- EDIT (Dec 5th 2020) Figured I should add this to the CONS since it's a pretty big deal! Basically this years Christmas Containers (And 2018/2019) have a shortlist of ships you will ALWAYS get. Problem is, WG advertises it as if you can get ANY of the 107 premiums when in actuality you can only get a handful of ships. I'm not going to explain this in detail, instead I insist you go to the forum post below and look this up. It's VERY scummy since this actually takes advantage of people's wallet WHILE being COMPLETE false advertisement.

And below one of WoWS larger Community Contributors testing this himself and basically proving it in the video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hyuejlhsts


I'm sure I could add a lot more to these lists. Especially on the cons side. But ultimately what is pushing me from the game is just how disconnected Wargaming is and that's really the core of all the things listed in the CONS. This game could be fantastic and I REALLY want it to be fantastic, but I just don't see that happening with WG at the helm.

I have a hard time recommending this game in the current state. If this was three years ago it would be a different story. It's just gone so downhill and the quality of the gameplay has grown really stale.",start saying 600 hour logged far many hour invested game would assume actual play time somewhere 2 000 3 000 hour total maybe even way could far number basically unlocked majority t10 ship well good number freemiums hell even spent money game though wallet regret start one world warship game think everyone play really want love let face control big boat shooting big gun ship blast mechanically game mostly important sound go quick pro con pro art department stress enough one division wg stuff together guy game look great ship awesome core gameplay assuming team work together pretty rewarding set crossfire angle ship correctly great brawling drive bys battleship blast work hard game pick learn basic note con note easy game learn basic difficult game master result poor play higher tier people pay way get meta shift currently game going frustrating shift stagnant gameplay static gameplay becoming commonplace high explosive shell spam cv carrier upcoming submarine limit ability utilize tactic work correctly team three thing really damage core tactical gameplay make game great balancing holy hell look forum see brutal really lot go going fill review balancing bad set get worse tip look carrier rework smolensk colbert russian battleship russian heavy cruiser stalingrad sap yeah lot somewhat fixed lot still problematic parasitic mess solved faster expanded cash shop yeah free play game really play game without spending money grind life frustrating higher tier break even credit loss high tier ship cost everything cost money little bit either premium time ship converting xp buying doubloon buying credit yadayadayada lot monetization game really important people aware jumping probably biggest con game wargamings disconnect playerbase game could great wg would sit listen playerbase actually consider opinion recently qna discord ended ask u question tell piss unfortunately sum interaction wg staff dodgy company horrible public relation lot fantasy ship really need added game go back balancing wg disconnect looking usn split bb smolensk wg want listen competitive absolutely dead reward worth pain taking part edit dec 5th 2020 figured add con since pretty big deal basically year christmas container 2018 2019 shortlist ship always get problem wg advertises get 107 premium actuality get handful ship going explain detail instead insist go forum post look scummy since actually take advantage people wallet complete false advertisement http www reddit com r worldofwarships comment k6ivy5 how_wg_chooses_your_santa_gift_ship_and_why_you one wow larger community contributor testing basically proving video http www youtube com watch v hyuejlhsts sure could add lot list especially con side ultimately pushing game disconnected wargaming really core thing listed con game could fantastic really want fantastic see happening wg helm hard time recommending game current state three year ago would different story gone downhill quality gameplay grown really stale

1190000,Car Mechanic Simulator 2021,"CMS 2021 is decent enough at what it does. It's more of a ""replace this rusty part sim"" than a true mechanic simulator. I've played CMS since 2015 and while it has gotten more in depth since, it's also still very lightweight compared to what mechanic work in real life is.  This game is useful for teaching you WHERE parts are but the procedures for removing them are generally wrong. While cars are just nuts and bolts, there's more to it than just removing and replacing.  For instance, if you ever have to replace a cam, you will NEVER use the old cam caps, (and 99% of the time, a tapping from the valve train doesn't require cam replacement) You wont change just one spark plug, you wont replace a caliper but re-use and old caliper piston, 
replacing subframe bushings are a lot more involved than just removing a bolt.  As a real life technician, feel free to use CMS as a light learning experience but please do not take this game as 100% true as doing things IRL the way you do in game WILL cause major problems with your car.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Well after reaching Pirate Legend and Athena's fortune Champion titles,
I'm finally able to make a review of this game, I hope it will help you decide if this game is worth it! I'll probably update this review the further I play. For now I'll be talkin about the [b]Adventure mode[/b] :)

Pros :
-Cool graphics and simulation of a pirate life.
-It's a game where you either get addicted or hate it in the first hours.
-Funnier with friends or randoms, but you'll learn so much faster in solo trust me.
-Satisfying sensation when you sink ennemies boats and grab their loot.
-Good game if you want to chill and kill time (but sometimes it can be stressful especially if you have a lot of loots and you're getting focused by a reaper or red flag emissaries).
-Active developer team (monthly updates, quick reactivity on problems in-game through their tweeter, so I would recommend to follow them there to not miss a thing and to always be aware of what's happening).
-A lot to experience, Stories, PVP, Fishing, Treasure Hunting, defeating Skeletons, world events, Seasonal events, Shipfight, collecting all achievements, and laugh with strangers :D

Cons:
-Intensive grind.
-Boring after a while.
-Lack of content eventhough it was way worse back when it came out in 2018.
-FPS optimization is a joke on islands (At full ultra I go from 120fps to 55 fps on big islands).
-PVP mechanic is old and boring (idk maybe they need to add some new guns or mechanics).
-Bugs after new updates are not even a surprise anymore.
-Servers issues is normal and the community is used to it (so an advice would be to never do an event the day it comes out because you probably won't receive your loot's coins, XP and achievements).
-Some events are only visible on their website and not in-game so sometimes you can miss them (Just stop it, we are lazy and hate to go through google to see our fck in-game event progression, just put it in game already ffs it's 2020).

Overall the game has a lot of problems but I still love the concept it does represent otherwise I wouldn't have reach one of the highest titles you can earn and I hope this game will continue to get the support it deserves. I haven't played such a great game in a while, so if you like intensive farming, bugs, coop and pvp but also the big map you're in the right place. We'll be waiting for you on the ocean :)

PS: If you're a veteran please help new players and don't bully them, that's what I do and I would have loved to be helped too when I started, so please do so they will always remember you, thanks fellow Legends.



[h1]Edit 1:[/h1]
So after 3 months, the game is still awesome, probably one of the best open world in multiplayer that I've played in a while. Nothing better but to fish with friends during late nights.



[h1]Edit 2:[/h1]
They finally added an Even tab in-game! Anyway I've been playing [b]Arena[/b], joined a competitive team and reached Legendary Sea Dog. So the Arena mode is way different from the actual game (adventure). It also have its pros and cons so here we go :

For the positive aspects :
- Helps you improve cannon shots
- Helps you improve your weapon accuracy
- TDM (Team deathmatch) is a lot of fun! It's like the endgame community event in the Arena
- You can make friends in this mode
- Since the last Arena patch, there's only one chest now and it's way better than before

Some negative aspects :
- Hitregs (When you hit players usually with weapons and you have the hitmarker but the server didn't register the damage, so sometimes you'll need to hit 3-4 time the player before he dies, and sometimes you may think they're cheater)
- Lobby waiting time : because the Arena mode is not the main mode, the playerbase is not that big here, so you might wait 10-30min in the worst case...
- Server region merge : Yeah well sometimes there's no server in EU (in my exemple) at certain hours and I usually get matched with NA players and I have an average of 200-250ms
- FPS optimization (Even on High-End PC you'll probably struggle to maintain a stable 144fps



[h1]Edit 3:[/h1]
They removed their own game mode called Arena. I don't know if it would now be an interesting game for pirate that love to pvp...
Quite a sad day for Sea of Thieves...



[h1]Edit 4:[/h1]
They added an alternative to the Arena inside of the Adventure mode!
Which means that you can now activate a totem on your boat which will transport you against another equivalent ship. Basically a great thing for the pvp community! Not tom mention you can customize your own ship, name it how you want, and even create or joind a Guild!

At the current state, I would seriously recommend this game to every gamers wanting to experience some adventure in the pirate world. In 2023 there is a lot of things to do, explore, farm, fight, collect and stories to experiences which are really amazing.

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"As a so-called 'AA-game' (indie scope and AAA presentation), [i]Hellblade[/i] is worthy of your attention and support already. Personally, I'm very much in favour of seeing more games of this type appearing. It's creatively daring for the budget and meaningful.

That said, [i]Hellblade[/i] is not without flaws.

[h1]PRESENTATION[/h1]
Just stunning. Incredible visuals, acting, and voice acting support impressive visual design, as well as the story itself. There are voices in Senua's head, and you have to constantly listen to them. And they're useful, too, giving you hints about puzzles and fights. The cutscenes are a sight to behold and make incredible use of lighting and interesting transitions.

The game also plays heavily with pareidolia, filling its surroundings with [i]The Witness[/i]-like puzzles, but this side is... well.

[h1]DESIGN[/h1]
You've got to give it to the developer: they've clearly put a lot of though and effort into creating thematic gameplay. Apart from slasher fights (not even that abundant) and bosses, you get a bunch of various puzzles and tasks. Some of them are good (like the whole Valravn's path, the masks puzzle, or the trial where you go blind and have to follow sounds and controller motion). Others are less inspired, and the ones that make you look for shapes in your surrounding are... well.

Let's just say it's not [i]The Witness[/i].

What's worse, however, is how slow and clunky Senua's movement is. It fits the story thematically, but since trial and error take an enormous amount of boring slow backtracking, the puzzles end up very primitive and are more about busywork than the player's wit.

And some sections were simply weird. What was the point of moving across ledges? Not planks that you can fall down from, but ledges—that slow you down, show a different animation, and create artificial tension, but actually pose no danger and are, as far as I could tell, impossible to fail? That's plain bad and misleading design.

Another issue is, since [i]Hellblade[/i] is a theme park ride game, it changes the type of challenge often, providing unique sections... while sometimes completely failing to explain what you have to do (I'm looking at you, chasing-fire-giant maze). Thank god the whole permadeath thing is a lie.

The fights, on the other hand, are fun, and I was always happy to see one start.

[h1]STORY[/h1]
The core idea of [i]Hellblade[/i] is great: a gruesome, gritty mythical journey that serves as a metaphor for a person fighting mental illness, both educating the player and making them sympathize with her. And it is for the most part a success, poignant and brilliantly mixing the mythical horrors and psychological pain.

Unfortunately, in the end the game runs it into the ground. When Senua tearfully cried that she is cursed and her darkness is consuming everything for the tenth time, I felt annoyance instead of empathy. I'd argue that they shouldn't have shown Dillion so much, because he becomes syrupy—a Perfectly Supportive Partner That Never Gets Angry or Frustrated or Anything. The whole parents plot was also slightly more convoluted than necessary; it's not like I cared about Senua's mother all that much, and then I get not one, but [i]two[/i] different explanations of her death in quick succession? Was that really the only way to tell this story?

Still, while there may be a lot of it, it's all just nitpicking. [i]Hellblade[/i] is undeniably beautiful, good at evoking emotions, daring, and generally worth experiencing by most people.

I genuinely hope there are more games like it in the future.",called aa game indie scope aaa presentation hellblade worthy attention support already personally much favour seeing game type appearing creatively daring budget meaningful said hellblade without flaw h1 presentation h1 stunning incredible visuals acting voice acting support impressive visual design well story voice senua head constantly listen useful giving hint puzzle fight cutscenes sight behold make incredible use lighting interesting transition game also play heavily pareidolia filling surroundings witness like puzzle side well h1 design h1 got give developer clearly put lot though effort creating thematic gameplay apart slasher fight even abundant boss get bunch various puzzle task good like whole valravn path mask puzzle trial go blind follow sound controller motion others le inspired one make look shape surrounding well let say witness worse however slow clunky senua movement fit story thematically since trial error take enormous amount boring slow backtracking puzzle end primitive busywork player wit section simply weird point moving across ledge plank fall ledge slow show different animation create artificial tension actually pose danger far could tell impossible fail plain bad misleading design another issue since hellblade theme park ride game change type challenge often providing unique section sometimes completely failing explain looking chasing fire giant maze thank god whole permadeath thing lie fight hand fun always happy see one start h1 story h1 core idea hellblade great gruesome gritty mythical journey serf metaphor person fighting mental illness educating player making sympathize part success poignant brilliantly mixing mythical horror psychological pain unfortunately end game run ground senua tearfully cried cursed darkness consuming everything tenth time felt annoyance instead empathy argue shown dillion much becomes syrupy perfectly supportive partner never get angry frustrated anything whole parent plot also slightly convoluted necessary like cared senua mother much get one two different explanation death quick succession really way tell story still may lot nitpicking hellblade undeniably beautiful good evoking emotion daring generally worth experiencing people genuinely hope game like future
294100,RimWorld,"I've been fiddling around with challenging game modes rather than the stock three. So I began a game with absolutely nothing other than the starting colonist, no food, no weapon, no silver. I've then opted then to go for a mountainous region cause it's easier to defend from attackers.

This is where things get interesting, normally what happens now is you get to choose your colonist. I thought ""Right, i want a good miner, someone who can farm relatively well and I guess a good fighter to start off with"". Off I go cycling through the colonists where I stumble upon Patrice. Patrice was shit at everything, I'm talking zero's, one's and two's across the board, with the exception of Art which was seven and Social which was bloody eighteen.

I thought to myself, how the hell does she have such a high social skill so I read her backstory. Now Patrice was just twenty years old, very young but she had done so much. Patrice wanted to sing for everybody, luckily for her, Dad was the CEO of an interplanetary corporation and set her up as a Childhood Idol. Patrice sang her poor heart out for everybody and made her parents proud. Until her mum died, dad was beside himself, lost in his thoughts, Patrice at this stage was developing into a woman and 'offered' herself to dad as a replacement for mum which he accepted....

The shenanighans went on until the corporation executives discovered Patrice and dad's secret and gave dad an ultimatum, ""Give us your daughter or we go public with what's been happening between you two, ruining both your lives in the process"". Dad agreed and sent poor Patrice away.

The executives kept Patrice in an orbital station on the galactic fringes far away from daddy, where they used Patrice for a new kind of job, if you know what I mean, say hello to Patrice's adult background Pornographic Idol. Yes you read that correctly, Patrice was now sold into sexual slavery. But it wasn't all that bad, she wasn't a typical 'whore' as it where, more like a Companion from Firefly where she selected her clients. She became very popular amongst the nobility of the region. Attended balls and had a cult following, much like her childhood.

I thought to myself ""Holy crap Batman WTF did I just read?"". This story was absolutely nuts, I had to try to help Patrice live a better life. Off we went to Patrice's new home. I'm assuming at this stage she's been rescued by some unknown benefactor. Anyway, Patric lands right in the centre of a small clearing surrounded by mountain with only one opening and fertile land within that area too. ""Score!!"" I thought as I got her to work setting up a shelter, bed and torch. Bloody hell wasn't this a task for her? It took two days to complete this menial task but together we persevered. Eventually she completed this task cutting down a dozen trees in the process and skilling up two levels in construction.

Then the feral rabbit came knocking, ""Crap"" I had to get her to safety, fortunately this rabbit tired itself rather quickly and left Patrice alone after it slept. I got Patrice to fashion herself a club to use and just in the nick of time, well I say nick of time but it took her a whole day to get this done too. At this stage she hasn't even gotten to setting up a farm, luckily there are heaps of wild berries around.

A visitor arrives and Patrice says hi but she has no goods to sell so they leave in a hurry, as they are leaving sirens roar as we're under attack. The attacker has a shiv, loves to fight and has eight skill. ""We're finished"" I think as the attacker runs down towards the village but attacks the visitor, the visitor manages to put a solid slug into the attacker but is killed in the process. The attacker is wounded but proceeds to move towards Patrice, I order Patrice to stay behind the door ready with her club. The attacker busts the door down and charges in but after suffering from blood loss Patrice is able to knock him out with a single swing from her club.

Patrice locks him up in her room after fixing the door and manages to stop the bleeding thanks to some bandages the visitor had. Then I got to see Patrice do what she did best, talk to people. You see what normally happens is these attackers are hard as nails to recruit to your village, with some taking days and even seasons before joining your community, Patrice didn't even need food to entice him, as soon as she walked into the room he instantly switched sides and became Patrice's bitch. 

Patrice was a God amongst men as she began her new dynasty, Patrice settled into her new roles as town artist and socialite, while minion one got to work erecting a wall, finishing some farmland and contructing a kitchen and dining room for Patrice to enjoy, all in a day's work as it were.

Patrice gathered up the supplies the visitor 'donated' equiping herself with a rifle in the process and set to work skilling up. It was like a switch was flicked, now she had a minion to dominate she finished everything with precision and haste. She developed a taste in gardening as the minion went to work digging out the tunnels, constructing two cells for conversation duties and completing a new throne room and Queen's chambers for Patrice.

This is where the story of Patrice ends..... for now... I'm actually looking forward to resuming the tale of Patrice.

Rimworld can be full of trash, normally I would look purely at the stats of a character to pick them for me but Patrice has changed my attitude here, now I look at the stories these colonists have as the main driving factor in selecting them.

Edit: Just getting my point for a review, listing Rimworld for GOTY

But then, as you explore more and more of the map and secure yourself... Things just kinda stagnate.

Not in this game.

648800,Raft,"[h1]Raft Review[/h1]
Don't feel like reading the whole thing? 
Down at the bottom is the conclusion and score given to the game! :)

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
If being chased by a Shark named Bruce while hoarding all the trash in the ocean sounds fun, it is because it is at least once you go over the initial tedious hours. Raft is a survival game in which, rather than fight zombies or demons, you have to deal with...a lot of water, aka the ocean. Discover the story left behind as you explore uncharted seas.

[h1]Control and Map Design[/h1]
Raft plays out in a way that can be praised and criticized simultaneously. It gives freedom in approaching base creation and exploring the islands it features, resulting in a good experience in the long run. However, it has some design choices that can leave it feeling rather tedious and damage the game's pace.

For example, exploring an island is always thrilling; players must move around the land while keeping tabs on their Raft. Otherwise, they could lose it. Animals on land can be dangerous but offer a good amount of food for the long term, making them an attractive high-risk, high-reward hunt. Likewise, expanding the Raft is rewarding, too, as the player can grow crops, upgrade their items and, most importantly, have a comfortable space to move around.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2987956821

Conversely, the fact that certain materials can only be obtained by specific tools or that they can get monotonous in the long run hampers some of the possibilities Raft looks to offer. Islands start to look and feel the same, while the Progression of the Raft can be determined by how many players are playing. One to two players can result in dull, slow growth in contrast to four to eight players, which makes the grinding of materials more bearable.

[h1] Strong Points[/h1]
The strong point of Raft is that the game visuals are mesmerizing, while the gameplay can be engaging if done right. It is a game that is both challenging and fun, where most troubles have a temporal solution rather than a permanent one until you reach a certain point. The ocean looks beautiful and comes alive as waves threaten to swallow your Raft or put you in reach of the shark to bite.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2987957250

Fighting the shark on itself offers some degree of ingenuity regarding gameplay. One player can distract it while other attacks or timing attacks correctly on certain sections can stop the shark mid-attack. If confrontation is not your forte, you can use shark bait to get rid of the shark for a while. These options in dealing with problems allow a good amount of freedom for the player to consider their approach to situations.

[h1] Art Design and Visuals [/h1]
The visuals of Raft are excellent, with the ocean looking vibrant both from the outside and the inside. The islands offer ecosystems on land and sea, as numerous animals live in both areas. You can find giant birds throwing rocks at you or a group of fish to collect. It is not the most pretty game out there, but it indeed commits to making the aspect of being stranded in a Raft appealing visually.

[h1]Sound, Replayability and Performance[/h1]
There is no voice acting, nor does the narrative demand lengthy sessions. Raft is all about making your own story of survival, and the sound effects are solid. Rain, waves, and water movement all have a noise that immerses you more, and I found my experience at best during solid tides in the deepest part of the ocean. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2987957514

Replayability-wise, the game is as infinite as you want to play it. Rather than being a game you replay after beating it, however, this title seems more in line with having a long run on a server. If the player desires, there is a narrative to follow, but there is enough room to make gigantic constructions on the water so that the Raft looks more like a city.

 My specs are RTX 2060, 36 GB of ram, Intel Core i7-11700K - Core i7 11th Gen Rocket Lake 8-Core 3.6 GHz LGA 1200. on High settings, the FPS was between 60 to 90 at all times.

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
Raft is a beautiful survival game that, while at times can feel like an unfinished beta of sorts, adds something unique to the survival genre. Fight the ocean as you look to survive being stranded, lack of food or water, or being eaten by sharks! I recommend the game if you enjoy survival games and have at least three other friends to play with.

8/10  GREAT

236390,War Thunder,"I didn't want to leave a negative review, but Gaijin's blatant contempt for their own players has forced my hand.

War Thunder is a game like no other, with a comprehensive damage system, combined arms, and variety of beautifully modeled tanks, aircraft and ships. 

Unfortunately, this ""uniqueness"" has left Gaijin with little real competition over the years. What started off as a ""free to play"" title has over time become less and less free. Gaijin keeps adding nations and vehicles, while at the same time increasing repair costs and lowering RP/SL gain. A premium account isn't enough to comfortably progress anymore, now you also have to buy premium vehicles in every nation.

For the new players reading this, Gaijin has recently admitted that they balance free vehicles around a negative SL income for average players. That means they WANT you to lose money by playing, so you'll be forced to buy a top tier premium vehicle.

This isn't just greedy, it also destroys the matchmaker and the balance of the game. Since you only profit using premium vehicles they often end up being spammed. In battlerating 8.7, more than half the players on each team are in premium tanks. This results in rampant ""one death leaving"". These players only spawn their premium tank and leave when it's destroyed, leaving their team in a bad position. Sometimes the premium is their only tank for the tier, othertimes it's because ""free"" tanks aren't worth the high cost to repair.

Gaijin and their purposefully frustrating economy is ultimately to blame for this. There's so many other issues and scandals I could bring up, like how you can't repair or extinguish flames on your new tank before unlocking ""parts"" and ""FPE"". Gaijin wants you to pay gold to skip the grind for these essential tools.

In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. That might seem hypocritical considering my hours spent in this game, but believe me. It's new players who suffer the most. Gaijin doesn't care about me, you, or the playerbase. Don't make the same mistake as me. Find another game that values your input, and respects your time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit, July 26: 

Much has happened since May and the publishing of this review.

Most importantly, on 13th of June, Gaijin published a roadmap of planned economy changes. 

Most recent roadmap update as of this edit: https://warthunder.com/en/news/8374-roadmap-following-the-roadmap-battle-pass-available-in-simulator-battles-en

This was an unprecedented event, as we have never seen this much transparency from the Devs before.

Despite tempered expecations and a healthy dose of skepticism on the part of myself and many others, the roadmap is actually progressing according to schedule.

One of the key criticisms in my review, that of SL (Silver Lions) has been (largely) adressed, earnings were increased across the board, and repair costs adjusted.

All ground vehicles now have a basic version of Parts and FPE available from the start without needing to unlock the Parts and FPE modifications: basic parts can repair components to partial functionality, while basic FPE is single-use.

Aircraft with countermeasures now start with a basic flare loadout, while mixed / full countermeasure loadouts require unlocking the flare modification.

You no longer have to pay repair cost when teamkilled (finally), and newly purchased premium vehicles now include 15 free backups (extra spawns). 

Backups are a consumable however, and as such it doesn't fully alleviate the ""one death leaving"" issue, as players will quickly spend their 15 backups and continue this behavior after. Gaijin needs to consider making the backup permament.

I don't mean to diminish these changes, they were sorely needed, but there's still a long way to go.

As of today, no changes have been made to RP (Research Point) gain, which is the main cause for slow progression, especially in Ground Forces Mode.

The matchmaking system desperately needs a major overhaul, and battle ratings need to be decompressed. While matchmaking changes are mentioned in the roadmap, it remains to be seen how Gaijin chooses to handle this issue.

All in all, while the changes are positive so far and show a lot of promise going forward, my review will stay unchanged until the roadmap is concluded, and the full effects can be seen.

Lastly I want to thank you all so much for your attention and gracious awards! Thanks to you I have amassed just over 2.5 Million Steam Points! That's mind-boggling, I could've never anticipated this much engagement writing my little review back in May.

Yes, this game was pretty bad before the free update. They knew that no one would like the paid subscription and so they finally made it free (after initial purchase).

This game is a MUST HAVE for Elder Scrolls fans, and players who want a ""new"" type of MMO.

PROS:
+ Good Combat System, No turn taking, and no point and spam keys.
+ No ""Grab this, kill ten of these"" Quests are INTERESTING AND FUN.
+ Lore is great, I really get immersed in this game.
+ NOT PAY TO WIN.
+ GOOD ECONOMY. I can buy iron ore 12g in one area and sell it to another player 15g in a different area.
Also no Crowns for Gold, So rich people cant mess up the economy.
+ Decisions affect gameplay.
+ Feels like a single player game, plays like an MMO.
+ First person, third person, and birds eye veiw for all players and preferences.
+ Amazing soundtrack.
+ No paid subscription.
+ No lowkey *BUY OUR STUFF PLZ* (ex. Guild wars 2 chest drops and keys.)
+ Quick and fast customer support.
+ PvP is very fun. Destroying forts with siege equipment is a blast.

Cons:
- Character creator is absolute trash. needs WAY more hairstyles and body mods.
- Must do quests to level up. Grinding takes forever.
- Needs more classes besides 4 basic ones.
- Needs more spells.
- Wish it had more of a ""I am me"" feel. 
- Shopkeepers will give you 1 gold for items that took your FOREVER to get.

The good outweighs the bad TREMENDOUSLY. Buy this game, have fun and recommend it! Lets get this to overwhelmingly positive like it deserves.


***EDIT***

After playing for some time, I started to play with a friend. We started two new characters and were going to complete quests together.

The group questing needs some major improvements.

Suggestions to the Developers:

+Add need/greed system
+If I complete an objective, my partner should NOT have to complete that same objective.
+Players should have a ""Waiting for buddy"" before going to next area/ talking to an NPC.
+Players should be able to teleport to buddy, their exact location if they become to far apart.
+Players should be able to ""duel"" friends or other players.",negative review tamriel unlimited yes game pretty bad free update knew one would like paid subscription finally made free initial purchase game must elder scroll fan player want new type mmo pro good combat system turn taking point spam key grab kill ten quest interesting fun lore great really get immersed game pay win good economy buy iron ore 12g one area sell another player 15g different area also crown gold rich people cant mess economy decision affect gameplay feel like single player game play like mmo first person third person bird eye veiw player preference amazing soundtrack paid subscription lowkey buy stuff plz ex guild war 2 chest drop key quick fast customer support pvp fun destroying fort siege equipment blast con character creator absolute trash need way hairstyle body mod must quest level grinding take forever need class besides 4 basic one need spell wish feel shopkeeper give 1 gold item took forever get good outweighs bad tremendously buy game fun recommend let get overwhelmingly positive like deserves edit playing time started play friend started two new character going complete quest together group questing need major improvement suggestion developer add need greed system complete objective partner complete objective player waiting buddy going next area talking npc player able teleport buddy exact location become far apart player able duel friend player

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"After 2 years and 2,200 hours of gameplay, I was Permanently Banned from PUBG without any reasoning provided. I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.

This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd. 

I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.

My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"This is a review from a new player aimed at new players.

I played ESO back in 2014 during the beta and didn't like it. I was expecting Skyrim online and it didn't qualify so I lost interest very quick.

Fast forward to april 2018, after years spent on Dark Souls, Dragon's Dogma, Rocket League and others ... Me and my buddies are looking for a game to play together like in the good old days. We're all dads with families now and there's no way we can get back to grinding like we used to (no pun intended).

I remember ESO and wonder how it's doing. People are talking about the One Tamriel update. I start a thread on Reddit asking if it's casual friendly, and everyone assures me that it very much is. Might be worth a shot so me and my buddies decide to give it a try.

ESO still isn't Skyrim Online, and won't ever be. The logistics of a MMO don't really allow the atmospheric beauty and complexity of a game like Skyrim. It is however way deeper in lore and atmosphere than any MMO I ever played, and you can tell great care is taken into making the world of Tamriel feel alive and breathing as much as can be. Every NPCs are voiced and side quests are literally everywhere. Many of them feel generic after a while, but some are actually really clever and well written. The world is absolutely humongous and very varied, with there again great care paid to respecting the Elder Scrolls lore. Long time ES players will appreciate the numerous references to stories and characters they already know well.

Graphics are pretty great for a MMO as well. I run it maxed out and lighting effects are downright gorgeous in some places. Art direction is consistent and while some places feel a little rushed, others surprise you with high levels of details. Riding from city to city through woods and moors, across deserts and sea shores, you always feel immersed in the world as should be. They also keep improving as the latest chapter, Summerset, is more beautiful and detailed than ever before.

Gameplay is one of the things that surprised me the most as I wasn't expecting it to be so fast paced. Fighting takes skills and strategy and you do need to learn to get better to earn victory, as opposed to simply leveling and spamming skills like it's sometimes the case in similar games. Me and my buddies have progressed steadily and we find ourselves beating dungeons we never thought we could beat before, and not just because we leveled up but because we learned to work better as a team. It's a very satisfactory feeling that the game encourages.

Classes are varied and skill lines designed to make you enjoy a high level of freedom in gameplay. I run a Magicka Templar, and designed my character so I can switch from DPS to Tank or Healer or a mix of both when I play with my friends without much of a hassle. I'll never be as performing as someone who would 100% specialize in either of these roles, but I would say that for once hybrid builds are absolutely do-able in this game, which is very rarely true in MMOs.

One thing responsible for us enjoying the game so much is the famed One Tamriel update. It basically removed level walls from the world and introduced a scaling system on the world map. It basically means that from level 1 to 50, you will adjust to monsters on the world map and normal delves to a beatable level. It does remove true challenge from these areas, but also allows you to roam the world freely to explore as you wish, which is a worthy trade in my opinion as it allows new players to be free to discover this enormous world like they were on an actual adventure. There are also no limits for partying with friends, so you don't need to worry about overleveling when you play on your own. While it could take from the satisfying experience of leveling up in early levels, the very flexible skill system feels like enough of a reward to keep it interesting.

World Bosses, Dungeons and Trials aren't scaled, and that's where the challenge begins. Each dungeon has several levels of difficulty and we have been steadily progressing through them in our 2 months of playing. Boss battles require strategy and analyzing the mechanics and can be quite epic. Sometimes you just don't have the required level or gears, but sometimes you just have to keep trying to get better. We have beaten many bosses we thought we would never beat on our first couple tries.

Past level 50, you start getting Champion Points, to a maximum of 750. They allow you to keep enhancing your character slowly and end up making quite a difference in the long run. As you get stronger, you'll be able to complete more difficult dungeons, which grant better gears. This is really clever design, as the game never feels like a grind in the traditional MMO sense, but instead more of renewed challenges. So far it has kept it's freshness to us.

The lack of ""grindy"" feeling is really something I want to emphasize on, as it's what's been preventing me from playing MMOs for so long. In my 2 months of playing I never felt myself even having the desire of grinding for levels or gears. I had fun doing quests on my own and playing with my friends, and my character naturally improved by doing so. We are still a long, long way from reaching end game content, and are in no hurry. From my experience, this is quite a feat to accomplish this feeling in a genre that is most often grindy by definition.

On the negative side, I would say that the game can sometimes feel a little bland, but then again it's a MMO and Skyrim, Dark Souls, Witcher III and the likes have spoiled us in recent years. Quests can feel generic and repetitive but you also don't need to do 80% of them.

The monthly subscription is by no mean necessary but access to all DLCs and their dungeons is quite pricey (and free if you subscribe). The bottomless crafting bag you get with the subscription is also pretty mandatory if you want to craft efficiently, and then again it isn't a necessity as you can resell materials instead of holding on to them and ask players to craft for you.

Crown store is mostly cosmetics or a shortcut to things you can buy with ingame currencies like skill respecs and the likes.

All in all, the game we were looking for at the right time for us. I highly recommend it if you are also looking for a similar chill, friendly experience in the Elder Scrolls universe.

ps: my hours logged have been greatly augmented by leaving the launcher opened all day on numerous occasions.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"(This review is mostly about the recent update 14 and the acquisition of the Hell Let Loose brand by Team17, and it may change over time based on future updates and insights.)

Black Matter, the former developer, has crafted something truly unique in the gaming market with Hell Let Loose, setting it apart from other games with its distinctiveness, tactical elements, and deliberate, slow-paced gameplay.

The former developers had a vision that they expanded over time through numerous changes and improvements. Although the game gradually shifted from its original Kickstarter vision to a more ""arcadish""-style shooter and had to sacrifice some historical authenticity for balance reasons, Hell Let Loose remained a passion project by Black Matter, with its unique charm and great attention to detail. Black Matter had also the reputation to maintained a close relationship with the community. This endeared Hell Let Loose to many longtime players who loved and shared the game.

Since the acquisition by Team17 and the release of the recent Update 14, noticeable changes have taken place in Hell Let Loose. These changes have sparked intense debates about the game's future and the direction that Team17 intends to steer Hell Let Loose towards.

Issues began to arise shortly after Team17 took over with the 13.5 ""health"" update. This update not only introduced questionable and unwanted design changes and animation replacements, which the community considered not only worse than the previous one but also unnecessary and low priority and also brought persistent bugs that could have been identified, avoided, and resolved through intense testing before launch.

The recently released Update 14 and the lack of a testing phase prior to its implementation is already demonstrating noticeable impact:

- During the beta stage, Black Matter made an adjustment to the sprint speed in order to balance the game flow and prevent what is commonly referred to as ""Zig-Zagging"" or ""Mosquito"" movements. The game does not feature an inertia or stamina system, enabling players to sprint indefinitely. The previous developer opposed the implementation of such a system and instead opted to adjust the speed as a compromise.

The re-implemented higher sprint speed with this update (which is also higher than the beta speed as many already figured out) not only reintroduces the ""Zig-Zagging"" Issue. 
The game has also evolved around the adjusted sprinting speed, which brings additional issues to other aspects in the game that still operate at different pace and were adjusted in response to it, such as vehicles, tanks, spawns, and certain weapon types. 

Now, for example, it is possible to catch up to a medium tank that is in its highest gear and traveling at maximum speed, all while continuously sprinting.

All these aspects should logically be upscaled for balance reasons, but remained untouched by Team17, which could have been avoided through an intensive testing phase before launch.
There were also no information given by Team17 regarding why this change was implemented or considered priority.

- The current repetitive spamming and exploiting of the new dive-to-prone in mid-animation (dolphin dive) introduces questionable movement into the game. These techniques not only provide unfair advantages but also feel completely out of place.

The update also raises questions about its design choices and appears to be poorly shaped and optimized, to name a few examples:

- The new British weapons exhibit noticeable weapon sway during side-to-side movement and have bulky sights that obstruct a significant portion of the vision. This implementation is completely unique and only occurs with British weapons; it does not happen in such extent on any of the German, American, or Soviet weapons, as they were implemented under Black Matter and feels completely inappropriate and inconsistence in the game.

- According to many players, many weapons of the new British faction are historically inaccurate, something that would have been unthinkable under Black Matter's careful research and dedication to presenting the weapons and factions in the game as historically accurate as possible. 

- The driver controls of the British heavy Firefly are reminiscent of the controls of the medium Sherman prior to Update 10 (when all armor in the game was updated). It appears that Team17 used outdated code for the Firefly, neglecting to bring it up to par with the other tanks in the game. It is also possible right now to penetrate its front with a medium tank.

And again, persistent and annoying bugs:

- Incorrect amount of XP rewarded at the end of the game.
- Holding the tab key or opening the map cancels certain actions in the game.
- Overall network problems, with many players complaining about server connection losses and rubberbanding issues.

Many of the current issues raise the question of whether there was any QA prior to the release and if the new developer truly comprehends every aspect of their own game and shares the same vision as Black Matter, which has been cherished and loved by many long-time veteran players over the years.

Some decisions Team17 also made to the game deeply split the community in an extent, which I never have expierenced with any other update under the old developer Black Matter. 

Prior to Update 14/13.5, Hell Let Loose was far from being a perfect game and needed urgent optimization and adjustments, but the current state of the game introduces unnecessary additions, which not only bring new issues to the game, but should also have lower priority in comparison.

Edit: 16.07

In case someone wonders, although they announced the revert of the speed change with an upcoming update and also mentioned an overhaul of many issues with the British forces in the subsequent patch, this review will remain negative until these announcements are actually implemented.

Always remember that actions speak louder than words. 

But it was a necessary first step to make that overdue announcement in the latest dev brief.

-You can see whats to come in future updates content-wise
-Upcoming content


Cons;
Most of the Cons are due to game being early access. I am sure devs are aware everything I wrote below and will fix/add it by time.
-UI is slow (could easily be updated)
-No visible production paths unless you look up manually (we should be able to see what to research before unlocking eg. engine without checking the whole research tree.)
-Missing indications such as you need to  produce medicine but no indication which building produces medicine (it is distillery)
-Maps should be bigger.
-Need more explorers.

440,Team Fortress 2,"Well..

Ok, Ill admit, unlike other high profile folk that have more hours then me.. I have just under 2000 hours but have been playing this game for well over 10 years.. To be exact March 8th 2009. (as my badge says)

I may be a no one in the community, but I have been supporting this game since I first played. The game I would always come back to and call ""home"".

I, over the years have made friends, enemies, servers.. Learnt different modes, meta, styles, languages.. I have been through multiple events like, The Sniper vs. Spy Update, Classless Update, the big 119th updates update (no joke..) Solider vs Demoman, Scream Fortresses, Christmas updates! You get the point..

There is no sparkle to this game anymore, I cannot jump on a 118 ping New York server, late at night waiting for the Americans to get back online in the evening, me and Banksy taking on 2Fort as Demoman to kill all soliders so that the Demoman could have his own weapon? (Spolier: Solider won, welcome to the Gunboats..) Then finding out TF2 came onto Mac and people that had it, got the ear buds, that sold well.. 

To be fair, I could go on and tell my war stories, but that feeling when the family gets a new puppy and you get shut out as no one is interested in you anymore? This is exactly whats happening with TF2 (dev side).. I always check steam stats and there is always over 50k people playing, always top 10 on the chart but something is missing..

As part of the community, us loyal people that cherish this game, we are the backbone to this beautiful creation. You don't see Blizzard (well not all the time) not maintaining their beautiful creation and of course World of Warcraft is older then this.. Maybe because of the paid subscription, but I am sure that TF2 alone use to get more money as a free to play game at one point. (Jeeze I had to pay for TF2 over 10 years ago..)

I mean ok, fair play, you have a new game coming out.. whooptie doo.. Send all the cavalry towards that.. Yet instead to the people who grew up with TF2, old players and new players. People who have spent hundreds and even thousands of dollars for now a game which to me is dying.. Not the people's fault, but your own selves..
Jumping into a casual game (YOUR servers) to be greeted by not one sniper but three sniper ""bots"" that have their own way-points, spamming ""good shot mate"", aim botting, auto spamming chat so no one can see whats written as a wall of blank appears and calling no when someone votes them a ban. When there is 3 or more of them they win the no vote anyway..

When making your own stuff glitch gets patched.. finding glitches in the items_game text file gets patched.. Oh yeah I forgot that's your profits going down the drain.. But don't worry as bots and hackers are not, so were forget about it.. the game.. the people, who truly love and support this game..

Excuse the rant but for a game that still, to me at this dire moment, is still rocking the steam charts, this should be dealt with within a matter of days or weeks.. There are no new updates like the Solider vs Demoman.. The love for this game from you, just has vanished.. 

I will carry on playing as I still love this game and class this as home. But for now, don't expect me to dedicate my time or spend money on anything till this ""bot"" situation and other stupid stuff is dealt with.. and hopefully soon. With new updates that sparkle in my eyes.. And a new bloody weapon for the Demoman as I deemed the solider win was unfair. 
 
Do I recommend it to others? Oh yes, yes I do. But at the moment with the bot situation, other stupid stuff and the game at the moment being ""devless"". No.
But still download it, go onto the community servers, find a mode, map, server and enjoy. I will give it a thumbs up but really should be a thumbs down at this point of the games life.

**New Players** the first initiate is daunting, but play for fun, learn who the characters are and the history about them. I did and it got me 2000 hours, 10 years of play and a game I could call home. There are also comics about the game to if you like to read.

Good luck and thank you for the read.",well ok ill admit unlike high profile folk hour 2000 hour playing game well 10 year exact march 8th 2009 badge say may one community supporting game since first played game would always come back call home year made friend enemy server learnt different mode meta style language multiple event like sniper v spy update classless update big 119th update update joke solider v demoman scream fortress christmas update get point sparkle game anymore jump 118 ping new york server late night waiting american get back online evening banksy taking 2fort demoman kill soliders demoman could weapon spolier solider welcome gunboat finding tf2 came onto mac people got ear bud sold well fair could go tell war story feeling family get new puppy get shut one interested anymore exactly whats happening tf2 dev side always check steam stats always 50k people playing always top 10 chart something missing part community u loyal people cherish game backbone beautiful creation see blizzard well time maintaining beautiful creation course world warcraft older maybe paid subscription sure tf2 alone use get money free play game one point jeeze pay tf2 10 year ago mean ok fair play new game coming whooptie doo send cavalry towards yet instead people grew tf2 old player new player people spent hundred even thousand dollar game dying people fault self jumping casual game server greeted one sniper three sniper bot way point spamming good shot mate aim botting auto spamming chat one see whats written wall blank appears calling someone vote ban 3 win vote anyway making stuff glitch get patched finding glitch items_game text file get patched oh yeah forgot profit going drain worry bot hacker forget game people truly love support game excuse rant game still dire moment still rocking steam chart dealt within matter day week new update like solider v demoman love game vanished carry playing still love game class home expect dedicate time spend money anything till bot situation stupid stuff dealt hopefully soon new update sparkle eye new bloody weapon demoman deemed solider win unfair recommend others oh yes yes moment bot situation stupid stuff game moment devless still download go onto community server find mode map server enjoy give thumb really thumb point game life new player first initiate daunting play fun learn character history got 2000 hour 10 year play game could call home also comic game like read good luck thank read
1336490,Against the Storm,"Against the Storm isn't a game where you can build a nice little village where all of your beavers can be well fed and live in harmony. This is a game that throws challenge after challenge at you and provides you with very few ways to deal with them. The resources on each map are different, as are the buildings you have access to. In one map you might have access to a lot of sea marrow to use as fuel, in another you'll have to use a kiln to convert wood into coal. In a third you might need to set up a production line to turn meat into oil. This randomness turns the game from a simple city builder into more of a puzzle, how are you going to approach the problems facing the settlement using the resources you have at your disposal? 

Throughout the entire game there is an underlying sense of urgency; as your settlement grows, so does the storm and so does the Queen's impatience. Failing to manage these can be incredibly punishing and you'll never feel like you're in a comfortable position, only that you're staving off the inevitable just long enough to get the renown you need to win. A truly happy population is often impossible and you'll frequently have to make tough decisions to meet that goal. 

However, the more punishing the game is, the more rewarding it feels when you overcome it. Seeing the victory screen pop up after pushing through the blight and the storm to that final point of reputation is one of the best feelings in gaming, it's the same one you get when you finally beat that Dark Souls boss you spent a month trying to kill or downing the final raid boss in an MMO. You feel like you accomplished something, that no matter what the game threw at you, you dealt with it.

The roguelite aspect provides a sense of progression between games. A settlement doesn't just exist in vacuum, completing one provides you with resources you can spend on unlocks that make your next settlement that little bit easier, allowing you to take on tougher areas for even more rewards. Even losing provides you with some amount of this meaning you'll never feel like your time was wasted no matter how badly your city goes.

It's an absolutely fantastic game and anybody with even a passing interest in city builders should pick it up. Probably the best city builder I've ever played.",storm game build nice little village beaver well fed live harmony game throw challenge challenge provides way deal resource map different building access one map might access lot sea marrow use fuel another use kiln convert wood coal third might need set production line turn meat oil randomness turn game simple city builder puzzle going approach problem facing settlement using resource disposal throughout entire game underlying sense urgency settlement grows storm queen impatience failing manage incredibly punishing never feel like comfortable position staving inevitable long enough get renown need win truly happy population often impossible frequently make tough decision meet goal however punishing game rewarding feel overcome seeing victory screen pop pushing blight storm final point reputation one best feeling gaming one get finally beat dark soul bos spent month trying kill downing final raid bos mmo feel like accomplished something matter game threw dealt roguelite aspect provides sense progression game settlement exist vacuum completing one provides resource spend unlocks make next settlement little bit easier allowing take tougher area even reward even losing provides amount meaning never feel like time wasted matter badly city go absolutely fantastic game anybody even passing interest city builder pick probably best city builder ever played

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"This review is for the single player, spent 150 hours to reach 91% completion and would need maybe 50 or 100 more hours to 100% it. I didn't try the online yet, i'll add the review for that after i try it.

I wont review the story to avoid spoilers, but it's a long game with some excellent missions, as usual when it come to Rockstar games and the humor is spot on, characters are great and the story as a whole is a great prequel to the excellent Red Dead Redemption.

The game is not easy if you want to master everything, nothing hard if you want to jump from one mission to another, but it'll take you a bit of time to get familiar with all the activities that you can do, especially the hunting which is essential if you want to craft the best items in the game.

For the visuals, even while not at the ultra settings, this game is insanely beautiful, i never felt a world full with life as much as in RDR2, Rockstar went into each detail to create the last days of the Wild West and it's a huge payoff for the players, you really feel like you riding with a gang in the early 1900s. And with photo mode, whatever you are doing and wherever you are on the map, be sure that you'll end up with a nice photo. I'll add to that the dynamic weather and different environment that wont change just the looks but also the fauna and flora of the region.

Shooting is pretty satisfying with the dead eye mechanic and the slow motion 
Even the crafting is diverse, from food to ammo to tonics, also loved the weapon modifications, to make each weapon customized to a different look.

Map is pretty big for a game that uses a horse as the primary travelling method, you can fast travel easily using camp, train or stagecoach, but i dont advise that, you'll miss a lot of nice things like that, a lot of random events. Plus there is way too many things to collect that will take hours and hours to find them all, add to that around 100 challenges and you have over 200 hours of gameplay without even touching the online part of the game and even with all that time i'm sure that you'll miss a few of easter eggs or interesting places in this game.

It's an amazing game and to me one of the best games ever made, so it's highly recommended for anyone who have the patience to learn what this game have to offer. 

Thank you Rockstar for all the amazing moments i had playing this game!

1336490,Against the Storm,"[h1]Summary[/h1]
As someone who no longer has the time to run 10-20-hour Civ/EU4/Stellaris campaigns, this is the perfect game for me. After work, or when I wake up, I can always find time to play a 1-2 hour game (Prestige 1, lower difficulties can run as short as 20-30 minutes). On some lazy days, I could also choose to play multiple runs in a single session if I want to. I have been playing colony sims and city builders for the most of my ""gaming timeline,"" and Against the Storm really has me hooked, considering the lack of combat and multiplayer. If you're looking for a roguelite city builder/colony sim experience, you've found it.

[h1]Replayability[/h1]
The roguelite meta-upgrades also help evolve the game beyond what you start with, such as unlocking other races, more advanced mechanics like Rainpunk Engines and better trade with other settlements. Sure, each run may not be truly unique, but similar runs are really spaced out, with very varied runs in between!

Often times, you are forced to work outside your comfort zone. There may be runs where you won't have Beavers to help you out with wood production, or where you won't have any fertile soil to grow any [i]renewable[/i] plants on. Of course, if it's [i]too[/i] outside your comfort zone, you could always choose to play these runs on lower difficulties to get the hang of the game.

[h1]Development[/h1]
The game has regular updates, and release dates of major updates are indicated on the main menu. When I first played the game, we only had Beavers, Humans, and Lizards. A few days later, [spoiler]Harpies[/spoiler] were introduced. As of writing, we also have [spoiler]Foxes[/spoiler]. There has been a number of QoL changes as well, such as recipe tweaks and the crucial ""unassign Woodcutters"" button. You can also personalize your building-specific keybinds to further make your experience better. Can't wait for the Steam Deck Verified update soon! They are always consistent with their roadmaps.

Against the Storm is actively developed, and there was a period (3-4 months) where I stopped playing due to grad school, and I had to start on a fresh save so I could experience everything and keep track of what I've unlocked so far. Of course, if you have an older save, you'll always have the option to keep that, but I preferred to have a fresh start.

[h1]Some tips and tricks[/h1]
[b]You may want to avoid reading this if you'd like to form your own strategies instead.[/b] Here are some personal tips I've gathered when playing on the higher base difficulties (Viceroy), excluding Prestige:
[list]
    [*]In the game settings, you can choose to pause on the start of each season, on cornerstone prompt, as well as when traders and newcomers arrive. Since I constantly play on 3x speed, it's easy to miss these opportunities.
    [*]Off the bat, start with 2 woodcutter camps, 1 food harvesting camp of your choice, then paths. Depending on your situation, you may want to delay building shelters if you'd like to rush materials from the Crude Workshop or the Makeshift Post. Set the woodcutter camps to ""Avoid Glades (unless marked).""
    [*]Ban coal from the Hearth (uncheck its usage) unless you can make a steady supply of it. Coal can be used in certain glade events, and it may be unwise to open a glade without at least 20.
    [*]Cut wood (hold Ctrl when marking to avoid glade border trees) in the direction of a Dangerous Glade. You'd prefer to open one after your first Storm, and you'd also want to avoid opening regular glades as they usually aren't worth the Hostility.
    [*]I prefer to delay picking my blueprints, unless there are some ""must-pick"" blueprints on the first roll (e.g. Kiln)
    [*]I also usually delay my newcomers if they come at a bad time (e.g. bad Storm), as well as when they come before the cornerstone prompt (some cornerstones benefit the arrival of newcomers)
    [*]Always go for Complex Food (Jerky, Biscuits, etc.) since raw food will eventually become unsustainable, even if you have plenty of farms and gathering nodes for them.
    [*]On the topic of food, you can also disallow your villagers from eating raw food once you unlock Consumption Control from the Citadel.
    [*]If you have some orders like ""Need for Jerky (0/20),"" you can also stockpile Jerky by disallowing these at the cost of -1 Resolve.
    [*]If you're only a few Reputation points (1-3) shy of a victory, you can Favor your best race in order to generate Reputation.
    [*]Similarly, you could also Favor a race during a Storm to keep villagers from leaving. Best used on [spoiler]Harpies[/spoiler].
    [*]Don't forget to have fun. Even during times when you struggle. I had a (Viceroy) run where ~12 villagers left during a Storm, only leaving me with <10 total. I still managed to win thanks to some adaptation and carefully-picked rerolls and trades. Personally, getting ""good"" at the game doesn't mean consistently winning at high difficulties; getting ""good"" is when you're able to win, or trying your best to win, when dealt with a really bad hand. That's me though, don't let me define your enjoyment. Have fun!

281990,Stellaris,"Stellaris as a whole is hard to review. The game itself is massive in scope, and over 880 hours (at time of writing) is hard to sum up in a character-limited review. There's a meme for Hearts of Iron veterans where the ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe"" clip from Bladerunner plays while they recount their experiences. Stellaris is the same way: over 800 hours in, and just when I think I've seen it all, something radically different pops up that shatters my expectations. I've seen startup empires get confined to 4 systems by mining drones surrounding them on 6 sides. I've seen AI suicide thousands of strength worth of fleets into a leviathan, solely because they were too lazy to path around it. I've seen multiple federations form, disband, recruit outcast members of the opposite side, and collapse again in a single playthrough. I've seen gas giants act as unofficial wormholes, and fallen empires fully surrender after losing a single space battle. I've seen countless AI uprisings spawn in with more fleets than the entire Contingency/endgame crisis combined, only to have them utterly collapse the next month from lack of economy. Stellaris can be a symphony of discord, betrayal, and stupidity, and I love finding new ways to both break the game, and watch the game break itself. I will, however, say this: Stellaris will not be for everyone. It took me over 50 hours to secure my first win, back in the early days of 1.9 & 2.0. Successful players will need a mix of patience, stubbornness, clever thinking, and extensive research via the wiki.

Stellaris itself is a semi-realtime strategic simulator, where you take a fledgling planet and turn it into a sprawling galactic empire... or more likely die trying. You control literally every aspect of your empire: how your government is set up, where your pops live, how they're treated, what they research, what planets they colonize, and how you deal with the galaxy around you. There are some automated aspects when it comes to ship design & planet/sector management, but these are almost always less efficient than player-controlled choices, and thus are best given as little automation as possible. With that said, there's a massive amount of information constantly being thrown at the player throughout the game, even enough to make veterans stumble from time to time. The tutorial by itself is insufficient in preparing the player for the full burdens of managing an empire all on their own, especially when dealing with the hidden interactions between traits, ethics, & research specialties, and thus an extensive reading of the wiki is highly recommended. 

The AI itself is at times odd, and predictably unpredictable. Everyone has different views regarding the AI, with personal skill and playstyle usually weighing heavily on their opinions. From personal experience, the AI can be compared to an early-mid tier player, depending on difficulty modifiers. They can utilize basic functionality like colonizing planets, utilizing relationships/trading, building fleets, etc, but they tend to have glaring issues that can be exploited. Specifically, they tend to have issues creating & maintaining their economy, leaning more towards early gains for later losses, and panic spam specific structures when certain resources start running low. At times they'll colonize planets, but not properly construct infrastructure on them. I've never seen an AI build a titan or colossus that wasn't a Fallen Empire. They're completely inflexible in terms of ship design, favouring point defense to a frankly ridiculous degree, and won't change their initial build based off external factors. They also tend to build way over their fleet cap, and thus bankrupt themselves economically as time goes on. And finally, their relationships with others is extremely fickle at best, making & break rivalries/alliances/non-aggression pacts constantly. With that said, difficulty modifiers giving passive economic & research buffs can help even the scales with them. The old problems still exist with them, but are less damning. Grand Admiral difficulty can absolutely wreck all but the strongest builds, and a mega federation can easily end a game, no matter how strong you are. Make no mistake, there will always be a challenging difficulty for all players. With that said, it's perfectly acceptable to find and stop at one that you find both challenging & enjoyable. For me, it's a 2300-2350 scaling Admiral game on a small galaxy, with 0.25 planet spawns and 0.5 hyperlane density. Your mileage may vary, as there are much, much bigger galaxy sizes to choose from... provided you have the time & energy to complete them.

I think my biggest problem is that Stellaris tends to change for all the wrong reasons. Things like the aforementioned issues with the AI's economy/war decisions, useless early techs like ""energy siphon"", the varied usability of missiles & the complete brokenness of strike craft, and a host of visual & gameplay issues existed even when I was playing at the end of 1.9, and still do to this day. The problem is that the devs seem to live in their own world, and think that constantly reworking everything will somehow nullify old gameplay issues, especially when it comes to balance decisions. Like for example, strike craft have been broken for a long time now, because their AI is scatterbrained and they fly too far from combat to be of any use. But instead of just fixing their AI, the devs are planning to re-purpose starport-based strike craft to instead guard trade routes. This is nice, but doesn't change the fact that they still target incorrectly and continue to be useless for mobile carriers. Similarly, the tile system is to be replaced entirely, to try and fix the AI's colonizing issues and the sector manager's overall efficiency flaws, but this doesn't change the fact that both are still awful at managing their economies as a whole. This is perhaps my biggest issue with Stellaris, and Paradox in general: they seldom fix anything that requires more than changing one or two lines of code, and instead seem to think that reworking everything is preferable to just fixing what's already there. There's an unreal amount of old, busted relics from previous patches left in the game, still as broken as the day they were introduced, but left ignored by a company that refuses to take a couple months off from developing new cosmetic DLC and simply fix what already exists.

I'm not mad per-ce; Stellaris is still perfectly playable, and I wouldn't have sunk almost 900 hours into it if I didn't enjoy it. But the last few months of minor changes and planned reworks haven't given me much hope for Paradox's vision of the future. Thus I'll re-emphasize that Stellaris requires a lot of determination, and a bit of thick headedness, in order to fully learn how to play it and circumvent the remaining bugs/gameplay imbalances. I very much enjoy the game, it's teachings about basic philosophies & politics, and the stories I've created over the dozens of empires I've built & destroyed. But I have to admit: I laughed at the 1.9ers who complained that 2.0 was ruining the game they'd come to love, as I thought 1.9 was a broken mess and that 2.0's changes were all right on the money. But after 880+ hours learning 2.0, 2.2 now imminently looms on the horizon, threatening to vastly change the game's economy & take away a large portion of player control via the tile system removal... and I can't help but feel a little anxious about the future. This is perhaps the biggest surprise that Stellaris has given me; the fact that I now feel so much sympathy for the 1.9ers.

Stellaris is a fun game, and worth your time to learn if you're determined enough. But I personally will be waiting on the sidelines with cautious optimism, hoping for the best with 2.2... but preparing for the worst.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"You play as a student in the most famous magical school of wizardry, and will follow along the expected milestones of the academic year—you’ll attend classes, learn new spells and skills, help both teachers and classmates and unravel a mystery regarding a powerful enemy. It’s as Harry-Potter-esque as it gets. If you loved the movies and books, this game is a must-play.

The gameplay is just as you’d expect for a student in the HP universe, complete with the selection process in charge of a talking hat, socializing with (or antagonizing) your colleagues, wandering around the castle and getting into trouble. Short of impersonating Potter himself, this is the closest experience you will get to enrolling in a Hogwarts school year. Of course, there is no Voldemort, but the story is sufficiently similar, and you will still feel like the prophetically-foretold boy who lived.

You can customize your student’s looks, clothing and even your magic wand and broom. The options are not a lot, but still serviceable enough. Naturally, you can belong to any of the four Hogwarts Houses, and you will be given the corresponding uniform and colored accessories. You’ll find a lot of clothes in your adventures, and each item provides different bonuses to your character. Interestingly, you can change the looks and keep the features, which means that you can always look the way you want, and have the combat perks you most like or need. This is an excellent feature.

Despite the emphasis on the wizarding experience, I believe the star of the show is Hogwarts itself. The castle is huge, rendered beautifully, and chock-full of secrets and places to explore. Ever wanted to wander around the school and grounds and see the places barely mentioned in the movies? Now’s your chance. And it’s every bit as fantastic as you imagine. Discovery is the name of the game, and every single location you’ve heard of in the books is here, and then some. Mind you, this is Hogwarts, not London—so no Ministry of Magic and such. Want to dare visiting the Forbidden Forest at night, looking for the dangerous arachnid lair? Try your luck at finding the common rooms of the other houses? Venture into the Library’s forbidden section? You can do all that. NPCs are quirky, diverse and in tune with the Potterverse. You will finally get to meet Peeves!

Interestingly, there’s no curfews or hard enforced rules. Considering this is a school, and the importance of norms in the movies, this is weird—but perfectly understandable, from a gameplay standpoint. Still, there are moments when stealth is the better approach to trouble, and the student is perfectly capable of hiding and defeating opponents while unseen.

Unlike with many games these days, I found myself avoiding fast travel almost every time. It’s nice to walk to the surrounding villages, and even nicer to fly there on your magic broom. You will find merchants, wild animals, rogue trolls, abandoned ruins and dark wizard camps. You can even explore ancient tombs, and there are many puzzles scattered all over the place for you to solve, courtesy of the late Merlin. Solving them will grant bonuses that aid you in several ways.

The story is interesting, usually predictable and mildly convoluted. It also echoes Potter's journey with small twists here and there. The dark figure of the mysterious looming enemy is still present, only this time the goblins play a bigger part. As usual, there are undertones of real-life problems, like racism and segregation.

An interesting choice regarding ethics is the use of the Unforgivable Curses. This topic is dealt with somewhat lightly, but the implied values and decisions are still there. Will you become a pre-teen murderous criminal and use these curses indiscriminately? Your choice. As for me, I decided I wouldn’t—and this meant a whole branch of the skill tree was unavailable to me. While you can’t pickpocket and rob to your heart’s desire, you can most definitely steal from every home in Hogsmeade, even in front of the owner, with no consequence at all. From a modern gaming perspective, I expected something less immersion-breaking.

The music is fantastic. Not Williams, but deeply reminiscent of his work. Once again, the similarity was pushed to the limit, stopping only short of exorbitant royalties. You’ll recognize the notes and motifs over and over, and it’s never invasive in terms of gameplay. Some comments from your character can get repetitive, though—and the flu stations suffer from the same.

The Room of Requirement is at your disposal as your main base of operations. You can decorate it to your heart’s desire, and gradually expand its size and functionality as the story progresses. Different props and magical stations will become available to find or purchase, and you can place them wherever you want. Eventually, you’ll get your own magical spaces to keep fantastic beasts like the famed magizoologist of the movies. The potion-making mechanics, however, are cumbersome and—at least to me—almost completely unnecessary.

True, there is little variety in the enemy department. Combat mechanics are a bit simplistic, but serviceable. The student is not very agile, but it works well. Sometimes the enemies will feel bland. Unlike Voldemort and his minions, these guys lack depth and personality, and you will frequently end up fighting and defeating mindless golems and statues that always act and look the same.

The graphics are really beautiful. And not only the world: the map, the cards, everything contributes to the gorgeous look of the game. A general sense of quality can be seen everywhere. The details are wonderful and always in line with the Potter universe.

The voice acting is excellent, varied in mood and accents. The only ugly detail is the sound editing, especially the pitch slider for the main character’s voice, but this is also present with other characters and even cats. This produces weird sound aberrations that are sadly somewhat common.

I did encounter a pair of bugs, but not game-breaking ones. In a weird case where my character clipped into a wall because I tried to use the broom too close to it, the reverse action solved the problem. I am aware of the complaints by other players, but for me it was a stutter-free experience, with no crashes at all, although texture popping can break the immersion from time to time. Loading times are not annoying save for the ""shades loading"" that always happens at launch.

I used the Xbox One wireless controller to excellent results.

In terms of mechanics, [i]Hogwarts Legacy[/i] is plagued by a sign of the times: lots of errands, collecting items, fetching quests, and the like take place in a very large open world. The beautiful castle and scenery help in that department, and you've got travel points, a flying broom and a magical steed to aid you in your travels. Thankfully, there are no microtransactions, gems, crystals, or any other annoying token currency so common today. Sadly, no Quidditch!

I could not help but to feel a little empty at times—in [i]Hogwarts Legacy[/i], the sense of “game-ness” is a bit painful, given the wondrous world and potential for immersion. The game could be much better with a bit more complexity, from more interaction with the environment to maybe better customization options. However, the game is complete and functional as it is, and I understand why these design decisions were made.

The price is a little high to my liking, but with a 15-20% off it would be fair.

Playing [i]Hogwarts Legacy[/i] has left me a sense of wonder I have seldom felt in a game lately. Even the story itself evokes that of Harry, and purposefully so. But it works. If you are a Potter fan, this is a must buy. You'll thoroughly enjoy the experience. This is the best alternative yet to be a Hogwarts student.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"[h1] Sum up[/h1]

+ A single character can learn all classes and jobs in the game.
+ Insane variety of content, even without the expansions. Up to 2000 hours easily.
+ An MMO that starts simple, looks appealing and raises the difficulty in later levels.
+ Dungeons, bosses and raids look amazing, featuring rich details and lots of effects.
+ Community is very social and they enjoy helping other players in anything they need.
+ Party finder for those lacking a party going solo, as well as other features to keep players together and make it easy to connect.

-  Monthly subscription can repel new players.
- Lots of content to do in order to catch up with the latest expansions.
- Early parts of the game can be quite dull and boring, though it gets much better.
- The duties which are solo instances can break a party temporally and be bothersome.
- Later in the game, it becomes a trial and error experience when battling new bosses and exploring new dungeons.

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is an MMO game base on the series with the same name. It features elements from all the entries and creates a huge world filled with lots of things to do. What set it apart from other MMO’s is that it looks visually appealing, that its system is easy to learn but hard to master and that it has a lot of versatility when it comes to its players. It is a fluid system with a good amount of room to explore and take it easy.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The gameplay features common elements of what an MMO would have. Players do quests in order to gain exp and level up, once they do they are able to queue up for dungeons, trials(bosses) and raids which they can battle together with friends or with other players through the party finder, which works like a charm.

Each player is required to choose a class, then at lv 30, that class will become a job. Job is a more specialized class. Depending on the class the player chooses, gameplay will vary and while it would be impossible to mention all of them in a review, I will give some examples. Classes are divided into three roles:

[h1] Healers [/h1]

Their job is to keep their fellow peers alive through the art of healing. They can range from the classic white mage with lots of healing spells, to a more offensive approach with the scholar who has damaging spells. Players can also opt to get a mix of both with astrologian, which depends on the high skill of the player and some RGN but features the higher arrange of abilities.

[h1] DPS (Damage dealers) [/h1]

They are the ones who kill the monsters. DPS is the role with more classes in the game and they feature different types of jobs such as black mages, which enjoy lots of damaging spells but lack utility, to bards who can buff their whole party with beneficial effects while keeping up damage or ninjas, who mix different kinds of abilities to generate powerful ninjutsu.

[h1] Tanks [/h1]

The heart of the party, they always must protect their fragile party members and be the shield that guards the realm of men. Like their description says, they keep everyone out of harm's way by provoking monster, rushing to deploy barriers or just being a pain for bosses to get rid of in general. Tanks will redirect all the damage towards them so that the healers and dps’s can do their jobs without preoccupying about dying.


Is the mix of all these roles that create a functioning party, and with the finder, you are always guaranteed to get a good balance of all of them. Each of these roles is equally important as they are pieces of a greater whole. The healers keep everyone alive, the DPS kills the enemies and the tanks keep the other two out of harm's way. No matter which role you choose, you will always be important for your party.

Speaking of side activities, there is another type of roles I haven’t mentioned yet. These are the disciples of the hand and the disciples of the hand. In these fields, players can find classes ranging from blacksmiths to fishermen or even culinarian! These jobs tend to break the normal pace of the game and offer a more relaxing environment. They might sound boring at first, but players often find themselves lost in them for hours. Once you get going, you just want to do more, and they are beneficial to yourself and your other classes.

If you are a culinarian, for example, you can make your own food which allows you to get bonus exp modifiers. If you are a blacksmith or an armorer, you can craft your own weapons and armors to use in your other classes. If you are a fisherman, you can sell the fish for lots of money on the player market and well, who doesn’t love fishing in a game?

[h1] Story [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a game that takes its story very personal and treats it with the utmost care. It does start pretty boring and dull but catches up fast and it can feel like watching a series or a movie. The richest stories are in the expansions, unfortunately, but these are quite enjoyable, filled with lots of believable characters, conflicts, development and more.

 Reading all of it or catching up to the latest expansions can be quite daunting, so if you are not into spending a lot of time reading/watching cutscenes, you can always skip them and rewatch them later at an inn’s room. There are also plenty of summaries only that are well written and consist of thirty to an hour reading material per expansion (game+2 expansions= 3 hours of reading total) so feel free to skip it if you do find it boring or exhausting to sit through. Do however note that the story is one of the strongest points of the game.

[h1] Some Notes [/h1]

The game runs well on any system that meets the requirements. Some areas might decrease your fps depending on your settings and the sheer amount of player characters that are present in the zone but fret not, this is not a big issue by any means. Duties can be bothersome when you are at a party with friends but are overall enjoyable. Probably the easiest MMO to get into has a UI that the player can adjust to fit their playstyle or needs and the game lacks any sort of pay to win or in-game advantage bought with real money, only shortcuts for those that simply don’t have a lot of time.

[h1] What Makes It Special [/h1]

What makes Final Fantasy XIV special is that it is well balanced when it comes to all the classes and jobs. That it looks more realistic when compared to its peers and that it features a dynamic, fluent system with that is easy to use but hard to master. By sharing all classes across one character, the player will never need to go back to the start of the game in they decide that maybe that class they picked, in the beginning, wasn’t the one for them. 

The game makes an effort to make fights different from one another. Players can find themselves fighting in Rubik's cube, getting devours by a Cerberus and fighting the beast from its stomach or even getting split from their bodies and have to move across a labyrinth of AOE’s in order to go back into them and continue the fight. There is always something new in waiting for the player in the next encounter. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a fantastic MMO, it is filled with great amounts of content and different ice breakers to teach new players how to play and hold their hands until they can go by themselves into the wild worlds of Eorzea. There are a bunch of side activities to break the normal pace of the game and have some fun if you are ever tired from questing, and each dungeon or trial keep adding new mechanics, keeping the game entertaining and making you wonder what you will encounter in your next adventure. I recommend this game to those that haven’t experienced an MMO, and to those that have as well.

294100,RimWorld,"I'm not one to write reviews for games - especially games that are in early access. So, I'll classify RimWorld as a lifestyle instead of a game. I was an original kickstarter backer and have played this game (almost) daily for the last 3 years with an estimated 1000 hours of playtime (before the game was avaible on Steam). So yes, I'll recommend this game and give it a positive review. 

The best way that I can describe RimWorld is the aesthetics of Prison Architect mixed with elements of Dwarf Fortress set in a Firefly styled Universe. In it's heart, it's a colony simulation game where you take control of colonists who are on a planet away from ""civilization"". You make the decisions to equip, shelter, feed, and protect your colony from the environmental dangers and enemy factions. 

Sure, the game is still in Early Access (Alpha 14 at the time of posting), but there are a ton of replayability and mechanics to learn as well as different difficulties and multiple AI types to ""guide"" your gameplay. The game is relatively bug free and nicely balanced in the vanilla game. The modding community is healthy and a lot of really solid mods have been released and updated.

With that said, the game may be a little daunting for new players. There are a lot of elements and core mechanics to the game that take some time to learn. My suggestion to this is to play the game on a reduced difficulty and learn from your mistakes. When your colony dies, restart a new map and learn from your mistakes. Losing is fun.

All in all, it's worth the $30 - even if $30 is expensive for an indie game. I mean, you can cure asthma by replacing a colonist's lungs. 

As I said before, I did purchase the game through kickstarter, but the developer added me to the game as a character - so I didn't technically get this game for free, but I did a bit of a bonus.

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"When I finished Dying Light 2 a month or so after launch, I opted to completely put the game away and hope Techland would give it some much needed love, mainly in the field of game mechanic improvement.

I am really glad I gave it that time.

Despite certain balance changes (rip day one grappling hook and korek) and the totally abysmal main story, Techland has now bought out a variety of total mechanical overhauls and content additions that have deeply enhanced the experience of Dying Light 2, the recent parkour update being the factor to start tipping my preference away from the first game. 

Not only am I blown away at how the reworked combat, gore and parkour feel like a more satisfying, roided version of the predecessors; but many parts of DL1 I enjoyed so much like bounties and events have returned too.

I think it's safe to say that we're in for a support run as good as Dying Light 1's was, and hopefully this shapes up to be the ultimate chaotic fun zombie game.",finished dying light 2 month launch opted completely put game away hope techland would give much needed love mainly field game mechanic improvement really glad gave time despite certain balance change rip day one grappling hook korek totally abysmal main story techland bought variety total mechanical overhaul content addition deeply enhanced experience dying light 2 recent parkour update factor start tipping preference away first game blown away reworked combat gore parkour feel like satisfying roided version predecessor many part dl1 enjoyed much like bounty event returned think safe say support run good dying light 1 hopefully shape ultimate chaotic fun zombie game

Finally finding a gun they like and having to immediately unequip it for something else as a new player high power level guns drop as every drop, but they’re all blue so they all feel like a wet noodle during any content that matters. A big gripe a lot of them had was the loot in general. The amount of times I got ""Oh man that's a cool gun, how do I get that"" or ""Oh damn your character looks SIYUCK! How can I get that armour"" and I have had to say things like ""Oh you can't anymore it was from a past season"" or ""Oh it was a past season weapon that you could focus but now it's a random world drop so you just have to hope you get lucky enough for it to drop randomly, and then be lucky enough for it to be a decent roll. rng on rng on rng baby!"" FOMO sucks and just shouldn’t be a thing.

“Why does everything cost so much” – A dude I know. I think he meant this both DLC $$$ wise (We’ll ignore that) but also in game at the time, legendary shards and upgrade materials are a ball-ache to get if you are a casual player. With everything costing more of them and now weapon crafting being changed to have them as a cost, it’s so hard to keep up as a new light.

They have also recently made the game harder (or in their words “more rewarding”) to play. Which is fine, I love to be challenged in games. But the not-so-much loot we were already getting stayed the same. So it took longer to get the same amount of loot. But wait then we got less loot. So now we are taking longer and fighting harder enemies to get less shitty loot than we were getting before, the vast majority of which we auto-dismantle anyway. The time investment to gear reward ratio feels so bad as things are right now.

I get that bugs happen in games, but it feels like a kick in the balls as a player when bugs that effect the player in a negative way are left to simmer (without communication) for multiple seasons while bugs that benefit the player (lookin at you rahool’s dismantling shop of mystery) have action/parts disabled within a few days. Just seems to show where the priorities are.

This is one of those games where the community is incredible, the lore is spicy (although lightfall campaign?? Not sure about that one chief.) but the game just seems to be the best there is in it’s field so it is stagnating. It happens with other games/game genres, there is no competition, so they aren’t forced to improve (Don’t get me wrong strand kinda slapped). I know there have been countless “Destiny Killers” but they all end up sucking and feeling dry, at least with Destiny we can feel dry in the comfort of the game we have been playing for 5 years, more if you include D1.

EDIT:

I am making an addition to this review and keeping it as negative, heck I would make it more negative if I could. Bungie has announced that the price of the season passes going forward is going up from 1000 silver to 1200 silver, call that what you will, inflation, greed, whatever. For me that part is what it is.. It’s only 200 silver.. right… right? The thing that gets me is that Bungie is doing the scummy mobile game microtransaction schtick of not having a silver bundle that gives you that amount. So, you need 1200 Silver right? Okay cool well for $14.95AUD you can get a bundle that gives you (as it’s worded in the store) “1000 +100 BONUS”. So you are 100 silver short of being able to buy the pass? So that means you have to purchase either the next bundle up (2000 + 300 BONUS Silver for $29.95AUD). Or you have to purchase the 1100 silver bundle and one of the bundle below that one (500 Silver for $7.55AUD) Totalling your silver purchases to 1600 Silver for $22.50AUD.

This also brings me to the topic that Destiny 2 is the only game I have played that has a battle pass that doesn’t give you some of the “themed premium currency” back in the pass. COD gives you COD points back, Siege gives you credits back, Fortnite does it. You are able to purchase one battlepass, complete it and save your credits for the next one. Not in Desty 2, spend more money next season you hobo’s!

So you are spending money on the big DLC’s (Lightfall), the season passes (which now cost more), the dungeons (that are now separate, so I hope you purchased the dungeon pass or the deluxe edition). You could have purchased the Lightfall: Big Honky Big Boi Deluxe Edition that comes with the “years worth of content”, but if you are one of the many people who isn’t confident in the technical state of the game, can’t play basic strikes without it being an error code simulator, or just don’t feel confident shelling out that much money for 3 seasons of what is mystery content at this point. (Mystery content that is 100% going to be filler stuff until the next big story expansion). I don't blame you for not buying the Deluxe edition, or for not upgrading to it. I'm honestly lost rambling at this point so don't even know where to go from here.. I guess I'll reupdate this review the next time there's a development, hopefully one day I'll be able to make it a positive review.

EDIT 2:

Just a quick update to note that the latest season has been released today (May 24, 2023), resulting in a the usual big season store refresh. However, it's worth noting that this time around, there is no armour available for purchase with bright dust (the earnable in-game currency) as there usually is. Instead, this time items are only available for silver. But wait, there's more! They have introduced three new eververse bundles containing exotic weapon ornaments that come bundled with silver-exclusive shaders who knows if/when these shaders will be available without opening your wallet. There used to be such an emphasis on the fact you could do it both ways, you could earn cool looking gear/shaders in game or you could buy others with silver. The community would tell you it wasn't a big deal and you didn't have to buy it if you didn't want to, which was fair. Jump to now where.... wait..  where'd all the armour that's obtainable in-game go?

I would like to bring up the somewhat random point that SPARE RATIONS IS BACK! So your old sunset gun is now back with more rolls that you have to grind for again. Really not sure where I stand on the whole reusing weapon models thing, on one hand I get it but on the other hand it seems lazy? This season we have normal spare rations and also spooky taken ghost spare rations, also seems like a nostalgia plug, imagine all the youtube titles ""WOW SPARE RATIONS IS BACK!"" ""SPARE RATIONS PVP KING AGAIN"" etc, etc. It is immensely frustrating that they have endless creativity for Sparrows, Ghosts, Ships, and exotic ornaments, but the actual gear is mostly reissues and reskins??

The reusing gun models argument aside they really have an issue with having weapons in promotional artwork/mission launch screens that just don't exist in game?? I'm also confused because they cancelled sunsetting and are now bringing back sunset weapons with different rolls? So was it really a space issue? I get they're shuffling seasonal stuff out but at this point it just seems like a cop-out

I'm not sure if they are just trying to milk the IP for all it's worth because the final shape is coming up or because they need to show papa Sony how much money they're making. It appears that even though it was easy to blame Activision there is an increasing emphasis on monetization regardless of Bungie splitting from Activision in 2019.",love game playing since launch also played d1 review heard destiny 2 described destiny 2 great people already play destiny 2 3 people know try get d2 none experience d1 original d2 curse osiris warmind experience get play past tutorial get overwhelmed somehow overwhelmed activity underwhelmed loot receive finally finding gun like immediately unequip something else new player high power level gun drop every drop blue feel like wet noodle content matter big gripe lot loot general amount time got oh man cool gun get oh damn character look siyuck get armour say thing like oh anymore past season oh past season weapon could focus random world drop hope get lucky enough drop randomly lucky enough decent roll rng rng rng baby fomo suck thing everything cost much dude know think meant dlc wise ignore also game time legendary shard upgrade material ball ache get casual player everything costing weapon crafting changed cost hard keep new light also recently made game harder word rewarding play fine love challenged game much loot already getting stayed took longer get amount loot wait got le loot taking longer fighting harder enemy get le shitty loot getting vast majority auto dismantle anyway time investment gear reward ratio feel bad thing right get bug happen game feel like kick ball player bug effect player negative way left simmer without communication multiple season bug benefit player lookin rahool dismantling shop mystery action part disabled within day seems show priority one game community incredible lore spicy although lightfall campaign sure one chief game seems best field stagnating happens game game genre competition forced improve get wrong strand kinda slapped know countless destiny killer end sucking feeling dry least destiny feel dry comfort game playing 5 year include d1 edit making addition review keeping negative heck would make negative could bungie announced price season pass going forward going 1000 silver 1200 silver call inflation greed whatever part 200 silver right right thing get bungie scummy mobile game microtransaction schtick silver bundle give amount need 1200 silver right okay cool well 14 95aud get bundle give worded store 1000 100 bonus 100 silver short able buy pas mean purchase either next bundle 2000 300 bonus silver 29 95aud purchase 1100 silver bundle one bundle one 500 silver 7 55aud totalling silver purchase 1600 silver 22 50aud also brings topic destiny 2 game played battle pas give themed premium currency back pas cod give cod point back siege give credit back fortnite able purchase one battlepass complete save credit next one desty 2 spend money next season hobo spending money big dlc lightfall season pass cost dungeon separate hope purchased dungeon pas deluxe edition could purchased lightfall big honky big boi deluxe edition come year worth content one many people confident technical state game play basic strike without error code simulator feel confident shelling much money 3 season mystery content point mystery content 100 going filler stuff next big story expansion blame buying deluxe edition upgrading honestly lost rambling point even know go guess reupdate review next time development hopefully one day able make positive review edit 2 quick update note latest season released today may 24 2023 resulting usual big season store refresh however worth noting time around armour available purchase bright dust earnable game currency usually instead time item available silver wait introduced three new eververse bundle containing exotic weapon ornament come bundled silver exclusive shaders know shaders available without opening wallet used emphasis fact could way could earn cool looking gear shaders game could buy others silver community would tell big deal buy want fair jump wait armour obtainable game go would like bring somewhat random point spare ration back old sunset gun back roll grind really sure stand whole reusing weapon model thing one hand get hand seems lazy season normal spare ration also spooky taken ghost spare ration also seems like nostalgia plug imagine youtube title wow spare ration back spare ration pvp king etc etc immensely frustrating endless creativity sparrow ghost ship exotic ornament actual gear mostly reissue reskins reusing gun model argument aside really issue weapon promotional artwork mission launch screen exist game also confused cancelled sunsetting bringing back sunset weapon different roll really space issue get shuffling seasonal stuff point seems like cop sure trying milk ip worth final shape coming need show papa sony much money making appears even though easy blame activision increasing emphasis monetization regardless bungie splitting activision 2019

1190970,House Flipper 2,"Here is my big pros and cons list for HF2 in comparison to HF1 as of right now:

Pros:
-Sandbox mode,
-Some nice QOL updates to the mechanics and the selling gun,
-Nice art style,
-Copy and paste mode for the design of furniture is amazing,
-Bigger starter house.

Cons:
-No minimap for dirt,
-No more assembly of items (i wanna assemble toilets, curtain rails and showers damn it),
-Feels like this game could have just been a DLC to the original like ""oh look a new town to flip!""
-They're deffo gonna release like 50 DLCs for this I can already tell.
-I would have liked to have seen a lot of the DLC content from 1 be moved over but seems that's probably also going to be DLC content here too.
-Painting walls gets even worse. You thought you hated painting in 1? Get ready for pixel painting in 2.
-No buyer input so flipping houses looses that target audience flipping charm (I wanna know that the old couple likes my furniture).
-Hardly any accessibility.
-Genuinely just missing that House Flipper spark.

Think truly this game should have just been House Flipper Sandbox, and have more focus on the Sandbox mode because that currently feels very overwhelming to go into. I can open the first house flipper game and lose 8 hours, here it feels like a chore to play for 2 hours.

1190970,House Flipper 2,"So, I've spent over 500 hours playing House Flipper. This game captured my heart and became one of my favorites. I was eagerly awaiting the second part and had high hopes for it.

Alas, it's not the second part; it's something else, something lacking the soul of what we loved in the first part.

- The graphics, to my taste, are just awful. Developers shifted from realism to a more cartoonish style, even though they tried to work on some details.
- Yes, they added some interesting features, but the game became tiresome due to the new mechanics.
- There's no sense of satisfaction; you don't see what was before and what you did after. You don't have to cater to the needs of buyers, and the game doesn't present a challenge (except for the challenge to keep playing it).
- The store is very limited and inconvenient (despite adding the ability to change finishing materials and furniture styles, it's not enough).
- You don't install plumbing, but after placing another window, which you just fit to the house, you find yourself filling holes in the wall every time.
- Painting is a separate nightmare; it gave me tunnel syndrome (yes, they added variety with more wall customization options, but the implementation is awful, alas).
- Floor coverings are now laid in pieces, which is also inconvenient and tiresome.
- Curtains? Blinds? Either they don't exist, or I couldn't find them in this awful store (judging by screenshots from others, they simply don't exist).

What I liked:

- Now you can move objects with items on them (it's convenient and was lacking in the first part).
- Added realism to opening doors (objects obstruct doors from opening).
- Grid for aligning objects.
- The ability to copy style (very convenient).
- The cartoon on TV is cute.

I'll go back to the first part of the game. 
The second, at this stage, is something terrible. 
I hope it's not an attempt to profit from fans by releasing new DLCs to finally make the game the one that will contain everything that once captivated our hearts. 
It's not a game; it's like a wonky DLC that needs more work. And it certainly isn't worth 20 bucks...

In fact, I could talk about the drawbacks more, but I don't see the point. It's just disappointing

As much as I enjoyed World of Warships for a long time, I cannot in good conscience recommend it. I played way more than the 200-ish hours before (and after) the game went on Steam. Gameplay is fun as soon as you take a couple of hours to understand the mechanics. Graphics are fine, so are the sounds and music.

Here comes the ""but"" - devs are using every single trick in the book to coerce you into paying. The game is addictive in real drug dealer style. At first, up to about tier 5, you get the good stuff. It's easy to earn credits, you unlock new modules and ships every few battles, you feel like you are progressing and making a difference. And when you're hooked, you hit the wall. Game becomes a grindfest. You need to play lower tier battles just to make credits. UNLESS you buy a premium account. Or a premium ship. Or premium camouflages. You have oh so many options. You can also buy lootboxes, err I mean containers. Or skip the middle men and just buy credits outright with real money.

There is a ton of events where you can win premium stuff for free, so that's nice. BUT, expect to get hit with enormous amounts of grind, thats where ""loss aversion marketing"" kicks in. After all you can just pay and get that prem thingie right now. They really outdid temselves in British Destroyers event - you could earn ""guineas"" to get a premium tier 8 british destroyer. You just needed to get 50 guineas, which you could earn at a rate of 4 per week, or buy at I think about 0.75 euro apiece. But here's the catch - you could only earn 48 guineas by playing. If you wanted the ship you had to pay something. And I bet a lot of players didn't read the event announcement (extremely long because the event was complicated like hell) carefully enough to notice that you couldn't earn all the 50 guineas in game.

Game is incredibly held back by its economy and developers, which are almost hostile towards the player's time. Even with a premium account the grind is painful and the toxicity of the economy permeates into normal gameplay as losing a match takes a hefty chunk out of your resource gains.

Can honestly not recommend it to any new players.

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"Techland sold out to Tencent. Let this be a reminder to gamers that no matter how beloved your favorite game studio is, sooner or later they'll have a downfall. 

I've been a fan of Dying Light since the first game released in 2015. So it pains me to see one of my favorite series' fall like that with the introduction of microtransactions and garbage live service elements. 

The story in DL2 is somehow worse than the original. While DL1's story was pretty generic, at least it wasn't crap. DL2's story is more generic and all of its characters are absolutely obnoxious (except for Hakon). I don't know why western devs and movie makers think writing obnoxious characters is good. Don't get me wrong, you can write an entertaining character who's obnoxious, but in DL2 they characters are just obnoxious, not entertaining. 

The combat gameplay in DL2 feels off. When you swing your melee weapons sometimes they don't connect with zombies right in front of you when they should. And the gore seems broken. Even with the Gut Feeling update. The gore might look good but it doesn't feel like its actually tied to the combat. For example, you could drop kick a human enemy and somehow all of their hands and legs would rip off after hitting a wall which makes no sense. Somehow DL1's gore is more realistic. With DL2 being a Chinese game now I think the gore might get downgraded later on. 

I might be a minority on this one but I never really had any complaints about the parkour. I thought it was a definite improvement over the first game and with the Good Night, Good Luck update they improved it even further. I also don't mind the lack of guns in the game. DL was always focused on melee combat and the lack of guns makes the game more challenging whereas in DL1 nighttime became a joke as soon as you got a powerful shotgun where you could also buy ammo for very cheap instead of it being scarce like in Resident Evil. But being OP and shooting volatiles was still fun in its own way NGL. 

Speaking of night, it's laughable how initially Techland completely nerfed the night time experience just to appeal to casuals. Instead of making the night scarier and more complex in DL2 for the millions of fans of DL1 they thought it was a good idea to appeal to people who dropped the game because they were scared of playing a HORROR game. I'm sure the devs had fun wasting their time reworking a core mechanic of the game months after the game was already out when they could've avoided this altogether if they didn't have the bright idea to remove roaming volatiles. But at least they added them back in and made it similar to how it worked in DL1 though it's not perfect yet. It's BS that volatiles NEED to be hit a certain amount of time before they die now. It feels like artificial difficulty. 

To Techland's credit, they did add a community map creation feature which I think more devs should do for their games. Even if DLC2 sucks and Elyseum is never included in the game, fans can now make their own maps and modes and have fun. I hope they keep expanding on this feature. It's also nice that Techland actually listens to feedback and include requested features as soon as they can. They promised at least 5 years of support and before the buyout it really did seem possible. 

I really wanted to love Dying Light 2. And I still do to some extent. But the game fails to live up to the first game even over a year after its release. And after the buyout, I don't think this game will ever do. My hype for DLC2 is almost zero. But that's only because I know almost nothing about the DLC except leaks and rumors as Techland didn't announce anything. I really hope this won't affect the updates Techland makes to change the game for the better but at this point I'm not sure anymore.",techland sold tencent let reminder gamers matter beloved favorite game studio sooner later downfall fan dying light since first game released 2015 pain see one favorite series fall like introduction microtransactions garbage live service element story dl2 somehow worse original dl1 story pretty generic least crap dl2 story generic character absolutely obnoxious except hakon know western devs movie maker think writing obnoxious character good get wrong write entertaining character obnoxious dl2 character obnoxious entertaining combat gameplay dl2 feel swing melee weapon sometimes connect zombie right front gore seems broken even gut feeling update gore might look good feel like actually tied combat example could drop kick human enemy somehow hand leg would rip hitting wall make sense somehow dl1 gore realistic dl2 chinese game think gore might get downgraded later might minority one never really complaint parkour thought definite improvement first game good night good luck update improved even also mind lack gun game dl always focused melee combat lack gun make game challenging whereas dl1 nighttime became joke soon got powerful shotgun could also buy ammo cheap instead scarce like resident evil op shooting volatile still fun way ngl speaking night laughable initially techland completely nerfed night time experience appeal casuals instead making night scarier complex dl2 million fan dl1 thought good idea appeal people dropped game scared playing horror game sure devs fun wasting time reworking core mechanic game month game already could avoided altogether bright idea remove roaming volatile least added back made similar worked dl1 though perfect yet b volatile need hit certain amount time die feel like artificial difficulty techland credit add community map creation feature think devs game even dlc2 suck elyseum never included game fan make map mode fun hope keep expanding feature also nice techland actually listens feedback include requested feature soon promised least 5 year support buyout really seem possible really wanted love dying light 2 still extent game fails live first game even year release buyout think game ever hype dlc2 almost zero know almost nothing dlc except leak rumor techland announce anything really hope affect update techland make change game better point sure anymore

The proximity voice chat is perfect. I'm hoping they add more moons to make it easier to meet higher quotas (the highest we reached was 2267 or something like that, and it was disappointing to just start over). Here's what you need to know to join the company:

- Never take your eyes off a coilhead. 
- Always check the ceiling.
- If there's an open vent, you aren't alone anymore!
- Just because that hallway was safe when you came through it, doesn't mean it will be safe coming back.
- Try to bring back your dead colleagues' bodies. It saves you getting a steep penalty AND the corpses are worth 5 credits!

- When you see the Flowerman, run fast and pray. Don't believe the Bestiary. Flowerman follows no rules or logic. Look at him, don't look at him, it makes no difference. He just decides, ""Yes. This one I'll murder. And this one, I'll let go... for now."" When the Flowerman says it's your time, you're GONE. 
- If something is moving and it's not wearing an orange jumpsuit, it has the capacity (and motivation) to kill you.

Hope that helps, and don't forget to meet that quota!

1336490,Against the Storm,"This game is an excellent example of in what state an early access game should be released. It works splendidly and gets regularly updated. The developers really have a vision and they believe in their project. 

The game itself is a solid town-builder with mission based levels, which doesn't drag the game too much. Once you have completed enough objectives, you can move on to another region. You can also continue building your town, if you want, but this doesn't get you anywhere further in the bigger picture of the game. It's just for us who have trouble letting go of the work we've put in. 

I've often had a problem with other building games that I build one city fanatically and after awhile I don't know what to do next and after one or two cities built I have a feeling I have seen all the game has to offer and I lose interest. Money not well spent. 

That is not the case here. You want to see where the story takes you. There are also different difficulties and seeing your townspeople die after you've gotten greedy and stretched the materials you have too far, makes you lose hair. If you have any, luckily I don't. 

The game has many aspects and I don't even pretend to know half of them. Every town is a learning lesson, and you forget fast that the game is only in early access.

892970,Valheim,"I just finished beating the first boss. These are my initial thoughts and the mechanics used in the game.  

Valheim is like a Minecraft version of dark souls with Fallout building/survival. 

Mechanics:

You gather resources and use a work bench to craft shelter, weapons and armor.

The tools, weapons and armor wear down with use but can be repaired at the work bench. 

The building of structures snaps together pretty well but sometimes the piece disappears until it’s in the right spot. 

You attack, run, sneak, block and dodge with a stamina meter. 

You sleep in a bed to set your respawn point. Sleeping turns night into day and you get a temporary bonus for sleeping. 

You cook food at a fire. When you eat you regenerate health. Rainy and cold weather debuffs you. These survival aspects makes you think a little more but is not a chore.

There are no experience points but there are skill levels. You get higher skill levels by doing those actions. E.g. run skill goes up when you run. 

When you die you leave behind a tombstone with all your gear. You have to go back to the place where you died to reclaim your gear. Once I died and looted all but one thing. I then died again. A second tomb stone was made. I was still able to go back and loot that one thing from the first tombstone. 

Thoughts / play experience / tips:

As soon as I landed I was attacked by four different types of enemies in sequential order while I was naked and bare handed. That let me know what I was in for. 

The trees are out to get you. When you chop them down run away. You have been warned. 

Watch your cooking food just like you would in real life. 

Mark all the shelter you come across on the map in case of bad weather. 

The first boss fight was done well. 

I played using the keyboard and mouse but I’m thinking my Xbox controller may be the way to go.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"TLTR: ESO is the best MMO I've played so far.


The Good.
It has retained many of the best elements from the Elder Scrolls series.
-Fantastic sound-score.
-Fine graphics.
-A world that feels alive.
-Great exploration gameplay.

The leveling and combat system is far better than any Elder Scrolls game, by miles. For PvE combat is great, tho I haven't played for long enough to get into PvP yet. You can choose to grind up to cap in a single session, if that strikes your fancy. Or you could care less about leveling and still participate fully in all non-endgame PvE.

ESO does not waste my time with long travel times, I can get to anywhere I've already been in between 30 sec to a minute. For me this is a very important point. I detest games that fakes longviety my wasting my time.

ESO is not in any way pay-to-win, and it doesen't unnaturally inconvenience the player to make me pay extra. The only inconvenience in the game comes with spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants while questing at the same time. This was an inconvenience in the Bethesdas Elder Scrolls games aswell because of inventory. You can pay to unnaturally compensate for this inconvenience through an ingredient-bag.

ESO has pay for vanity.

The world is immensly open. I can go anywhere I want and be successful straight from the start. There are many questlines with their own story tying into the main story. I can choose freely what storyline to follow, or I can ignore the story entirely if I just want to grind my way to the endgame content or just want to explore. This also means the game is extremely accessible for anyone.

Crafting is plesant and feels meaningful so far. There are crafting-quests in addition to crafting for trade, if I want to pursue it as a career. There are few games where I enjoy crafting, but in this one it seems ok.

Stealth gameplay is fun, although not innovative by any means.

Playing together ad hoc is fun even without groupinng up. Just running together with random people for an area or a difficult fight is quite fun. Probably because combat is fast-paced, players are considered allies for the purpose of abilities, and game mechanics generally supports doing so. It works very well for any open area I've been to, and is faster than grouping up.

Some of the dialouge is good.

Some of the quests are ok.


The Bad.
With the game being extremely accessible, people looking for a challenge will have to do a bit of searching or research where to go and who to hook up with.

Because the enemies and treasure scales with level, ESO doesen't have the mother-haul aspect of treasure-hunting that some older Elder Scrolls titles had. For instance, in the original Morrowind I could sneak into an ancient abandoned fortress, find a coven of vampires there so powerful they could one-hit kill me, sneak past them, discover an endgame weapon, steal it and leave. It was a very unique feeling when just stumbling into it while exploring.

The community tools for ESO are the porest of any MMO I've played. I haven't found an accessible way of reaching ppl even for PUGs. There is no tutorial on how to effectively get a group going, and frankly zero incentive to do so anyway in any area I've been so far. Further, getting a guild seems to be a matter of blindly accepting guild-invites from ppl spamming general chat. For instance I've found no credible channel on how to get info on guilds that may be suitable for me, seek them out and ask for an invite. As a noob I find getting involved in the community in ESO a frustrating chore.

There is a tool for queing to participate in dungeons (instances) with PUGs. The tool is never explained however, you just have to find it yourself. Also the queing I've done takes 30-90 minutes. Some times of the day I'm unable to find PUGs for dungeons at all through this tool.

The community also doesen't seem very inviting towards new players in my experience. I've not seen anyone being very helpful towards each other yet. It's not that it's hostile, just not very friendly either. It may of course be because the Morrowind expansion was just released and all the established players are over there, for all I know.

I cannot fly, levitate or do Khajiit-level jumps in ESO.

Some of the story isn't good. They all pivot around the main story in a very overt way. Like in the old arcade games, where there is a scheming badguy and everything except the end-fight is about thwarting his minions. ""His"" minions are everywhere in ESO: Tamriel, and it's just to much of the same. This is very different from the other Elder Scrolls titles, where the monsters of the land seemed to make up a whole ecosystem on their own, with their own lives and events. It makes the stories that follow the quests boring after 25 hours, and deteriorating rapidly at 50 hours.

Most of the quests are very boring. Fetch me those items or kill me those enemies. For me this may well become a reason for abandoning ESO, they were the reason I never played WoW for more than 20 minutes. In ESO they aren't as bad as the ones I experienced in the other title. It's normally 3-5 targets instead of 20-30. At first it seemed that this type of quests would be few, but it proved to be very frequent. A real pity.

Many of the quests are really stupid. And I mean really really bone 'ead stupid. Like the world-class schemer who's locked himself inside a tomb and left the 3 keys outside the door at different but easy-to-find locations. Makes sense.. It's back to the old arcades, only back then the format required some abstractions. In ESO it's not an abstraction anymore, but a literally really dumb story-element. While there are some straight-forward story elements of the type ""some soldiers have been captured, go rescue them"", nonsense solutions are more common. Fully expect an NPC to suggest solving a problem by shooting her magic rainbow-ray at the moon while farting some magic sunshine. But first you must go find her some rare shrooms at one location, kill 4 zombies at another location, get 3 seashells, then kill an evil monster turtle-boss. Then she can find the spy who's been taken prisoner by the enemy and learn what he knows. And on to the next one.

After a quest is done I get a pat on the back, where the NPC tells me this was all my doing. I'm a hero. It's not that it's wrong, it's just that after a while all quest-givers start to seem like a benevolent school-teacher praising a 7-year old.


The Ugly.
Customer Support are flat-out ignoring support-tickets. 

There are 3-year old bugs that prevent installing or starting up the game for enough players that the forums have several threads each day regarding them. New players enter the forum frustrated, not being able to play. Some are able to get it working through forum advice, and others can't and refund the game as a result. The ugly part is that the developers don't communicate with the players and doesen't even acknowledge the problem. It's been 3 years now, so it seems they just don't find the bugs worth the cost of resolving vs the number of resulting refunds and bad reviews.


Final Words.
I don't know how long ESO will keep me engaged. I'm currently doing the story and exploration, but unless the story starts diversifying in the next area I fear I'll seek other content. Maybe that content can keep my attention, maybe not. Regardless, this is the best MMO I've played despite its shortcomings. The combat is quite good, and the absence of time-sinks count for alot.

518790,theHunter: Call of the Wild™,"Hello, after playing this game for many years now I have a fairly good understanding of some of the ins and outs of how this game works.  Keep in mind that I am only one person and there are many different perspectives out there about this game.
	What is theHunter Call of the Wild and how is it different from other hunting games?  I am sure you may have skimmed the description of the game by now but to put it into my words.  TheHunter: Call of the Wild (CotW) is an “easy to pick up” hunting experience.  It has enough of a realistic sense of hunting albeit a tad more on the arcadey side of things but is not too overwhelming when it comes to understanding some core mechanics.

While the main objective of the game is to hunt and explore, you do not have to hunt any animals.  Some people enjoy the game for its atmosphere, walking around the reserves, the ambient noises, and photography.  You have the option to turn off the narrative voice lines so you may not be disturbed in your endeavors.  The various soundtracks that are unique to each reserve give a little bit more soul to a map.

Base mechanics - Unlike in other games where you have the option to “hunt” animals by turning them into bullet sponges.  In this game there is a strong emphasis on shot placement (where you shoot an animal) and tracking.  Typically you want to shoot behind the front shoulders on 95% of the animals in game (any quadruped) the exceptions tend to be small game like rabbits, hares, waterfowl, and upland birds.  Hitting the lungs will bring the animal down fairly quickly (depending on the animal and weapon used)  If you are feeling up for a challenge you may also want to try for a heart shot. The heart (ingame) is normally located at the elbow of most animals if they are broadside (facing 90 degrees left or right from you) or somewhere mid/low chest if facing you.  This will take down almost all animals on the spot.

Outposts - these are places where you stock up on ammo, weapons, callers, medkits, fast travel, or sleep to go to certain times.  They are scattered all throughout the reserves and are marked by a green dot with a house inside.
	Currency - this game has its own currency system so there is no need to use real money to buy ingame money.  You get this by hunting animals and completing missions.
Missions - the missions are completely optional and really only serve to give a reserve more backstory.  There is also the plus benefit that they pay out a little extra cash and exp along the way.  You may also unlock a few outposts while attempting the missions.

Hunting pressure (big purple/pink spots on your map) - Hunting pressure is a pretty simple mechanic in that it basically removes any zone that is within its sphere of influence.  Animals will tend to avoid the area at least when needzones are concerned.  Depending on if you are hunting with a bow or from a hunting structure.  The hunting pressure will become bright pink if you hunt more than three animals in the area.  If you kill any more animals it will delete the zones and you will need to hunt somewhere else on the map to remove the pressure.  

Harvest check - This is more or less the game’s way of rewarding players with extra cash and xp for quick and clean kills.  The four “checks” are as follows: hitting a vital organ, no more then two shots on an animal, using the right ammo, not damaging the trophy organ (skull on most species).  The vital organs in this game’s definition are: heart, lungs, liver, neck bones (not spine), and the brain.  Hitting any of these will result in a check.  You will know when you hit them, there will be a large splat of blood where you shot the animal.
Shooting an animal two times or less is pretty simple.  As long as you made a decent shot one should do it.
When it comes to using the “right ammo” make sure you check the class range of the current ammo you have and the animal you are hunting.  The starting weapons you have (.243, .357, 420gr bow, and 12ga) will be sufficient enough for you to take down some of the immediate animals you are likely to encounter as long as you are playing the base game maps (Layton Lakes and Hirschfelden.)

Animal difficulty - The difficulty is how sharp that particular animal’s senses are, some species have keen eyesight or sense of smell and will react quickly if startled.  The range of numbers go as follows: 1 trivial, 2 minor, 3 very easy, 4 easy, 5 medium, 6 hard, 7 very hard, 8 mythical, 9 legendary.  Most animals have a difficulty range of 1 - 5.  Predators all go up to 9, additionally red deer, cape buffalo, and water buffalo go up to 9 as well.  Most small species have a range of 1 - 3 with some exceptions like white tail and roe deer.  Difficulty does not dictate what weapon class you use, only how quickly an animal will pick you up on it’s senses.

Weapon class range - I’ll touch on this briefly.  This is basically telling you what animals you are “permitted” to hunt with a certain caliber/load.  You can hunt how you wish with whatever weapon, however, if you want to get a high medal, exp, and extra cash then following the ranges will be most beneficial.  For example: the .243 has a range of 2 - 6 meaning any animal that falls within that range you can ethically shoot.  These animals are: red fox, wild boar, springbok, gray wolf, and red deer.  However, it should be noted that just because you can shoot a large animal with a weapon that is at its range does not mean it will die quickly.  Shooting a red deer with either a .243 or a .357 will result in a long track (if any vital except heart, brain, or neck is hit.)

Bugs - Yes there are bugs in this game, most of which are (at least from my experience) small annoying things like your character deciding to suddenly face north, not syncing properly in multiplayer, missions not tracking properly, and putting the wrong caliber of ammo in a weapon.  Some of the more heavier bugs include: saved games being lost and losing some trophies in your lodges.  While losing your game and trophies can be a very frustrating thing to occur.  There are some workarounds that can help mitigate the impact of lost progress.  I, however, am not tech savvy to explain how this works.  If you would like to know more there are a few guides in the forums that do a good job explaining how to make a backup save.

Content - The game gets new content and various updates throughout the year.  The content can range from a new species getting their truRACS, a new reserve, or hunting equipment (weapons and structures.)  Typically when something is about to be added, there are small and occasionally vague clues that the developers put into the game to tease upcoming content.  The game is pretty good without the need to purchase every single item.  However, the only content I say you will need would be a trophy lodge, for obvious reasons.

Community - The community is also fairly well behaved.  While it is online and there are of course some instances of poor user interaction.  From my experience it is not toxic to the point where you may feel threatened.  However, this is just from my experience and this may be vastly different from person to person.

Conclusion - TheHunter: Call of the Wild is a very relaxing hunting experience, it is not meant to be taken very seriously.  The environmental graphics (trees, lakes, mountains, hillsides) are pretty good and just about every step you take there are multiple opportunities to take some pretty amazing scenic pictures for those who are interested.  The animal models are subjective.  I find them to be quite adequate for the time being, however, there can always be adjustments made over time.

I highly recommend this game for people who are interested in hunting games and culture.

[i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is unquestionably awe-inspiring, artistically beautiful, superbly unique, and delivers (what can be) an unbelievably immersive and memorable experience if you’re willing to build a deep understanding of its mechanics...

HOWEVER, you MUST keep this key point in mind if you’re considering playing this game:
[quote][b][u]THIS IS A PVP GAME.[/u] Your enjoyment is based *entirely* on whether your style of play harmonizes with the other players who share the sea.[/b][/quote]
That in this mind, here’s my summary for each audience:
[list]
[*] [b]IF YOU DON’T HAVE FRIENDS WILLING TO LEARN, SUFFER, OR GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE [i]SEA OF THIEVES[/i] GAUNTLET, [U]DO NOT[/U] PLAY THIS GAME.[/b] You’ll have to endure A LOT of trivialized efforts, crushed dreams, verbal abuse, and game mechanics that are wholly unsympathetic of your time to reach the enjoyable parts of the experience.

[*] [b]IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD, STORY-BASED EXPLORATION GAME FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS, THEN PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.[/b] That good, story-based exploration game is *definitely* in there, but can get lost in the salt.

[*] [b]IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR A COMPETITIVE ONLINE FIRST-PERSON PIRACY GAME WITH BRILLIANT NAVAL COMBAT AND COSMETIC-BASED PROGRESSION, *ABSOLUTELY* PLAY THIS GAME![/b] It will be worth your time to learn, master, and conquer the high seas!
[/list]
Okay; onward to the in-depth review points!

[hr][/hr][h1]🟢 THE POSITIVES[/h1][hr][/hr]
[b]➕ SAILING MECHANICS.[/b] The cornerstone of any sailing game should be the boat mechanics, and [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] delivers. It does a masterful job of blending the complexity of sail and wind management, ship-to-ship cannon-play, and a variety of sailing mechanics to create a brilliant seafaring experience!

[b]➕ THE WATER.[/b] THE WAVES AND WATER IN THIS GAME: U.N.B.E.L.I.E.V.A.B.L.E! 🌊🌊🌊

[b]➕ The ART.[/b] In fact, the *ENTIRE* art style of the game is undisputedly STUNNING! From the golden shores to the volcanic frontiers, the game is built on [i]National Geographic[/i]-quality landscapes!

[b]➕ BETTER WITH FRIENDS.[/b] This can’t be understated enough: [b]the seas can be a ROUGH place—both when it comes to gameplay AND the people you meet along the way. Bring a crew so you don’t have to face it alone! 💯[/b]

[b]➕ HORIZONTAL PROGRESSION.[/b] The game has no vertical progression; there’s no “leveling up” to become a better pirate with better equipment or gain any mechanical advantage over your opponents. The playing field is level every time you roll a new ship—apart from your personal knowledge and mastery of the game mechanics!

[b]➕ The OPEN WORLD and the “INFINITE QUEST LOOP.”[/b] While the world is your oyster to explore the moment you leave the dock, there’s also an incredibly brilliant “quest loop” that emerges as you discover expeditions and unlock special emissary quests as you gain their favor. The game rewards you with better and quicker rewards the longer you play—making it incredibly easy to lose yourself for HOURS on end!

[b]➕ The STORY VOYAGES (aka “TALL TALES”).[/b] Much of the game’s lore is presented in story voyages known as Tall Tales. These concise, open world stories are a *fantastic* way to explore the world and learn about the magic that drives the [i]Sea of Thieves[/i]. (There’s even checkpoints to save your progress in case you’re ganked by some salty pirate!)

[b]➕ HUMOR![/b] As is typical in most Rare games, there’s a glorious, tongue-in-cheek humor woven throughout the gameplay and narrative experience. The world doesn’t take itself too seriously, which helps you get lost in the joy of the game!

[b]➕ The LIVESTREAM COMMUNITY.[/b] Where the game falls short of teaching the game and community norms, the streaming community is a BRILLIANT resource to fill in those gaps. Take the time to tune in and find a few favorite streamers:
[list][*] [url=https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Sea%20of%20Thieves]Sea of Thieves on Twitch[/url][/list]

[hr][/hr][h1]🟡 THE...""TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT""[/h1][hr][/hr]
[b]〰️ QUESTS (aka “VOYAGES”).[/b] Voyages are quests offered by the trading companies that help you grow your wealth. Each company only offers two or three *unique* voyages, and while there is some randomness inherent to each voyage, they will begin to feel repetitive after (admittedly) several hundred hours of adventuring.

[b]〰️ HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.[/b] On one hand: the mechanics are relatively straightforward, simple to pick up, and offer room to master a multitude of tricks that’ll give you the upper-hand in a fight.

On the other: long animations, hit-reg issues, and a lack of “weight” to your hits can make it feel like you’re dueling with wet pool noodles.

[b]〰️ ⚠ SAFETY PROTOCOLS: DISENGAGED ⚠[/b] The moment you set sail, you’ll be with the greenest of green sailors and the hardest, saltiest, most cutthroat pirates on the waves. Though skeleton ships will help you practice and prepare for the PvP encounters you’ll inevitably face, there’s no real, “safe” space to hone your skills as you play—a daunting hurdle to overcome early in the game experience.

[b]〰️ The PLAYERS[/b] …are truly a mixed bag. Some days you’ll make meaningful connections with pirates who are humble in victory, merciful through teaching, or powerful allies on the seas. Other days, you’ll encounter the most toxic, unfeeling players whose singular goal is to break your spirit. All you can do is be prepared for both…

[b]〰️ FISHING.[/b] While fish are both a source of nourishment and highly-desired by the fishing guild, the fishing mechanics themselves aren’t that interesting, and sadly feel like more of a time sync than an enjoyable minigame with meaningful rewards.

[b]〰️ The LACK OF SEA LIFE.[/b] While not game-breaking in any way, the variety of ocean life is sadly lacking in an otherwise STUNNING game... 😞

[hr][/hr][h1]💢 THE NOT-SO-GREAT[/h1][hr][/hr]
[b]➖ The game only *KIND OF* CARES ABOUT YOUR TIME.[/b] My biggest complaint with [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is the fact that many mechanics are designed to waste your time. Whether seeking out tiny dig spots on massive islands, fighting waves of skeletons for hours, or fighting a hooked fish for several minutes, the game is [i]NOT[/i] friendly if you’re looking to jump in for any less than two hours at a time.

[b]➖ The game does very little TEACHING.[/b] While the Maiden Voyage is a good place to learn the basic mechanics of the game, it doesn’t go into great depth and fails to cover several critical mechanics to the experience: including wind angles, bailing and repairing in combat situations, cannon mechanics, etc.

[b]➖ The game relies on XBOX LIVE.[/b] While this unifies all of the different platforms under a single account, the XBL service is clunky when it comes to making, inviting, or communicating with friends.

[b]➖ The PIRATE CODE are more what you'd call...“guidelines”...than actual rules.[/b] The code is a reminder of what the game proposes in a community and where it consistently falls short of nurturing that environment.

[b]➖ CHARACTER CREATION.[/b] While character creation guarantees a…”gruff” selection of pirates, it can be frustratingly limited if you’re particular about the look of your character..

[hr][/hr][h1]🤔 THE FINAL WORD…[/h1][hr][/hr]
[i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is a truly fantastic game held back by its indifference to the player experience and an insufferable community…and while some days will create some of your most memorable experiences in gaming, others will make you regret every hour you’ve invested to get there.

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"For MHW veterans on consoles: This version has faster loading times compared to the consoles, you will be impressed.
For newcomers: BEWARE. It still has some issues that I will explain in a moment.

This review was specifically made for those who have a low-end PC. I want to share my actual specs and current graphic setting to try and reach 1080p 60fps.

MY BUILD 

CPU: AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core 4.00GHz
Video Card: AMD Radeon R7 370 Series 4GB VRAM
RAM: 12 GB
Storage: Hybrid HD-SSD

As you can tell, it's not impressive, something Low-Mid for today standards.

GRAPHIC SETTINGS IN MONSTER HUNTER WORLD

Frame Rate (cap): 60.

V-Sync: Off. 
I rather tweak some settings with my Radeon software to try and fix the V-Sync, so I left AMD FreeSync on just in case and worked so far. The thing is, the built-in V-Sync in the game is very taxing. 
FPS cost: HIGH

Resolution Scaling: Low. 
The difference is noticeable between Low/Med/High, but the fps jump is kinda noticeable as well, specially in open areas (which is VERY common in the game). Since I'm playing on a 49"" HDTV from a distance I can't tell much of a difference, so I leave it in Low. 
FPS cost: LOW.

Texture Quality: 1024. 
Tested on lower values but hardly see any difference... until cutscenes showed up. Close ups also shows the degraded quality on textures, fortunately FPS is stable at max. 
FPS cost: VERY LOW.

Ambient Occlussion: Off. 
Adds more detail on the environment, but I currently suffer from FPS drop even if leaving it on low. 
FPS cost: MEDIUM

Volume Rendering Quality: Off. 
This is it, the bane of the FPS. Console users will recognize it as the fog, the one to blame all those fps drops; it adds more detail in the areas with all the lightning and stuff, but you can't see past the fog sometimes. This is no Nintendo 64, so no need to leave it on. 
FPS Cost: EXTREMELY HIGH.

Shadow Quality: Low. 
The shadows in the game are already good; sure you will see some low quality shadows cast from the characters, but it definitely won't bother you, also you will save a lot of FPS. 
FPS cost: HIGH

Anti-Aliasing: Off. 
I personally override the settings with Radeon settings, I use AMD's AA 8xEQ with Multisampling AA Method and it does a better job than the game with their own settings, which makes blurry edges, specially FXAA. Jaggies can be seen, but doesn't bother me that much. 
FPS Cost: MEDIUM

LOD Bias: Low. 
This defines how detailed the objects are from a distance. I generally switch between low and medium, but the drop in FPS is kinda noticeable.
FPS cost: MEDIUM.

Max LOD Level: No Limit. 
Will switch between -1 and No Limit, but it does bother me the lack of detail in objects sometimes, so I leave it in No Limit, also, it doesn't punish my FPS that hard.
FPS cost: LOW.

Foliage Sway: On. 
I want the game to look good and alive. Static foliage is not good, nor alive.
FPS cost: VERY LOW.

Subsurface Scattering: On.
I like to see very detailed skin on characters, definitely looks bad without it, specially in cutscenes.
FPS cost: LOW 

Screen Space Reflection: Off.
How objects reflect the environment. FPS altered if leaving it on. You can hardly tell the difference in quality.
FPS cost: MEDIUM

Anisotropic Filtering: Off.
The detail of the terrain from some angles. You will not notice the difference.
FPS cost: MEDIUM

Water Reflection: On.
I honestly can't remember if this was on in the PS4, but I liked the detail. FPS may vary.
FPS cost: LOW

SH Diffuse Quality: Low.
There is this thing in the game where objects that are very close to you - more specifically, between your hunter, and the camera - get diffused, transparent and leave some dots all over the object. Supposedly, you can try to remove the dots by making them blurrier with this option, but it's very taxing on FPS, so I leave it on Low.
FPS cost: MEDIUM 

Dynamic Range: 64-Bit. 
Left on 32-Bit and didn't like the colors, fortunately not taxing.
FPS: LOW

Z-Prepass: On.
I honestly have no idea what this is about, even if the game tells you. Had no issues with FPS drops, so I left it On.
FPS cost: LOW


After all that, I can review the game for what it is, but a lot of comments here already explained what it is about, how does it feel, what works, what doesn't; so I'm gonna try my best to do a brief review.

Had already spent 350+ hours on PS4 with Hunter Rank 179; I personally love this game, it's one of my favorites of the year so far. Haven't played a MonHun title before, but I can tell there were a lot of improvements, like real open areas and be able to move while drinking potions.

The game consists on hunting monsters to carve them to get rare materials to build weapons, armor, and accessories to go hunt more powerful and dangerous monsters. Rinse and repeat.
Character customization is deep enough, you may spend more than an hour trying to create your prefered hunter, and palico. (Palico are the little cat helpers that hunt with you)
You have 14 different weapons to choose from, and it's fairly balanced.
It has no PvP, the game is about hunting monsters, not other hunters.
It has a story mode but I've find it not that engaging personally.
It has multiplayer, you can play with other 3 players in a single quest and do whatever you want in the area: scavenging for bones, items, gems, and of course, hunting monsters.
You have a HUB where you can improve your hunter with lots of stuff, and more options are unlocked as you progress during the main story.
There's also a gathering hub that no one uses because there's no smithy, nor botany, nor melder, nor other shops that you will use a lot in the main tradeyard hub in Astera; the only reason you would go to the gathering hub is to do exclusive Arena quests. 
You can finish the game under 80-120 hours, depending on your pacing. But I would say ""finish"", because a lot of content opens up afterwards, also the team releases free DLC monsters and events and hopefully will continue to do so throughout the year.

Now, it has some issues that people are currently facing and let me tell you, THEY WERE THE SAME IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. More spefically, about the disconnections. And guess what? As of today, seems that issue was fixed... at least on the PS4. I had no idea why it happens on PC, but the port job is not perfect. You will face with random disconnections all the time, so get used to it until they fix the problem. 
Disconnecting from a room doesn't kick you out of the game though.

You will notice a little bit of lag on the controls, specially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a quest, your hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest. It's a minor detail, but it bothers me sometimes.

Some users have issues with FPS. nVidia users suggest NOT to update your video card drivers, but updates fixed my problem in AMD Radeon.

Some users are complaining about the keyboard-mouse controls, I would suggest to use a controller instead if you're in that position. I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great. The only issue is that the game doesn't recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout instead, since it's an Xbox One port.
Speaking of Xbox, I tried a wired Xbox 360 controller to play the game and works perfectly.

Graphics are great, music is great, gameplay is satisfying, it has a LOT of replayability, even after finishing the main story.
If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into, I would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter World.
If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into WITHOUT disconnections, I would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter World.

Better yet, I would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if you're convinced into buying it.

So, personally, I recommend this game for its gameplay and replayability, but maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnections, it definitely can be better.",mhw veteran console version

1599340,Lost Ark,"I loved this game. The first part was a grind. Getting a character to lvl 50 felt like it took an eternity. But once I was able to join my friends on end game content, it was a blast. It all went to hell when I decided to start collecting mokoko seeds. One day I decided to sit at a breakable wall on Mount Zagoras and attack it to get the 3 hidden/ blocked collectibles. After about an hour and with the help of a random player, we got the seeds and then I got permanently banned for cheating. I went back and forth with Amazon Games customer service bots and they sent a final ""We can't share any further information about our decision, and we won't reply to further emails about the issue"". 

367 hours down the drain because I did exactly what the game developers designed when they made a wall/barrier that requires a ton of hits to break down. It is sad, but clearly they don't care how much time is invested in their product. Maybe if I wasn't F2P I would have had a different outcome.",loved game first part grind getting character lvl 50 felt like took eternity able join friend end game content blast went hell decided start collecting mokoko seed one day decided sit breakable wall mount zagoras attack get 3 hidden blocked collectible hour help random player got seed got permanently banned cheating went back forth amazon game customer service bot sent final share information decision reply email issue 367 hour drain exactly game developer designed made wall barrier requires ton hit break sad clearly care much time invested product maybe f2p would different outcome

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"I love the top reviewer of this game on Steam talks about his issues with food storage and giving people in this game food. But all you need is a food storage...and everything automatically works.

And this is coming from a review from this month. 

The game is good, unfinished - but good. Graphics are superb, building mechanics are alright - could use a bit more inter activeness perhaps more customization before the building is constructed (however that's just me nitpicking). The game isn't close to being like the trailers, but close enough to be one of the better first person management simulators out there. 

You ever played Skyrim and wanted to do more in your Homestead? 
[b]This is your game. [/b]

You ever played Kingdom Come, loved the graphics and feel of it but wanted to build your town with more complexity from that one DLC? 
[b]This is your game[/b], [i]*minus the incredible combat in Kingdom Come. [/i]

But why am I praising this game so highly? Because it's constantly being updated. The devs seem to be listening to their community and doing everything in their power to make this game shine. This game has a lot of enjoyable mechanics to it, but it will end by making you want more. That same feeling of playing the good Harvest Moon games and then finding Stardew Valley. This game is taking the practical idea of first person management and making it a reality - and I want to see more developers try this more. And succeed. Because I'm sick of unfinished, unpolished farming sim 20** games.

Anyway, get this game. It's cheap and it will hook you for hours.

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"I think the best way I can describe this game is an online RPG rather than a traditional MMO. Although it does have the essentials (dungeons, raids, world bosses, etc.) the worlds themselves are pretty empty most of the time.

Go into SWTOR with a ""solo-mindset"". Understand you're rarely going to see people doing story content 10-years after the game's launch... but that's not a bad thing. The endgame community is very active and those planets/areas are always full of players.

However, having low-populated areas has little effect on a story-based game like SWTOR. I actually just started playing for the first time in 2023 and feel like I would hate the ""2012-2014 swarms of players"" buzzing around constantly and much prefer the less player-cluttered experience. 

SWTOR has 8 ""origin"" stories to complete for 100% free. This is easily over 300 hours of FREE content even if you blast through it. I am almost done 2 stories (agent + warrior) and I still only have 80 hours.

If you do choose to subscribe for just 1 month, you get to KEEP all DLC content FOREVER. No MMO I've ever played has a monetization system this good. So for $15 you get close to 400-500 hours of Star Wars content all created by one of the best story-driven game developers on the planet: BioWare.

386360,SMITE®,"RISE AND FALL OF SMITE

I have been around since the Beta. This is by far my most played game with over 3000 hours over the years. Its kind of a love-hate relationship.

The game initially took my breath away. Playing as legendary mythical gods and champions in beautiful detailed environments. There were few bugs here and there, but nothing that really bothered me. We had He-Bro, Lil' Mana, Olympian Anhur, but I felt like these skins we're not seen too often. They did not break the immersion.

Some time went pass and they introduced new Gods, Seasons and Items. New gods kept getting more and more overpowered to push people into buying the God Pack. Bellona was a fine example. It took them months to fix a god, that everyone agreed was beyond broken. Simple hotfix, reduce healing in half? Nope. We saw her fighting 1vs2's, 1vs3's and shivered at the mere sight of it. Console players had to suffer her for even longer.

There was the Frostbound meta, Qins/Fatalis meta where Cernunnos and many others were running rampant with insane damage and mobility, (I still have 88% win rate with Cern and 86% with the Bee.) Then there was the Defence meta, where assassins and warriors built 4 bridge items, and were able to destroy mages and hunters with ease, while taking barely any damage. Hi-rez did struggle massively to balance the game, and as they added more and more Gods and Items, it was even tougher job to get things right. We've all seen how bad it eventually got.

With every patch note, we saw where the manpower has gone. Skins. The base mechanics are barely working, while leaving people often with issues like:
-Not being able to invite friends
-Having to restart Smite in order to receive invitations or invite people
-Not seeing who is online
-Not seeing who is in game
-People getting randomly deleted from your Friendlist
-Not being able to talk in Party Chat
-Not being able to talk in Lobby Chat
-Not being able to talk in game chat without saying /g (not all know this)
-Mouse not interacting with item store, forcing you to restart the game
... And many many more.


You can start to see the picture i'm painting here. This could have been a game that kept tens of thousands of players around for years to come, but they did horrible job with managing the game. There are few expectations, but most of these skins are not appealing. They are all copies of each other with the same Edgy Robot, School Girl, Stuffed Animal, Edgy Demon and Edgy Demon Hunter Knight Thing kind of themes. They have been using the same taunts and cringey pop-culture references for years, with the same god damn voice actors.
The atmosphere of mythology, lore and divinity is all gone. The balancing is underwhelming. These gods are complete jokes, throwing around Cringey lines and occasional VELVEL spams. I used to read lore behind my favourite gods, that's how big of an impact the atmosphere had on me.

Hi-rez did jump on the MOBA wagon when it was popular.
Hi-rez did jump on the Hero Shooter wagon when it was popular, leaving Smite behind with no care for the well-being of the game.
Hirez did jump on the Battle Royale wago.. you know how this goes.

This could have been something special.


Honourable Mentions:

-Massively overbuffing Ullr before the release of 80€ T5 skin for him. He got banned in ranked in nearly every game and destroyed the casual experience. He was nerfed after the event, leaving people who spent money on that skin disappointed.
-I once opened 73 chests in a row and got the rare skins Derpules, Nuclear Ymir and 4 Convention skins in the last 6 chests. It is all a scam for the people with gambling tendencies.
-People were unavailable to spend money on the store after a patch last year. It took them only few hours to take the game down and hotfix this issue. My lobby chat was missing in January, it was still missing in July hours before writing this review. This is not healthy.



JULY 2020 UPDATE:

All the user interface, lobby and friendlist bugs are gone for me at least. Great!


NOVEMBER 2022 UPDATE:

Time to kill changes killed the game for me.

Time to kill was increased massively some time ago. Now everyone hits like a wet noodle, and i feel like the game is way more boring and stale than before.
This sucks for the following reasons:

Previously you could kill a fed enemy, if they made a missplay. Now, they are so beefy that they can afford to mess up a full kit rotation and still somehow survive/kill someone.
This makes the game even more snowbally than before. Capitalizing on your enemies mistakes don't pay off the same way as before and the player who is ahead in levels/defence/health, just rolls you, even if they make major mistakes.
I'd rather have fed enemies deal tons of damage, than to be unkillable. If they just deal tons of damage, you can outplay their kit and actually kill them.

1vs1 fights feel awful. Previously you could kill gods with single kit rotation and few basics, if you used your god to its full potential. It felt great. It felt rewarding. Pushing your god further just to deal that extra 100 dmg could mean the difference between enemy escaping or dying. Now there are just few champs that can actually 100>0 someone. Ra ulting someone, just to deal about 18% of warriors max health feels awful.

Since 1vs1 killing someone is out of the question, you have to rely more on your team. If you're playing with randies, you know how bad people are at this game. I feel so powerless, when the enemies are rolling over us and I cant kill anyone on my own. I have to depend on Fleshgordon27FENRIRx007  with his level 23 account to follow up on attacks to actually kill someone.
Impact of individual skill has been brought down SO MUCH that i just feel dead on the inside when team refuses to group up or work together.

Hunters crit meta is ass. Fights are decided on who gets the lucky roll out of the RNG machine and that is horrible for a skill based competitive game. I do wish they would rework the crit system or remove it all together. Maybe crits would crit every 2nd or 3rd basic attack, so that you have ways to play around it. You would be able to keep track of your own and enemies crits to add another layer of depth to the game.

Hitting like a wet noodle and feeling powerless does not fit the game where you play as literal chad fcking Zeus. This is also not a skill issue. I've dropped solid 4000 hours into this game and made it into masters many times.

The recent updates are really good for the game and the overall experience feels a lot better.
Some defense builds are a bit problematic as they stack tons of survivability and damage at the same time, but overall I feel like I can actually deal damage. Extra free wards are mostly gone and that's really healthy for the game.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Edit: Still good 4 years later.

For a long time, I avoided FF14 even as word continued on that it was one of the best MMO's  currently out there. This only increased with the release of the Shadowbringers Expansion, which I heard nothing but good things about. Still, this was not enough. Knowing how I operate in MMO's, starting one would be a colossal time investment for months, and possibly years depending upon how much I enjoyed it. I ended up giving FF14 a try when I saw how many of my oldest friends were either playing it or planning to. They let you do a free trial up to level 35, so I figured... why not? If I make it that far and like it, then perhaps this may be worth buying.

Even so, I wasn't quite prepared for how much I was about to be consumed by this game. FF14 is easily the best MMO i've played since WoW's Wrath of the Lich King expansion more than 10 years ago. I found it to be more enjoyable than EVE and Guild Wars 2, and far superior to WoW's current expansion Battle for Azeroth. After over a year of enduring that mess, it was refreshing to play FF14 and find an MMO that I actually could enjoy without excessive RNG and obnoxious busywork.

Ok, so reviewing an MMO in its entirety is utterly mad and i'd be here for hours, so instead I'm going to try to highlight a few key points.

First and foremost, FF14 puts some serious investment into its storylines. While it might officially be an MMO, FF14 is also probably the largest JRPG ever made. Expect dozens of hours of cutscenes and story events, with me having about 300 hours played when I finished all current story content. Now I didn't spend all 300 of those hours only doing story content, but that should give you a pretty decent idea of how large the story is. If you are familiar with this franchise then you have a pretty good idea of what to expect, and longtime fans will see many familiar names among this game's characters and boss fights. On the other hand the story is a bit mediocre early on and only really gets going in the first expansion Heavensward. Technically you can skip all the cutscenes (and rewatch them in an Inn or your house), and even buy a skip all the way to Shadowbringers if you really want to, but I'd recommend against it considering how much of a role story and character development play in this game. The story might be a bit bland and lengthy in its early stages, but it becomes one of the better parts of this game.

Moving on to gameplay, FF14 has a large number of different classes, or ""jobs"", that you can play as. You get your typical MMO setup of tanks, healers, melee, and ranged each with their own distinct play style, strengths, and weaknesses. Crafting and gathering in FF14 is much more developed than in most MMO's with each of them being different classes in their own right. But unlike most MMO's, FF14 allows you to play all of these different classes on a single character. This is a major selling point for someone like me with major alt problems in other MMO's (12 120's in WoW, for example). FF14 ensures that you are able to play all of the classes and their own storylines while at the same time not forcing you to build a new character from scratch for each different class.

As for group content, there are plenty of opportunities for PvE and PvP. When it comes to PvP, i'll admit that my experience is somewhat limited. However from what I have seen of PvP in FF14 it is a bit clunky, does not seem to be particularly popular, and is one of the few areas where WoW clearly beats FF14... for now. As for PvE, FF14 is very strong indeed. There are a large number of Dungeons (4 player runs), Trials (8 player boss fights), Raids (8 players), and Alliance Raids (24 players). FF14's version of LFG, the ""Duty Finder"", is simple to use and allows you to queue up for any content you have unlocked - though you may want an organized group for the high difficulty content. Worth mentioning are the ""roulettes"" which let you select a category (such as Trials, Level 80 Dungeons, or Alliance Raids) to queue for and obtain a daily reward based upon your class level. FF14 does have level scaling that reduces your level to fit whatever PvE content you find yourself in, though it is possible to turn this off for your own private groups. 

Like what WoW used to have when it was still good, FF14 has a token/badge system where you collect currencies from doing 50+ PvE content that you can use to buy gear, materials, and other goodies. There is also nothing like the Titanforging or weekly chest RNG BS like what is in current (8.2.5) WoW. Current content raids work a little differently in FF14 too, with you being limited in the amount of gear items you can get per week. On the one hand this slows down gearing a bit, but on the other you are free to run the current raids as many times as you want until you get the gear drop you are after, at least on normal difficulty. In the light of having to wait months before getting crucial gear upgrades in WoW due to only getting one chance a week, I like how FF14 does it.

As for the community, I haven't been on forums or around hardcore players since I have not joined a proper raid guild yet (or Free Company as they are called in FF14). However, from what I have seen FF14 players are far more friendly and far less toxic than many other game communities. I've completed over 500 dungeons so far and I can probably count on one hand the number of times i've dealt with jackasses in those dungeons. People tend to be friendly, helpful, more relaxed, and more forgiving of errors - especially if you are new and have the ""sprout"" icon. I think FF14 might have stronger rule enforcement for bad behavior, but I am not completely sure about that. I don't even see much swearing, which is kind of a shock for an online game. In any event, I very much like the peaceful community this game has.

Ok I better wrap this up before this review goes on forever.

And yet there are so many other neat things to mention. Gold Saucer and all its minigames, Player owned housing and all the customization that comes with it, the massive amount of special items to collect, and on the list goes. FF14 is an MMO after all, so having an insane amount of content to spend time with is to be expected. There are so many opportunities to play this game in the manner of your choosing. :D

So... If my opinion on this game isn't obvious to you by know, I don't know what to tell you. :o

One last note though... like many other MMO's, [url=https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/friend_recruit/]FF14 has a ""Recruit a Friend"" feature[/url] where a new player who has yet to buy their first month of subscription can get a code from a current subscriber and get rewards for both of them that increase the longer the new person sticks with the game. If FF14 sounds like something you may be interested in, feel free to leave a comment on this review asking for one of these codes and i'll reply with one. :D

2073850,THE FINALS,"[h2] ""Ok! I'm stealing the cashou----wooahhhhhhh the building's going down!"" [/h2]

While not something I would usually go for, THE FINALS has left an impression. 

I initially overlooked it as just another F2P that will die in a couple months (which it could) with silly cosmetics and an overall aesthetic that makes no sense. However, devoid of any good PvP shooters in life since COD2 and CS 1.6 (I'm trying to get into 2 ok) and occasional flirts with other COD games, and Battlefield, etc. I gave it a second look...

Something about the collasping casinos, explosions, coins everywhere, and the sheer destructive over the top tone of it as well as a bit of homage to Squid Games (a series I enjoyed) I thought -- eh, what the heck -- and started installing.

Now I'm glad I've had my brother and cousin to play with as being a party of 3 has shown me how fun the co-op, competitive experience can be. So, with some hours solo and some in party I do enjoy the tight team tactics a lot more than throwing my lot in with randoms and giving it a go; however there have been some fun surprises a long the way.

First, the game is pretty fast and I like that. Lots of opportunity for mobility in the form of jumps, dashes, grappling hooks, and pads that shoot you into the sky. There are ziplines and ladders everywhere. The maps are a parkour free for all and that adds a fun layer to things for sure. 

But where it all comes alive is in the destructiveness around the game. With all that mobility and speed it's amazing how, despite some balancing issues, there can be so many creative and fun counters. Blow up buildings, re-engineering the battlefield to flavor close quarter combat or ranged flanks, building a nest of rubble perfect for your mines and grenades to funnel into and vaporise your foes in a shower of golden coins...

Anyways, I got lightly hooked and am having a lot of fun. You just play: there's a good pace to the rounds, it can get silly and explosive, or extremely sweaty and tactical, it all depends on your mode and mix of parties. 

Physics are pretty awesome with lots of little surprises like mines colliding in mid air and sticking together, throwing knives whipping past you and burying themselves in the cashbox you're holding, cranes toppling, bridges disintegrating around you, and more to be discovered no doubt. Needless to say, it's achieved that easy to learn (kill, get money, win) but difficult to master (many, many 'mechanics' that can be utilised for success) learning curve.

I'll most likely never be some Diamond ranked master but the cool thing is, I don't mind at all. There's fun to be had! 

We'll see how it goes, but I'm also appreciating that it's pretty simple in terms of: you play and unlock your gadgets and guns and the only microtransactions are the clothing and stuff that have no impact on gameplay; they keep it pretty clean and separated. 

All in all, whatever happens with THE FINALS, it is fun and I hope developers interested in competitive and PvP style shooters can take the good stuff and learn from it and run with it and bring us some renewal in the genre.

Thanks for reading and hope you have an awesome day!

582660,Black Desert,"So, where to even begin. I guess the most important thing here is that this is certainly not the MMO for everybody. This MMO manages to pack in something for every kind of player out there, but that actually doesn't mean it will appeal to everyone. 

First of all, I'll cover the topic of the pricepoint, since in the very most lenient sense here, it's ""variable"". 

It's $10 to get into the game. No monthly fees, nothing. That's pretty handy. The price point is at least low enough that for most people, even if they don't like the game, they won't have lost out on much. Now, chances are, the price point is that low because THERE ARE MICROTRANSACTIONS, IF YOU WANT THEM. I'm putting this at the beginning of the review because I know that this will either immediately deter people, or encourage them to hear me out on this. The best way I saw these described was as ""conveniences"". You can get items that rival the cash shop items, but it will take time, and it will take effort. But, there is nothing to stop someone from simply getting a headstart on the game by dropping a little extra money on the game. Is that bad? Well, at a $10 initial price point, I don't think so, because almost all of the cash shop items are convenience items, i.e. streamlining workers, getting a nicer boat without investing time into it, getting gear to speed up fishing initially, etc. The game counteracts this by allowing a lot of things to be completed AFK, such as fishing, or even autolooping a running path to level up your stamina (seriously, you can just have your character run infinitely between two points and get levels out of it, I can't make this up). Need to level your mount? Check the ""auto feed"" option, stock up on carrots, set an autoloop, and go sleep or do productive things while your character travels between points A and B and your horse learns new skills. So honestly, the cash shop items are certainly a thing which most people would look down on, but I haven't even seen the need for them. That said, I could have higher tolerance for grinding (see my Maplestory hours, let's not talk about it).

Now, on the topic of grinding, this IS a korean MMO, and it's gonna involve a lot of grinding. The AFK system is honestly a god-send, I'm telling you. However, the combat is very dynamic and frankly the best I've ever seen in an MMO (it does seem very similar to TERA, but definitely more rewarding and satisfying). For skills grinding, a fair amount of it can be done while tabbed out, so the grindy feeling there is alleviated to a fair extent. 

As far as skills versus combat, this game does a very good job of letting you choose your own playstyle. Want to make it to the second town and then level all the way to 55+ and make millions by fishing? Sure, go ahead. Want to immediately start a farm and create a monopoly on food goods in the player marketplace? That works too. Set up trade routes between nodes and make all your money and experience through buying low and selling high, it doesn't matter, you get rewarded with level exp for so many things in this game, you can choose how you want to play the game. You can even treat it almost as a single-player game with the Black Spirit quest line, so play how you want to. And hey, if you're still into the kill-quest style MMO, that's all here for you too, and you won't even have to touch the other skills. It's relieving to play an MMO that lets you decide how you want to play it. 

Something I have not been a part of yet is the guild system, which entails warring over territories or capturing areas to claim tax to pay guild members and such. I don't know too much about this, but from what I've viewed, it seems incredible to wage all-out-war with other guilds for essentially control over money. The PvP seems to be a big part of this game, and I'm hoping to make it to that end-game experience soon. And yes, before you ask, these wars DO entail forts, cannons, armies, etc, which just seems super awesome. Other guilds though seem to take the game casually, and only want a community to play with, so that's diversified as well.

Now for the more technical stuff. The graphics are gorgeous, the combat is fluid and feels OH SO GOOD, and the AFK feature is even enhanced by an option to minimize the game to the tray. The chat is very spammy with system notifications when you first join the game, but the settings menus help with all that and it should take you just a couple trial-and-errors to figure out what you do want to see broadcast and what you don't want to see. The quest handling is nice and will even autopath you to destinations, and despite minor environmental hookups (I got stuck on a staircase once) it's a very reliable system and can streamline the early game.

Now, so after all of this, why can't I recommend it to everyone? I mean, I'm giving it a thumbs up, am I not? Well, it's because there is very little explained to you in this game, and that's probably because if they did, you wouldn't ever end the tutorial. The game has so much complexity to it that you're going to want to have YouTube open, whatever databases or guides you can find, a friend on skype, really anything to help you understand a new part of the game you've decided to dabble in. For some, that's incredibly daunting and I can't say everyone would enjoy the game based on this aspect. And this isn't me saying ""GO BACK TO YOUR BABY MMOS YA BABIES"" I mean seriously, this game is a lot to take in and I'm surprised even I can handle it. While I believe you can take the game in any way you like, you still might get curious one day and find a whole new aspect to the game that doesn't suit your fancy, or it's just so horrifically complicated at first that you aren't going to understand it until your 15th fail stack. Now personally, I don't mind having to research an aspect of a game, and I even personally have a journal where I jot down notes for all sorts of games I play (I'm a huge nerd, I know this). But some people want to hop in and just play to end-game, which is okay. Having to find and research your way to the end-game isn't always fun, and I understand that. 

So with all of that said, my final verdict is this: if any of this sounded appealing to you, give it a shot. Given that it casts it's net very wide, you can probably find something you'd enjoy in this game. But, be prepared to do some research, as some of the time you're just going to be confused, no matter how much experience you have with MMOs or in-game economies. If the mention of a cash shop that DOES benefit players deterred you entirely, then, ah well, that's fair, and I'd even encourage you to look elsewhere. Despite it being solely convenience items, I can't dispute the fact that they do exactly that. And finally, if all of this sounded appealing to you, I almost plead with you to play this, as I ended up finding the MMO I was looking for, and I hope you do to.

Thanks!

Edit: Wow! Thanks for all the reception everybody. Glad to see this review is helping people. After discussing the game with a prospective buyer, I realized I totally forgot to mention that the Black Desert Online site DOES ALLOW A 7-DAY TRIAL. Please note, the account used for that trial and the account used in Steam CANNOT BE LINKED, but this is a way for you to try the game and see if you like it! If the $10 or the cash shop is concerning, give the trial a chance and see, and then decide what medium you would want to purchase it on. I'd recommend using the trial and then coming to steam to start anew and know what direction you want to pursue, but please keep this in mind!

I spent 20 years single, building up my power until I could finally free her and remarry. She died not long after and I thought I'd play out the rest of my characters life until he died, and restart.

As it turned out I found a ""wolf-boy"" whilst I was on a hunting trip and was offered the chance to raise him, and make him my heir. When I died he went on to not only found his own Kingdom, but an empire when he was 60.

Probably the biggest recovery from launch of any game, ever. Excellent fixes, great work from the developers and community managers - little to no BS, mouse fixes, network fixes, prolonged events, and continued support for those with continued network issues. While a clumsy launch is always best to avoid, the gameplay and response from Capcom to the issues they've caused has been more than acceptable.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"By the time I write this review I have 740 hours in this game. I've done pretty much everything you can do around here and max level'd all the companies.

-Graphics are stunning for the most part, especially the sea. Characters do look goofy but thats not a bad thing. 

-Pve is fun at first 100-200 hours or so but gets repetitive after a while.

-Gold system is just stupid. I've bought everything in the game and still have millions of gold and thousands of dubloons just sitting there with nothing to spend them on. They need to balance it more. either add more stuff to buy, make it more expensive or decrease the loot you gain.

-To basically summarize the pve, there are 7 emmissary companies in this game. They will give you quests and bonuses on the items you sell if you're sailing with their emmisary flag.

EMMISARIES

Gold Hoarders.
They give you treasure hunt quests where you gotta dig up stuff from random islands. That's all they used to do until they introduced the vaults in a recent update. Vaults are a lot more fun. You gotta put together the map for a key then go to a specific island where the key will unlock a cave. You will see a lot of gold and chests laying around in there but those are just a distraction. Your main goal will be to get the Chest of Tributes by collecting madallions and entering the correct sequence to open sesame as it were.
They only give you bonus for treasure chests and small collectibles like chalices and ornate cups and whatnot.

Merchants.
Most boring emmisary of all. Just delivering cargos from one place to another. They give you bonus for selling cargo items like sugar, tea etc.

Order of Souls.
Basically a skeleton killing faction. They give you bounties to kill some skeleton captains and they will give you a bonus for selling them their skull. There's also ghost fleets which are much more fun and giving bigger rewards.
They only give you bonus for selling skulls.

Reapers.
The ''pvp'' faction of adventure mode. I just call them garbage collectors of this game because they will give you bonus for literally everything. Anything you got you thought was worthless, they will buy it. They buy everything. They dont give you any quests. There are a couple items that you can only sell to them. Reapers Chest and Reapers Bounty but beware these chests are cursed and their positions are revealed on the map. So other players may see you. If you're flying reaper emissary flag they will see you. BUT, if you reach level 5 emmisary you will be able to see other emmisaries on the map to hunt them down. You get really good money for selling broken emmisary flags of those people you sank. 

The reason I said ''pvp'' faction is because a lot of reaper players are known to just run soon as they see you. Yes. It's supposed mean ''hey guys, you can see us on the map, we're up for some pvp, come get us'' but they raise it to get more money from the items they sell and just keep doing pve. 

Don't raise reaper if you're gonna run from the first ship you see. If you get sunk, they will be toxic to you naturally and you will deserve it because you made them waste an hour chasing you down. 

Hunters.
Fishermen. You can fish in this game and sell your fish to these guys at any seapost. Best way to level up on hunters is to save your gems to sell it to them only(you can sell gems to everyone pretty much). It's a lot more xp and gold than fishin.

Athena.
The emmisary you unlock by reaching pirate legend. Pretty boring voyages and overrated rewards. I was disappointed. It was supposed to be some big endgame company where it'd be fun stuff but its meh.

Sea dogs.
Arena company. Arena is a seperate gamemode than adventure where its ONLY pvp. Just constant action for 15 minutes straight. Huge fun. I love their cosmetics too. Really the coolest and most posh stuff ever lol

WORLD EVENTS

These are where you enjoy some of the best of pve this game can offer. Rewards are pretty huge compared to regular emmisary voyages.

Flameheart
Giant Bearded Face in the sky screaming at you all the time. Everyone hates him. You fight his ghost fleet. Reward is plenty and you also get a lot of supplies.

Ashen Winds.
Boss on an island. Decent rewards, you also get a unique cool flamethrower skull that you can sell for 10k. Not bad.

Skeleton Fleet.
Probably the most challanging pve i'd say. Especially if you're in a small ship. But the loot haul is pretty big. Fastest way to level up your emmisary flag because of the high quantity of items you'll get.

Active Forts.
Skeleton waves and then a boss. You get decent loot. 

Fort of the Damned.
Biggest loot haul you can get from this game. But beware, people will try to steal it from you. This is the number 1 event every server hopper can dream of. It's the main attraction for pvp. Really the most fun thing to do/steal in adventure mode.

-------------------------

PVP.

Now for the best part of this game, PVP. It gives you a pleasure that other pvp games can't. It's just a really unique experience battling it out as pirates. I don't even do any pve anymore it's all about pvp.

I'll see if I can summarize the key parts of it, but oh boy it's beautifully complicated. 

-There's the naval part where you have to out-manuever your enemy. You have to stay out of their broadside while try to get them in your broadside while they're doing the same thing. It's not just a spinning battle where both ships constantly fire at eachother like in the Caribbean movies. There's unique moves you can pull off with harpoon turning, anchor turning, adjusting sails to surprise your enemy. Having a good captain will make all the difference between winning or losing a battle. 

-Cannons. Different types of cannonballs for different purposes, regular cannons to put some holes in, cursed balls with million different (and very useful) purposes, firebombs to put their ship ablaze, blunderbombs to damage players knock them back from repairing. and in my opinion the best type is the chainshots to knock their mast down. Because soon as you're unable to move, you're done. You will just be sitting ducks for the volley of cannonfire soon to follow. Having a good gunner who hits their shots in good sequence will make all the difference between winning and losing the battle.

-Repairing. Every crew needs a good bilge rat who makes sure that the ship is in top shape. You can't just ignore the holes in your ship to do anything else like boarding or shooting. Not sinking yourself is the priority. Worry about sinking your enemy later. A good bilge rat in your crew will make all the difference between winning and losing the battle.

-Boarding. Without a doubt the most fun thing to do in this game. Boarding other people and killing them. 1 boarder who can put the enemy's anchor down and keep them busy just for a little while is usually good enough to win a battle. You dont even have to really kill them usually. Because as they are busy with the boarder, the other crew member will continue putting the pressure with cannonfire and putting more holes. They won't be able to really focus on repair while they have an active boarder. 

On the othere hand, as fun as it is, too much boarding can be the downfall of a bad crew. Disorganized, if you send too many boarders and they either miss the target or die without doing significant damage, you will be severely undermanned in your own ship to survive the enemy's cannonfire or boarders. I've seen people just all abandoning their ship with holes in it to board ours, we just kill them and theres nobody left to repair them. Come on people. Take care of your ship. Your ship must come first.

TL:DR

There's so much more to it than I can fit in this review. Really a rich game with a vast world. It's well worth buying at full price. A must buy if you're really into pirate's life. One thing I must say though, you gotta play it with friends. x10 more fun. Solo sailing can be painful and usually gets boring really fast.",time write review 740 hour game done pretty much everything around max level company graphic stunning part especially sea character look goofy thats bad thing pve fun first 100 200 hour get repetitive gold system stupid bought everything game still million gold thousand dubloons sitting nothing spend need balance either add stuff buy make expensive decrease loot gain basically summarize pve 7 emmissary company game give quest bonus item sell sailing emmisary flag emmisaries gold hoarder give treasure hunt quest got ta dig stuff random island used introduced vault recent update vault lot fun got ta put together map key go specific island key unlock cave see lot gold chest laying around distraction main goal get chest tribute collecting madallions entering correct sequence open sesame give bonus treasure chest small collectible like chalice ornate cup whatnot merchant boring emmisary delivering cargo one place another give bonus selling cargo item like sugar tea etc order soul basically skeleton killing faction give bounty kill skeleton captain give bonus selling skull also ghost fleet much fun giving bigger reward give bonus selling skull reaper pvp faction adventure mode call garbage collector game give bonus literally everything anything got thought worthless buy buy everything dont give quest couple item sell reaper chest reaper bounty beware chest cursed position revealed map player may see flying reaper emissary flag see reach level 5 emmisary able see emmisaries map hunt get really good money selling broken emmisary flag people sank reason said pvp faction lot reaper player known run soon see yes supposed mean hey guy see u map pvp come get u raise get money item sell keep pve raise reaper gon na run first ship see get sunk toxic naturally deserve made waste hour chasing hunter fisherman fish game sell fish guy seapost best way level hunter save gem sell sell gem everyone pretty much lot xp gold fishin athena emmisary unlock reaching pirate legend pretty boring voyage overrated reward disappointed supposed big endgame company fun stuff meh sea dog arena company arena seperate gamemode adventure pvp constant action 15 minute straight huge fun love cosmetic really coolest posh stuff ever lol world event enjoy best pve game offer reward pretty huge compared regular emmisary voyage flameheart giant bearded face sky screaming time everyone hate fight ghost fleet reward plenty also get lot supply ashen wind bos island decent reward also get unique cool flamethrower skull sell 10k bad skeleton fleet probably challanging pve say especially small ship loot haul pretty big fastest way level emmisary flag high quantity item get active fort skeleton wave bos get decent loot fort damned biggest loot haul get game beware people try steal number 1 event every server hopper dream main attraction pvp really fun thing steal adventure mode pvp best part game pvp give pleasure pvp game really unique experience battling pirate even pve anymore pvp see summarize key part oh boy beautifully complicated naval part manuever enemy stay broadside try get broadside thing spinning battle ship constantly fire eachother like caribbean movie unique move pull harpoon turning anchor turning adjusting sail surprise enemy good captain make difference winning losing battle cannon different type cannonball different purpose regular cannon put hole cursed ball million different useful purpose firebomb put ship ablaze blunderbombs damage player knock back repairing opinion best type chainshots knock mast soon unable move done sitting duck volley cannonfire soon follow good gunner hit shot good sequence make difference winning losing battle repairing every crew need good bilge rat make sure ship top shape ignore hole ship anything else like boarding shooting sinking priority worry sinking enemy later good bilge rat crew make difference winning losing battle boarding without doubt fun thing game boarding people killing 1 boarder put enemy anchor keep busy little usually good enough win battle dont even really kill usually busy boarder crew member continue putting pressure cannonfire putting hole able really focus repair active boarder othere hand fun much boarding downfall bad crew disorganized send many boarder either miss target die without significant damage severely undermanned ship survive enemy cannonfire boarder seen people abandoning ship hole board kill there nobody left repair come people take care ship ship must come first tl dr much fit review really rich game vast world well worth buying full price must buy really pirate life one thing must say though got ta play friend x10 fun solo sailing painful usually get boring really fast
2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Playing JUST Franchise mode for 50 hours. The game has lots of bugs that EA has to fix. Defense in this game sucks, usering on defense sucks, the AI on defense sucks. Broken plays like mesh spot or broken routes like the wheel route are automatic touchdowns cause the AI is stupid and leaves the receivers open and then realize they're getting burnt by a tight end with 80 speed when they have 93.  I know some others have complained about the online issues and I heard it's a lot worse. I don't recommend spending $70 on a game that will take months to fix, get the game on G2A where it's cheap, or when it's on sale, or when EA doesn't make this game anymore.

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"It feels like a lot of people are willing this game to fail, like they're salivating over having another Cyberpunk to get mad at. It's weird. 

If you liked the first game, you will love this one. It's much better in a lot of ways and is a better day 1 experience, but does fall down elsewhere.

Parkour is excellent, dropkicking bozos off of rooftops is still amazing, and there's a nice power curve that means you shouldn't judge how it feels after two hours. You feel like a million bucks once you get the grappling hook and start Mortal Kombating every nerd you see.

Your choices *do* matter, just not on the level many were expecting. It's also difficult to see exactly what can change without a manual save, quicksave, or new game plus. The aforementioned power curve does also make it less enticing to play a second time around as well, as you have to grind allll the way up again to simply sprint. 

The story is...not amazing, but the characters carry it. Hakon, Lawan, and Frank are great. Some of the side quests aren't quite Bloody Baron, but they are up there. 

Annoying that yet another AAA release is a few patches away from being what it could, but I don't think anyone at Techland is sleeping until it's where it should be.",feel like lot people willing game fail like salivating another cyberpunk get mad weird liked first game love one much better lot way better day 1 experience fall elsewhere parkour excellent dropkicking bozo rooftop still amazing nice power curve mean judge feel two hour feel like million buck get grappling hook start mortal kombating every nerd see choice matter level many expecting also difficult see exactly change without manual save quicksave new game plus aforementioned power curve also make le enticing play second time around well grind allll way simply sprint story amazing character carry hakon lawan frank great side quest quite bloody baron annoying yet another aaa release patch away could think anyone techland sleeping
1336490,Against the Storm,"I highly recommend this game. It's one of the few 10 out of 10 games for me.

What makes this game so great is that building the 100th settlement is just as exciting as building the 1st settlement. They do this by limiting what tools and resources you have available to work with in each run, but also giving you clear and achievable goals. So, the puzzle always feels fresh, with new solutions to think through.

The game also has a long and great meta-progression system, and many tiers of difficulties. The dark fairytale rainpunk vibe is also really engaging.

This game is for anyone who wants a challenging but low pressure, methodical resource management game.",highly recommend game one 10 10 game make game great building 100th settlement exciting building 1st settlement limiting tool resource available work run also giving clear achievable goal puzzle always feel fresh new solution think game also long great meta progression system many tier difficulty dark fairytale rainpunk vibe also really engaging game anyone want challenging low pressure methodical resource management game

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"I'm not someone who usually leaves a review. I occasionally leave a meme one or a short one to fulfill a Steam Badge requirement, but otherwise I never really leave a review, let alone a negative one.

Dying Light 2 is an exception.

Dying Light as a franchise means a lot to me, both as a gamer and content creator. I've been able to play, have fun, participate in competitions, make many new friends online, and even be lucky enough to make an online career out of making content for both games. My recent life has been shaped a lot by these games and I'm thankful for the great stuff that has happened because of it.

When DL2 first came out, I was overhyped to play it, but ever since my first playthrough my opinion of it mellowed. There are many reasons to point out why, whether it being the awful story, barely any meaningful choices, failing to live up to promises, or the numerous unplayable bugs, or missing features that made its predecessor great. And don't forget the numerous delays. Still, I had good faith in Techland despite all this and stuck through with them based on their history with DL1 and listening to community feedback.

But then it started to get even worse. Game breaking or softlocking bugs not getting patched until months later, or even new bugs being introduced with each patch! There were even numerous balancing changes, like the grappling hook nerf, Korek Charm nerf (that even Franchise Director Tymon Smektala didn't even know about!) or the ""Return To Mission Area"" feature that basically killed all kinds of out of bounds exploration. There were ways to get the Kadoom Shotgun or Broomstick Easter Egg items into free roam, but Techland also patched those out. There were even numerous speedrun exploits, routes or tricks that were pretty much all patched out, which had zero effect on regular players, which felt slightly malicious at first because it felt like Techland were targeting speedrunners! You would think that in a game all about player choice and freedom, that LIMITING their freedom and forcing them to play more how you WANT them to play is a bad thing. 

But even after all of that, I thought to myself ""it's going to get better."" A few missteps can be corrected, and with 5 years of support, we can get a gem of a game just like the first. I've even participated greatly in community feedback, filling out forms, responding to social media posts and polls, and even talking to members of Techland during my visit to their headquarters last year alongside other creators. I felt that maybe if myself and others stick with Techland and persist through this, that there may be something great at the end.

Despite Bloody Ties being a disaster, the core game got some really nice and very needed changes from the Gut Feeling / Good Night Good Luck updates. This was the first time I started really seeing hope for the future. However, cracks were starting to show in that hope as well, as both updates included more ""balancing"" by nerfing Boosters and removing other features! It's like Techland was taking two steps forward, and one step back every update. But STILL, I stuck with Techland.

And then I found out about DL Points.

The predatory DL Points system that basically squeezes more money out of its playerbase is something that I think I'd only see in games from EA or other companies with bad rep. But the fact that this is happening with DL2 is heartbreaking, especially since it was Techland's idea to implement this, completely unrelated to Tencent. Before they released, there was a thought in my head that maybe they wouldn't mark the prices in a scummy way like other games have, I was too naive. There's honestly so much to unpack from DL Points but literally none of it is good, not even the damn UI design for the store page. Them phasing out buying DLC normally hurts even more.

And to think it would only get worse as the Summertime Update itself has very few meaningful changes, and most of them BAD. A knife animation? Cool, except for the fact that it came a month late after it was advertised, and it's only available for two DLC weapons as there are still no knives in the base game! There were also MORE BALANCING CHANGES where Techland nerfed Boosters again, as well as the Military Gear and numerous Legendary Weapon blueprints! 1.5 years later and they're still trying to balance a PvE game with no competitive leaderboards of any kind! And to think the best thing to come out of this update is simply the removal of the 20k night bonus xp cap, which funnily enough is something they added IN to the game post launch. So yeah, the best thing is reverting a BAD change they made.

This was the final straw, even for me. I'm tired of being strung up for over a year and a half now, with many negative changes that keep on coming to the game, enough to outweigh the positives at times. And with the predatory DL Points system, that's pretty much it. I'll only stick around for DLC2 to see how much of a potential mess that will be. After that? Who knows.

Techland pride themselves on listening to community feedback. So if they really want to prove that statement, they need to remove DL Points and pull the game back from the edge of the cliff it's on right now, because otherwise, I'm never going back to this game.

294100,RimWorld,"Full underground base, chemfuel stored in a granite room with no cables in the walls so I figured it was safe, a Zzzt event set a colonist on fire who fled into the chemfuel stockpile, the stockpile exploded destroying the wall between it and the hallway. 

The initial explosion was fairly well contained but the heat from the fire raised the temperature in the communal hall to several hundred degrees in about 15 seconds then all the furniture caught fire as well. there was nowhere for the heat to go and relatively little space to heat up so it turned the whole place into a furnace, even the coolers caught fire, then the food caught fire. The communal hall included all the hallways that went throughout my base (ironically to make temperature control easier) so there was no way to get out of the base other than to go through the communal hall. 

One dumbass died in the initial explosion, three caught fire in the halls before reaching the shelter of the adjacent rooms, those already in those rooms caught fire as they were dying of heatstroke, the communal hall reached over two thousand degrees Celsius.

There were no survivors.

703080,Planet Zoo,"Planet Zoo is probably the game that I was most interested in of the last 10 years, which might seem a little weird, but the premise of the game literally ticks all my boxes. Not only have I worked with exotic animals for my entire adult life (which showing my age, is quite a long time), I have an avid interest in animal breeding genetics, conservation, and video games. It's a bit of a hard combo to meet all these interests, so the original Zoo Tycoon series (topped by Zoo Tycoon 2) is one of my favourite games of all time (ignoring the hideous console reboot of course which I like to pretend doesn't exist).  Planet Zoo released when I was wallowing pretty deeply in depression and haven't had much time for video games, so I haven't quite managed to get the pleasure out of it I'd hoped for, but that's certainly no fault of the game. 100 hours later and I've finally mustered up a few words to start reviewing again, and almost made a decent looking custom enclosure or two... 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Stunning graphics
[*] Realistic animal behaviour
[*] Complex Breeding and Genetics
[*] Ample Tycoon / Management Mechanics if you want them, and a Sandbox if you don't
[*] Franchise mode which allows you to link multiple zoos and get a great feeling of progression
[*] 62 million (feels like) customization options
[*] Extensive workshop support and amazing fanbase of creators
[*] Lots of conservation information and very educational
[*] Regular updates and new content
[*] Interesting campaign with some stunning pre-built zoos
[*] One of the narrators is Welsh
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Perfect customization is a bit fiddly with a high learning curve. Expect to spend hours making a single wall at first, if you don't want to use the workshop
[*] I expect the rising cost of buying all the DLC is going to start putting some people off who are new to the game
[*] The pathing system still makes me want to throw things at my computer
[/list]

I think that Planet Zoo is everything that we could have hoped for in both a successor to Zoo Tycoon 2 from an animal simulation perspective, and a successor to Planet Coaster from a tycoon perspective. Planet Coaster initially lacked in tycoon elements and campaign features, but feedback was definitely listened to and Planet Coaster has a much deeper array of management tools, as well as a fully fleshed campaign complete with storyline and voiceover. Also one of the narrators is Welsh, and hearing a Welsh accent unexpectedly when I first played the game brought a rare smile to my face.

It gets a double thumbs up from me. Right, back to encouraging animals to get it on.

105600,Terraria,"[h1] You feel an evil presence watching you... [/h1]
This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end. 

Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health. 

My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected. 

Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...

All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game.

548430,Deep Rock Galactic,"Rock and Stone, reader, take a moment to read my review : 

In an era of unyielding greed where publishers release half-arsed games with day-one DLCs, an era where graphics are put before gameplay, an era of toxicity where people are just after their high score and shiny cosmetics - comes one of Steam's most underrated games : Deep Rock Galactic ! Yes I dare say Underrated !

A game where you dig ore, and fight bugs . Simple as ? There is plenty of variation, and the developers make sure to periodically add something new to the mix - something new that is not behind any pay-wall or trickery.
The moment you buy the game, there is no need to pay for anything else, unless you want to support the developers and get some tasteful , world-coherent cosmetics

Ghost Ship Games have created a gameplay loop that is simplistic enough to follow , yet compelling enough that it does not get repetitive . Ever been into one of those co-op games where if one person has the wrong item or load-out, everyone loses ? Well not here, all builds are viable - no cookie cutting required, just point at the bug and shoot at it simple as .
These people have put quality and community first and foremost 

But the most beautiful thing about this game is one simple thing, one thing that I have never seen in an online game in a long time and never to this extend : Cooperation ! You have never seen a game where strangers will work together and help each other quite like this . It's as if going back to the first days of a MMORPG where everyone is just glad to be there and glad to fulfill their role

In the deep dangerous depths of Hoxxes, you aren't just the employees of a mysterious interplanetary mining corporation, you are not just strangers on a job - you are Brothers 

You must have played one of those mmorpgs where you just rush rush rush to the next objective ! Next marker, next checklist, next SHINY - when was the last time you danced and slammed ales with your brothers just for the fun of it ?! Well in this game, that is what you do best
This ""silly game about dwarves"" has more soul into it than most games released within the last ten years , here in the big cold web you can find friendship .

If you decide to buy this game, be sure to be the dwarf you wish to have at your side ! Here dear reader, you will find friendship.

Be the Dwarf that Karl would approve of !",rock stone reader take moment read review era unyielding greed publisher release half arsed game day one dlcs era graphic put gameplay era toxicity people high score shiny cosmetic come one steam underrated game deep rock galactic yes dare say underrated game dig ore fight bug simple plenty variation developer make sure periodically add something new mix something new behind pay wall trickery moment buy game need pay anything else unless want support developer get tasteful world coherent cosmetic ghost ship game created gameplay loop simplistic enough follow yet compelling enough get repetitive ever one co op game one person wrong item load everyone loses well build viable cookie cutting required point bug shoot simple people put quality community first foremost beautiful thing game one simple thing one thing never seen online game long time never extend cooperation never seen game stranger work together help quite like going back first day mmorpg everyone glad glad fulfill role deep dangerous depth hoxxes employee mysterious interplanetary mining corporation stranger job brother must played one mmorpgs rush rush rush next objective next marker next checklist next shiny last time danced slammed ale brother fun well game best silly game dwarf soul game released within last ten year big cold web find friendship decide buy game sure dwarf wish side dear reader find friendship dwarf karl would approve

1144200,Ready or Not,"Look, I am not exaggerating here when I say this but, Ready or Not is genuinely one of the most thrilling, nerve-wrecking, exciting and best games I have played so far this year. For someone like me that grew up playing SWAT 4 pretty much every day after school on my dad's old Dell PC this game brings back a lot of nostalgia for me which makes it even better. I think I speak for all of us that played SWAT 4 when I say we have all been waiting and seething for a similar title that can scratch that itch - Ready or Not does just that. The game is fantastic in every single aspect. I also love how punishing and difficult it can be at times. The margin for error is very small, which just adds to the realism. 

The game very much fits the ""Early Access"" model at this current state and content is neither here nor there in my book. At the moment there are currently 6 vastly different maps, a hotel, a gas station, a crack house, a port, a farm and a car dealership. All 6 of aforementioned maps are beautifully crafted with the visuals immediately immersing you in the world you are playing in. The sound design is awesome as well, might I add. The sound of explosions, flashbangs, the guns, they sound and feel impactful, something even AAA studios fail to replicate at times. 

The AI are either good or straight up stupid at times, they are definitely the one thing that needs the most work. But I find that most of the time they do work relatively fine. 

I hope to see the implementation of achievements - which would be cool to grind for/incentivise us to play - and more customisation - that stays true to real life, of course, Jesus forbid we get another RS6 - and potentially more weapons to fool around with. The game comes in expensive at around 35 bucks but if you are looking to get your tactical shooter fix, Ready or Not will do just that for you.",look exaggerating say ready genuinely one thrilling nerve wrecking exciting best game played far year someone like grew playing swat 4 pretty much every day school dad old dell pc game brings back lot nostalgia make even better think speak u played swat 4 say waiting seething similar title scratch itch ready game fantastic every single aspect also love punishing difficult time margin error small add realism game much fit early access model current state content neither book moment currently 6 vastly different map hotel gas station crack house port farm car dealership 6 aforementioned map beautifully crafted visuals immediately immersing world playing sound design awesome well might add sound explosion flashbangs gun sound feel impactful something even aaa studio fail replicate time ai either good straight stupid time definitely one thing need work find time work relatively fine hope see implementation achievement would cool grind incentivise u play customisation stay true real life course jesus forbid get another rs6 potentially weapon fool around game come expensive around 35 buck looking get tactical shooter fix ready

221100,DayZ,"I entered a house, desperate and hungry, looking for some food. I heard some footsteps outside.

The guy said ""hey"", and entered the house.

I said ""hey"" back.

He hit me with a hammer.

This was the beginning of a beautiful tale... the tale... of the Shoe Gang.

I ran out of the house and up the street as far and as fast as I could. I stopped and turned around to see if I was being followed by this crazy hammer man. I stood there, hungry and demoralised.

Then there was a voice... ""Behind you, behind you""! Out of nowhere and in all his glory, another player... apparently much friendlier than my previous encounter.

I told him what had happened in town. He charged off... ""Let's get this mother fucker"".

Armed only with my ten fingers curled into balls, we ran at the Hammer Man, who after seeing our number had doubled, decided to take a more diplomatic approach.

He apologised for hitting me with his hammer, and explained he simply wanted my shoes for his friend. Little did he know that I had just found the most pristine pair of shoes in the house where we first met.

They were my shoes now.

Agreeing to put our differences aside, the three of us teamed up in search of the finest shoes for the Hammer Man’s friend. We searched high and we searched low, but there were no shoes to be found. Finally, we met up with the shoeless man, whose shoes certainly were in a state of disrepair. Unable to tolerate the toes of the bare footed any longer, the four of us left town and made our way across the countryside.

Sometime later, we encountered another survivor. He had a nice hat, but we weren't there for hats. He was clearly uncomfortable, and he was right to be, as the Hammer Man had been stashing a secret pistol this whole time. We were explaining our need for shoes when the Hammer Man went for the kill.

Unknown to the survivor, the gun went to the back of his head. Hammer Man pulled the trigger. He completely missed the shot. Listening to the Hammer Man’s accent he appeared to be French, which for me, an Englishman, explained his inability to handle a firearm at 3 centimetres.

The Hammer Man pulled out his primary hammer and bashed the survivor over the head. It was terrible to witness, and mentally scarring. 

Utterly traumatised, the rest of us piled in with our fists. We were careful not to hit his shoes, but it turned out that he too was wearing worn footwear. However, it was enough, and our friend fitted the loafers over his aching toes.

The four of us marched on. The fields of Livonia seemed to stretch forever, and the rain began to fall. We found an old abandoned house, apparently half-shelled but yet still standing. One of the boys lit a fire in the fireplace.

It was beautiful.

We properly introduced ourselves. Bonds were formed. Shoes were discussed.

It was a moment cut short. My saviour in town announced that his shoes were now unfit for purpose, and so our thirst for shoes was far from satiated.

After much searching, my new friend had to go, leaving myself, the Hammer Man and his friend to fend for ourselves. We moved on... shoes won't wear themselves.

The rain gave way and we pushed on, the scent of leather driving us through the forests. The three remaining members of The Shoe Gang took part in some fishing. We sat round a fire and cooked, and we discussed our shoe filled fantasies.

We moved on and day began to turn into night. Darkness was our environment. Nature began to stir and the sound of wolves filled the air. It didn't take long. We were outnumbered. Our shoes were worn out, and they were upon us in the blink of an eye.

Hammer Man was the first to fall, flailing his gavel relentlessly as the beasts took him. I attacked the alpha wolf with a big stick which only seemed to anger him. Soon everything began to fade, the blood loss was traumatic and I slipped into darkness. Many hours had passed with my new friends, and my last memories were of them dying.

Darkness came. Silence followed. A loud ringing in my ears...

The wolves killed us all. I have no doubt that they took all of our shoes.",entered house desperate hungry looking food heard footstep outside guy said hey entered house said hey back hit hammer beginning beautiful tale tale shoe gang ran house street far fast could stopped turned around see followed crazy hammer man stood hungry demoralised voice behind behind nowhere glory another player apparently much friendlier previous encounter told happened town charged let get mother fucker armed ten finger curled ball ran hammer man seeing number doubled decided take diplomatic approach apologised hitting hammer explained simply wanted shoe friend little know found pristine pair shoe house first met shoe agreeing put difference aside three u teamed search finest shoe hammer man friend searched high searched low shoe found finally met shoeless man whose shoe certainly state disrepair unable tolerate toe bare footed longer four u left town made way across countryside sometime later encountered another survivor nice hat hat clearly uncomfortable right hammer man stashing secret pistol whole time explaining need shoe hammer man went kill unknown survivor gun went back head hammer man pulled trigger completely missed shot listening hammer man accent appeared french englishman explained inability handle firearm 3 centimetre hammer man pulled primary hammer bashed survivor head terrible witness mentally scarring utterly traumatised rest u piled fist careful hit shoe turned wearing worn footwear however enough friend fitted loafer aching toe four u marched field livonia seemed stretch forever rain began fall found old abandoned house apparently half shelled yet still standing one boy lit fire fireplace beautiful properly introduced bond formed shoe discussed moment cut short saviour town announced shoe unfit purpose thirst shoe far satiated much searching new friend go leaving hammer man friend fend moved shoe wear rain gave way pushed scent leather driving u forest three remaining member shoe gang took part fishing sat round fire cooked discussed shoe filled fantasy moved day began turn night darkness environment nature began stir sound wolf filled air take long outnumbered shoe worn upon u blink eye hammer man first fall flailing gavel relentlessly beast took attacked alpha wolf big stick seemed anger soon everything began fade blood loss traumatic slipped darkness many hour passed new friend last memory dying darkness came silence followed loud ringing ear wolf killed u doubt took shoe

1931770,Chants of Sennaar,"This is 2 games:
1 very bad real time stealth game, that at least has resets fast, not worth talking about and that the 2nd game would definitely be much better without. It keeps popping up bit makes up less than 1/8 of everything.
1 very good adventure game with better-than-within-Myst pattern-correlation-puzzles rotating around language ciphers.
This sounds intimidatingly difficult, but it is not only very easy combination-puzzles, but also not mandatory for most progress, as countless poor but good enough guesses are always good enough for progress.

Despite having an excellent automated-Journal for automatic-notes, and middle-mouse-for-interactive-object-highlighting, it suffers from minor design flaws like ""One door is poorly hidden in the corner of a horizontally scrolling room behind a staircase"" and ""It has fast some travel but lacks fast-movement"" and ""sub-optimally implementing timing puzzlers but insisting on having more than 1 timing-puzzle-as-a-boss-monster (the only way limited-time puzzles should be used, like Zelda games tend to do).

Narrative is linear and nice, that this is fine, its just not as good of a linear narrative as ToTheMoon or Undertale.
The puzzle+exploration game-play sure is not as great as OuterWilds (where translation is automated and history/cultures are the focus).
Every modern adventure game now must learn from TheForgottenCity, that merges adventure-exploration+puzzles with many nonlinear ImmersiveSim games, and ChantsOfSennar gets there a little bit, but stays too much in the realms of linear-narrative contained-puzzle-room-games like PlaydeadInside.

It is well segmented into 5 themes, but the last-of-5-area feels a bit rushed, falling significantly shorter and simpler, but at least it manages to fill in all the possible gaps of all the previous non-mandatory-puzzle-solutions.

2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"[h2]For new players:[/h2]
This is a deep and complex war game, focusing on the titanic struggle between gods for supremacy of a fantasy world. The nations are mostly based on real-world mythologies and histories, and while there are similar themes and a few shared units between some of them, each one is and [i]feels like[/i] a unique nation, with the aforementioned similarities being an enhancement of the flavor and storytelling. The options for gods are many, and there are innumerable strategies for victory - but there are only a few [i]paths[/i] to victory, all of them conflict oriented. This is not like Civilization, this is not like Stellaris - this is War, brutal and terrible. Your soldiers will get lasting injuries. If you're lucky, your mages will grow old and die. Your population will be decimated by horrible magic. Your heroes will be killed by assassins or horrors from beyond. Your God may also be slain, but like Innana, may be risen from the dead to continue the fight. A ""Cultural Victory"" is extinguishing belief in your enemies, and a ""Technology victory"" is having the most powerful magic and using it effectively. There is no peaceful option in the contest for all possible chips.

There are more than 100 nations across three distinct ages, and several thousand units and commanders, many with special abilities. Careful consideration will be required, as will studying your opponent's forces to glean their weaknesses, and then you will need to find ways to exploit those weaknesses. There is a ton of stuff to go through - more spells than you will ever cast, more items than you will ever forge, and combined with the variety of units, there are a [i]technically[/i] calculable but incomprehensibly large number of options for you and your opponents to choose from, and your strategy will have to evolve and change to meet the latest threat. There isn't a clear optimal order of operations, nor are all options equally valid - everything is in a constant state of flux, as gods awaken and their blessings grow stronger, as new magic sites are found, as new spells are rediscovered. The manual to this game is hundreds of pages long, and it still doesn't cover every last thing in extreme detail - which for some is a negative, but for me is a positive, as learning through experience is what I find fun. You will need to think on your toes, and you will probably lose several times before you win your first game, but it is a rich and rewarding experience. 

The game itself is a grand strategy auto-battler, and consists of a campaign map (which can have several layers and planes) and battle maps, and is based on concurrent turns. In battle, you will position your troops, and give them general orders to follow. You will script your commanders and mages with more granularity, but after the first five rounds, the AI will determine their movements and actions, and it generally does a good job, if not always doing what you would want. Coming from a total war background, it can be frustrating to not have your soldiers capitalize on every gap you can see, but it is a different system, and you get to spend your time fretting the innumerable possibilities beforehand and you get to sit back and actually [i]watch[/i] the battle.

[h2]For experienced players:[/h2]
 Dominions 6 is similar enough to feel familiar, but different enough to make you rethink your go-to strategies. 

[h3]Gameplay:[/h3]
From my experience, the game seems to be shifted more in favor of a slower expansion, expecting you to field larger armies than before, and to consider your targets more carefully.  The Fog of War is a nice addition, and encourages you to send out more scouts to determine which direction to focus your war machine on. Features like Auto-searching for magic sites, inventory sorting, and commander loadout search [i]by magic item[/i] are all welcome QoL improvements. Spells and Magic items have been shuffled around, and there are plenty of new options to consider as well. I haven't had much interaction with the new mount mechanics as yet, but seeing riders thrown from their dying horses is a nice touch. In a similar vein, Assassinations have been greatly improved by the wholesale slaughter of taverngoers. Almost as excitingly, there's now an in-built multiplayer lobby!

The new bless system may take some time to come to grips with, as it separates bless points from path points to some degree, but I think it's a positive change, especially for multiplayer. Effectively, bless points are determined by each non-native path level of 3 or higher, while the bless options are based on path strength. It should allow for greater variety, and less predictability - if you want several smaller blesses in the same path, for instance, you no longer have to sink tons of design points into a ""tall"" path build, and can instead broaden into other paths and still meet the requirements. 

The new Scales system is interesting. You can't dump/max scales as readily as before, as they are bounded within a more narrow range depending on your nation and pretender. That said, the total possible strength of scales have been increased from +/-3 to +/-5, allowing for magic and thrones to push a province well outside safe levels of a given scale.

The AI also seems to be significantly improved, using a much stronger mix of national troops, supplementing with a variety of summons and (to a much lesser degree) independent soldiers - meaning that AI opponents feel more thematic.

The UI is going to take some getting used to, but I'll get there in a few days. Most screens are now found in a tiny bar of icons at the top of the screen, and everything is accessible through key commands (""?"" to view key commands for each window). This decision opens the screen up greatly, and most of it is taken up by the campaign map, rather than being hidden behind the UI on smaller devices. 

[h3]The Map:[/h3]
Uploading a blueprint and having the game generate a map based on it is really cool, as is its support of an absurd number of provinces (1985). So far I've only played with the Overworld and Cavern layers, but I can't wait for the custom maps with elemental planes, alternate dimensions, etc. The province connections in created maps are still sometimes a little wonky, but seem significantly better than previous installments. I haven't yet seen terraforming in action, but it is a new mechanic, and I am excited to play with it.

 [h3]The Music:[/h3]
It's pretty good. At the moment, I don't like it as much as Dom 5's - which I am certain I and others said at the release of Dom 5 in comparison to Dom 4's music. I think it will grow on me, as Dom 5's did (which I now listen to at work). It's capable, and I appreciate the fading shift when entering battles. If you want to play with other music, unfortunately for the moment you are relegated to replacing the in-game music entirely, and this is rigidly locked. I hope that this is addressed at some point, as I would like to be able to throw the music from the other games into folders and have it pull from there.

Unfortunately I have to get ready for work, and have already spent too much time on this review, so it will have to do. My overall takeaway is that if you enjoy auto-battlers, deep strategic gameplay, and deep mythological lore, you will likely find this to be a worthwhile purchase.

1336490,Against the Storm,"I'm coming at this as a person who has been obsessed with city-building and economy-based games my entire life. I've tried just about all of them, from more normal city-builders to 4X games to factory simulators. I've seen a lot of novel game designs. Normally they're interesting for about a couple weeks, then you get kinda bored once you've mastered the gameplay mechanics and move on to the next one.

Not this game. That's why I've come to spread the word, my friends.

Eremite games have created a real masterpiece here. Not just because the game is so well designed, but because they've essentially invented a new genre: the Rogue-like (randomized) City-Builder.

Now some of you are probably thinking: ""Isn't that what Frostpunk did?"" Well, not really. There's aspects of this game that are definitely very inspired by Frostpunk (the storm cycle, for one), but other than that, it's quite different. Frostpunk had a randomized story generator laid over the game. But Against the Storm is something else - the randomization is built into the very core of the gameplay itself, which essentially means every game you have different buildings, buffs, and supply chains. I'd almost describe Against the Storm as ""What if Frostpunk and the Anno series had a baby?"" If this sounds interesting to you, let me explain a bit.

If you're into Rogue-like games at all, you know that they're designed to be infinitely replayable. Every round is different than the last because you start mostly blank, and develop all your skills and powers as the game progresses through a randomly generated map. And then in addition there's generally a difficulty level that can be raised continuously (Hard 1, Hard 2, Hard 3.. etc) so that a pro player can continue to make the game more and more difficult as they get better.

This game follows the same design philosophy. I'm not gonna go way into detail about how the randomness works exactly -  It uses standard Rogue-like methods (choose 1 of 3 randomly selected buffs, etc). But the point of my review is to convey the point of this. A lot of people seem to be skeptical of playing a randomized city-builder where you don't have total control over what buildings you have on any given round. And I want to alleviate that concern by stating why that actually makes it way more fun.

It's the replayability factor. It's knowing that every game I jump in is gonna present new challenges that are different from the previous game. That I'm gonna be given a different set of buildings to work with, and that I have to figure out a way to make a strong economy using the hand I was dealt, with a completely different set of negative effects on my villagers, with a completely different set of passive bonuses that interact with my buildings or my workers. Exploring the maps is actually both fun and stressful because I haven't even discovered all the ""dangerous events"" that you find out in the woods as you chop down trees, and if you don't deal with them as you find them they can take your village down.

In many ways I view this game as being like the Yin to Anno 1800's Yang - where that game is a ""Macro"" game, and revolves around maintaining many, many different supply chains at the same time across numerous cities, Against the Storm is a ""micro"" game that takes place in fast, completely randomized rounds. The base concept is somewhat similar - create products through increasingly complex supply chains that make your villagers happy. But here, the game has a Micro feel that's a lot more similar to Frostpunk - It's punishing, there's randomization of what buildings and passive buffs you have available, and it's a constant struggle to figure out what goods and services you're going to be able to provide to your villagers.

Even if you're a bit skeptical at first, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot. If you're already familiar with rogue-likes at all, I think you'll find the combination is quite natural. For me, I know I'm gonna be slowly cranking up the difficulty on this game for the conceivable future. Oh, and with the steady stream of updates that these devs are putting out, it doesn't look like there's gonna be a lack of new content, either.

1190970,House Flipper 2,"Honestly, I have no idea why they would call it House Flipper 2, yet give us limited content. This game, in no way shape or form comes close to the greatness of House Flipper 1. For starters, This game is missing the assemble mini game. That is something we all loved in House Flipper 1. Secondly, no mini map to guide you. No curtains, seriously? no blinds, no nothing for the windows. Goes to show, this game was rushed. This game just doesnt have that House ""Flippery"" feeling. House Flipper 1 had such a great feeling. I am happy that now we can make our own houses from the ground up and the game has a great concept behind it. That, I am thankful for, but at the same time, as usual when it comes to sequels, why the hell remove stuff that made its previous game so great. Oh, and no carpets, seriously? The list goes on and on....and the most highly requested feature, co-op is still missing! Powerwash Simulator made it happened! you guys should too. This is something that has been requested for ages now! I really dont see how this game is supposed to be better (thats the point of sequels right?) 

I have huge trust in Frozen District, and I would love to see this game make a huge turn around and be the great sequel is meant to be. But as of right now, it plainly sucks! its so bland! no roaches, no moles, its just meh! no pools!!! again nothing! 

pros

-nice graphics
-okish in game mechanics
- nice houses
- looks a bit promising nothing more!

cons
- Imagine House Flipper 1 without its great features and the things you love from it, it sucks right? thats what you will get with this game. 

I will be on the look out for the upcoming updates, and if by any chance, this game becomes the solid sequel is meant to be, ill happily change my review. I am a House Flipper fan, and trust me, it hurts to leave a bad review in a game I was looking forward to.",honestly idea would call house flipper 2 yet give u limited content game way shape form come close greatness house flipper 1 starter game missing assemble mini game something loved house flipper 1 secondly mini map guide curtain seriously blind nothing window go show game rushed game doesnt house flippery feeling house flipper 1 great feeling happy make house ground game great concept behind thankful time usual come sequel hell remove stuff made previous game great oh carpet seriously list go highly requested feature co op still missing powerwash simulator made happened guy something requested age really dont see game supposed better thats point sequel right huge trust frozen district would love see game make huge turn around great sequel meant right plainly suck bland roach mole meh pool nothing pro nice graphic okish game mechanic nice house look bit promising nothing con imagine house flipper 1 without great feature thing love suck right thats get game look upcoming update chance game becomes solid sequel meant ill happily change review house flipper fan trust hurt leave bad review game looking forward

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"A great release by Paradox standards.
     The game builds off of everything CK2 accomplished, and feels complete and polished from day one. The improved graphics add a ton to the immersion, and the new mechanics add needed depth to gameplay systems. The writing is improved over CK2 and there seems to be way more events, both small and large, and everything is absurd as ever. Combat systems were redone and play much better in this game. The UI also feels much cleaner. It's as complex as it always has been, but that's what makes it great. This game is an improvement in pretty much every way, and I am not at all disappointed. A worthy heir.

This feels like the definitive Crusader Kings experience. As always with Paradox games, it will only get better with time.

 If you've never played Crusader Kings, try CK2 for free first. If you like CK2, this is an easy buy.",great release paradox standard game build everything ck2 accomplished feel complete polished day one improved graphic add ton immersion new mechanic add needed depth gameplay system writing improved ck2 seems way event small large everything absurd ever combat system redone play much better game ui also feel much cleaner complex always make great game improvement pretty much every way disappointed worthy heir feel like definitive crusader king experience always paradox game get better time never played crusader king try ck2 free first like ck2 easy buy

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"I hate to say this and it's sad to see - but the state of the game now is awful. Yes it plays quite well and visually looks better than ever - but it's really lost that PUBG magic and feel. Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions. Everything just feels cluttered and complicated as soon as you log on with a very messy UI.

When you get into a lobby you're now greeted by people running around as multi coloured anime looking characters/skins, and I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point... It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!

It really feels like the Devs completely lost the roadmap and made the rest up as they went along, stealing other games recipes and jumbling it up into one mess.

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"This is my first steam review, and it probably won't be read in the sea of other comments on this title, but I felt that despite years of gaming (okay, decades) I've never felt the urge to strongly recommend a purchase until now. Sure, there are things I would have preferred to be more complex, spoilt by the combat systems of Dark souls and the Witcher, but what's so special about this game is the storytelling and the creative courage Ninja Theory bring. 

This isn't just a game. This is a sincere artwork, using game design, to tell the most compelling story about psychosis I've ever experienced. They did their homework, not just with the depiction of mental illness, but also on the wonderful Norse mythology, joyously wrestled from the bubblegum claws of Marvel studios and told with all its blood and guts and grim darkness. 

Senua is easily the most human heroine I've seen in any game ever, and while there have been more 'strong' female characters, there's no heroism like the heroism of the truly broken and crippled. She has to fight her demons, and it's all the more meaningful because unlike fem-Shepard who eats Reapers for breakfast, you can see in the gorgeously motion captured performance of Senua's face, that she is truly terrified as she fights. 

This game is short. This game probably has awful replay value. All the same, this game is a MUST play.",first steam review probably read sea comment title felt despite year gaming okay decade never felt urge strongly recommend purchase sure thing would preferred complex spoilt combat system dark soul witcher special game storytelling creative courage ninja theory bring game sincere artwork using game design tell compelling story psychosis ever experienced homework depiction mental illness also wonderful norse mythology joyously wrestled bubblegum claw marvel studio told blood gut grim darkness senua easily human heroine seen game ever strong female character heroism like heroism truly broken crippled fight demon meaningful unlike fem shepard eats reaper breakfast see gorgeously motion captured performance senua face truly terrified fight game short game probably awful replay value game must play
