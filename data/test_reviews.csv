The biggest problem with the game is the grind, you can tell that a lot of artificial progress walls have been put in place to tempt you to buy ""time savers"" from the in game store. This will always be bad practice and I hate it.

Overall the game is good, but personally I would only pick it up at a discount so that Ubisoft get as little money as possible out of principle.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"// Please scroll down to ""EDIT #3"" - I still like the game, but the devs have dropped the ball in a few ways

For an early access game, Hell Let Loose does everything right.

This is the best modern WW2 shooter on the market IMO. You have the pacing/action of Red Orchestra/Rising Storm with the tactical play of Squad and PS.

Unlike Squad and PS, you won't have 30 minute breaks between fighting and won't have to wait 15+ minutes after the match starts to fight. The maps are large enough, but their design encourages players to get into the action quickly, while still retaining a very important tactical meta. That meta doesn't just include field tactics such as flanking, defending, finding superior firing positions, etc., but also a Commander role which leads your team and has the power to call supply drops, strafing runs, and bombing runs.

Armor can dominate the battlefield if used appropriately, and player-controlled artillery guns can wreak havoc on enemy positions. The experience of being an infantryman while tactically pushing forward alongside armor and a platoon's worth of soldiers, while being hailed with artillery and enemy small arms fire, is really a sight to see.


There is both role and career progression that unlocks authentically-appropriate cosmetics, FOR FREE. No MTX, no lootboxes, you can only earn these items by playing the game.

The devs post updates almost weekly; some are small, and some are quite large.

There are 5 completed maps on live servers, 1 more is being released within the next few weeks, and they stated they have 3 additional maps in the current development pipeline (community believes at least one of these is Carentan). (edit: I think it's more like 10 or 11 maps at this point, with plenty more on the way)

Graphics are surely good enough. Audio design and animations could use some reworking, which is exactly what is happening. The current audio for weapons and animations for weapons/movement are being upgraded significantly at the moment, and this update will be pushed to player clients within the next few months.

The devs have stated they intend to include the Asian theatre (likely US-Japanese) and Eastern Front. 

If you were disappointed by BFV, this game might be for you. It doesn't exactly play like BF, it isn't quite a sandbox. And you really really need to work with your team. Having a mic is preferable, but most leaders in-game will be OK with your presence as long as you can understand/follow orders and occasionally type in the chat.

Very bright future ahead for HLL, and it's already shining quite a bit IMO.

I rate HLL in its current state an 8.5/10, and I believe the release product will be truly amazing.

EDIT #1: Changed 4 maps to 5 maps.

EDIT #2: Adding performance information I posted in another thread -

i7 3820
EVGA GTX 1080 FTW
16GB 2333mhz
850 EVO SSD
1440p

Almost all maxed settings, slightly higher than default FOV, and two settings on Medium - I think one is Shadows and I forget the other. FX/textures are definitely kept maxed. Also using FXAA. And setting corpse despawn to lowest possible.

Steady 60 - 90, drops to 40-45 with heavy action/lots of players. Pretty playable, it's not like a twitch reaction shooter like CoD that often, though I still would like a better processor. But due to Intel's annoying socket release I'm stuck with this until I get a fully new PC.

EDIT #3: Well, things have faltered slightly. Since I last updated this review, the devs have added MTX and a console version. Pacing of updates has slowed down as well, and the game suffers from long periods of imbalance in which everyone (including the devs) agree certain features aren't working well, but they refuse to diverge from their ""once every 5 to 6 months"" patch schedule.

Example: they are deactivating the Commander's Final Stand ability in the upcoming early December update (U11)  - this has literally been publicly known to be exploitable for YEARS.

It's still a great game, but there are rough edges that will likely never be sorted out. HLL is an indie game that likes to pretend it's AA, but it's far from it.","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",please scroll 3 dropped ball way early access hell loose best modern ww2 shooter market imo pacing action red orchestra rising storm tactical squad p unlike squad p 30 minute break fighting wait 15 minute start fight map large design encourages player action quickly retaining important tactical meta meta include field tactic flanking defending finding superior firing position commander role lead power call supply drop strafing run bombing run armor dominate battlefield appropriately controlled artillery gun wreak havoc enemy position infantryman tactically pushing forward alongside armor platoon worth soldier hailed artillery enemy small arm fire sight role career progression unlocks authentically appropriate cosmetic no_mtx no_lootboxes earn item post update weekly small large 5 completed map live server 1 released next week stated 3 additional map development pipeline community belief carentan 10 11 map plenty graphic surely good audio design animation reworking exactly happening audio weapon animation weapon movement upgraded significantly moment pushed client next month stated intend include asian theatre japanese eastern front disappointed bfv exactly bf sandbox really_emphasized mic preferable leader ok presence long understand follow order occasionally type chat bright future ahead hll already shining bit imo rate hll state 8 5 10 believe release product truly amazing 1 changed 4 map 5 map 2 adding performance information posted thread i7 3820 evga gtx 1080 ftw 16gb 2333mhz 850 evo ssd 1440p maxed setting slightly higher default fov setting medium shadow forget fx texture definitely maxed fxaa corpse despawn lowest possible steady 60 90 drop 40 45 heavy action lot player pretty playable not_like twitch reaction shooter cod processor due intel annoying socket release stuck fully pc 3 thing faltered slightly last updated mtx console version pacing update slowed suffers long period imbalance including agree certain feature working refuse diverge 5 6 month patch schedule example deactivating commander final stand upcoming early december u11 literally publicly known exploitable year s_emphasizedtill great rough edge never_be sorted hll indie like pretend aa far
582660,Black Desert,"I have now 5.660,5 hours on this account besides this I have a Beta account that I played on when the game came out. Aka let me tell you about the game that will make you lose your mind in multiple ways.

If you like exploring, traveling, following a story, questing and lifeskilling you will be drawn to this game from the get go. Also you can drop all your idea's of your perfect E-Girl in the character design. 

When the game just came out it was mostly grinding for a long amount of hours. For a regular player it took around 20 to 40 hours of playtime to get to lvl 50. Now the game has turned into a fresh start friendly game where you get to lvl 50 in just 1 hour of grinding. The game also gives new players tons of stuff to help you to get further into the game. This is not just a MMORPG. It's a Korean MMORPG. This means you will have to grind a fuck ton to be able to do anything besides the things i listed above here. PVP wont be possible if you dont put any time into the game.

Now to the beautiful fail stack system. This is BS RNG based but keeps the game fun if you don't have a temper. The game can make you super frustrated but when you manage to reach your goal you will have a feeling of accomplishment. 

IF RNG IS NOT YOUR THING DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!

When you read this you probably see comments about that the game is Pay to Win. This is BS. The game gives you tons of free stuff and it's easy to get the stuff you want by playing without spending money. But here is a big BUTT. If you want to lvl faster and get more money out of the time that you are grinding spending IRL money on pets/outfits could be an option.

The game end game is 100% focused on PVP. There are sometimes PVE events tho. 

This game is for the people that have a feeling that they need something to put a lot of time in. This is the solution for you. You will meet tons of people that you can play with. There are some guilds where I met tons of awesome players that don't mind to help new players out at all. 

If you checked all this text out Thanks and hopefully this was helpfull

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Previously having issues, I found out that there was a problem with my PC, and somehow was sussed out by GranBlue Relink.

Playing the game, Graphics are crisp and effects are stylish. My experience so fat (up to the first boss) has been quite enjoyable, though I fear from the initial impression that monsters may be a bit of a damage sponge moving forward.

Gameplay is reminiscent of GodEater and Metal Gear Solid: Revengence ( the MemEs jAck!), fights consists of exchanges between blocks and dodges while getting in their safe zones and attacking them where the sun doesn't shine. GBF players would be familiar with many of the Mobs/ Bosses, their fights reimagined in a 3D space where they can finally not blame their weapon grid for when they fail a boss. Oh yeah, it also incorporates GBF's Burst system as well, and it is satisfying to see each time it is executed ( exhaustion pending).

All in all, GBF: Relink is a great fix for those waiting for MH:Worlds, those itching to see how Gran's battles feel like as he adventures across the realms. 

My only gripe is that I wished they allowed gamepad button binding - but I believe developers are aware of this and am working on it.","Very Positive90% of the 19,808 user reviews for this game are positive.",previously issue found problem pc somehow sussed granblue relink graphic crisp effect stylish fat bos enjoyable fear initial impression monster bit damage sponge moving forward reminiscent godeater metal gear solid revengence meme jack fight consists exchange block dodge safe zone attacking sun shine gbf player familiar mob boss fight reimagined 3d space finally not_blame weapon grid fail bos oh yeah incorporates gbf burst satisfying executed exhaustion pending gbf relink great fix waiting mh world itching gran battle adventure across realm gripe wished allowed gamepad button binding believe developer aware working

2161700,Persona 3 Reload,"Persona 3 is a very special game to me. Back in 2008, I randomly was looking for things to play during the summer break and decided to play Persona 3 FES which also introduced me to the overall Shin Megami Tensei franchise. As a teen who usually played puzzle, FPS and platformers during that time, the game was unique to me as it delves into complex themes such as death, identity, and the meaning of life which was something a high schooler would never usually give a second thought. It also paved way for me to look at and start reading visual novels which is one of my favorite consumable medias.

I know this isn't a review of the game specifically but this game is one of the few games that shaped me as a person today and I am glad to experience it again with QoL improvements, better graphics and improved gameplay because let's be honest, Persona 3, P3 FES and P3 Portable isn't a fun game to play anymore with everything that Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal had to offer gameplay wise. This version of the game at least makes the overall dungeon crawling aspect of the game bearable. 

There's a few things I don't like about how Sega bundled the Soundtrack and Digital Artbook as a Program and not their usual respectable file types but this game is an absolute gem.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 7,943 user reviews for this game are positive.",persona 3 special 2008 randomly thing summer break decided persona 3 fe introduced shin megami tensei franchise teen usually puzzle shooter platformers unique delf complex theme death identity meaning life high schooler never_usually thought paved look reading visual novel favorite consumable medias specifically game shaped today glad qol improvement graphic improved honest persona 3 p3 fe p3 portable fun anymore persona 4 golden persona 5 royal offer wise version make dungeon crawling aspect bearable thing sega bundled soundtrack digital artbook program not_their usual respectable file type absolute gem

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I'd been playing this game since before World 3 was out; the game was [i]originally[/i] a fantastic F2P experience - freemium currency was easy to come by and prices for upgrades were relatively inexpensive, but there's been a massive negative shift in terms of how the game is presented and how in-game purchases are pushed.

The game is beautiful on the surface, the gameplay is interesting, the art is charming with fascinating worlds and every new world brings in new skills that make the game interesting and adds complexity. When I first heard about pet companions coming as an update, I was [b]thrilled[/b]...[i]until[/i] I saw the absolute huge shift towards P2W in regards to the drop chances of the most game breaking pet in the system. It's nothing more than a glorified loot box system jazzed up to look less like one. I then started to notice the massive cracks in how badly the game had become predatory in terms of in-game microtransactions - constant on-screen pushes for limited time gem packs with seemingly no way to close them without clicking on the shop, along with new limited time offers on premium equipment all to induce FOMO and get you to spend money. [b]Predatory.[/b] Plain and simple.

Shameful to say now, I did throw money into the game previously, I was playing the game often and incorrectly thought, ""Hey, the dev seems like a pretty cool dude. I'll throw some money into the game to show support. He's not [i]currently[/i] pushing for it.""...and now I feel like a massive fool. If I could go back and prevent myself from playing this game, I would. If I could go back and stop myself from handing the dev money, I [u]absolutely[/u] would. Lava, you won't be getting another cent from me. I encourage anyone who is thinking of playing this game to avoid it, especially if you're vulnerable to making in-game purchases on a whim. I don't know if I'll continue playing at this point. It hurts to see a dev for what was a good F2P game fall so deep into the cesspool of predatory practices that have begun to plague these kinds of games.

582660,Black Desert,"I have nearly 7k hours in BDO.  I don't recommend this game at the moment.

The cash shop is a complete money grab. Don't buy this game thinking you'll reach end game off $5 or even $50.  You're looking at a solid $200+ to be competitive in a decent amount of time.  Anyone who says otherwise is lying to you.  The game skirts P2W by creating massive annoyances, such as limiting weight and inventory space, to the point where players have huge incentive to fix the issues through the cash shop.  Even swimming is made slow in an effort to push a $20+ swimming outift.

The game is an endless grind, gated by RNG.  You might spend a month getting 5 billion silver only to blow it all in one night on Tungrad earrings and end up empty handed, with that entire month's work completely gone.  It can be incredibly demoralizing, and there isn't a viable way around it.

The developers are currently running around with the heads cutoff.  They introduced massive changes to the PvP system over three years after release.  These changes increased the gear gap, makign strong players even stronger.  However, they also managed to neuter many classes.  Remember how I said it takes nearly $200 to be viable? A lot of those cash items are tied to a character, not the account.  This means that if you want to play another class, you have to repurchase weight, inventory, and costumes.  It adds up extremely fast.  Therefore, you're at the mercy of Korean developers who don't even play the game, and who have shown that they can castrate a class on a moment's notice.  

 You can look at Steam Charts to see that the playerbase is slowly dying.  Even with a $5 sale, the game is losing more people than it's gaining.  Most high level PvPers like myself have abandoned the game because of the drastic changes to super armor, iframes, and crowd control.  What once was  fast paced game has slowed down considerably - most likely to pave the way for Xbox relase and/or compensate for their terrible, terrible netcode.

Be very wary of BDO.  It's essentially a giant scam to inconvience and annoy you into spending money.  The game currently is devoid of direction, with unneeded changes coming nearly weekly.

230410,Warframe,"First, good things about Warframe:

This game has spoiled me. I will no longer accept anything less than this from any game developer. Be it AAA or indie.

This game is free. Get it? Free. You are not required to spend a single penny in order to experience the full content of the game. All characters, quests and environments are fully disclosed to you on their due time. That being said, I HAVE spent money on this. Why? Cosmetics of course. Fashion is endgame you know?

Now, just what is Warframe? Warframe is a mostly PVE third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay. You have seen games do parkour before of course, but these are space ninjas we're talking about, which means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bullets, rockets and/or high-energy plasma, or just take out your trusty sword/hammer/fists and cripple anything in your path.

What will you face? Humanoids, robots, aliens, you name it. Yes, there are bosses, and they can and will kick your butt.
What will you face them with? Hundreds, and I mean HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from. Each of them unique in its own way, and deeply customizable to suit your needs and/or taste. You can carry three of them at a time. A primary weapon (bow, rifle, etc), a secondary weapon (pistol, throwing knives, and... other things), and of course a melee weapon.

Now, you can always tear through the game solo, but, for the best experience, the game pairs you with up to three other players in missions ranging from a stealthy rescue in the overgrown jungles of Earth, to an all-out extermination in the frozen wastelands of Pluto.
But doing missions is just one part of it, you also have a widely explorable open-world area, with its own assortment of missions waiting for you. And this open-world thing is only going get bigger in future updates. Oh and the updates, they are a regular thing. Like, every other day.

Now what's the story? Can't tell you. Its a secret. No, really, the game community is super protective of the game lore. There is a certain point in the game where you will KNOW, and then we can talk about it, but until then, you gotta find out for yourself. For now just consider yourself a space ninja.

How about difficulty? Scales up with your level, just like most modern mmos. The game will be just as hard as you want to handle. If you want to go at it casually, there's content for you. If you're looking for a challenge, good news, the enemy level can scale up almost infinitely.

------------------------------------
Now, bad things about warframe:

-PVP sucks
-Grinding, lots of grinding.
-There are some cool aspects of the game that are seemingly abandoned and/or have been in development hell for ages.
-Your inventory slots are limited, and you can buy more by using the premium currency. While technically you do not need to buy more slots, since you can simply sell what you don't need or want, it is a huge temptation and it is the most likely reason why you will buy platinum, if you ever do.

------------------------------------
About grinding. This is both a good and bad thing about the game. Most will consider grinding a bad thing but here it's a little diferent. In Warframe, the grind is integratd into the core objective of the game. Grinding is what you do to pass the time. It is so integrated into the game world that you don't really notice it. So yeah, there is a lot of grinding, but you have fun while doing it.
------------------------------------

Final thoughts.

Now, I'm not saying warframe should be game of the year or anything (more like game of the decade), but the level of attention and communication that Digital Extremes (the game devs) has with the warframe community and the display of love for their own game is absolutely marvelous. These people are setting a new standard for the gaming industry, and I can only see good things in the future for them.

In conclusion, we don't deserve Warframe.

Also, you can have a space dog/cat, and PET THEM. 10/10

MSFS2020 is simply put: a next gen flight simulator. Everything is indeed a step forwarded compared to older simulators. Cities with 3D models look amazing, cities with AI buildings also look cool, but of course they aren't entirely modeled.

To the Simulator itself: I have been flying mostly small aircraft exploring the world and doing simple IFR flight here and there. I have yet to find a bug or something weird that ruined my experience. I know a lot of people are complaining about the Flight Management computers in airliners being fucked, as well as the autopilot. These are extremely complex systems and quite honestly, I would be extremely surprised if they got some study-material aircraft perfectly at launch. Physics wise this is also very interesting. It's still not perfect, but it's getting better. Topographic turbulence and weather changes are becoming somewhat realistic. 

Long story short, this is obviously a classic and will become the new industry standard. If you are here for big planes and exact real life procedures, you might want to do that when third parties start releasing their products.

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"[Armored Core Experience]
I've played every mainline Armored Core game in the franchise. S-ranked every mission, obtained every part, beaten every hidden boss and played far too many hours of Armored Core 3: Silent Line (one of the only games I had for around 4 years) and Armored Core For Answer. I had been waiting thirteen years for a good Armored Core game to finally come out. Sekiro, Dark Souls 3, and Elden Ring were all great but just don't have the same appeal. This game pulls many of the best elements from previous generations of Armored Core and develops some of the things that were fairly clunky and uninteractive.

[Stagger]
The fact stagger has a functional purpose instead of being a simple case of stunlocking is a gigantic depature from previous titles. In Gen 3 and 4, and even in Gen 5 (until it was nerfed) stunlocking was very easy to do. Many enemy AC's and heavy MT's were basically unable to respond. At the same time the player could end up getting stunlocked to death. So it went both ways, with little interaction or reaction possible. Stagger in AC6 isn't perfect, but it is a large step forward toward refining Armored Core's combat loop as a whole.

[Repair Kits]
Were derided early on for making the game 'too easy' but the reality is the opposite. Previous generations of games offered repairs via supply vehicles, but it wasn't very useful in the midst of combat. It is worth noting that Repair Kits are not a crutch they are simply a guide rail. A player relying on them heavily to beat the game is going to have a fairly poor time of it. Whereas people who learn from their mistakes and seek to master the game are likely to never require it.

[Reduced PvP]
As much as I may be derided for saying this. I disliked PvP in Armored Core V. The excessive focus of ACV and Verdict Day on online co-op heavily damaged the singleplayer experience, and considering the already controversial control scheme switch up, and the complete lack of true aerial combat, it just stuck out like a sore thumb. While I am rather baffled by the lack of features that ACFA had for PvP it doesn't really  change my opinion on the game. I began playing Armored Core when PvP was a pipe dream (or split-screen only), and while I had a bit of fun with PvP in AC4 and ACFA, and dabbled in ACV's PvP. Its never been a major focus to me.

[Customization]
I'd be lying if I didn't think they could've had more specific types of parts available, weapon arms, extensions, add-on boosters, ammo boost back parts... The amount of parts available in AC6 is fairly impressive, and if FromSoft builds upon this game with a DLC or sequel in the same vein as AC4 to ACFA. This is the start of a VERY interesting generation of AC. Also the addition of texturing and weathering is an extremely important improvement, as prior your mech either looked pristine or in the case of ACV like it fell out of a scrap-pile.

[Story]
Armored Core 6 has a fairly intriguing story, but obviously for many AC's fans a lot of the story beats will feel familiar. Fortunately its not as 'moustache-twirling evil' as some of the Gen 2 titles. I'd still say ACFA has a leg up story wise, but that was a sequel which had the foundation AC4 laid to work off of. We will have to see how far Gen 6 goes.

[Is It A Souls-Like?]
A lot of people seemed to think Armored Core 6 is just 'mech-souls' but that isn't the case. Even if you try to act like Repair Kits and Stagger are alien to AC, you'd just be displaying your lack of knowledge. Armored Core 6 is a truly refined return to form. A definitive 'Armored Core' game, and I look forward to the next addition.

[Score]
[strike]I'm still working through New Game ++, but if I had to put a score on AC6, its a solid 8.0.[/strike]
I've nearly done with NG++, and I've been pleasantly surprised by how much the story shifts for the 3rd ending. I've raised my score to 8.5. It's not perfect, but it lays the ground work for an all out masterpiece in the future.","Very Positive90% of the 50,561 user reviews for this game are positive.",armored core mainline armored core franchise ranked mission obtained beaten hidden bos far hour armored core 3 silent line game 4 year armored core answer waiting thirteen year good armored core finally sekiro dark soul 3 elden ring great appeal pull best element previous generation armored core develops thing fairly clunky uninteractive stagger stagger functional purpose simple case stunlocking gigantic depature previous title gen 3 4 gen 5 nerfed stunlocking easy enemy ac heavy mt basically unable respond stunlocked death way interaction reaction possible stagger ac6 perfect large forward refining armored core combat loop repair kit derided early easy reality opposite previous generation game offered repair via supply vehicle useful midst combat worth noting repair kit not_a crutch simply guide rail relying heavily beat fairly poor whereas learn mistake seek master never_require reduced pvp derided saying disliked pvp armored core v excessive focus acv verdict on_emphasizedline co overpowered heavily damaged singleplayer considering already controversial control scheme switch complete lack true aerial combat stuck sore thumb rather baffled lack feature acfa pvp opinion began armored core pvp pipe dream split screen bit fun pvp ac4 acfa dabbled acv pvp never_been major focus customization lying t_emphasizedhink specific type part available weapon arm extension add booster ammo boost part part available ac6 fairly impressive fromsoft build dlc sequel vein ac4 acfa interesting generation ac addition texturing weathering extremely important improvement prior mech looked pristine case acv fell scrap pile armored core 6 fairly intriguing obviously ac fan beat familiar fortunately not_as moustache twirling evil gen 2 title acfa leg wise sequel foundation ac4 laid far gen 6 go soul armored core 6 mech soul t_emphasizedhe case act repair kit stagger alien ac displaying lack knowledge armored core 6 truly refined return form definitive armored core look forward next addition score strike working score ac6 solid 8 0 strike nearly ng pleasantly surprised shift 3rd ending raised score 8 5 not_perfect lay ground masterpiece future

1245620,ELDEN RING,"I bought this game out of spite because one of my best friends convinced me for the 5th time in a row that ""Soulslike is for me"" even though I could barely be bothered to play up to the first boss in previous entries.  He's not wrong that the game seems perfect for me: a character customization heavy ARPG that actually makes the player work to [b]play better, not farm harder[/b], with mysterious lore, gritty aesthetic, and rogue-like punishment.  Yet time and time again, as much as I [b]want[/b] to be enamored by the game, I find myself too frustrated to justify spending time improving, and default to things that are more forgiving.  I am weak.

But when I walked out of the gates and saw The Lands In-Between for the first time my jaw hit the damn floor.  I immediately identified multiple places I wanted to explore, and I felt like there was nothing stopping me from doing it.  Of course, the first thing I investigated reassured me that many things could, in fact, stop me from doing it.

That's actually what I realized I needed from other Soulslikes.  I don't mind a linear path, but I don't like feeling trapped in the same mistake.  When I'm playing Elden Ring, if I can't figure something out, I don't feel like my entire experience is blocked.  I can walk away and go check out something nearby, maybe find a spell or new armor that gets me through the fight that was stopping me.  I'm [i]always[/i] progressing, even if I walk away.  That option solved my biggest problem with getting into the genre.

What KEPT me, was all the stuff I'd hoped to get out of the other games.  The characters are vague, but the details they share are just specific enough to cause a sense of wonder.  I actually feel like I'm a part of this huge world torn apart by a tremendous war.  I didn't feel important at the start...but I slowly started to say ""Wait you think I'm not tough after I took down [[redacted]]?!""  I actually felt like the world was reflecting my actions and I worked to earn my place as the difficulty rose, and it was fun doing it!

I felt this way when I was a kid and played The Legend of Zelda for the first time.   The storytelling is enough to get you interested in doing things/going places, but doesn't flood you with details.  Dungeons are fun to explore and you know you'll get something out of them.  There are clear rules to getting to the end, but your path there is mostly up to you.  It's wonderful!

Now to be clear, there are some issues I have.  The UI is pretty unintuitive, the important things are difficult to recognize as such, but honestly they're so small compared to the highs I really don't care.

If you want your hand held, you'll hate this.  If you want to feel like you're discovering a new world that will constantly have you wondering if you can survive the next encounter and push a little further every day, this is for you.","Very Positive92% of the 576,811 user reviews for this game are positive.",bought spite best friend convinced 5th row soulslike barely bothered bos previous entry not_wrong perfect customization heavy arpg make not_farm harder mysterious lore gritty aesthetic rogue punishment enamored frustrated justify spending improving default thing forgiving weak walked gate saw land jaw damn floor i_emphasizedmmediately identified multiple place wanted explore stopping course i_emphasizednvestigated reassured thing realized needed soulslikes mind linear path feeling trapped mistake elden ring figure entire blocked walk check nearby maybe spell armor get fight stopping progressing walk option solved biggest problem genre stuff hoped game character vague detail share specific cause sense wonder huge world torn apart tremendous war important slowly started wait not_tough took redacted world reflecting action worked earn difficulty rose fun kid legend zelda storytelling interested thing place flood detail dungeon fun explore clear rule path mostly wonderful clear issue ui pretty unintuitive important thing difficult recognize honestly small compared high care hand held hate discovering world constantly wondering survive next encounter push

230410,Warframe,"[h1]The Platinum must flow![/h1]
 
[h2]Oh boy.[/h2]
 
Before I can get into the nitty-gritty and answer the question of ""Should I play Warframe?"" let it be known that it's impossible to review the entirety of this game with the restriction imposed by Steam's review format. There are too many systems within it to cover them all. We can talk about what works and what doesn’t as a whole, but to truly dissect them we’d need one of those 6-hour-long YouTube videos that are all the rage these days.

The short answer: Yes, you should play it. It’s free, a lot of fun and doesn’t make you feel terrible if you never spend money on it. The long answer; here we go!

[h1]The good[/h1]
[h2] Audio, Visuals, Gameplay, Variety[/h2]

Warframe is an MMO, co-op, third-person shooter, taking place in our very own solar system, at an unimaginably distant point in time, where two major factions vie for control in the aftermath of a great war. Players take on the role of the Tenno – ancient warriors now needed more than ever to keep balance within the universe and protect innocents from the new war they find themselves in. The Tenno operate the titular Warframes, battlesuits with exceptional combat prowess, agility, and space magic.

After choosing your Warframe, you’re dropped into a tutorial where you learn the basics of Warframe’s excellent combat and movement systems. You get a primary, secondary, and melee weapon, and can switch between them on the fly. Each Warframe also has four unique abilities, ie. space magic. Although the game doesn’t have a combo meter, it is very evocative of Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, and similar hack-n-slash games. The movement is cathartic, as you can glide through the air, run on walls, slide, twirl, and generally parkour all over the place. It’s a lot of fun.

After the tutorial, you get your very own spaceship, from which you’ll be able to fly across the galaxy and participate in the abundant content Warframe offers. You can visit all of the planets in the Solar system, and then some. While some of them have open-world areas, the majority of Warframe’s game modes you’ll get to play will be standalone missions, such as Survival, Defense, Assassination, Excavation, etc. As you do so, you will be awarded crafting resources and blueprints on which to use them, usually for crafting new weapons and Warframes. You’ll also be awarded Mods, which you can equip on your equipment to modify its various stats.

You’ll also notice just how beautiful of a game Warframe is, with visuals that make me wonder just how in the world they keep the system requirements as low as they are. There are issues with how lighting works, as certain surfaces can be blindingly bright, but turn off Bloom and you should be good. The audio production is similarly brilliant, with excellent sound design that makes the combat punchy and satisfying, regardless of which weapon you’re using. It’s amazing how every single weapon, no matter if it’s a primary, secondary, or melee, can be auditorily distinct from another, and still sound amazing. The soundtrack has a fitting track for every situation, ranging from ethereal chants when the game is being mysterious, to faster-paced, drum-driven ones that compliment the combat. There’s a bit of inconsistency to it, as some are memorable enough to become known even outside of the game, while others are just something you probably won't think about outside of the moment it's playing.

[h1]The bad[/h1]
[h2]Progression, Difficulty, Story Quests, Design Philosophy[/h2]

So, after you’ve gotten acquainted with your ship and everything you can do around it, maybe progressed through a couple of planets, and tried doing a quest or two, the game opens up and provides very little information on what you’re supposed to do next. Don’t bother with figuring it out on your own, as that’ll only put you off. Look to the wiki and save yourself unnecessary frustration. After the first…40 hours, the game will click. You’ll find a weapon that works for you and continue progressing through the Star map, acquiring more gear and knowledge on the game as you go along, and getting to complete more and more story quests.

If you’re smart, unlike I was, you should probably stop around 400-500 hours, as Warframe’s problems become more apparent as progression continues. I believe that, first and foremost, Warframe was designed to keep player base retention. You may think that every game is, but no. As a free-to-play title, Warframe most likely relies on players to keep coming back; as they invest more and more time into it, the more likely they are to invest money as well. Other, paid titles, won’t mind how many hours you put in since you pay up-front. Warframe isn’t bad in this regard, as pretty much anything that can be bought with Platinum (the game's premium currency) can be grinded for, as you can trade Platinum with other players, so there’s a strong trading economy at play here - but you wouldn't know it from the in-game market. 

The very progression is stop-and-go, as each piece of gear has its own level. As you level them up, so does your overall account level, called Mastery, increase – granting you access to more content and weapons. You’re encouraged to keep swapping between them, instead of getting more powerful with one – which you will have to do as well, at some point. Once this stops at Mastery level 16, you’ve pretty much encountered the hardest Warframe has to throw at you, and you still have another 24 levels to go, with new ones being added as the number of equipment in the game grows. Past that point, all you’re doing is increasing numbers and figuring out the most efficient way of farming for new stuff. You might not mind it as much, but know that the game wasn’t designed with a point of finality in mind, but for you to keep coming back, again and again, to keep grinding and completing content, without much substance to it. Enemies become trivial, as a single press of a button can wipe out entire rooms. Level-design becomes non-existent, as you spam the bullet jump maneuver to blaze through levels as fast as possible, so you can try again if that piece of loot you need didn’t drop.

As such, the developers prioritize new, replayable content to get older players into the grind again. At the same time, it has to be accessible to newer players, so it can’t be made too difficult. Story quests suffer especially, as they’re not designed with replayability in mind. The main plot of Warframe still isn’t finished, and it’s been three years since the previous major quest had been added. There’s a lot of wasted potential here, especially with some of the characters, as such a game can’t really have character development. There's simply no room for it as things need to stay static—characters are bereft of their arcs and remain the same for the sake of replayable missions and grind. 

It might keep all those boxes in your mind ticked so you feel accomplished. I know I did way past a point I should have, but looking back at a good part of those 995 hours, and it feels like time wasted.

Story: Amazing rich and emotional story though you are not tied to it and can go off and do whatever in the Jackdaw
Gameplay: This is where this game falls a bit. You constantly jump and climb on things you didnt want to. Though overall it's okay
Graphics: When you are looking at moutains, ect. in the distance they somtimes flash back and fourth and also textures take awhile to load in, though other then that, the lighting, weather,water and textures are up at the top for this generation.
Open World: Perfect, if you want to go to a bar and recruit some crew, to then go and invade a hideout and look the treausre to then upgrade your ship. Overall, I give open world 10/10

Overall, I would give this game a 9/10 for its perfect story and amazing open world. I would recommend this to anyone who has a mildy good pc or any consel who wants hours and hours of good open world fun!

This should be a special game that I could easily recommend to anyone.
This should be a must finish for any star wars lover like me.
This should be a contender for game of the year.

but its not.

The technical performance of this video game on a system that is above average is frankly shocking. 

After the recent 'Patch 7' (5th September) dropped, I decided to really give it another go since the performance could improve using DLSS. The performance did not improve, it stayed exactly the same while looking visually worse because of DLSS.

I cannot recommend this game to anyone who has anything less than a RTX 4090 tier GPU and a 12th gen or higher CPU. My 3080 gets me maybe 40fps but dips much, much longer than that if it doesn't crash before then. I can run any other UE4 game with no problems and I know the developers really pushed this engine to a new level but at the cost of making the game unplayable.

I'm still waiting to play this game since the 28th of April but I'm finally going to uninstall it because I have absolutely zero faith that this game will ever run smoothly.

I will at least say that this game is visually stunning even if it runs like a slide show. I wish I could play through the whole game myself but I'm not about to spend 5k on a PC just for this video game.

Do not buy this game.

It's incredible. Go get it, review it, make From and Bamco and everyone know they can still make this kind of games!

What a way to debut the series on PC and bring back a franchise that had been dormant for a decade. It runs buttery smooth even on my aging configuration. It looks great, sounds great, plays great (it instantly recognised my Xbox One controller no problem), is complete on release, no predatory DLC or microtransactions, with a level of customisation that other games could only dream of.

Much like with Ace Combat (buddy!), it's amazing what they achieved with just showing vehicles, awesome mechs in this case. With an OST that slaps harder than a hard bass, crisp sound, excellent style and design UI elements, a non intrusive COM voice (shame you can only switch languages instead of voices but the default is great and feels like having Jarvis).

This is like a come back from another timeline where everything just was right! I've just cleared NG and on my way to NG+ and beyond (the game keeps giving!) so this is my GOTY, hands down.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn't want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.

The dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.

People who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won't replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don't use the boxes.

PvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules ""No healing potions, no ultimates"" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it's my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can't do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I'll leave it as ""I'm new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being"".

Addressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don't feel it's a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That's pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don't have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it's not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.

Classes. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won't be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren't available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I'm not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn't' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.

So to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",0 expectation sunk 20 hour alpha burn no_idea launching took gunlance class 40 fantastic excited launch dungeon interesting far mini cutscenes character slowly climb ladder walk across skinny beam decent found spam clicking 20 action able respec talent nice allowing different ability different modifier progressed saying easy weapon box high weapon replace anytime soon obvious completing dungeon hard mode drop lower weapon gate 10 good otherwise progression slow spongy enemy result authentic whatever box pvp side met group player dueling consistently alpha 30 gunlance dueled artillerist 28 player participating 15 rule no_healing potion no_ultimates z v ability generate perhaps lack knowledge ranged class ability stagger lock artillerist flame thrower caught anywhere massive cone flinch damage no_diminishing return saw warlord dodge unique hop hated giving small dodge rarely took danger ability super armor leave ranged class kick as addressing pay 2 win concern pay 2 win model traditionally upcoming top guild recruiting player platinum founder pack rushing 50 spending premium currency load character rolling map pure speculation understand pay upgrade gear pretty frustrating knowledge guild war not_my priority streamer state country 100 stuff paying real perpetually allowing bonus spending dime good imo class class balance strange 5 class released launch available country access 14 power house class available scouter demolisher lance master arcanist desired based general chat feel gating player dump pay gear class release not_a fan game ready slowly introducing cash grab 14 class plenty gender lock major issue outside not_wanting look waifu wrap someone 0 expectation 0 knowledge enjoyed market serious massively multiplayer online format gamble

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! NOT EVEN ON SALE! 

This is quite possibly the worst Madden game EVER produced. I haven't bought one in a few years so I figured I was due. BIG MISTAKE. Do not believe the lies about improved anything or added features. The features added are either useless, broken or both. They're also just re-added features from old Madden games that are poorly re-implemented. 

-1 out of 5 running plays will have a holding penalty so it's basically pointless. I had to turn off holding completely to be able to run the ball.
-Controller will drop input at random either in menus or during plays. Happens more often in menus resulting in random scrolling.
-Route running gets broken during press coverage and receivers just run around random directions or right out of bounds. They also just stop running routes at random. Slant route? You meant stop running at the hash mark right? Picked.
-Random frame rate drops for no reason at all.
-Constant mini-freezing in menus when trying to call plays.
-Probably removed more features from franchise mode than they added, and the implementation on those added are awful copy and pastes from past games. 
-""Manage team"" is a whole menu just to rebuild your entire stadium, to the same 6 templates they had 10 years ago, or relocate. No upgrades, no renovations. Absolutely nothing new at all, just half way re-added features from old games.
-Absolutely ridiculous glitchy ball carriers breaking 10 tackles, spinning out of a massive pile up and running 80 yards for a TD. Don't worry though, most long runs get called back for holding even if it's 50 yards behind the play.
-The training camp drills are broken. They're either glithched to the point of being pointless (Pass rush tunnel drill. The linemen will follow you down the tunnel and get in the way) Or just about learning to exploit buggy AI (WR Red Zone Drill. The only way to get the top score is to run whip routes over and over again). The ""drills"" are pointless and have no application on how to play Madden or football.
-Commentary is the worst I've ever heard. Pointless rambling that has nothing to do with what is happening. Or things like ""That Ravens defense was really great last week in their win against Baltimore."" Zero quality control as usual.

My first instinct was to refund immediately and I should have listened. I'm going to play a few seasons of franchise mode and go back to College Football Revamped because NCAA 14 is a better game than any Madden in the last decade.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"I played this game over a month or two in early 2016 to have an escape to a pirate adventure. It was one of my best gaming experiences ever as I was very invested in the plot and gameplay, and I was up to have a rollicking good swashbuckle for an hour or two at a time.

You should get it now, in 2020, for two reasons. I think that the flow of the game, now in the light of ""Sea of Thieves"" and looking back, has advantages in the bigger, more epic sea battles which you can also control more. You also get slightly less freedom for more meaningful ""micro-worlds"" on each island. Such as, working through a plantation at night, killing guards in silence until you reach the target. Not just a different island shape with the same content.

I'd advise using the plot hand-in-hand with your sailing to drive your exploration of the islands; sailing around, collecting/unlocking sea shanties and then coming into port to do a mission. Old AC games always suffered from players fast travelling to missions once you got bored of the parkour, this game solved that for me. I often did missions to get the unlocks and cash needed to upgrade the ship and that then drove my way through the content. 

Lastly, I didn't mind the ""present day"" gameplay as I had no spoilers and was invested in the general AC games plot. This isn't too impactful as it can line up with your breaks but some other players don't like it. 

Make sure you take breaks. Use the game to scratch that adventure itch rather than deep-dive. 56 hours and I had completed pretty much all the content. Averaged to an hour a day for two months, I now look back with nothing but fond memories.","Very Positive88% of the 55,599 user reviews for this game are positive.",early 2016 escape pirate adventure best gaming experience invested plot rollicking good swashbuckle 2020 reason flow light sea thief advantage bigger epic sea battle control slightly freedom meaningful micro world island working plantation night killing guard silence reach target not_just different island shape advise plot hand hand sailing drive exploration island sailing collecting unlocking sea shanty coming port mission old ac game suffered player fast travelling mission bored parkour solved mission unlocks cash needed upgrade ship drove lastly mind present no_spoilers invested general ac game plot t_emphasizedoo impactful line break player break scratch adventure itch rather deep dive 56 hour completed pretty averaged month look fond memory

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I've been compelled to write this review because I'm tired of seeing all these jaded vets rage on and on about how the game is dying despite being part of the problem themselves. There will be a TLDR, otherwise here we go.

This game is a good game. Is it a great game? No. Is it a bad game? No. It is a solid good title if you are looking for a game that is not a twitch, run and gun shooter, but also don't really have the patience to learn to play something like ARMA III. This game is all about team play and communication. If you can't do either of these things this game is not for you. Having a mic is pretty much required if you want to play in anything other than a regular infantry squad, and even then you are putting your team at a severe disadvantage by not having one. The game is strongly in favor of being historically accurate (with some minor tweaks for gameplay reasons), so much so that the maps you play on are straight up recreations of the real life locations from back during the years of World War II. The various fronts, uniforms, and sounds this game uses to create its atmosphere is awesome. When you're in the shit with your face in the dirt you honestly get scared from how intense it all can be. Players will even do some light hearted roleplay over proximity when they're calling for a medic which can get pretty funny.

This game is slow and the gameplay reflects this. The fact that the two game modes (Warfare and Offensive) can last for a whole 1 hour 30 minutes or 2 hours respectively frequently speaks to this. You will be running for minutes on end a lot. You will be dying a lot. Respawn waves often take 20+ seconds depending on where you spawn. Capturing points takes 2 minutes and the enemy can stop you very easily. There will be many times where you will be shot, burned, blown up, or knifed and you will never see your attacker. There will be times where you will never know where the enemy is coming from. There will be times where you will go half an hour without a single kill, or maybe even a whole game. There will be times when you push the enemy back to their last point only for everything to fall apart on that final push and suddenly you are the one on your last point.

Then there will be times where you kill 20 people all by yourself. There will be times you singlehandedly turn the tide of a match with one spawn point, one kill, one explosion. There will be times where you work with your squad to accomplish an objective that allows another squad to accomplish theirs which allows the commander to do his thing to clinch you the game. There will be times where you fight for every bloody inch of a point for 30 minutes and then finally come out on top. There will be times where you fight over the midpoint the whole game and it comes down to the literal second on the timer, and then everyone cheers when you successfully cap. There will be times when you lose, but you won't care because the enemy played so well and your team matched them blow for blow that it felt like you didn't lose anything at all. There will be times when you fight an epic last stand and you just manage to beat the clock that it makes you feel like you really are fighting a war.

Hell Let Loose is not without its issues. Medics are alright, but they could be better, the artillery system needs changes in how it affects gameplay (although personally that issue is way down on the list), the British faction is kind of a mess, there are some bugs still stubbornly around, the flamethrower is underpowered, and collision (especially driving) on certain objects is really annoying. But you often forget about a lot of this when your charging towards the point and people are blowing up around you and machine guns are laying down suppressive fire and you finally reach the trenches and sweep through them killing everyone in your path. Those cinematic moments straight out of Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan is what you play for.

Sometimes you will hate this game and wonder why you wasted your time on such a hopeless match with such idiotic teammates. Other times you will love it and wish you could play with the guys you met in that game forever. The lows can be really low, but the highs can be really high.

There are those that say this game is going down the drain and this is not a true. Some of this game's veteran community has become extremely jaded over the past year and a half or so for a variety of reasons. Some of them are warranted and some of them aren't. When I first got this game back in December of 2021 the community was awesome. Never met such nice and patient people so consistently in a game about brutally murdering each other during the worst war of human history. This community is no longer that most of the time. It is full of veterans who are no longer understanding of new players. It is full of servers run by admins who think they are always right, who can't be challenged at all lest their fragile egos crack. Bickering is frequent, arguments and name calling are plenty, roaming bands of clan tags will constantly complain and heckle in chat, and most people don't want to lead teams because they don't want command screaming in their ear constantly the whole game.

Not all veterans are like this, but most of the whining does not come from the new players because these vets constantly scare them off with their horrid attitudes and elitism. It's like watching a CoD lobby unfold over the course of an hour and a half. There are those who still try to make the game as enjoyable as possible (shout out to McBluffin and his crew, go check them out and join their discord awesome people), but they are unfortunately the minority of interactions I see nowadays. I will never forget teaching a new player how to tank and him telling me at the end of the match ""Hey, thanks for teaching me. I was gonna drop this game because of the previous crew I was working with, but you guys made me change my mind.""

To all the new players or prospective buyers there are kind veterans out there, so stick it out. It is worth it, trust me. Once you find the right group this game is like magic (and drugs), you will never want to stop playing. This game is worth your money. The Team17 take over has been bumpy regarding the release of U14 and the ""trailer"", but this game is far from dead. Most of the bugs seen nowadays are legacy bugs from when Black Matter was still developing (something the vets will neglect to tell you due to their hate boners) and Team17 is currently ironing them out. They've already tackled/fixed quite a few and I am hopeful that they will figure the rest out soon. This game is in no worse a state than it was a year and a half ago, and is no worse off than when Black Matter was developing. So please, give this game a try. It will surprise you. I know it surprised me.

TLDR: This game is solid. It's got problems concerning various longstanding bugs and certain systems need attention, but they are being worked on. Its got great atmosphere and some real cinematic moments. Its had some bumpy trials since Team17 took over, but they have smoothed them out for the most part. Some of the veteran community could use a real attitude adjustment, but not everyone is crotchety. Its not great, its not terrible, but it is good and worth your time. Give this game a try, hop on with some buddies or find some of your own in-game and go win the war. 7/10","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",compelled write tired seeing jaded vet rage dying despite problem otherwise good great no_is bad no_it solid good title not_a twitch gun shooter patience learn arma iii communication thing not_for mic pretty required regular infantry squad putting severe disadvantage not_having strongly favor historically accurate minor tweak reason map straight recreation real life location year world war ii various front uniform sound us create atmosphere awesome shit face dirt honestly scared intense player light hearted roleplay proximity calling medic pretty funny slow reflects mode warfare offensive last 1 30 minute 2 hour respectively frequently speaks running minute dying respawn wave 20 second depending spawn capturing point take 2 minute enemy easily time shot burned blown knifed never_see attacker time never_know enemy coming time half single kill maybe time push enemy last fall apart final push suddenly last time kill 20 time singlehandedly turn tide spawn kill explosion time squad accomplish objective allows squad accomplish allows commander clinch time fight bloody inch 30 minute finally top time fight midpoint come literal timer cheer successfully cap time lose care enemy matched blow blow lose time fight epic last stand manage beat clock make fighting war hell loose not_without issue medic alright be_emphasizedtter artillery need change affect personally issue british faction kind mess bug stubbornly flamethrower underpowered collision especially driving certain object annoying forget charging towards blowing machine gun laying suppressive fire finally reach trench sweep killing path cinematic moment straight band brother saving private ryan hate wonder wasted hopeless idiotic teammate time love wish guy met forever low low high high drain not_a true veteran community extremely jaded past half variety reason warranted december 2021 community awesome never_met nice patient consistently brutally murdering worst war human history community no_longer veteran no_longer understanding player server admins challenged lest fragile ego crack bickering frequent argument name calling plenty roaming band clan tag constantly complain heckle chat lead team command screaming ear constantly not_all veteran whining not_come player vet constantly scare horrid attitude elitism watching cod lobby unfold course half enjoyable possible shout mcbluffin crew check join discord awesome unfortunately minority interaction nowadays never_forget teaching tank telling hey thanks teaching gon na drop previous crew working guy mind player prospective buyer kind veteran stick worth trust group magic drug never_want worth team17 bumpy regarding release u14 trailer far dead bug nowadays legacy bug black matter developing vet neglect tell due hate boner team17 currently ironing already tackled fixed hopeful figure rest soon no_worse state half ago no_worse black matter developing please surprise surprised solid problem concerning various longstanding bug certain system attention worked great atmosphere real cinematic moment bumpy trial team17 took smoothed veteran community real attitude adjustment not_everyone crotchety not_great not_terrible good worth hop buddy win war 7 10

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"I genuinely don't get what the negative reviews are saying, and it seems like the only positive reviews are just from people who like the game because it's DRG. So I would like to give some genuine praise to this game and refute some of the claims the negative reviews make.

1 ""The game doesn't have much content"": OF COURSE THE GAME DOESN'T HAVE MUCH CONTENT, IT JUST RELEASED INTO EARLY ACCESS.

2 I'm not going to value your opinions if you have only played the game for TWO HOURS

3 ""The upgrades don't feel powerful"": This is the statement I understand the least, have these people even unlocked overclocks? I agree that the normal upgrades feel a bit weak, but they're just meant to be stepping stones to the overclocks. 

4 ""The gameplay doesn't feel satisfying"": I find the gameplay very satisfying. the exploder chain reactions clearing entire swarms, one shotting elites with resupply pods, picking up a magnet and getting six levels at once, I find all of these some of the most satisfying things in any game I've ever played. 

 I think DRG Survivor is a very fun game that does have its flaws, but also has a lot of potential to become something great.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"I bought it from the sale and I'm a bit dissatisfied. The Far Cry series is really going downhill. 

-Ubisoft launcher is just horrible piece of crap. Steam is a launcher that works, theres absolutely no need for another launcher on top of that. And Ubisoft connects sometimes doesn't connect and it's one more account to register and to forget passwords for. 
-Enemies show up as a red blob on the radar, so they never appear out of nowhere. Thus making sneaking around too easy. 
-Bullet sponge enemies just feel bad. Three headshots with an M-14 rifle is ridiculous. 
-Bullet sponge animals are just the same. 
-Different ammo types was a nice idea, but they overdid it. Changing ammo type and/or weapon three times in one firefight just feels bad. 
-Weapons unlock not from enemies killed but from game progress. Killing an enemy that has shotgun doesn't give a chance to pick up that shotgun unlike in previous games. 
-The game forces you into 3rd person view from time to time without an option to toggle it off.
-Supremos (backpack ultimate weapons) are ridiculous and not really fun and they really break the immersion. 
-Modifying weapons makes them uglier, and silencers overheat extremely easily.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla commits a grave sin. It didn't kill off a beloved character nor was it a buggy mess on launch. The fault with this game is much simpler than that--It's really, REALLY, effing boring.

I will say, I have been an AC fan since the first game came out. I remember being excited for the launch and enthralled with Altair and his secretive clan of assassins. I loved the intrigue of slowly unraveling the bigger picture of the story as each new installment came out. Over the years the vision for where the franchise was going changed, and the games changed with them. Some of these changes were good, most were not. AC Valhalla represents the culmination of what is wrong with the modern take on Assassin's Creed games. 

What does one expect from an Assassin's Creed game? Let’s get to basics, cause by god we're gonna need 'em.

1) The main character is an Assassin and/or joins the order at some point.
=> Eivor is pointedly NOT an Assassin, never intends to become one, flat out says that he/she doesn't really have much interest in their cause beyond using the assassins as allies. I have not completed this game at time of writing, however it is my understanding that this does not change. In fact, while Eivor may have the hidden blade, they do not keep it actually hidden, opting instead to wear it like glorified brass knuckles and use it in head-on attacks. 

2) The main character will complete assassinations on high profile targets that involve some stealth combat.
=> There is stealth combat in this game. There are not, however, many opportunities to use it. The main story does not have the assassination targets as an objective, instead this game went the route of AC Odyssey and opted for a tree of mystery-unraveling to unveil the big players of the organization. In Odyssey that system worked with the story and was at least partially relevant to what was happening. Those characters had a reason to hate the members of the cult and want to  hunt them down. In Valhalla? I have no idea why I would bother taking down the Templar figures because Eivor isn’t even an Assassin. They want power and glory, sure, but that's such a weak motivator that it doesn’t keep the player’s interest for long.  Eivor (as a Viking) goes for a straightforward “raid and pillage” style of fighting so during missions the game often immediately puts you in combat and thus eliminates the possibility of a stealthy approach. Large scale castle raids are played this way as well. Eivor is NOT an Assassin.

3) There is a complex and engaging story.
=> This game has a good 3-4 hours in the beginning where it starts to feel like they are building a complex narrative with key players that I could buy into. Then, instead of building on that, they use it as a call to the hero’s journey and dump you smack dab in the middle of what I have begun to call the “open world grind”. Do you enjoy following objectives to the next place you need to pillage? Opening every chest to get generic ‘supplies’ so you can push a button back at your village and upgrade a shop? Killing wild animals and breaking rocks so you can fuel the upgrade machine? No? Then don’t bother playing. The game is so desperate to show the player that they have an open world to explore that they didn’t stop to write in a reason for me to do so beyond endless tiers of upgrades. The missions are also uninteresting. Go here, kill some bad guys, go there, talk to someone, etc. 

4) The game will have parkour movement that will be used in creative ways for infiltration or assassinations.
=> This game has parkour movement. It has unbelievable parkour movement. You can climb anything and everything, effortlessly  latching onto a flat wall with your spiked gloves or something I suppose because there’s clearly no other explanation. Look, far be it from me to advocate for less freedom of movement, but I remember when parkour in games felt cool because it had some limitations that required different gear, or an upgrade, or--I don’t know--some mild puzzling to figure out how to get to where you wanted to be. It feels so lifeless and uninteresting to be able to climb all over everything like a spider-monkey without even earning it. And again--Eivor is NOT AN ASSASSIN. Why do they just know how to do this? And even putting all I have said aside, stealth and parkour just isn’t super relevant to completing objectives in AC Valhalla. Story missions are straightforward assault battles.

5) Interesting setting.
=> This reason is much more subjective, but honestly I think it’s still a valid point for reasons I’ll expand upon. Vikings just feel…very done as a concept right now, in my opinion. Obviously this game was conceptualized years ago, but it just doesn’t hit as an unexplored interesting locale and time period to set an AC game. However even beyond my opinion, the color palette is definitely limited by this setting. I was getting flashbacks to the drab, boring and ugly locations in Assassin’s Creed 3, and that’s not a good thing. The game is pitched as a Viking raider vs English townspeople struggle for power but somehow also tries to convince me that the Vikings were the good guys and all of the people who lived on that land are corrupt. Like ok sure the king might be selfish and a despot but was the farmer and his family? You know, the one I just mugged for supplies during a raid? I’m not saying that the main character of a game has to be a good guy but when you try and convince me they are while also asking me to pillage towns it just rings hollow. 

There is more I could say that I haven't even touched on (pointless boat transit, equally pointless city management systems, etc.), but this review is already quite long and I don’t want it to double in length. I guess what you should know is:

TL;DR--Valhalla is an extremely boring game that fails to give the player any motivation to keep playing it. It is an aimless and drab experience of half-considered systems and features that feel shoved-in to justify the title of Assassin’s Creed. It did not need to be an Assassin’s Creed game, nor was it compelling enough to have existed as a standalone title. It is a vapid example of a game that might be designed by some corporate AI that seeks to check off boxes rather than make something truly interesting.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Ah man, where to begin!

[h1]The art design:[/h1]
Playful, whimsical, charming. Paired with the fantastic water effects and the day/night cycle, the world feels uplifting from minute 1. You can practically smell the crisp, salty air... 


[h1]The learning curve:[/h1]
Reasonable. You can master the basics within the first hour, and then spend the next 100 hours living your best piratey life.


[h1]The play style:[/h1] 
Interestingly enough, you don't level up your weapons, skills, or ship's abilities. The changes are purely cosmetic... and I love it. While I've enjoyed games that require you to level up your gear or unlock moves, this style feels much more comfortable. YOU get to decide if you want to invest time in a quest chain that unlocks a new item (a cool ship's livery, a flashy new hat), but you aren't penalized for being a newcomer. Yes, the fancy canons look nice, but they are just as powerful as the default canons. 

You build your reputation with different factions (aka Companies), which leads to unlocking better paying gigs (aka Voyages) and cool-looking items. This works to the benefit of everyone in your crew: A sailor who has a higher rank with a specific Company than their crewmates will be able to pick up a better-paying Voyage, and then everyone in their crew can participate. I love this-- if you happen to outrank your friends/crewmates, you can offer to buy that Voyage. Some aspects of play require everyone to be on the same page (ie, Tall Tales), but that's ok. Means you can have a positive experience doing one-off Voyages some times, and other times hunker down and work toward longer gameplay arcs. 


[h1]My experience so far:[/h1]
I played the beta, but only recently bought the game. Even though I missed a massive gap of updates, I don't feel left behind. I love going on adventures with my friends, or winding down the evening with some solo-slooping. I live in a different timezone than my crew, which has meant I have time earlier in my evenings to invest in the pre-adventure prepwork (gathering supplies for the ship, fishing and cooking said fish so we'll have extra stamina). It's fun, and is surprisingly soothing. 

PVP has been interesting. When I solo, I try to avoid conflict. When I'm with my crew, we meet it head-on! Both dynamics are enjoyable: Being stealthy, hiding behind mountains, darting around the map, versus gearing up and letting the cannons fly...! So good. 


[h1]Why I especially like this game (and why you might like it too):[/h1]
I'm a fan of all things nautical, and I come from a WoW background. For me, this feels like the best parts of WoW: You can tackle massive monsters with your friends, you can choose to grind for random achievements, and you can spend as much time as you want getting sidetracked by treasure and exploration. Plus, the outfits/livery options...! Since the outfits and ship details are purely cosmetic, you can mix and match to your heart's content. 

[h1]I imagine you would NOT like this game if:[/h1]
-- You only have 10 minutes of spare time to play games.
-- You hate everything to do with water.

[h1]I imagine you would like this game if:[/h1]
-- You have always wanted to be a pirate.
-- You have at least one person to adventure with some of the time.
-- You like to blow things up.
-- You like to sneak away from danger.
-- When playing other games, you find yourself getting lost and spending hours NOT doing the mission objectives, but have a better time for it.

252490,Rust,"The key to enjoying RUST is simple... Find the right server. If you like desperately trying to avoid getting ghosted by groups of geared player-killers while clawing your way into position as top dog, there's a server for that. If you like building a great base and only fighting other players in specific areas, there's a server for that. If you like fighting off zombies while never having to deal with getting raided or offlined, there's a server for that. The graphics are intense and visceral, yet also beautiful, while the crafting and building are pretty intuitive once you get used to the system. For your first run I would suggest a specifically newb friendly server until you get used to things, otherwise it will just be lots of dying and rage quitting and you will miss an excellent survival shooter.","Very Positive87% of the 845,275 user reviews for this game are positive.",key enjoying rust simple desperately trying avoid ghosted group geared killer clawing position top dog building great base fighting player specific area fighting zombie never_having deal raided offlined graphic intense visceral beautiful crafting building pretty intuitive suggest specifically newb friendly thing otherwise lot dying rage quitting miss excellent survival shooter

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"TLTR: ESO is the best MMO I've played so far.


The Good.
It has retained many of the best elements from the Elder Scrolls series.
-Fantastic sound-score.
-Fine graphics.
-A world that feels alive.
-Great exploration gameplay.

The leveling and combat system is far better than any Elder Scrolls game, by miles. For PvE combat is great, tho I haven't played for long enough to get into PvP yet. You can choose to grind up to cap in a single session, if that strikes your fancy. Or you could care less about leveling and still participate fully in all non-endgame PvE.

ESO does not waste my time with long travel times, I can get to anywhere I've already been in between 30 sec to a minute. For me this is a very important point. I detest games that fakes longviety my wasting my time.

ESO is not in any way pay-to-win, and it doesen't unnaturally inconvenience the player to make me pay extra. The only inconvenience in the game comes with spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants while questing at the same time. This was an inconvenience in the Bethesdas Elder Scrolls games aswell because of inventory. You can pay to unnaturally compensate for this inconvenience through an ingredient-bag.

ESO has pay for vanity.

The world is immensly open. I can go anywhere I want and be successful straight from the start. There are many questlines with their own story tying into the main story. I can choose freely what storyline to follow, or I can ignore the story entirely if I just want to grind my way to the endgame content or just want to explore. This also means the game is extremely accessible for anyone.

Crafting is plesant and feels meaningful so far. There are crafting-quests in addition to crafting for trade, if I want to pursue it as a career. There are few games where I enjoy crafting, but in this one it seems ok.

Stealth gameplay is fun, although not innovative by any means.

Playing together ad hoc is fun even without groupinng up. Just running together with random people for an area or a difficult fight is quite fun. Probably because combat is fast-paced, players are considered allies for the purpose of abilities, and game mechanics generally supports doing so. It works very well for any open area I've been to, and is faster than grouping up.

Some of the dialouge is good.

Some of the quests are ok.


The Bad.
With the game being extremely accessible, people looking for a challenge will have to do a bit of searching or research where to go and who to hook up with.

Because the enemies and treasure scales with level, ESO doesen't have the mother-haul aspect of treasure-hunting that some older Elder Scrolls titles had. For instance, in the original Morrowind I could sneak into an ancient abandoned fortress, find a coven of vampires there so powerful they could one-hit kill me, sneak past them, discover an endgame weapon, steal it and leave. It was a very unique feeling when just stumbling into it while exploring.

The community tools for ESO are the porest of any MMO I've played. I haven't found an accessible way of reaching ppl even for PUGs. There is no tutorial on how to effectively get a group going, and frankly zero incentive to do so anyway in any area I've been so far. Further, getting a guild seems to be a matter of blindly accepting guild-invites from ppl spamming general chat. For instance I've found no credible channel on how to get info on guilds that may be suitable for me, seek them out and ask for an invite. As a noob I find getting involved in the community in ESO a frustrating chore.

There is a tool for queing to participate in dungeons (instances) with PUGs. The tool is never explained however, you just have to find it yourself. Also the queing I've done takes 30-90 minutes. Some times of the day I'm unable to find PUGs for dungeons at all through this tool.

The community also doesen't seem very inviting towards new players in my experience. I've not seen anyone being very helpful towards each other yet. It's not that it's hostile, just not very friendly either. It may of course be because the Morrowind expansion was just released and all the established players are over there, for all I know.

I cannot fly, levitate or do Khajiit-level jumps in ESO.

Some of the story isn't good. They all pivot around the main story in a very overt way. Like in the old arcade games, where there is a scheming badguy and everything except the end-fight is about thwarting his minions. ""His"" minions are everywhere in ESO: Tamriel, and it's just to much of the same. This is very different from the other Elder Scrolls titles, where the monsters of the land seemed to make up a whole ecosystem on their own, with their own lives and events. It makes the stories that follow the quests boring after 25 hours, and deteriorating rapidly at 50 hours.

Most of the quests are very boring. Fetch me those items or kill me those enemies. For me this may well become a reason for abandoning ESO, they were the reason I never played WoW for more than 20 minutes. In ESO they aren't as bad as the ones I experienced in the other title. It's normally 3-5 targets instead of 20-30. At first it seemed that this type of quests would be few, but it proved to be very frequent. A real pity.

Many of the quests are really stupid. And I mean really really bone 'ead stupid. Like the world-class schemer who's locked himself inside a tomb and left the 3 keys outside the door at different but easy-to-find locations. Makes sense.. It's back to the old arcades, only back then the format required some abstractions. In ESO it's not an abstraction anymore, but a literally really dumb story-element. While there are some straight-forward story elements of the type ""some soldiers have been captured, go rescue them"", nonsense solutions are more common. Fully expect an NPC to suggest solving a problem by shooting her magic rainbow-ray at the moon while farting some magic sunshine. But first you must go find her some rare shrooms at one location, kill 4 zombies at another location, get 3 seashells, then kill an evil monster turtle-boss. Then she can find the spy who's been taken prisoner by the enemy and learn what he knows. And on to the next one.

After a quest is done I get a pat on the back, where the NPC tells me this was all my doing. I'm a hero. It's not that it's wrong, it's just that after a while all quest-givers start to seem like a benevolent school-teacher praising a 7-year old.


The Ugly.
Customer Support are flat-out ignoring support-tickets. 

There are 3-year old bugs that prevent installing or starting up the game for enough players that the forums have several threads each day regarding them. New players enter the forum frustrated, not being able to play. Some are able to get it working through forum advice, and others can't and refund the game as a result. The ugly part is that the developers don't communicate with the players and doesen't even acknowledge the problem. It's been 3 years now, so it seems they just don't find the bugs worth the cost of resolving vs the number of resulting refunds and bad reviews.


Final Words.
I don't know how long ESO will keep me engaged. I'm currently doing the story and exploration, but unless the story starts diversifying in the next area I fear I'll seek other content. Maybe that content can keep my attention, maybe not. Regardless, this is the best MMO I've played despite its shortcomings. The combat is quite good, and the absence of time-sinks count for alot. That said, I've yet to find an MMO that could hold my attention for more than a couple of months.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",tltr eso best massively multiplayer online far good retained best element elder scroll series fantastic sound score fine graphic world feel alive great exploration leveling combat far elder scroll mile pve combat great tho long pvp choose grind cap single session strike fancy care leveling participate fully non endgame pve eso not_waste long travel time anywhere already 30 sec minute important detest game fake longviety wasting eso not_in pay win doesen unnaturally inconvenience pay extra inconvenience come spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants questing inconvenience bethesdas elder scroll game aswell inventory pay unnaturally compensate inconvenience ingredient bag eso pay vanity world immensly open anywhere successful straight questlines tying choose freely storyline follow ignore entirely grind endgame explore mean extremely accessible crafting plesant feel meaningful far crafting quest addition crafting trade pursue career game enjoy crafting ok stealth fun not_innovative mean ad hoc fun groupinng running random difficult fight fun probably combat fast paced player considered ally purpose ability mechanic generally support work open faster grouping dialouge good quest ok bad extremely accessible challenge bit searching research hook enemy treasure scale eso doesen mother haul aspect treasure hunting older elder scroll title instance original morrowind sneak an_emphasizedcient abandoned fortress coven vampire powerful kill sneak past discover endgame weapon steal leave unique feeling stumbling exploring community tool eso porest massively multiplayer online found accessible reaching ppl pug no_tutorial effectively group frankly zero incentive anyway far guild matter blindly accepting guild invite ppl spamming general chat instance found no_credible channel info guild suitable seek ask invite noob involved community eso frustrating chore tool queing participate dungeon instance pug tool never_explained queing take 30 90 minute time unable pug dungeon tool community doesen inviting towards player not_seen helpful towards not_that hostile not_very friendly course be_emphasizedcause morrowind expansion released established player cannot_fly levitate khajiit jump eso good pivot overt old arcade game scheming badguy except fight thwarting minion minion everywhere eso tamriel different elder scroll title monster land ecosystem life event make story follow quest boring 25 hour deteriorating rapidly 50 hour quest boring fetch item kill enemy abandoning eso never_played wow 20 minute eso bad one experienced title normally 3 5 target 20 30 type quest proved frequent real pity quest stupid really_emphasized bone ead stupid world class schemer locked inside tomb left 3 key outside door different easy location make sense old arcade format required abstraction eso not_an abstraction anymore literally dumb element straight forward element type soldier captured rescue nonsense solution common fully expect non suggest solving problem shooting magic rainbow ray moon farting magic sunshine rare shrooms location kill 4 zombie location 3 seashell kill evil monster turtle bos spy taken prisoner enemy learn know next pat non tell hero not_that wrong giver benevolent school teacher praising 7 old ugly customer support flat ignoring support ticket 3 old bug prevent installing starting player forum thread regarding player enter forum frustrated not_being able able working forum advice others refund result ugly developer communicate player doesen acknowledge problem 3 year bug worth cost resolving v number resulting refund bad review final word long eso engaged currently exploration unless start diversifying next fear seek maybe attention maybe not_regardless best massively multiplayer online despite shortcoming combat good absence sink count alot massively multiplayer online hold attention couple month
1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"FOR ALL THE DEVS THAT HAVE MICRO-TRANSACTIONS ETC;

You know your doing something right when other developers like EA/Ubisoft/Blizzard, etc, come out saying, ""Baldur's Gate 3 should not be the new standard"". 
To put it simply, they are just mad because Larian Studios will not have a battle-pass, micro-transactions and expensive DLC's.
Which after all, is all us gamer's want. Just a polished game with unlimited hours of fun. Well done Larian Studios! You can tell you actually care about games, and have bought back what it felt like 15 years ago for me.

EDIT:
reading through the comments and you can see the majority rules. when i speak of DLC's i'm referring to things that should already of been included in the base game for example, Total War Warhammer (great game btw) should, in my opinion, already include the chaos race in the base game. i shouldn't have to pay an extra $30 for this particular race, (once again just my opinion). now id happily pay for an ""expensive"" DLC/add-on whatever you want to call it for BG3, especially if its the same quality as Blood and Wine.

Narrator: you sense something staring at you from afar, something pulls your gaze from the screen and, as you slowly turn your head your good eye catches the time. your gaze is now drawn to your wife (Raphael) as you realise you have been playing for almost 8 hours straight.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"In 1998, after seeing Saving Private Ryan at the tender supple age of 16, I wrote a letter to god knows what game developer that essentially outlined what this game actually is:  gritty, slow-paced foot races to take objectives, forced team work and communication, and the iron-sight dominated battlefield.  

I won't lie:  I had the exact same frustrations as everyone else: ""I can't see anyone!"".  Take it from me:  MOVE SLOWLY.  APPROACH CORNERS METHODICALLY.  STICK YOUR HEAD OUT SLOWLY.  WAIT.  LOOK FOR MOVEMENT.  IF NONE, TRY MOVING.  REPEAT.

The only way to have a ""truly"" enjoyable time is to use a headset, participate in chat and strategy, call in requests for supplies, put down garrisons and outposts.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'm pushing 1500 hours and decided it was time for a review. Here you go.

As a long time Morrowind addict I was hesitant to jump on the ESO bandwagon.  I'd heard a lot of bad stuff about it when it was first released and solidly decided I was in the camp of 'that's not a real Elder Scrolls game, it's a cashgrabbing, PVPing, mainstream-appealing mess'.  Which. to be fair, was kind of accurate back around initial release (from what I've heard). Jump forward give years though, and it's come a looooooooong way.

Lore: 
If I'd started playing and found the lore side of things to be poorly addressed I would have stopped playing. I haven't stopped playing. Established lore is maintained and adhered to well, and the game adds its own bits and pieces - some new stuff, some expanding on previous knowledge.  And there's plenty of books lying around for the lore enthusiasts to pore over. You could quite easily play the game and completely ignore the lore aspect, if that''s your thing, but you'd be missing out on a huge part of the charm of the ES world.

Gameplay: 
Top notch questing, both the main questlines (of which there are many) and also standalone side quests. Keeping in line with previous titles in the series, there's been an effort made to minimise 'Go and kill X bandits' or 'Fetch me X golden watercress seeds' type quests. While ultimately all quests will be basically 'Go there, do this, come back' they are well presented, relevant to the storyline and generally cohesive.

There are less world-changing decisions that can be made than in other games of the series, but that's part and parcel of the MMO genre. Occasionally you will meet a new character who obviously thinks they know you - as far as I can tell this is an overhand from early days when different areas of the world were levelled, and progress was more linear. Modern ESO has level-scaling across the board, meaning you can access previously 'end-game' zones from the get go. It's not gamebreaking, and very minor - took me ages to even realise it was happening. 

Combat:
My first impression was that regardless of class/playstyle you end up being forced to do magick-y stuff. Coming from earlier games where playing as a warrior (or whatever non-magic class) means you can basically light attack, heavy attack or block I was....somewhat irked. Combat is basically a combination of buffing yourself/debuffing enemies with 'abilities' and then using normal attacks interspersed with other 'abilities'. All these abilities are accompanied by much pomp and circumstance - flames, sparkles, sound effects and such. I was kind of miffed that I couldn't just hit things with a sword/arrow/morningstar and occasionally swig a health potion. Once again, it's an MMO - not a single player adventure game. Took a while to get used to, but you adjust. There's also wiggle room if you want to be more of a purist, but you'll be cutting yourself off from most of the group/endgame activities by doing so.

Classes/Races:
Well handled. Nightblade is the quintessential 'Thief' class, Sorceror is the 'Mage' and Templars, Dragonknights and Wardens are a bit of a mixed bag. There's less of a Warrior/Mage/Thief theme and more of a Damage/Healer/Tank vibe to the whole affair, due to the traditional 4 man party setup for group activities. Too much reading online will convince you that to be any good at all you need to shoehorn yourself into the current 'meta' build for whatever role you want to fill. Reading these guides and builds is a great way to understand how to use skills more effectively or learn how different armour sets can help in combat, but at the end of the day they're best ignored. Play the character you want to play - if you were good enough to benefit from squeezing an extra 1.6% DPS out of your toon you wouldn't need to read a guide to find out how to do it.

Races are pretty faithful to tradition, with 'passives' that are vaguely in line with with the old 'Altmer have extra magicka', 'Khajiit be sneaky' stuff. Nothing to prevent you from making an Orc healer or an Altmer brawler if you wish, though.

Community:
Generally good, always feel free to ask questions in zone chat if you need a hand with something. Lot's of helpful sorts out there. PUGs can be a bit toxic sometimes, but it's easy to just leave the group if you can't be bothered dealing with someone excessively unpleasant. Hundreds of guilds to join, everything from trading to roleplaying to hardcore score pushers. On that note, if you're trying to do an endgame trial and suck, the other people are NOT being toxic. There's an expectation that you will contribute effectively, and if you're not, well tough potatoes.

Crafting:
Only mentioning because it's a big part of the in-game economy and a main reason for lots of people to play. In the course of your adventures you'll collect oodles of furnishing designs, armor and weapon style diagrams, foodstuffs, raw resources and other shiny bits and bobs. Level up your crafting skills and you can make your own gear, make furniture, potions/poisons to use or sell. You can also just go out foraging for stuff and sell your spoils through a guild for a tidy profit. Nice low-key way to spend an hour or two if you don't feel like combat or questing and just want to romp around outside enjoying the landscape.

Real money:
Yes, there's a 'Crown Store' where you can buy stuff with your IRL fundage. I don't think many people use it. Lot's of flashy stuff (and lots of cosmetics) that after a few weeks of playing you can mostly find or make yourself in-game. Subscribing to ESO Plus gets you an unlimited inventory for crafting resources (very handy) and access to all the DLC content (which can also be purchased one-off if you prefer). It also gives you 1500 crowns per month, so you can fritter it away on the more useful/appealing items if you so wish. The game is fully playable without subscribing, it's really just a QOL improvement and means you don't have to pay upfront for the many DLC zones.

Overall:
I love this game. It's huge, both geographically and in terms of content. New areas are being released regularly and despite the whining on forums, the dev team does a good job of addressing issues and making the game enjoyable, accessible and true to the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe.  You can play this as an MMO, a single-player game or anything in between. You can RP your way through the overland regions, or min-max your way onto some very competitive leaderboards.  For me, it's a great continuation of he Elder Scrolls series and also a very enjoyable (and affordable) MMO without that horrible WoW feel to it. You're not forced into any particular playstyle based on your class or race, and there's enough content to keep anyone busy for many thousands of hours. 

If you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, or MMOs, or RPGs in general, I suggest you give it a try. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but such a large bag that you'll never get bored.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"TLDR; There is an abundance of content, but none of it feels especially fun or meaningful. I would avoid this entry in the series in favor of 3,4, or 5.

Yikes... I really wanted this game to be good, I really really did. I 100% completed every other Far Cry game starting at 3, and enjoyed it pretty well. But this game is just bad. I'm currently in the process of finishing it up, but I wouldn't really recommend that anyone else start it. There was a lot of potential here, but it was botched pretty bad.

Let me first give credit where credit is due; the open world of Yara is absolutely stunning. There is such a wide variety of environments to explore and they all feel pretty well fleshed out. I have enjoyed exploring Yara through and through. It is absolutely beautiful, and you can see so far from the highest peaks. Also, the character of Dani is great. This is the first Far Cry to have an engaging protagonist. You can choose your gender, but the dialogue is the same either way. Dani makes decent quips, doesn't talk excessively in my opinion (though it is quite frequent), and generally felt good to play as. Also, awesome takedown and healing animations have returned!

And my praise unfortunately ends there. There were a lot of innovative ideas added to this game, such as the Supremos and a more in depth crafting and base building system. Loot crates are also back from the earlier entries like FC3 and 4, but instead of money they give you weapons, clothes, and crafting materials. Oddly, I didn't despise any of these systems, and I think they could've been much more fun or rewarding given better implementation. Weapons crafting is fun, but excessively grindy in order to get you to make micro transactions, and a lot of tradeoffs you make in what equipment you use are just plain dumb. Who would take fire protection over being able to easily tag enemy locations? Many buffs in this game are too circumstantial to be swapped out; some of them should've just been upgrades.

I won't go into everything, because there's a ton of content which is excessively padded out to artificially inflate playtime. What you need to know is that a lot of this could have been fun if the core gameplay of Far Cry 6 were more fun and engaging. It is not. Combat feels flat most of the time, with you either rolling over enemies with no effort whatsoever, or occasionally an enemy will be much stronger than they should be and take too many hits to kill (why do I sometimes have to hit a helicopter with 3 rockets to down it and other times just one?). The gameplay loop and sandbox are repetitive in this way very consistently and by probably around 50 hours you really start to feel exhausted by it.

And the story... it's a joke. The main villain doesn't get much screen time or development, which is an issue when most Far Cry entries favor their villains and when said villain is ON THE PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL FOR THE GAME. There's also a general lack of nuance that was present in other entries; in 3,4, and 5 you were made to question your actions as the main character and whether what you were doing was right. In this game, it feels like you're expected to side with the guerillas even when they do horrendous things, like dangling the corpse of a military official over the water for show, just as she had done prior. I haven't reached the ending, but I don't expect that to change there. The main cast is generally unlikable with only a few exceptions, and a lot of times I found myself rooting for the bad guys out of spite. It feels like the writers are using the game as their own fantasy of a glorious revolution where they're absolutely in the right all the time, except for the people they use to represent the ""good guys"" are generally obnoxious teenagers who take pleasure in killing with a disturbing lack of self awareness. This is something that almost every other Far Cry addresses, but it doesn't seem to in this one.

Also there's a very obvious push for diversity and it really comes at no benefit to the plot. There are gay and transgender characters that were clearly thrown in just for the sake of trying to appeal to a wider audience at a surface level. In every case that I've seen thus far, these inclusions make NO meaningful addition to the plot. Whether you view this as another case of forced diversity or as a pandering technique to the LGBT community, it's bound to annoy you either way.

Some of the DLCs aren't bad though. The ones that let you play through the minds of the main villains from prior games are interesting and pretty engaging even. However, you have to complete them in one sitting and they expect multiple replays, which are frustrating. I don't find the gameplay compelling enough to warrant that many playthroughs, and trying to find time to finish one of these at a time could sometimes be difficult for me.

Overall, I would just stay away from this one. I really wanted to like it, but it just feels almost incomplete. The story and gameplay are generally a flop, and while the map IS beautiful, it's not enough on its own to make this game worth playing.","Mostly Positive72% of the 15,575 user reviews for this game are positive.",abundance feel especially fun meaningful avoid entry series favor 3 4 5 yikes wanted good really_emphasized 100 completed far cry starting 3 enjoyed pretty bad currently process finishing recommend else potential botched pretty bad credit credit due open world yara stunning wide variety environment explore pretty fleshed enjoyed exploring yara beautiful far highest peak dani great far cry engaging protagonist choose gender dialogue dani make decent quip t_emphasizedalk excessively opinion frequent generally good awesome takedown healing animation returned praise unfortunately end there_emphasized innovative idea supremo depth crafting base building loot crate earlier entry fc3 4 weapon clothes crafting material oddly despise system fun rewarding given implementation weapon crafting fun excessively grindy order micro transaction tradeoff equipment plain dumb fire protection able easily tag enemy location buff circumstantial swapped upgrade ton excessively padded artificially inflate playtime fun core far cry 6 fun engaging not_combat feel flat rolling enemy no_effort whatsoever occasionally enemy stronger hit kill helicopter 3 rocket time loop sandbox repetitive consistently probably 50 hour exhausted joke villain screen development issue far cry entry favor villain villain promotional material general lack nuance present entry 3 4 5 question action feel expected side guerilla horrendous thing dangling corpse military official water prior reached ending expect cast generally unlikable exception time found rooting bad guy spite feel writer fantasy glorious revolution except represent good guy generally obnoxious teenager pleasure killing disturbing lack self awareness far cry address obvious push diversity come no_benefit plot gay transgender character clearly thrown sake trying appeal wider audience surface case far inclusion no_meaningful addition plot view case forced diversity pandering technique lgbt community bound annoy dlcs bad one mind villain prior game interesting pretty engaging complete sitting expect multiple replay frustrating compelling warrant playthroughs trying finish difficult stay wanted feel incomplete generally flop map beautiful not_enough worth

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Black Flag is competing to be the best Assassin's Creed title since Assassin's Creed II.
Not only the story is well written to a point that not only the gamer relates to the main character, a pirate named Edward Kenway, it also creates an emotional tide with the adventure and exploration of sailing the high seas and hunting treasure and other bounties while discovering more about the Assassins, the Templars, and the secrets of both.

Sailing.
Before Black Flag was released there was a game no one heard of called Pirates of The Burning Sea, a F2P MMO that currently had the title for best Sailing experience, Black Flag took that away and better.
With a immerse and easy to understand camera and control mechanics sailing in Black Flag is an amazing time, so much so that the game gives you the option to Fast Travel if needed, and I played for over 50 hours completing the game, without Fast Traveling Once.
With the additions of random AI Ships with Different Random Cargo roaming the seas, special challanges, secrets, and different weather and time conditions, the sailing it self sells the game.

Running.
The main aspect of running and jumping on rooftops and trees to explore ways to complete your objectives still a big thing and very well crafted, the only Con to it is that often you find yourself jumping in Hay Stacks or Trees just by running Aside some, which is a very hard thing to balance, but even tho very frustrating at the time, it goes away as soon as you get done with it.

Storyline.
The main storyline is very interesting to watch read and play, with various famous characters as usual of an Assassin's Creed game, introduced very well in the story.
The ending feels solid, and with enough questions for more story, but not enough to upset anyone.

Multiplayer.
The multiplayer feels more balanced than previous AC titles, with more maps and a more fluid and Skill Based mechanic.
The only bad thing is that as always and sadly gamers would always for some reason find ways to exploit game mechanics for an easy win.
The game introduced GameLabs a feature that allows players to customize Game Modes, everything from what skills can be used, to how much a kill would be worth, and what kind.
The issue currently with GameLabs is that you can only play your custom made Game Modes with your friends, and only find a Random ""Approved"" Type on the public lobby.
With enough luck, that would be fixed, and a new feature would allow gamers to publicly host GameLab creations for any player to pick and play.

Overall this is the level of detail the so called Next Gen titles should be all about. Great environments graphics, level design, interaction, and details to very small things.
This might be the best AC Title so far, and might also be GOTY.","Very Positive88% of the 55,599 user reviews for this game are positive.",black flag competing best assassin creed title assassin creed ii not_only written not_only gamer relates pirate named edward kenway creates emotional tide adventure exploration sailing high sea hunting treasure bounty discovering assassin templar secret sailing black flag released no_one heard called pirate burning sea f2p massively multiplayer online currently title best sailing black flag took immerse easy understand camera control mechanic sailing black flag amazing give option fast travel needed 50 hour completing fast traveling addition random ai ship different random cargo roaming sea special challanges secret different weather condition sailing self sell running aspect running jumping rooftop tree explore way complete objective big crafted con jumping hay stack tree running aside hard balance tho frustrating go soon storyline storyline interesting watch read various famous character usual assassin creed introduced ending feel solid question not_enough upset multiplayer multiplayer feel balanced previous ac title map fluid skill based mechanic bad sadly gamers way exploit mechanic easy win introduced gamelabs allows player customize mode skill kill worth kind issue currently gamelabs custom mode friend random approved type public lobby luck fixed allow gamers publicly host gamelab creation pick detail called next gen title great environment graphic design interaction detail small thing best ac title far goty

Astore was born of two white parents, yet suspiciously looked to be of partial African descent. Despite looking nothing like his ""father"", he still managed the Empire much better than his predecessor. His sister, Agostina, who also looked to be half-black, ruled the neighboring Empire of Francia. Because the realm split when Iliya died, they both had a strong claim on their respective empires. 

Despite this, they both considered each other great friends. And the comfort of this friendship helped Astore greatly after his firstborn son was mysteriously murdered. As an emperor, he was known to be extremely generous and kind. He helped put down many rebellions caused by his ""grandfather"", and restored much of the land which had previously been lost. By the time Astore was 75 years old, he had lived a long and content life. 

It all came crashing down, however, when an extremely old man offered to give Astore a secret in exchange for a favor. Expecting the secret to be some mundane thing, such as some man from India having slept with one of his courtiers, Astore reluctantly accepted the offer. However, the secret was nothing less than the true murderer of Astore's son: Agostina, his only sister, best friend, and faithful ally. 

Betrayed, Astore declared war on the 80 year old Agostina, shattering the alliance. The war waged for 4 years until she was eventually captured and executed.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"[hr][/hr][h1]SYNOPSIS[/h1][hr][/hr]
[i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is unquestionably awe-inspiring, artistically beautiful, superbly unique, and delivers (what can be) an unbelievably immersive and memorable experience if you’re willing to build a deep understanding of its mechanics...

HOWEVER, you MUST keep this key point in mind if you’re considering playing this game:
[quote][b][u]THIS IS A PVP GAME.[/u] Your enjoyment is based *entirely* on whether your style of play harmonizes with the other players who share the sea.[/b][/quote]
That in this mind, here’s my summary for each audience:
[list]
[*] [b]IF YOU DON’T HAVE FRIENDS WILLING TO LEARN, SUFFER, OR GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE [i]SEA OF THIEVES[/i] GAUNTLET, [U]DO NOT[/U] PLAY THIS GAME.[/b] You’ll have to endure A LOT of trivialized efforts, crushed dreams, verbal abuse, and game mechanics that are wholly unsympathetic of your time to reach the enjoyable parts of the experience.

[*] [b]IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD, STORY-BASED EXPLORATION GAME FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS, THEN PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.[/b] That good, story-based exploration game is *definitely* in there, but can get lost in the salt.

[*] [b]IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR A COMPETITIVE ONLINE FIRST-PERSON PIRACY GAME WITH BRILLIANT NAVAL COMBAT AND COSMETIC-BASED PROGRESSION, *ABSOLUTELY* PLAY THIS GAME![/b] It will be worth your time to learn, master, and conquer the high seas!
[/list]
Okay; onward to the in-depth review points!

[hr][/hr][h1]🟢 THE POSITIVES[/h1][hr][/hr]
[b]➕ SAILING MECHANICS.[/b] The cornerstone of any sailing game should be the boat mechanics, and [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] delivers. It does a masterful job of blending the complexity of sail and wind management, ship-to-ship cannon-play, and a variety of sailing mechanics to create a brilliant seafaring experience!

[b]➕ THE WATER.[/b] THE WAVES AND WATER IN THIS GAME: U.N.B.E.L.I.E.V.A.B.L.E! 🌊🌊🌊

[b]➕ The ART.[/b] In fact, the *ENTIRE* art style of the game is undisputedly STUNNING! From the golden shores to the volcanic frontiers, the game is built on [i]National Geographic[/i]-quality landscapes!

[b]➕ BETTER WITH FRIENDS.[/b] This can’t be understated enough: [b]the seas can be a ROUGH place—both when it comes to gameplay AND the people you meet along the way. Bring a crew so you don’t have to face it alone! 💯[/b]

[b]➕ HORIZONTAL PROGRESSION.[/b] The game has no vertical progression; there’s no “leveling up” to become a better pirate with better equipment or gain any mechanical advantage over your opponents. The playing field is level every time you roll a new ship—apart from your personal knowledge and mastery of the game mechanics!

[b]➕ The OPEN WORLD and the “INFINITE QUEST LOOP.”[/b] While the world is your oyster to explore the moment you leave the dock, there’s also an incredibly brilliant “quest loop” that emerges as you discover expeditions and unlock special emissary quests as you gain their favor. The game rewards you with better and quicker rewards the longer you play—making it incredibly easy to lose yourself for HOURS on end!

[b]➕ The STORY VOYAGES (aka “TALL TALES”).[/b] Much of the game’s lore is presented in story voyages known as Tall Tales. These concise, open world stories are a *fantastic* way to explore the world and learn about the magic that drives the [i]Sea of Thieves[/i]. (There’s even checkpoints to save your progress in case you’re ganked by some salty pirate!)

[b]➕ HUMOR![/b] As is typical in most Rare games, there’s a glorious, tongue-in-cheek humor woven throughout the gameplay and narrative experience. The world doesn’t take itself too seriously, which helps you get lost in the joy of the game!

[b]➕ The LIVESTREAM COMMUNITY.[/b] Where the game falls short of teaching the game and community norms, the streaming community is a BRILLIANT resource to fill in those gaps. Take the time to tune in and find a few favorite streamers:
[list][*] [url=https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Sea%20of%20Thieves]Sea of Thieves on Twitch[/url][/list]

[hr][/hr][h1]🟡 THE...""TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT""[/h1][hr][/hr]
[b]〰️ QUESTS (aka “VOYAGES”).[/b] Voyages are quests offered by the trading companies that help you grow your wealth. Each company only offers two or three *unique* voyages, and while there is some randomness inherent to each voyage, they will begin to feel repetitive after (admittedly) several hundred hours of adventuring.

[b]〰️ HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.[/b] On one hand: the mechanics are relatively straightforward, simple to pick up, and offer room to master a multitude of tricks that’ll give you the upper-hand in a fight.

On the other: long animations, hit-reg issues, and a lack of “weight” to your hits can make it feel like you’re dueling with wet pool noodles.

[b]〰️ ⚠ SAFETY PROTOCOLS: DISENGAGED ⚠[/b] The moment you set sail, you’ll be with the greenest of green sailors and the hardest, saltiest, most cutthroat pirates on the waves. Though skeleton ships will help you practice and prepare for the PvP encounters you’ll inevitably face, there’s no real, “safe” space to hone your skills as you play—a daunting hurdle to overcome early in the game experience.

[b]〰️ The PLAYERS[/b] …are truly a mixed bag. Some days you’ll make meaningful connections with pirates who are humble in victory, merciful through teaching, or powerful allies on the seas. Other days, you’ll encounter the most toxic, unfeeling players whose singular goal is to break your spirit. All you can do is be prepared for both…

[b]〰️ FISHING.[/b] While fish are both a source of nourishment and highly-desired by the fishing guild, the fishing mechanics themselves aren’t that interesting, and sadly feel like more of a time sync than an enjoyable minigame with meaningful rewards.

[b]〰️ The LACK OF SEA LIFE.[/b] While not game-breaking in any way, the variety of ocean life is sadly lacking in an otherwise STUNNING game... 😞

[hr][/hr][h1]💢 THE NOT-SO-GREAT[/h1][hr][/hr]
[b]➖ The game only *KIND OF* CARES ABOUT YOUR TIME.[/b] My biggest complaint with [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is the fact that many mechanics are designed to waste your time. Whether seeking out tiny dig spots on massive islands, fighting waves of skeletons for hours, or fighting a hooked fish for several minutes, the game is [i]NOT[/i] friendly if you’re looking to jump in for any less than two hours at a time.

[b]➖ The game does very little TEACHING.[/b] While the Maiden Voyage is a good place to learn the basic mechanics of the game, it doesn’t go into great depth and fails to cover several critical mechanics to the experience: including wind angles, bailing and repairing in combat situations, cannon mechanics, etc.

[b]➖ The game relies on XBOX LIVE.[/b] While this unifies all of the different platforms under a single account, the XBL service is clunky when it comes to making, inviting, or communicating with friends.

[b]➖ The PIRATE CODE are more what you'd call...“guidelines”...than actual rules.[/b] The code is a reminder of what the game proposes in a community and where it consistently falls short of nurturing that environment.

[b]➖ CHARACTER CREATION.[/b] While character creation guarantees a…”gruff” selection of pirates, it can be frustratingly limited if you’re particular about the look of your character..

[hr][/hr][h1]🤔 THE FINAL WORD…[/h1][hr][/hr]
[i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is a truly fantastic game held back by its indifference to the player experience and an insufferable community…and while some days will create some of your most memorable experiences in gaming, others will make you regret every hour you’ve invested to get there.

I will say, this game is my favorite game yet in 2023-2024. As a player who specializes on FPS Shooters, I will say I enjoy the game a lot. The grinding is a lot and have some cute anime girls in it, my fav is Cagliostro... don't judge me. As a person who got extremely disappointed with Gensh*t, this game is definitely leagues better than that game. Definitely requires way more skill to play compared to Gensh*t. 

The best part of this game that it is not a gacha game, so not much ""immoral"" practices of draining your wallets out for a chance to get a character. Definitely a money worth  and I am willing to spend money on DLC where you are guaranteed to get certain characters, and doesn't require you to slave everyday (but you can do so, because I did). I am hoping that they plan to add more characters from CyGames universe (Please Kasumi Kirihara... please come home...), and hoping this game will last years to come by them adding DLCs.

For context, I play very limited amount of RPG games. The RPG games I have played and enjoyed are Monster Hunter World & Rise and Pokemon (already stopped playing). I played a couple of gacha games (Gensh*t & Arknights) and was fan of Princess Connect from CyGames. Just a big fan of their character designs over most other franchises so far.

For me, it is worth to get the full price tag (it is cheaper at my place because regional pricing). But if you do not want to dish out as much money, wait for it to go on sale (I doubt it will come any time soon though). I am planning to support game companies that support good practices like selling premium games and having DLCs to add more extra stuff like cosmetics and more story/game modes.

[b] IMPORTANT!!! [/b]
I do want to give a word of warning. I would [b] RECOMMEND [/b] turning off Steam Cloud Save and turn off auto save. The reason is if you are somehow saving and a blackout happens that causes your PC to turn off... or just a BSOD, your save file [b] WILL GET CORRUPTED [/b] and lose your save. This will cause you to start from beginning or find out another solution (using saves). 
Ask me how I find this out...

Your save file will be located in AppData\Local\GBFR\Saved\SaveGames
The easiest way to access this is to type ""%AppData%"" in the directory. Then go to Local after clicking AppData in the directory.

899770,Last Epoch,"There have been recent review bombs because of multiplayer ""launch"" issues. Basically, the developers spent a long time working on making their single-player game multiplayer, and launch got hammered by 3-4x their expected player numbers, so the servers had massive issues. I personally don't think people should review games based on server issues that are in the process of being fixed in a game that's still in beta, but I digress. 

At the time of writing this I have 30 some odd hours on steam, but maybe 100-200 with their standalone launcher throughout the past few years. I've watched this game grow from the most barebones, amateur looking RPG, to a super polished, promising soon-to-be competitor to the loot-based ARPG behemoths (PoE, d4). 

Last Epoch is an uncut gem. I've watched the passionate developers work based on community feedback and vision for years now. I cannot wait to see where this game is in a year or two at this trajectory, because the 0.9 multiplayer launch has already far exceeded my expectations. I don't think it's in a position to compete with PoE and D4 at the moment, but as it grows and gets better and better it definitely will. This is a developer team to watch closely, and It would be dumb for GGG and Blizzard to not take a look at how they've taken outdated systems from other ARPGs and made them a lot better. 

This game as is pre-launch is already a 7/10. As they flesh out end game, add their 3 launch classes, and stick to their philosophy on game design and working with the community to make a good game, I can easily foresee it being a 9/10, and I expect that it will end up sharing the top few spots in viewer numbers with PoE in the ARPG genre.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"I love GBF and I'm happy. I'm eating real good right now. Welcome to my table, friend.

[h1]This game has no right to be this good[/h1]
First, let me open the windows real quick:
Downsides are criminally bad EN voice acting (for the love of god switch to the godtier JP VA) and localization, some stability jank and hub CPU overhead despite the good perfs and instant loading times, badly thought-out co-op downscaling that makes playing with underleveled friends a sad experience, underwhelming rewards for quick-questing, no PC<->PS crossplay, no GBF codes on PC, and multitarget attack magnetism hating you.
Okay, we can breathe now.

[b]We are only in February and it's already my [i]mercilessly[/i] uncontested GOTY.[/b]

Immediately buy it now if you like any of those: Character-action combat (Platinum games), MMORPG raidboss mechanics, Final Fantasy aesthetics, Monster Hunter beast slaying and game loop, Tales of JRPG comfort food, Skies of Arcadia or floating islands in general, or huge angry lizards.
Worth at a discount if you just want to enjoy the short and generic, but explosively spectacular tutorial that is the main story.

[b]Gameplay, presentation, visuals, and soundtrack [i]are at the top[/i] of the J-ARPG genre.[/b]
Count 60-ish hours to complete the game up to the current Proud difficulty last boss. 8-16 intense hours if you only want to play the main story. Hundreds if you want to be that one guy with every character maxed to high heaven. Post-game is very challenging and has some cheesable grind.

[h1]Unexpectedly blue skies[/h1]
Granblue Versus first introduced me to the franchise with a stellar fighting game, and made me fall in love with its world -as a huge fan of anything celestial fantasy- and its characters, from my goofy main bro Lowain to the ever so popular Narmaya. After a while, I made the mistake of touching the browser game and got hooked by its progression, story, grid system, Narita's music ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjsv056BXE ) and Minaba's pretty draph pictures ( https://gbf.wiki/Character_Tier_List pick your poison).
While every love story has its honeymoon, what follows is often a bitter marathon. [b]And good lord if Cygames isn't a company that masters the monkey paw like no other...[/b]
Every great addition was punctuated by terrible management decisions and very strong disconnections with their games' identities and playerbases. After years of going through nonsensical balancing in VS (and still going, hello 66L), and debacles like GBF's infamous summer fortune, revans weapons BS and simply inhumane grinds, I got used to the ways of that company... Or so I thought.

After 7 tumultuous years of development, what we thought was basically vaporware, came back from development hell to slap our collective behinds, into a now million-selling release on PC alone. And... just wow.

[h1]A game that knows exactly what it wants to do[/h1]
The identity crisis most JRPGs and ARPGs face generally takes the form of a thick layer of bland-tasting fat, with stories that try being impactful but fall flat, convoluted and broken systems, endless padded sidequests and oh my god the pacing! Here, most of it is trimmed, with some remnants to remind you that this is a Granblue game, and to lure you in with some sweet suspension of disbelief. And by the time you realize it, [b]you're enjoying the gameplay so much you just forget about everything else[/b]. You know the story is McDonalds JRPG slop. Relink knows the story is McDonalds JRPG slop. You look at each other and nod, then cut to the chase.

There's the hubs, the main story and the co-op monster hunter-like gameloop. Everything else is treated like the aforementioned fat and aggressively cut. Forget long character intro monologue cutscenes. Here you have a few gists in voiced text blocks in the form of fate episodes. Collectables? There's just a few barely hidden chests in your way. Side-quests? It's just auto-complete stuff you automatically hit as you progress through co-op with some handy repeatables for that endgame grind. Character banter? Percival orders Vane to bark for him as you chain skybound arts together, no need for a dedicated cutscene that cuts your gameplay for 5 minutes.
Dialogues and cutscenes exist to put the fights in context and that's it, and they are all skippable and handily summed up if need be. Hub area, dialogue, short cutscene, repeat. [b]The momentum never stops[/b] and you surprise yourself binge-eating the game at 2 AM, wanting for more every chapter...

...And that's only the tutorial.

All of it is presented in a polished package with one of the most beautiful and tightly executed art directions this techart nerd has ever seen. It's [b]Hideo Minaba's illustrations coming alive[/b], with jaw-dropping vistas and hub areas that brim with life and personality from Folca's retired draph soldiers teaching swordfighting to a bunch of kids to Ghandagoza getting lost in Seedhollow's backstreets.
The visual effects are omnipresent and bursting with energy while staying perfectly readable in some Proud fights' bullet hell situations. I very much know how difficult these things are to pull off and this simply leaves me in admiration.

[b]The game keeps raising the bar on every chapter in every form[/b]. And one I haven't talked about yet is the soundtrack. In short, you are not ready.
As always, Tsutomu Narita + Nobuo Uematsu + Stella Magna is a very deadly combination.
While it sometimes re-uses tracks from good ol' GBF, it has many original tracks that are among Narita's very best works. If you don't mind me spoiling you the battle track for the base antagonist in the game's cover art, Id, here's a sample of what you can expect from this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDq5_PZ57xg

[h1]And now, the meat[/h1]
[b]This is the best-feeling action combat I have ever touched[/b]. It's heavy and observant like Monster Hunter, fast and deep like a bayonetta, over-the-top flashy like a Metal Gear Rising, strategic and demanding like an MMO raidboss, bullet hell-y like a Nier Automata, and has big number soup that goes brrr with insanely complex itemization theorycrafting like.... Granblue Fantasy.
You control one character in a Xenoblade-y party of four, starting with 6 base playable skyfarers and a pool of 12 you progressively choose and unlock as you progress through the game.
They are all incredibly varied, ranging from Lancelot's mash & dodge gorilla gameplay to Rosetta's buff and rose turret uptime rotation, Zeta's pogo stick loops with gradually tighter timings, Narmaya's super technical and fun stance dancing, Eugen's third person shooter mode, Io's cast-for-hours nukes... Every character is like playing a different game, and not a single one of them is boring, with multiple possible builds each. Fantastic kit design.
Teammates can be players or CPU, which are, surprisingly, [i]really[/i] good, like, better than the average player!
You hit, hit harder with another button, do character-specific combo routes, manage character mechanics and stacks/bars/etc, block, dodge, jump, attack in the air, use one of four skills of your choice, break enemy ""parts"", do linked attacks, chain ultimate moves into each other, use a variety of potions, revive teammates, become a doormat, spam silly stickers when the big dragon boss fires a huge laser so that all your teammates can see on their screen is a dumb obscure old man GBF meme bathed in blinding, lethal light.
Your equipment consists of your levellable weapon (customizable stat stick) and slots for sigils which contain traits that conditionally modify your stats or build you a certain way. This is pretty much GBF's grid and weapon mod system, and if there's one thing GBF vets will always say good things about aside from the pretty JPEGs, it's the grid.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Let's get this out there.
I played the Division 1 and 2, did the grind on Destiny, and grind for god rolls on Destiny 2 on the Season of Wish. 3,000+ Hours for both. I can give the beans and how the content is.


[ PROS ] 
- Decent story it's not the best, not the worse. Better than Days Gone, It's quite fast actually. 10+ Hours it took me, might vary if you are a 100%-er.

- Pretty Graphics, it's no Red Dead Redemption 2, but it's more on the side of Dragon Dogma/Breath Of The Wild. It's nice, and easy.

- The Combat, is hands down is my number 1. From Perfect Parrying/Guard to Perfect Dodges, abilities that give you rewards for doing so. Teamwork is HUGE, and it's pretty. Link-Bursts, Bad-ass Super Moves, it makes you feel like your own anime moment. If you chain your supers with your teams? You get huge bad-ass explosions. 'Nuff said  

- Casual or Min-Maxing, The sigil system which to put it easily, it's Monster Hunter's Perks/Charm system. You can crunch your numbers to the point you have to include raising your Damage Cap.

- The Roster, not to shabby to be honest. You like the heavy hitters? Got them, Fast slashing type of folk? Got it, You like trading blow for blow on the enemy? Got that too, and support. Which by the way, you can use the sigils to make almost all of the roster support, dps, tank, healer.

- Music, well. I made it to end game, and I'll tell you. Those bosses have some real DBZ vocal energy. It's goooooood.

- You can play solo and still have the same fun as with a group. The AI are pretty smart.

- Endgame has some bad-ass bosses, and also pretty challenging. Ranks for difficulty: Easy/Normal/Hard/Very Hard/Maniac/Proud and to get to Proud Rank? It makes you work for it but man is it good.

[ CONS ]

- Matchmaking is..50//50. Looking at like 1-4 minute wait times.

- Semi-Live Service game, not much is known about the future after the content drops. (Three to be exact) After that? It's clouded.

- Grind, if you want to survive in Maniac + Proud. If you are planning to go that high be ready. The grind isn't bad, honestly. Way better than Destiny 2.

- Stupid freaking parrot saying sugoi or very good for the 8395287359827th time after transmuting a sigil.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                 I give it a  8.9/10. A fun game, keeps ya busy good to keep you playing for a time to come. Worth it in my opinion and it leads me

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"I know most of you are just here to see how the game perform so here's my thought

I have an RTX 3070 and i7-10700KF CPU. All my settings are on high with ray tracing turned off. I am playing with Patch 7 right now, and I have about 70 to 90 FPS in smaller areas. But once I go to an open area, my frame drops to 50. It also drops when there are smoke effects from the enemy smashing the ground. My game also crashed 2 times in the 5 hours I've played today. I don't really recommend it unless your PC is super good. Come back after you've finished Baldur's Gate 3.

Now for the actual game I actually kinda like it.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is really satisfying. It's an improvement over the last game. Parrying feels more responsive and more satisfying. Each lightsaber style actually has a purpose. Double-bladed has a wider attack area, dual dual-blade has faster attacks. I am having a blast fighting bosses.

Character:
For Cal, I think he is a much better character than he was in the last game. He acts more natural and is more lovable. In this game, he truly feels like a Jedi survivor. As a surviving Jedi, he sounds and acts more like a normal civilian since he has been living among the people for a few years. But he is also a good guy because of his Jedi background, which isn't how normal people would act. Normal people in the Galaxy would be more selfish and greedy, and this took them by surprise when they see Cal being such as good person. This makes Cal more believable as a Jedi who has been living among normal people.

Exploration:
The exploration is whatever. The world is a little empty in some areas, and you don't feel intrigued when you explore. You do it because the map tells you, you haven't explored this area yet, and you expect to find good loot. Personally, I like it when I am motivated by the environment itself instead of the game telling me to explore. I wish the game used interesting buildings, landscapes, or NPC dialogues to motivate me to explore the world.

Story:
So far, the story is interesting. I am looking forward to finding out what happens next. And the game asks Cal some interesting and realistic questions instead of just defeating the empire, go kill the villain type of corny story. Cal's friends are telling him that it is meaningless for him to fight until he dies, and maybe it's time for him to be more selfish and think about how he wants to live. This is such a good question to ask and have our main character think about. For that, I am surprised and happy this is the direction the story is heading.
 
Graphics:
It's pretty good

Overall, I would 100% recommend this game if you can actually play it. What a shame.....

1599340,Lost Ark,"After hours of my life on this game... I've come to the sad conclusion that it can't be enjoyed.
The only thing I enjoy in this game is raiding with my friends if not for them I would have quit long ago.. I was going to put a list of pros and cons like most reviews but I am finding it hard to come up with pros aside from playing with friends but not everyone has friends that can play around the same times they can.. so I will just post the cons.

1. [Gate keeping] Players gate keep for everything in this game.. Items / your I level / your roster level / your class / your title / your pet / your card set / The crazy part is I don't blame them 1 bit because the game encourages it.. I mean think about it if you can get your raids done faster why would you not? it is not like you get anything for spending time with new players in fact you lose all the way around.. your time to play / your items / sanity.. even playing with friends can be hard because if someone has a hiccup you all die in raids and raiding is a must.. that brings me to number 2 below

2. [The Community] is very predatory you will be kicked from raids for messing up sometimes even once is enough and it don't matter if you are a new player or not..now what I mean by predatory is the high level players often sell buses to low level players or players that don't want to take the time to learn and them same high level players make alts that they use to sabotage other players raids so they can sell them buses to stay ahead in the game.. this has no sign of going away because 1 players mistakes costs everyone in raids and late game gear is locked behind them same raids.

3. [Honing] You have to hone your gear in this game to unlock content and the cost is insane.. just as an example I had an alt cost me over 250.000 gold just to gain 15 I levels.. 1475 to 1490.. you need 1490 to gain access to a raid called brelshaza.. and I didn't even count the gold I spent on getting the gear I needed to raid 60.000 which you need or you will be subjected to gate keeping.. this is over a months worth of gold raiding as a F2P player with 5 alts doing all of your raids weekly.. dealing with hard raids and a toxic community that won't let you learn unless you have friends to play with.. If I am being honest the raids are not even that hard but the community being toxic / rage quitting / sabotaging / makes them hard.. some light to raiding is they are nerfing how hard some of the raids are however they are also taking some of the gold you make out of them raids making it harder to hone up to the levels you need to get into higher level raids.

4. [Dead content] The game is filled with side quests in the form of islands you go to some of which have important things such as skill potions you need for your characters... I think it is an awesome idea to give players more to do in game.. however most of them islands need a group of players and can't be done solo.. so in the end the players that started when the game was released got to enjoy some of them islands until the player base got what they needed and the content died leaving new players or players that didn't focus on that content left out.

5. [Raiding] I like raids with my friends however some of my friends are not that good at raiding and don't have much time to sit and learn for hours so what ends up happening is we take time out to teach each other the raids this costs us entry into the higher level raids we need to progress and the items we have to use during learning time...overall setting us back weeks in progress cause raids can only be done weekly making it hard to enjoy teaching your friends or new players new raids and adding to the gate keeping that is already crazy in this game.. it is hard to keep raiding as a friends group cause honing can be lucky or unlucky setting you back or ahead not to mention time difference work / school schedule then the entry system I mentioned above... this leaves your friends or new players at the mercy of a toxic predatory community making raiding not enjoyable and gate keeping players progress stopping them from obtaining the gold/gear they need to progress in the game.

6. [Trading] Trading is locked behind a system that uses coins called pheons like a tax pheons are also used to buy your meta gear off the market however the cost is high making you not want to trade with players so you have the pheons to buy the meta gear you need to raid so you are not getting gate kept... not to mention you also can't send your alt characters gear that would be good for them cause it will still cost you pheons and pheons cost real money... pheons was a system put in place to stop bots from farming gear and trading it so that a market could exist however it stops players from helping friends or new players from obtaining the gear they need to progress driving market prices up and promoting gate keeping.

7. [Bussing] Bus/carry players.. I don't think Bussing overall is a bad thing sometimes players don't have the time to do raids on all 6 characters or they are being gate kept by the community however Bussing becomes bad when players take advantage of newer players by charging them crazy amounts of gold to pass a raid stopping them from having gold to hone and progress also stopping them from making gold by learning the raids creating a grey area where they have to pay to play or quit because depending on how long they have been bussing they will be so far behind that no one will want to help them learn or catch up leaving them gate kept.

8. [Time spent] Overall all sometimes it feels like the community traps players into playing so you don't fall behind... by gate keeping players with low roster levels or lack of titles from raids they need to progress making it so time off of the game hurts... not to mention it takes weeks/months to get the gold you need to build a meta character.. the game itself encourages you to make alt characters so you can level up your roster faster and so you will have more raids to do for gold but again this takes a lot of time to get done.. you have to take into account the fact it will cost gold to build every alt character you make before you can even use them to make gold cutting into even more of your time..not to mention each of them characters will be gate kept at some point making it take more time to get the gear they need from raids.. if you plan on playing every alt you make for profit the game will feel like a job and take up crazy amounts of your time... if you don't you will be gate kept for not having a high enough roster level and your progress will slow.

I can't recommend it to any new players knowing what I know after 1640 hours into playing...1. Raids need to be nerfed so players can't sabotage new players in hopes of selling buses... also so new players stand a chance at learning not just being kicked from party's and to cut down on the time it takes to raid when you have 6 characters to raid on. / 2. Honing cost is still way to high for a game that is losing ways to make gold Rapport/Raids / 3. Pheons have to go they don't stop bots they drive up the market and encourage gate keeping / 4. side content like the islands should be solo friendly for players that don't play much or don't have 7 friends on standby for when they do have time to play it especially since that content is important for progress / 5. Overall time it takes to get daily's done needs to be reduced as it is essential for roster level and character growth it takes way to much time to even think about side content when you have to do daily's on 6 characters / 6. Remove the ability to view other players roster levels to prevent gate keeping / 7. Remove entry costs from raids so players don't get punished for helping new players or friends learn... instead of promoting bussing / gate keeping / 8. Fix the engravings system so it has engravings we can actually use instead of just more excuses to gate keep players.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",hour life sad conclusion enjoyed enjoy raiding friend not_for quit long ago pro con review finding hard pro aside friend not_everyone friend time post con 1 gate keeping player gate item roster class title pet card set crazy blame 1 bit encourages raid faster not_it not_like spending player lose item sanity friend hard someone hiccup die raid raiding brings number 2 2 community predatory kicked raid messing matter not_now predatory high player bus low player player learn high player alt sabotage player raid bus stay ahead no_sign 1 player mistake cost raid late gear locked raid 3 honing hone gear unlock cost insane example alt cost 250 000 gold gain 15 level 1475 1490 1490 gain access raid called brelshaza count gold spent gear needed raid 60 000 subjected gate keeping month worth gold raiding f2p 5 alt raid weekly dealing hard raid toxic community learn unless friend honest raid not_even hard community toxic rage quitting sabotaging make hard light raiding nerfing hard raid taking gold raid harder hone level higher raid 4 dead filled side quest form island important thing skill potion character awesome idea player island group player solo player started released enjoy island base needed died leaving player player focus left 5 raiding raid friend friend not_that good raiding sit learn hour end happening teach raid cost entry higher raid progress item learning week progress cause raid weekly hard enjoy teaching friend player raid adding gate keeping already crazy hard raiding friend group cause honing lucky unlucky ahead not_to mention difference school schedule entry mentioned leaf friend player mercy toxic predatory community raiding not_enjoyable gate keeping player progress stopping obtaining gold gear progress 6 trading_emphasized locked us coin called pheons tax pheons meta gear market cost high not_want trade player pheons meta gear raid not_getting gate not_to mention send alt character gear good cause cost pheons pheons cost real pheons bot farming gear trading market exist stop player helping friend player obtaining gear progress driving market price promoting gate keeping 7 bussing bus carry player t_emphasizedhink bussing bad player raid 6 character gate community bussing bad player advantage newer player charging crazy amount gold pas raid stopping gold hone progress stopping gold learning raid creating grey pay quit depending long bussing far no_one help learn catch leaving gate 8 spent feel community trap player fall gate keeping player low roster level lack title raid progress hurt not_to mention take week month gold build meta encourages alt character roster faster raid gold take cost gold build alt gold cutting not_to mention character gate gear raid plan alt profit crazy amount gate not_having high roster progress slow recommend player knowing 1640 hour 1 raid nerfed player sabotage player hope selling bus player stand chance learning not_just kicked party cut take raid 6 character raid 2 honing cost high losing way gold rapport raid 3 pheons bot drive market encourage gate keeping 4 side island solo friendly player 7 friend standby especially important progress 5 take daily need reduced essential roster growth take side daily 6 character 6 remove view player roster level prevent gate keeping 7 remove entry cost raid player punished helping player friend learn promoting bussing gate keeping 8 fix engraving engraving excuse gate player

[i]I am writing this review on November 22nd, 2021 after the 1.31 patch[/i]

This game didn't have a good start, did it? But for the biggest part, it's all fixed now. 
There are still some bugs, but in most cases they are just visual.
To be honest they are quite ridiculously funny. Imagine driving alongside a character and then you witness the character start spinning to 360 degrees its limbs around like it was possessed by some demon.
In a way CP2077 became family for me, you know? You somewhat hate some of your relatives but you still love them in another way, right? Well that's CP2077 for me.
[i]What do we know? CP2077 is just too ahead of it's time, in the future when we will have implants real life, the entire world will be buggy and glitchy. This game is just immersive![/i]


It took me some few good hours to learn to love the game, and i would say, i am very happy i didn't give up on it.

[b]For the sake of not wasting much of your time with this review i will start with the bad[/b]

As i said above, as far as bugs go, it's pretty stable and i didn't really encounter anything that was major.
Obviously, people are different so this is purely my opinion, but i don't like how the car driving feels in this game, it feels too.. stiff and unnatural, it might be just me because i am used to old-school car driving, let's say GTA 3/NFS (anything before NFS 5 - Porsche). 
Driving a bike on the other hand is amazing, it's what i use most of the times.

- Another thing that is somewhat annoying, the waypointing system is somewhat bad, the routes you get aren't the most efficient ones, and often your objective isn't appearing on the 'floor' it really is, so you end up searching for something and then realize it might be in some hidden basement or something.
- The UI seems to be a bit cluttered and confusing and it takes a bit to get used to, or maybe i am just getting old, but i feel like there's no point in over-complicating things.
- The overall mechanics or however you want to call them feel somewhat mediocre, but it's fine by me, the game compensates with other stuff.
- You cannot edit your facial/body features/tattoos. Once you press that goddamn button. That's how you'll be stuck for life. 

One more thing, and this probably was my biggest 'oof' about the game was that the assault rifles are pretty awful.
Pistols? Good! Revolvers? Great! Sniper Rifles and Melee Weapons? Amazing!, but the assault rifles are just bad and inefficient. Even shotguns are decent. 

[b]But what about the good parts?[/b]

While this section might have less of these bulletpoints, they're the pillar of this game, the ultimate moneyshot.

The world is so big you will feel like frog in the Ural mountains, you will feel so small.It's quite an interesting feeling that i could never get from any game before, for me this thing made the game so much more immersive.
It's a beautiful game with purely astonishing views, amazing world details and such, but the size of it all, too. 
So many streets, alleys, not to mention if you go climbing like a goat on all the buildings.  
In my opinion, if you're into walking simulators, this alone could be worth your eddies (i.e. money).

The story is more than decent, it avoids some of the most boring cliches, although, it's not anything mindblowing.
Friendships and relationships come and go in odd ways, depending on how you make your decisions, i think it's pretty rare to actually feel like your decisions really affect people in games. To feel like you're actually influence someone real.
Often when i had to make decisions i was encountering dillemas such as 'Hm, c'mon, this dude is a decent fella, i shouldn't be a dick to him', and well, i usually don't overthink that kind of stuff in a game, lol.

The game is a modder's paradise if you're into that, the internet is full of tutorials and content, they aren't very finicky to install, however, updates usually tend to mess with them.

Did i mention side gigs? There's plenty of them, but also random events happening around as you walk, such as groups of gang members commiting dumb stuff. Obviously you can go past them, but would you? After this game will suck you in, you won't be able to stop sinking hours in it.
While we're on this subject, my advice would be to not rush into the story (I kinda did and i am not very happy about it), and enjoy some of these side stuff first, besides leveling up and getting cool stuff which will aid you in the main missions later, it's also the best way to get to know the game.

There's so many references and easter eggs, some subtle, some not so subtle, especially if you're from Eastern Europe.

You can play the game any way you want. You can go the boring route, non-lethal and stealthy, or you can go in guns blazing, and not leave one single cell in an enemy's body alive. Of course, a combination between all of these options is also a possibility, but i like to keep it simple.
I do wish it was more fun to play in stealth. While i usually am not the stealthy kind of gamer, i can and do appreciate a game with good stealth. CP2077 doesn't have a good nor bad stealth, it's just.. average, i guess?
(With this, i mean purely by how it feels for me to play it in stealth. You do get to be very creative in stealth, you have interesting ways to mess with the enemies and distract them, but the 'satisfaction' just isn't there for me)

Ultimately, it's a game that will suck you in, you will have fun for hours, the world is purely amazing, you'll feel like 'Woah' all the time. 

[b]Closing notes and random useless blabbering[/b]

I initially bought this game on pre-order, i was angry about the delays, before i got the chance to play it at the release, my PC died. Now after 1 year i finally get to play it (I know it's better that i didn't play it at launch, but it's about the principle).
I am happy with my purchase, and for the price i paid (one night out in the city [spoiler]I might have an alcohol problem though[/spoiler]), i had and still have a lot of fun, even if i already saw 2 endings, i am not letting my grip of it, i don't even remember when i was so caught in a game that i played it without a break until the sun was rising.
Probably i will go for full completion. 60h in this game passed so fast, and there's still plenty of juice in this baby.

As far as the developers go... I know they got a lot of poo thrown at them, but they're people and they make mistakes, and they weren't lazy. I would say things went wrong because of the team leading/resource management, but that's another subject and quite irrelevant. 
Point is.. their hearts are in the right place, and they fixed a majority of issues, and they still are working on the game.
Maybe i am being too soft about the situation, but it is what it is, i can't say i am not disappointed because it's not how i expected the game to be after how it was marketed pre-release, but i also like to believe i have some common sense and ability to make the best out of situations.

Edit:
After putting around 150h in this game, i must say, there were few more bugs i encountered, but nothing major, except, i once fell through the map and the game reloaded from the last checkpoint.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"So far, I'm impressed. 

There are a few minor flaws with balancing and whatnot, but Ghost Ship has always excelled at listening to critique, so I trust most of these will be patched by the time the full version drops. 

DRG: Survivor is fun and engaging. In my opinion, it toes the line between needing to ""sweat"" and ""I am become death"" very well. I've obviously not played all that much (especially compared to the time I've sunk into the original) but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. For an early access game, it looks fantastic and runs better than most v.1 games. 

With regard to flaws, the only glaring one is that I seem to be progressing rather quickly. I think veterans of this genre might find it a bit easy or perhaps just short. But I say this knowing that it's not yet finished, so I'm not too bothered by it at present. 

Many people seem to have a problem with the difficulty level, but I don't feel the same at all. I'm most impressed by the games ability to make each class feel unique and therefore more memorable. I think it's excellent thus far and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future.

582660,Black Desert,"I have mixed feelings at best about Black Desert Online, but ultimately my conclusion is that the negatives significantly outweigh the positives.

First, what the game does well. It's pretty. The life skills system, by which you progress your ability to craft, farm, trade, and perform the various noncombat labors of the game is very wide and developed. Farming is fun, combos are satisfying, and the world is fun to explore. There are moments when you find certain places or cities that it does feel like you're in a living world. There's a scope to the landscape that lends itself to immersion.

But every aspect of the game has been meticulously designed from the ground up to be better if maybe you just spent some money on it. There is inconvenience engineered into dozens upon dozens of systems to encourage you to swipe that plastic. The largest cost to be competitive is probably the monthly item which provides a whopping 30% increase to the efficiency of your marketplace transactions, making profitable trading out-of-reach for F2Pers. But there's so many other places. Out of context, I like the idea of restricted travel encouraging a short journey to actually move from place to place. Such a thing orients a player to the landscape and assists in the immersion I mentioned earlier. Those of you who have played Morrowind will know what I mean. But in Black Desert Online, the only fast-travel option is a cash shop item. Furthermore, there is a highly punishing system for breeding mounts where males can breed twice, females once, and there's only a small chance of the offspring being higher in level. Once they're out of ""breeds,"" you're done... unless you want to recharge with a shop item. C'mon, you'll get it, you want to go places fast, right?

I should mention there's an autotravel option. It makes your character navigate to the point you establish, be that the next quest or the next town or whatever. It can take 15 minutes to get between some towns, further for others, so yeah, go do something else for awhile. But there are, again, dozens of systems for doing this... many life skills and other activities are almost exclusively afk. Fishing. Processing. Horse training. It goes on. And you cannot do this while your computer is off or you are logged out of BDO ala EVE. 

This game wants you to be online all of the time. It wants you to be thinking about it all the time. Black Desert Online will make it obvious to you that if you want to play it successfully it wants you to make it a priority in your life. It's designed to be a habit. I enjoyed it for a few hours, but the more I played it, the more uncomfortable I became with how elegantly BDO is made to encourage unhealthy behavior. I played DOOM with a glass of scotch at hand, loving every second of demon-slaying glory. I stayed up late with friends playing League of Legends in college. I really loved the Guild Wars series. It's not a dislike of anything to do with videogames or MMOs. It's Black Desert Online. The only thing I can compare it to is those games on your choice of cellphone or tablet appstore that actively try to foster addiction. 

But it's so much more sophisticated. This is the distillation and refinement of the Korean MMO design philosophy. It is an engine that convinces you it's important and then tries to get into your wallet. The gaming public should be ashamed we tolerate this stuff. This thing is designed to create whales. Forget gaming, this thing isn't good for *society.* Black Desert Online does a few things well... but allowing it to succeed is a loss for gaming.

I have been playing FPS games since the original Doom, and I played Unreal Tournament (UT) and Quake 3 a lot when they were launched on 1999. To me, UT is the greatest, and I played every iteration since then. However, lately I think Epic (UT developer) have gone for kid-friendly stuff with Fortnite to milk them and lost hardcore people like me in the process. In comes APEX LEGENDS. 
This is the sci-fi themed Battle Royale that I have been looking for. Excellent fight dynamics, very good character differentiation,  good (but few) maps, great ping system and teamplay.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"EDIT: 

I created a video review for Patch #8. If you want to check it out I put a link at the end of this review. I know a lot of people found this initial review helpful and I hope my most recent one can help people decide whether or not they want to buy the game! 

So should you get Baldur's Gate 3? If you really like Larian RPG games then probably yeah, it's a lot like their other games with a few major differences that might make you not enjoy the game: 

1) The skills don't have CDs like in other games, they're based on 5E D&D so they're based on your class, so your class selection is very important and you'll need a balanced party.

2) If you're big into D&D games like me you might be frustrated at some of the Larian game mechanics, like Ray of Frost leaving ice beneath the feet of enemies and similar spells leaving fields on the ground that debuff or damage targets. Ray of Frost is the biggest offender since slipping on ice ends your turn, or your opponents turn making it the best mage cantrip for its RNG value. 

Is this game a sequel to Baldur's Gate 1 and 2? 

No, so far it seems like it has nothing to do with the other Baldur's Gates game besides the fact you're trying to get to Baldur's Gate to some degree but can't because monsters are fucking around in the countryside, as per usual. Your character is also not a Bhaalspawn so I'm not sure why they called it Baldur's Gate 3 when more accurately it should be like: Baldur's Gate: The Mind Flayering or something similar. 

Does the game run well? 

Depends on your machine, mine is fairly powerful and with the game ready Nvidia Driver the game runs smooth, however textures kinda pop in weirdly, the game is in Early Access so it's expected that the graphics aren't full up to snuff yet. 

Does the combat feel good? 

Yeah, it feels pretty good they got the 5E stuff in game to work really well and they added in special weapon attacks that make a big difference. The Combat is deadly, but fair and you have loads of options to subvert encounters and crush your enemies. Beyond that it's not a big murder hobo affair either you do murder many things but I was surprised when I actually found some friendly monsters who'd normally be murder hobo fodder. Larian also wisely shot the alignment system of D&D in the head behind a shed which was a good move since 5E doesn't really use that system very much anyways. I find the AI however has a hard time handling stealth attacks, where I can sometimes get three free stealth attacks against monsters if I have my rogue hidden well, perhaps that's a bug or a reward for good positioning I can't say. 

How is the Story? (Don't worry, no spoilers)

Story is pretty fine and the characters you meet along the way are interesting. Some are a bit hostile towards you but due to the situation you find yourself in I think it's 100% natural that your party will be distrustful towards each other and your character. However I found that even the more nasty characters do warm up to you quickly, or at the very least treat you as a decent person. I read some reviews after playing where reviewers complained that the party ALWAYS hated you. But I only ever felt that one NPC hated me, and now after a few hours into the game they talk to me as an ally and have even confided into me about some of their own secrets making me feel like it's something that could easily become a true friendship. One praise I'll give it that others will call negative is that some persuasion options might not be good ideas. Please use your common sense, you might not want to tell sensitive things about your situation to certain people or even if you pass your check it might have a negative outcome, in this case passing the check makes a really bad situation a bit less bad. You also get special dialogue options due to some special magical powers you get rather early on in the game though I'll avoid calling them by name because that could be a spoiler which give you OP persuasion options that you cannot fail, however I like that the game implies that by using these powers you can get some negative backlash, these options even let you learn extra details about certain characters that share your condition though I have opted not to use them since I assume it will worsen my relationship with the character. The only downside of conversations is that in single player you can't change who is talking to perform skill checks. I had a Dex check in a conversation to pick a lock but couldn't let the rogue do his job to pick the lock. There was also lacking a dialogue option of me just using the key I had on me to unlock the shackles the guy was trapped in. The animations in conversation are also fairly stiff looking and your character only has a few stances they take, they're kinda annoying and I hope they add more variety to them. 

So how good is the game in Early Access? 

I'd say pretty good, you get a large area to explore and the characters are varied and the story interesting if a bit high fantasy, though I feel Baldur's Gate was also High Fantasy, I will say I'm not a fan of certain named characters existing in the world like Volo who I found, but I was happy to learn you can also mindlessly murder such refferences and rob their dead caracasses with only minimal consequences (I bribed a guard like 200 gold after I killed Volo and stole all of his swag, it was super worth I'd recommend murdering Volo in every game he's in.)  Beyond that I'd say the game is on the right track to be a cool RPG, though the game requires patience if you want to avoid murder hoboing, the game gives most characters even goblins actual names which makes talking to them and learning their secrets worthwhile, I'd recommend talking to as many people as your patience can handle to solve problems non-violently since some fights are nearly unwinnable. Also don't forget to scout around with your rogue to find shenanigans to cheese encounters and make sure you're not about to walk into a hornets nest.

252490,Rust,"So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.

Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.

Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.

I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.

Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.

Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.

In a tiny hut on a mountain with my sleeping bag and meager belongings after 12 hours of playing straight, I can probably safely say I'm enjoying this game.","Very Positive87% of the 845,275 user reviews for this game are positive.",started rust 4pm yesterday 3 minute bear ate watched player club death large stone completely naked penis penii dangling wind managed slay small pig fashioned clothes cover genitals exploring ate uncooked meat threw small fire cook rest meat fashioned bow arrow wood collected shirt pair boot fashioning small shelter random crap laying sleep outdoors chosen many_emphasized ramshackle structure dotting landscape not_belong contain player not_be armed clothed wanted peacefully live alone stuck wilderness slipped cliff broke leg shouted listen asking fix broken leg understand needed help naked man typed help response plea bashed head rock presumably looted corpse starved death forgot eat desperation butchered wolf attacked running didnt cook ate raw meat nope starving death vomited starved death 7 25 adventure decided sleep small shack mountain dare risk fire someone night kill tin baked bean zombie found wandering town gave radiation poisoning oh yeah probably die slowly radiation thats problem tiny hut mountain sleeping bag meager belonging 12 hour straight probably safely enjoying

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"[i]I've never added a review to a game before but hopefully this will be helpful to someone, also this is gonna be long so feel free to TLDR :D[/i]
[h1][u]FF14 Con:[/u][/h1]
[i]Gonna do cons first as that's more important for a should I buy imo[/i]
[b]SLOW AS ****[/b][i]like watching paint dry slow, seriously seriously slow[/i]: 
This con needs it's own subsection as it's slow in so many aspects.
[olist]
[*] Slow/ bland early quest progression - After starting the game as a new player you will spend approx 30-40m doing run to character A for tedious dialogue, now run to character B for some more tedious dialogue and if you are really really lucky you will get to run to character C for..... you guessed it more tedious dialogue. Eventually Character C will send you off for the inevitable kill X amount of adorable critters quest because. hey who likes critters am I right, it's not like Eorzea has P.E.T.A or anything. I know that you are a new low level day 1 adventurer and can hardly be expected to go kill a legendary dragon first day on the job but ""please can you take this note to my mate who is upstairs in the pub"" is a bit rediculous. [i] This changes abit more at late game but not much [/i]
[*] Slow combat - One of the biggest complaints you will hear from anyone about FF14 is the combat. Early level it is excruciatingly tedious. Auto attack speed and damage is roughly to normal, however alot of you moves share a GC and it's set to around 2.5 seconds this is a very long time especially at early level when you only really have a hand full of moves all of which will likely share the same GC. It is worth noting that this becomes less of a bore as you level and get more moves but for a new level 1 player this can be a deal breaker.
[*] Slow Leveling - Leveling in the game can feel like a grindy chore and it's something that alot of people complain about, the game has quests like you would expect from a traditional mmo but honestly most of your Exp will come from a mix of Fates(Public quests) Leves (like quests but not quests, it's a weird pre realm reborn system that hung around) and instances. This isn't exactly a bad thing as personally I would rather run dungeons than kill 10 boars and run back to someone but Exp gain is quiet slow(buy food in the first town and eat it, food increases EXP gain by like 3%, no one tell you this and alot of people miss out on extra EXP  early game) early game theres only like 3 different dungeons so running them repeatedly gets old fast. 

This is more of a gripe than a con but meh, Recently some jack*** dev(clearly someone in the cinematics team) decided that they worked so hard on the main scenario cutscenes. so players should not be able to skip them. This dev is an ***hole and everyone hates him/her.
Also houses cost your soul, ingame and IRL, not even kidding like ridiculously expensive, but alot of people band together and by a guild hall so meh.
[/olist]
Con over now to the pro's, seriously the only real issue is the slowness.

[h1][u]FF14 Pro's:[/u][/h1]
[b]Current Content[/b]
FF14 has some incredible content most of it is end game, like alot of it. I remember playing pre expansions(so just realm reborn) hitting 50 and saying to my friend ""So what's left?"" We looked about and immediatly found out that the game pretty much starts at end game, here is a list and brief info about some of the content:
[olist]
[*] Primals - Although you fight some of the primals (GFs/Summons) through the main storyline, some of them can only be attempted at end game, also you can attempt them on harder difficulties which honestly completely changes the fight and gives loot, primal skinnned gear :).
[*] Classes/Crafting - So orignal day 1 combat classes are split into 2 groups Disciple of War, Disciple of Magic. theses classes evolve once you hit 30. If you feel like you aren't enjoying your current class you can go to the trainer for one of the other classes and they will give you a quest to change class. You won't loose your level in the current class so 1 character can have a max level for all classes if you want to put the time in. Crafting is apparently really fun and an entire game to itself. I've not done it as it's never been my thing in MMO's but apparently it's very good and there are character classes specifically for crafting.
[*] One Character, ALL OF THE THINGS - the game has a multi class system which lets you swap class based on the weapon you use, these cannot be changed mid combat or whilst in a dungeon/instance/raid, however outside of that as long as you've done the class quest to unlock it you're free to switch anytime you like.
[*] Raids - The raids a fun and one of the biggest things going for FF14 is that the instances and raids feel epic, they have interesting mechanics the environments have a feel of grandeur, Good King Moogle Mog is the most epic box fight music you could get, and the general feel while instancing is awesome. 
[*] Chocobo raising - you can dye your chocobo and train it for chocobo racing,
[*] Mini games - This MMO loves it's mini games like seriously loves them, they added a version of the golden saucer from ff7 to the game and they also added a version of the tera master card game. It's pretty fun.
[*] Querky Quests - I complained before about the early level questing being dull but the end game quest are awesome espesially when you start to realise they aren't really there for leveling more for a fun side story. There are alot of really querky and fun quest lines out there so find them and enjoy the oddness.
[*] Outfits and costumes - You can either glamour a single item of gear at a time using a consumable item each time you want to glamour the gear, or you can use the consumable and add the gear piece to your waredrobe, this destorys the gear but makes it accessable to use whenever and doesn't cost to apply.

The game does have PVP, I've never done it tho.
[/olist]
[b]Story[/b]
The Story in FF14 is split 3 ways:
[olist]
[*] Main Story - It's a true final fantasy game, the story line is very enjoyable if story is important to you then you'll love it.That's all I'll say as I don't want to spoil anything. Also dont worry about skipping cutscenes for general story stuff if you wish to save time, you can retire to your character room at the inn and watch them all at once if you like, ok now that's all I'll say on the main story line.
[*] Class Story - Each Class has it's own Story quests cutscenes etc, they are fun introduce some cool characters over all a nice addition to leveling.
[*] Querky Quest - Some of the quest lines are like their own little miniture adventure for example the detetive quest line which probably has the most notoriety. Again I don't want to spoil anything so I'll say no more, but they will probably give you giggle or two.
[/olist]
[b]New Content[/b]
Dev support for this game has been great, probably because it's making square enix so much money that they are actually funneling it back into development.... I know right a company that realises if you want your MMO to do well you've got to add more content, It's quiet refreshing. We get quiet alot of ingame events and things also new story progression which basically covers a build up to the next expansion. 
[b]Community[/b]
The community is amazing, Don't get me wrong like all games some people are toxic but overall the community in FF14 is great. There's a novice global chat that new players are auto added to which high level can opt into being a mentor etc, if you have any question people tend to reply real quick and are genuinely pretty decent in helping others.

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
I would recommend buying FF14 if you enjoy MMO's for the challenging PVE end game content and community aspects, then FF14 is the mmo for you, if you prefer quick in out dungeon runs for loot and lots PVP arenas, I recommend playing WoW.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"This is the best game I would not recommend to any new players. The game has the bones to be a great idle experience but unfortunately it is helmed by a sole developer who's ego is contributing to its eventual failure. I am writing this out of frustration as I am a victim of LAVAflame's limitation as a developer. I've lost my account with no chance at a back up with no support from Lava despite emails and messages in his discord seeking it. You can look at my profile page to see how invested I was in this game until that point. Worse yet this happened to a decent amount of the player base and Lava's response was to ignore and ban any players from the official discord trying to ask for support or help in addressing this. I have devoted a large amount of time and money to playing this game only to have the door slammed in my face when asking for help in trying to recover my account. I am reiterating this as this is a game you will need to sink countless hours into it only to have it suddenly taken away from you with no word or care from the developer of the game. To add salt to the wound it seems Lava is more interested in posting his PR for bench and flexing on the people who play his game than to care about the players who are supporting his vision and buying his product.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a Vampire Survivors spin-off from Ghost Ship Publishing and is a smokescreen in terms of data collection. Extensive data is collected for the title without users being able to object.

[h1]What Does This Product Do?[/h1]
Upon starting the game, various trackers and geodata services by Unity Technologies are activated, collecting comprehensive data from players. The issue here is that customers are only informed about this behavior within the product itself, by then it's too late. Data is gone. There is also an opt-out option in the settings (thanks to my previous review of Deep Rock Galactic, the developers learned), but this feature is meaningless for the aforementioned reason and users are still tracked with disabled ingame placebo options!

[h1]Who Operates the Product?[/h1]
Ghost Ship Publishing

Ghost Ship Publishing is a subsidiary of Ghost Ship Games and was founded in 2023. The company is part of the Embracer Group.

[h1]Where Are the Service Providers Located?[/h1]
Ghost Ship Games - Wildersgade 41A, st., 1408 Copenhagen K, Denmark
Google, LLC - 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California, 94043, USA
Unity Technologies - San Francisco, 30 3rd Street, CA 94103, United States

[h1]What Data Is Collected?[/h1]
Too much. A legitimate interest is hardly present here, especially with the data theft occurring as it does.

[b][u]Unity Analytics[/u][/b]

""coreBusinessMetrics"" : {

""timeToWaitForUserInfoS"" : 60
}
},
""performance"" : {

}
}[/code]
The settings indicate that analytics for automation and core business metrics as well as performance measurements are enabled. User tracking is not restricted, and the player has not opted out of tracking (the player doesn't even get to know about it!). It waits up to 60 seconds for user information.

Users should note that these settings are almost universally active in every product with the Unity engine, without users knowing about it, let alone consenting to this data collection. In short, user consent to data collection is akin to data theft, self-legitimized by Unity Technologies.

The core metrics can be deactivated by developers based on the Unity license, but very few do so.

[h1]Privacy Policy/Terms of Use and Opt-Out/In?[/h1]
Nothing is visible on the product page on Steam. Information about product behavior is completely missing.

In summary, ""Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor"" has implemented an extensive tracking and analytics framework that collects detailed user data, including specific events and configurations. While some measures for compliance with data protection regulations are evident, such as consideration for GDPR and CCPA, the collected data and their unique identifiers could potentially lead to individual user identification.

This raises questions about transparency and user consent, as well as the possibility of identification based on collected data, especially since these data are collected prior to in-game consent. An opt-out option in the settings is therefore meaningless.

[h1]Can This Behavior Be Blocked?[/h1]
Unity services can (and should) be completely blocked without affecting the gaming experience. The UnityCrashHandler64.exe or *.32.exe in the installation directory should also be deleted.

[i][url=https://www.twitch.tv/nightserg] Follow me on twitch![/url][/i]

[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]
If you like any real-time city builder, do yourself a favor, forget this was published by Ubisoft, and buy Anno 1800. It's probably one of the best out there and it has so much content that you'll probably get bored before seeing it all. 

👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]
+Amazing attention to detail
+Relaxing and complex building mechanics
+Cool soundtrack

👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]
-Will get overwhelmed with how much content it has
-Campaign is mostly a big tutorial

[h1]Story[/h1]
There isn't much to talk about here, the campaign is pretty much a big introduction to game mechanics and after it ends you continue on the same map(s) which was a pretty good idea. 

As for the story of the campaign, you get invited by your sister to come home, due to some problems with your father, you arrive, things happen, and now you have an island to take care of and deal with your uncle being an asshole. 

Not much else can be said about it, you obviously won't play Anno for the writing or the characters, but they did try to make a decent story so I'll have to rate it accordingly. 

Story rating: 6/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Anno 1800 is a city builder that focuses a lot on the economy, and your citizens among other things. If you're not a fan of the combat in RTS games, then you can play this game safely as you can avoid combat 90% of the time by either game settings or allying with the AI or pirates in the game. If you do wish to have combat, it's all at sea and it only starts halfway in the game when you can afford to build them. 

Anno 1800 when it comes to gameplay it can be very relaxing and time-consuming while also overwhelming you as your city, economy, and people grow. It's not just a simple, build your buildings and that is it. Each house grows in its inhabitants and they all have needs that you must fulfill in order for that specific house to keep growing. Once it has reached a certain point they can get upgraded to the next level of citizenship. That, in turn, means, you lose the previous type of workers and you have to keep building more and more, and as your city grows, so do the needs. It's a constant battle to maintain demands while also having a positive income, mostly because every manufacturing building has costs that drop your income significantly. These costs are money and worker-wise. You can't just spam sheep farmers if you do not have enough farm-level citizens or enough income. 

It only gets better from there or worse depending on your view, as your city evolves the game then opens up with shipbuilding and capturing other islands. You'll have to then build a lot of ships to gather resources that are not available on your main island and move them from your secondary islands. Ships also cost income, and you'll also have to take care of the people on the other island as well. And just when you finally managed to have a positive and on-rails economy, the game opens up even more through expeditions where you have to build a ship, fill it up with resources and start a voyage to unknown lands. Once you reach these lands, such as the Arctic, you're going to have to build a settlement there as well which has its own unique mechanics and buildings. Congratulations, now you have to deal with even more cities. 

Anno 1800 does offer you the chance to play with friends either by controlling the same city or you can be two players as allies. You can probably spend 100 hours alone playing the game and reaching the point of nothing else to do, which may get boring for some due to the amount of content. 


Gameplay rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Audio design wise it's pretty great. Every building, every part of your city as it grows has its own unique sounds, the more your scroll down the more you hear your people roaming the city, going to work, dorks barking, etc. 

The soundtrack is pretty good as well, each region has its own unique set of songs that fit perfectly well with the atmosphere. As for the voice acting, it's okay, nothing really out of the ordinary, not good but not bad either. 

Audio rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
Tech-wise I'm in awe of how much detail Anno 1800 has. The game is a technical marvel, every building has its own unique look, actual people roam the city as it grows, they go to their jobs, etc. Texture detail, atmosphere, water details, everything is absolutely top-notch. 

That being said, all these amazing details come at a cost as the game is very demanding in hardware. A shame it never got updated with DLSS because Ubisoft won't allow them to due to its partnership with AMD. It has FSR, but it's the 1.0 version which is a blurry pos. 

As for bugs and other problems, the game is surprisingly free of them. 

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 9/10

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you want a fantastic city-builder that focuses a lot on its citizens and economy with tons of hours of content then there's no reason not to play Anno 1800. Visually the game is one, if not the best-looking RTS ever made.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I am almost 60 hours into the game at this point. It is a very *grueling* experience. I am not even half way through the main stor. Spoilers below.

I don't care about the lack of achievements. I don't care about it not being a sneaky AC Game. I can respect this game as an RPG with elements of the AC World during the Viking Raids of England. I don't even necessarily care that the game can't seem to decide if it's Isu technology or if magick is actually real (At this point I'm leaning somewhere near the latter).

Issue #1: The Main storyline is WAY too long and way too repetitive. I'm sorry but I really have no incentive to want to explore the world and help EVERY SINGLE little count or ealdorman in England just so I can beat the game. And that's not even including the missions in Asgard and Jotunheim through Valka. To put into perspective how many quests there are in the main storyline, I lost count at around 112-ish. These quests can range from ""Go to Randvi and tell her you finishes the last story arc"" to ""Find 8 unmarked locations at the map and kill people and find supplies"" I enjoyed Origins on my Xbox One. I loved Egypt, I loved following Bayek's tale of revenge. There was a clear goal that was driving you, the death of his son and getting justice for that. With Eivor I don't even know what I am doing at this point. Like: We have the support of like 6 kings or ealdormans and like I don't really know WHO THE BAD GUYS ARE! In theory, the order of ancients are the bad guys but the game never really makes it a priority to hunt them down (there's also like no real reason for me to want to hunt them down. They haven't DONE anything to Eivor and there's no real reward, as far as I can tell, for killing them all), they're really a secondary concern to the acquiring of alliances, but at this point there isn't a point to collecting alliances. There are no immediate threats to Eivor or their clan. At the beginning, it made sense for Eivor to ally with Grantebridge or Seek out the Ragnarsons, that was in line with the original goal of establishing a home for the clan. But at that point the clan is pretty safe all things considered so there isn't really any pressure at this point anymore. Also the game is REALLY INSISTENT on Eivor and Sigurd being angry and hateful to fulfill Valka's prophecy but there hasn't really been enough development, to me at this point, for them to want to be this close to coming to blows.

Issue #2: The World feels empty and at the same time cluttered with useless junk. There are many collectibles in the world of AC Valhalla, and at the point I'm at in the game they are all useless. I don't have a need to upgrade my gear because I have not faced enemies that have forced me to reconsider my strategy or way of fighting, I haven't reached a blocking point, in fact I'm TOO Strong at this point. None of the armors or wealths or mysteries interest me anymore. They don't reward me anything of value. I understand that part of this is to encourage players to explore, but what's the point? I see why people WANT the achievements, because this would make it worth it, but I would take anything for collecting all of the mysteries, artifacts and wealth points in a certain number of places. The armor isn't really that good compared to the upgraded berserkir armor. At the same time, the world doesn't make you feel like you're in it, it makes you feel like you're the center of it. Nothing happens without Eivor, the all powerful ubermensch who can literally be the difference between an army winning a battle and just losing. No one does anything without you. Sure there are some funny voicelines in cities and such, but the world doesn't feel alive. Even the mysteries, which are meant to be these sort of side quests are just so boring and insignificant, they are only worth doing when they give you a key to get some supplies you desperately need to build one more part of your settlement.

Issue #3: The Legendary weapons are very underwhelming. These are meant to be the ""Weapons of Gods and Heroes"". They feel like weapons in skyrim that you enchanted with shock damage... It would be cool I guess if the weapons looked a bit more impressive or if they had like actually good special abilities aside from ""Pew pew lightning, *stuns for like a second*""

The final thing I want to note is that, it feels like some of the writing and items are just there as fan service. Like, this game has a LOT of fan service. Kassandra didn't need to be in the game, you could've avoided that entirely, they did it because ""OMG LOOK IT'S THE CHARACTER FROM THE LAST GAME!!!!"" And you didn't need to make the Egypt armor from the Wrath of the Druids DLC literally just be partially based on Bayek's armor...

All of this said... I want to praise it a bit as well. Eivor's character is interesting and there are good moments where their qualities shine through, One of the best ways is at the beginning, Eivor places the hidden blade over their wrist and says ""Why would I want to hide such a weapon?"" This is really fascinating on many levels: It sets up that Eivor is not a fan of hiding their power, it says something about the culture Eivor comes from, it sets out that Eivor is not the sneaky type, they're a warrior and proud of it and they want everyone to know they're proud of this fact. Eivor also manages to do it without seeming, to me at least, overly arrogant and self righteous. I think this is because Eivor really goes out of their way, at least out I play them, to do the right thing and find BETTER solutions than the problems present.

One of the best storylines in this game is the Wrath of the Druids DLC. Eivor gets a message to meet the King of dublin, their cousin Bairid and his son Sicfrith. Bairid asks Eivor to help him gain the favor of the High King of Ireland, a godly man who hates Pagans and Vikings on account of them killing his father. In doing so, you are roped into building up Dublin as a center of trade and in trying to stop a cult of druids who are trying to kill the High King of Ireland and Bairid. Along the way you meet one of the Good Druids, the High Poetess and you start to see this tension between the christians and pagans in Ireland. Eventually you go hunt down all of the Evil Druid cult leaders and the last mission is killing the leader. Your reward for killing all of these leaders is the legendary Gae Bolg, the weapon of Cu Chulainn. Afterwards the kings of Ireland call a meeting with the High King and they all decide to do an inquisition to purge the island of all of the Druids. The High Poetess storms off and attempts to unleash hell upon the isle and kill the High King, You then either kill her or spare her life, in which case she flees. the High King is convinced of his faults and calls of the Inquisition. The story ends with you and Sicfrith mourning Bairid who died in the course of the war trying to earn the favor of his High King. 

THIS IS WHAT A STORY SHOULD BE LIKE. It's not Oscar winning by any means, but it doesn't force you to win the favor of every single gods damned lord in England, AND THEN some quests with the gods.

I think it would've been better for all of the alliances to be optional and instead maybe make them simplified or offer a reward for creating all of these alliances like special merchants or buildings for Raventhorpe or maybe a special set of armor or something. Kind of like the Templar Hunt missions in AC4.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1]Honest Review from an Old Codger[/h1]

[b]First impressions and on the fence: [/b]

I am an older gamer and a father of 4 boys. Elden Ring was the first game for me in the ""Souls-Series"" that I have really played. I did buy Dark Souls 3 and try to play that once it released on Steam, and it took me nearly 3 hours to kill Gundyr; only to find myself constantly invaded, and relentlessly killed when I was trying to play with my youngest son, Griffin afterwards. Needlessly to say, I quickly put that game down and moved on with my life. Years later, my sons showed me Elden Ring and I fell in love with the trailer. My wife encouraged me to try it and be open; maybe this would be a better experience. Time would tell. My gamers of all age and creed, I have put in 1000 hours in and I have no intentions of stopping. 

 I told myself that I would give an honest review from my point of view if I ever played the game for 1000 hours.

[b]Arising as a Tarnished: [/b]

I can safely say that this game is one of the best games that I have ever played in my life; I have played many. I have experienced such a range of emotions of this game, and no matter how many times I failed at a boss or a mechanic, I always knew that I could better myself if I applied myself; a nice lesson learned in life that transcends quite well into the gaming universes. Once I was able to get my noodle around the mechanics of this game, I fell in love and I could not put it down; I still cannot. You just have to be patient with yourself and believe in yourself. That is one of the many cornerstones of life that leads to success and in these Souls games, it is no different. You can quite literally play the game however you want. Any build you can think of, any style you desire, you can do it here.  Your limits are only set on your imagination and will power.  I have created many different kinds of builds for my complete playthroughs and I never get bored beating the games and repeating the content as a different character from the hit MOBA: League of Legends. 

[b]Support beyond the Fog[/b]:

As an older gamer, and father of 4 boys, my time is limited, and it is always an opportunity cost when learning how to play a new game. The community that surrounds Elden Ring are amazing as well, which was very strange at first. I did not expect a game, that is heavily singleplayer, to have an immense amount of care, and support from a community. From this community, the amount of resources of knowledge and guidance they give, often reminds me of my first time playing Star Wars Galaxies, EverQuest and the original World of Warcraft.  From wikis to video playthroughs, and everything in between, anything you could possibly want to know, and answers to the questions that you did not think you could have, the community has your back. Keep this in mind if you are ever stuck in this game, or on the fence about this game. The resources are there for you, the support from the community is there for you both in and out of game. Shout out to Fextralife, Fightincowboy, Giggathiccas, Onion Samurai, Titus Actual, YMAH (the goat), and Steelovsky for helping me in all aspects of the game. If you are ever struggling, please look any of those up on how to better yourselves in PvE or the PvP Aspects of the game. 

[b]A Seamless Land, that is as vast as the oceans[/b]

When I reached the 25 hours mark, I told my wife that this game reminded me a lot of Nintendo's 1998 hit classic ""Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"". That world space was so vast for its time, it was like nothing that the world of gaming has ever seen before.  Seamlessly wondering around, adventuring around, didn't matter if you got lost or hit a dead end, I was so engaged back then to explore and find what wonders and secrets held, low and behold, Elden Ring delivered that same experience that I had in my youth. That was so captivating for me and it really left an impression on me of what it means to explore in a game and actually enjoy yourself. It has been literally decades since any game has been able to deliver that experience again and trust me, I have bought nearly all those AAA open world games that have sucked in comparison on delivering a wholesome experience. 

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]

When I buy a game, I invest my hard earned money AND my limited time in it. I expect to have a good time with my family and friends that also play that game. I took a leap of faith with this game; especially after my first experience with a FROMSOFT game was quite miserable (LOL not anymore, I have nearly 100% Darksouls III and absolutely love the Dark Souls games, yes including DS II). Needless to say, this game has not only surpassed my expectations, but it has been quite sometime (I would say 5 years) that I have thoroughly enjoyed myself playing a game. Gamer-Rot is a hard experience to endure and live through as a passionate gamer, and Elden Ring got me out of it. Elden Ring has paved the road for me and my sons to spend more quality time together. Thank you Elden Ring.

899770,Last Epoch,"Like the lovechild of Diablo and Path of Exile that has the best features of both, Last Epoch is everything I'm looking for in an Arpg.  From the diverse classes, to the unique boss attacks and patterns, to the robust filter--Last Epoch gets all the small details right. However, I have to say it's the intuitive crafting systems for both skills and items that's the real winner. I never liked crafting in other games because it was always buried beneath a byzantine system of checks and balances. Here, they handle crafting as a more WYSIWYG affair. You know what you're getting and, with the items, you know the success probability of it being crafted without a hitch. No more mixing recipes or putting runes in a certain order--do you want to add damage, or speed, or cheaper mana cost. Then by the effing gods that's what you need to find and that's what you craft onto your item. Period.

Once multiplayer is added and the story to completion is added, I literally think this has the foundation to blow 95% of the other Arpg's out of the water--including Grim Dawn and PoE. The barrier for entry is low, but the path to mastery is still long and exciting. In my book that's the winning combination.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

But, what really bothers me and alot of people is the unrealistic and downright criminal prices you expect people to pay for your Shark Cards. $100 real money for $8Million in-game cash.

When every new DLC costs $25Million-$40Million if you want all the vehicles, upgrades, unlocks..etc..etc WTF good is $8Million?? Your price structure on everything from Shark Cards to Merch is bizarre and unbalanced - if you wonder why people mod and manipulate your game, its because nobody enjoys being blatantly ripped off.

Irony here, when the 'ripping off' got to much for you guys, you threatened the very same people that mod your game to enhance it and who, at the same time, put food on your table and keep you with a job.

STOP ripping off your customers and instead of fighting, why not listen to the community - expand the single player experience with some kind of worthwhile DLC, like people have been begging for. Why not make servers that welcome modders and people that enjoy enhancing the game and getting even more value for money.

1203620,Enshrouded,"71 Hours to complete the Early Access release version. 

I seldom write reviews but Enshrouded has compelled me to put my thoughts down. Is the game good? Yes and No. 

Gameplay is fun and the sense of exploration is fantastic. It has a great foundation to be something special BUT it has some fundamental design issues. 

1) Leveling is very poorly done. I progressed through 40ish or so hours with the exact same weapons. A million common drops or even worse Legendary drops with worse stats than an early Epic really takes you out of grinding. 

2) Enemy variety is lacking. You will encounter 5 or 6 enemy types the entire game. Every area begins to feel the same because you are constantly facing the same enemy types. 

3) Enemy Scaling is garbage. Killing a Level 1 enemy vs killing a Level 30 drops the same exact loot. Why would I farm a higher tier zone? Only point of higher tier zones is for materials tied only to these areas. It is not face stronger enemies with better drops.

4) Building types are pointless. Over the course of your play through you will pick up better build block types. Some even with the Epic tag. The problem with this, there is literally no point in using them. They do not give a comfort bonus for higher tier/nicer build blocks. There is also zero point is having more than 1 base. Place a main base, then only put alters and a work bench to repair weapons/tools if needed while farming. Another problem with bases, they're never attacked. This really draws away from the point of building bigger or more secure. You could live out of a 1x2 with a big court foundation square for your minions the entire game. 

5) Quests are mehhhh, not terrible but not wonderful either. It's basically 3 quest types. Fetch, Kill/Boss Fights, & Area clears. Quests types could really use some variety. 

All in all, I enjoyed my early access time with Enshrouded but I don't think I'll be back for a while. It will need a lot of updates and design changes for me to attempt another play through. My recommendation, give it a solid 2 years in the oven to mature.

Edit: Clarification is obviously needed why I'm down voting aka Not Recommending. The comments have clearly leaned into three areas (Time spent, Value, and You liked it?!?!). 

1) ""You put 70 hours and down vote, clown"" 
2) ""70 hours is a lot of value for an EA title""
3) ""You said gameplay is fun & it has an excellent foundation""

Let me be clear. I enjoyed Enshrouded, but each passing day, that spark dimmed. I want to elaborate why I've set my review to Not Recommended. 

Day 1, ""WOW this map is huge and look at all these icons!"" As time passed, hmmm ok, it's a repeat of the same things to do over and over. Fighting the same enemies, just to receive the same mediocre loot. 

Next high to low moment, building my base. ""Ok, the building controls are solid and work well. ""Damn there are a million build types"", ""Wait, I can't just upgrade the material type? I have to remove and add, why???"" ""Nothing attacks, whats the point in spending time doing all of this?"" At the end I realized that building for the screenshot is nice and all, but having a built in game mechanic, the comfort bonus that does not interface with building qualities that unlock along your journey is very lackluster. One, because building & harvesting resources is a time requirement w/ no payback and two, there is no threat to make you engage w/ protecting your investment. 

Again, same thing with leveling. At the start it's flowing and unlocking all these new crafting recipes, but yet again the flaws start to show. Why am I going to these higher tier zones, getting weapons & armor that is higher quality but worse stats. Then you start seeing weapons and armor on repeat, ohhh ok so the loot table isn't large enough yet. This is one area that could make the game immediately jump up in quality. It needs to feel exciting grinding for better gear. 

I say all this to come to my final point. Yes, I put 70 hours on a $30 game. Does that qualify as good cost to time value, absolutely. I've also reiterated the foundation of the game is fantastic and has the potential to be the best action RPG/survival game that's come out in the last few years. I think most of these flaws will be addressed as they move through Early Access, which come to my final key point. If I had to do it again, I'd wait until these things are addressed. I've completed EA and left Enshrouded feeling like the journey was shallow. That lasting impression is hard to escape, so for that......I suggest anyone on the fence to wait for these areas to be fixed. Jumping into this world fresh w/ the systems properly fleshed out would make for a much more exciting adventure.","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",71 hour complete early access release version seldom write review enshrouded compelled thought good yes no_gameplay fun sense exploration fantastic great foundation special fundamental design issue 1 leveling poorly progressed 40ish hour exact weapon million common drop worse legendary drop worse stats early epic take grinding 2 enemy variety lacking encounter 5 6 enemy type entire begin constantly facing enemy type 3 enemy scaling garbage killing 1 enemy v killing 30 drop exact loot farm higher tier zone higher tier zone material tied area not_face stronger enemy drop 4 building type pointless course pick build block type epic tag problem literally no_point not_give comfort bonus higher tier nicer build block zero 1 base base alters bench repair weapon tool needed farming problem base never_attacked draw building bigger secure live 1x2 big court foundation square minion entire 5 quest mehhhh not_terrible not_wonderful basically 3 type fetch kill bos fight clear quest type variety enjoyed early access enshrouded t_emphasizedhink update design change attempt recommendation solid 2 year oven mature clarification obviously needed voting aka not_recommending comment clearly leaned three area spent value liked 1 70 hour vote clown 2 70 hour value ea title 3 fun excellent foundation clear enjoyed enshrouded passing spark dimmed elaborate set not_recommended 1 wow map huge look icon passed hmmm ok repeat thing fighting enemy receive mediocre loot next high low moment building base ok building control solid damn million build type wait upgrade material type remove add attack whats spending realized building screenshot nice built mechanic comfort bonus not_interface building quality unlock along journey lackluster building harvesting resource requirement w no_payback no_threat engage w protecting investment leveling flowing unlocking crafting recipe flaw higher tier zone weapon armor higher quality worse stats seeing weapon armor repeat ohhh ok loot table large immediately quality need exciting grinding gear final yes 70 hour 30 qualify good cost value reiterated foundation fantastic potential best action role survival last year flaw addressed move early access final key wait thing addressed completed ea left enshrouded feeling journey shallow lasting impression hard escape suggest fence wait area fixed jumping world fresh w system properly fleshed exciting adventure

582660,Black Desert,"This game is the most beautiful empty shell, I ever came across.

Is this a bad game? Not at all, but it has a way of hiding what its endgame looks like and depending on your personal values, you might feel tricked once u get disillusioned. Most of this comes down to the player perception in the early game. Because this game doesn’t feed its content to you with a spoon, you have to explore a lot of the content yourself, leading to developing expectations based on those experiences.

Therefore, I think most of the frustration with this game comes from players developing expectations and false hopes the game can’t satisfy. And I am no exception from this.

As I got a first taste of the action packed combat, the astonishing graphics and the overall level of immersion, I couldn’t wait to see what the endgame content would look like, only to find out that there is no difference. If u have been busy grinding mobs for hours, congratulations, you experienced the endgame content. The gameplay in the early levelling experience isn’t really any different later on. The packs of mobs will have more hp and look different, but there isn’t much else different about them. They don’t get smarter, get any unique attacks or mechanic, to be honest the whole pve content isn’t really challenging at all. Even when fighting bosses I can’t help myself but to think that I have seen all of this done better in other games. 

At this point I have to confess that I´m a filthy pve´ler. I enjoy raids and similar group content so bdo not having any of those made me wonder what the whole point of grinding and gearing up actually is, if there is no fun content I am working towards.

Pvp some people said. As I already confessed I don’t think too fond of pvp. Specifically in this game it might sound a lot better on paper than it is in practise. What I heard, the always active open world pvp will mostly result in the one who oneshots and the one who gets oneshot. To me, this sounds like a lot of potential frustration for new players, rather than a fun experience.
Others said I should go fishing, processing or any of those afk activities, which I always found very hilarious. Why should I play a game with beautiful graphic just to not look at it? And overall I think the term “life skilling” is mildly infuriating. If I had a life, I wouldn’t be playing this.

Another thing that usually kept me grinding unhealthy amounts of time is to spend my efforts on cosmetic content. Especially because once those timed costumes expire, the character you spend 5h+ on to create, starts to look like a beggar again. Low and behold, there exists a quest ingame which seems to provide the “Karlstein” costume after completion. All you need to be able to accept the quest is to drop one of those rare stones with no designated drop location. Or so I thought, turns out that after the completion of the questline you still need said rare stones to craft the set. I got 3 (one is granted from the questline) in 80h of playtime and the whole set requires about 100 of them. Dependent on how lucky you are we are talking about around 2000h of nonstop grinding to get an outfit set that’s arguably on the lower end of all the costumes. Seriously, cleaning toilets will get you this set faster. But that would require me to leave the house, so that’s not an option.
Frustrated but not yet hopeless, I turned to the craftable costumes. Setting up my workers, gathering the needed materials and finally sending the order to a workshop. All this work just to be greeted with a fairly familiar armor in my inventory after equipping the costume. It turns out that the selfmade costumes take up all the armor slots instead of the actual costume slots, leaving you with paper thin defense while wearing it. After a quick research I am enlightened. Those crafted costumes can be made into real costumes with a tailor coupon. Which can be found in the pearl shop. For real money. And nowhere else. Not even in the loyalties shop. So except for taking screenshots they don’t serve any purpose. In result, my feelings hurt.

Ok, I´m thinking to myself, why not take the most obvious approach. Just buy it from the market place. Here is the thing. Upon opening the costume section in the marketplace you are greeted with tons of demand and apparently no supply. So when there are no trades happening in this section, does a market really exist? My guess was that the prices for said costumes in the pearl shop are definitely on the higher end of what I have seen in similar games so far. And because pearl abys is a very progressive company that values their player base and never lies to them, they of course have no cosmetic only surprise mechanics in their game. This and the fact that dismantling your costumes gives you valuable items which can be used in their perfectly balanced gear upgrade system; there is literally no reason for someone to sell their costumes. Apparently this was a little different in the earlier days of bdo with the old marketplace system, but I can’t travel in time. If I could, I would rather use that to kick someone in his one nut.

Devastated but still not completely sane again, I remembered the questline about the “Karlstein” set. And I also remembered that upon completing it I was granted with one of those stupid stones. So maybe … just maybe one could create an alternative characters to grab one of the stones I already dropped, run to calpheon, do the quest, store the additional stone from the quest, delete the character and repeat the process. All of this pain just to slowly cheese my way to reach those 100 stones without spending 2000h+ on grinding while praying to rngesus (yes I am that desperate). Well, turns out that your character doesn’t just need to have one of those stones in order to accept the questline but also a certain level, or maybe worse, needs to drop the stone themselves. At this point I am convinced, that if pearl abys spend as much time and effort into health care as they spend into making sure no one gets access to costumes with ingame methods, they could have cured cancer by now.

After all those efforts I have to admit defeat. I couldn’t find a long term motivation for myself to keep playing this game. And I tried really hard. But after around 100h of playtime, I am disillusioned. This is not a game for me. It is not like I didn’t had a lot of fun along the way. But to realise that there is nothing left for me at the end was really disappointing. A beautiful shell but an empty core.

But that is just my experience with the game and it’s still developing and changing every day so maybe … just maybe I´ll return to it one day.
If you think about playing this game I would suggest you to give it a try. Just ensure that you don’t get your hopes and expectations up too high. This game will push the need of spending money and the time consuming grind to an all-time extreme. Probably the most extreme in the whole genre. So be okay with that or brace yourself for some crippling disappointment.

(Review character limit !@#$)

This game is a top down looter/hack and slash ARPG, this review is aimed at those familiar with such games and there will be comparison with Path of Exile and Diablo, as both are THE genre, currently.

So I wont bother explaining basic stuff but rather introduce the plate briefly,
then dive into the ""meat and potatoes"" of the game.

My point of view is someone who has over 1k hours in PoE, 300 in the Diablo franchise, and about 50 into this one 
(Steam hours are misleading, as I have played the game on other accounts as well) Rookie numbers, some might say, and rightly so.

In that case, feel free to add words or provide counter argument to mine. I will also try to keep this review updated as the game continues to develop and grow.

[b]THE PLATE[/b]

First of all I would like to start by saying that the game is absolutely [b]worth[/b] its current price tag (30 euros) in its [b]current[/b] state: Early Access, version 8.1

The game has easily 50-100 hours of pure gameplay content, before any future ""seasons/leagues"" that have already been foreshadowed by the devs, and which will be set in time periods [b]between[/b] the already existing ""leagues"" of its main competitor, PoE.

I feel this is an important topic that needs to be adressed, as these types of games are usually played in ""bursts"" of content updates, alongside other players, in an ""asymmetrical"" competition/cooperation marathon.

There is also currently NO multiplayer but its been scheduled to be included within 2021. The only current form of social features are global/personal chat and friend list. There are also plans to include PvP, but frankly, these games are never balanced or designed around that, so its just an extra side feature.

[b]HARD COMPARISON WITH ESTABLISHED PATH OF EXILE SYSTEMS[/b]

This is the only part of my review where PoE will be mentioned directly.

This is by no means a ""PoE hate rant"", I just want to highlight that there is a very clear difference in systems and design philosophy, permeating through the entirety of the game. Obviously, at the time of writing, and most likely a while longer, this early access title is hardly near the content of one of the most notoriously complex games on the market that is approaching nearly a decade of constant updates.

First of all, you do not need to download a lootfilter or watch several video guides totaling hours to understand and enjoy the majority of the game as a new player. 

This game has learned from both the successes and missteps of the genre, as I feel all games must. It strikes a nice balance between the overwhelming complexity of PoE and the baffling simplicity (that is close to insulting intelligence) of Diablo 3.

Damage numbers! Seeing the constant rise of numbers you deal while progressing through the game is a nostalgic feeling I constantly miss during my PoE playtime.

In the case of lootfilters the game has an excellent and easy way to setup multiple personalized ones, IN GAME. If you really want, you can still download and import a ready one. 
In the case of understanding deep game mechanics, the game has an in game encyclopedia providing even detailed mathematical equations/formulas.

There is also a clear abhorrent of menus-within-menus and constant tedious micro management like constant use of vendor recipes or drag-dropping and switching mechanics like watchstones, scarabs, sextants. 

And designed to avoid clicking and wasting the players time as much as possible like constant re-rolls.

It also features a [b]deterministic crafting system[/b], frankly, the steam review limit is not enough for me to write about that alone.

So unlike Path of Exile, the overwhelming majority of gaming time is meant to be spend [b]ingame[/b], killing/looting stuff rather than constantly alt-tabbing to several browser pages, using external third party apps, crawling throughout tens of stash tabs and calculating percentages to create ""efficiency"".

Also, there are no real-money micro-transactions that provide quality of life stuff, like extra stash tabs or premium stuff that enable or simplify basic gaming concepts like guilds, trading and visual clarity.

And regarding quality of life

Oh 
my 
god

The game is packed with those

If you come from Path of Exile, your wrist will constantly thank you as you play this game.
No flask piano or constantly holding/casting certain abilities (the devs are clearly against that, in terms of design and communication with players)

No unidentified items, no portal scrolls. (portal is a hotkey and items are meant to be constantly upgraded, even during leveling)

Vacuuming ""currency/craft materials"" and autostashing such loot with the click of a button, even outside a stash menu.
As well as a sorting button, both in inventory and stashes.

Its hilarious that this counts as a feature in 2021... but there is even a training dummy and death recap screen!

[b]VISUALS & SOUND[/b]

The game frequently changes tone and setting due to its ""time traveling"" theme. This creates a nice  frequent change of pace.

One moment you are an ancient colorful valley filled with dinosaurs, the other you are in a medieval abandoned town or a post apocalyptic distant future cave complex as humanity has retreated from the surface, seeking refuge down below.

Usually those locations are in the exact same locations set in different time eras and often you can't help but stop and admire visuals and background ""noise"". 

Game speed and visual clarity is at a comfortable place where you can understand whats going on the screen at all times and thats the most important thing in such fast paced games.

The animations especially for the most recent class (Rogue) are very snappy and precise, enemies have good telegraphs and very dangerous moves have very clear areas of effect.

The voice acting and sound design is, in my opinion, the weakest part of the game.

Its not always the case in the entirety of the game but I feel often the voice acting aproaches ""porn quality"".

The music can also be improved vastly, boss themes are reused too much and tracks have small durations, resulting in a repeating, boring ambience.

[b]STRUCTURE & LAST THOUGHTS[/b]

5 classes to choose from, 3 sub-classes to each one.

The level cap is 100, at around 25-30 you choose the subclass, the current ""endgame"" starts at lvl 50-60.

I strongly suggest that you just dive in, you don't need any outside information or build guide for even your first character.

Respeccing is easy and rather cheap, and [b]the only permanent option currently is the master class.[/b]

The game is a joy to play in both Softcore and Hardcore (permadeath) mode.

It does a wonderful job with pacing and introducing mechanics.

It does not insult your intelligence by making you use 1 or 2 abilities for hours, within minutes you will have plenty of choices and most importantly, you will be able to easily switch out and try new stuff on the fly without any significant costs or requirements.

There are obviously passive and skill trees but the game rewards correct movement/positioning and cooldown/resource management more than min maxing and game knowledge.

Managing such aspects and creating synergies such as ""your dash now create shadow clones that mimic your abilities"" is the bread & butter of the game.

If there is one drawback, the leveling is ""too easy"" coming from other games.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Hello Friends, 

Today i wish to review the game Assasins Creed Valhalla. This is technically my first playthrough with a newer Assasin Creed game. I have personally played earlier ones, but not in this new format that is open world version. It was very fun to play for me personally. Although this game sufferes from some issues, some big and low, but if you can survive thru them, you may enjoy the game. Following is a list of all bugs i have encountered in my playthough of this game:

#1. Constant crashing all the time in this game. This causes alot of problems. There is a workaround i used to temporarily fix it was to delete shader cache everytime i started new playing of game, file cache deleted everytime i started the game, set fps to 60 FPS in the game, and that did the trick. It is not a permanent fix as there is none. SO BE WARNED, the game will crash most likely.

#2. Many bugs, including armour bugs that switch in cutscenes, clipping issues with many armours, issues with the ending swithing character types in the scenes, and many smaller bugs.

Due to the above bugs, this will put off many purchasers of this game. Many people also do not like the steam version as it is required to download ubisoft connect to even play the games thru steam. This also is why there are no achievements on steam. Personally, getting acheivements do not bother me. 

So as for the game itself, It follows the adventures of the viking Eivor and how he conqueres England. There are many twists and turns in the story, and some choices can change how the ending is. Depending also how you act too in the game can change the ending. The game has so many quests and side quests, if you want to finish it, it will take you quite awhile, especially if a player takes their time to finish all of them. This is what i did and why my playtime is so high. Anyways, here is the PRO/CON list:

PROS:

- A viking saga set in the dark ages of history.
- Many side quests and lots of main quest storyline to finish.
- Beautliful world locations and great music.
- Nice voice acting for many of the characters.


CONS:

- Major crashing bugs that effect the game. At this time, no permanent fixes will completly fixes this issue.
- Many small minor bugs including swapped characters in scenes, clipping issues, and issues with maps and environment.
- The ubisoft connect store that has many microtransactions to force people to buy their special money version to buy items in the game. The opal store in the game helps a bit with buying stuff for free in the game, but you still need to hunt down opals to buy most of the stuff.


So do i recomment this game? Personally, i would rate it as neutral, as it has it's good points and bad points. The crashing is a very bad turnoff of the game. BE AWARE IF YOU DO WANT TO BUY THIS, YOU WILL CRASH WHETHER USING A NVIDIA OR AMD GRAPHICS CARD. Personally, when the game worked, i enjoyed it. I do recommend it, but only if you can ignore the constant crashing, the minor switching bugs in some scenes, and clipping issues. Otherwise, avoid this game with a 100 foot pole.","Mostly Positive71% of the 17,395 user reviews for this game are positive.",hello friend today wish assasins creed valhalla technically playthrough newer assasin creed personally earlier one not_in format open world version fun personally sufferes issue big low survive thru enjoy following bug encountered playthough 1 constant crashing cause alot problem workaround temporarily fix delete shader cache everytime started file cache deleted everytime started set shooter 60 shooter trick not_a permanent fix warned crash 2 bug including armour bug switch cutscenes clipping issue armour issue ending swithing type scene smaller bug due bug purchaser not_like version required download ubisoft connect game thru no_achievements personally acheivements not_bother follows adventure viking eivor conqueres england twist turn choice ending depending act ending quest side quest finish it_emphasized awhile especially take finish playtime high anyways pro con pro viking saga set dark age history side quest lot storyline finish beautliful world location great music nice voice acting character con major crashing bug effect no_permanent fix completly fix issue small minor bug including swapped character scene clipping issue issue map environment ubisoft connect store microtransactions force special version item opal store help bit buying stuff hunt opal stuff recomment personally rate neutral good point bad point crashing bad turnoff aware crash nvidia amd graphic card personally worked enjoyed recommend ignore constant crashing minor switching bug scene clipping issue otherwise avoid 100 foot pole
1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"This is the best videogame I have played in decades. I feel like I curled up with a great book for 281 hours while binge-watching an epic series, all while playing a game that felt challenging but also super rewarding. The storytelling is amazing! There is actual character development, and things don't always go the way you expect they will when you start off.

Things you experience in the first act come back around way later (in my case over 100 hours later) and your choices MATTER. Playing this at the same time as a lot of my friends (and activity feed) was especially fun because everyone had a totally different experience, which means that there is solid replay value here. {I am already planning my next-- and the next after that -- playthrough!)

It's not 100% perfect, the UI and particularly inventory and party management systems could be less cumbersome (and if Larian doesn't take care of that, I am sure the modding community will) but it is damn close! With years in early access, the first act has clearly been tested much more than what follows, and there are some buggy experiences. But, wow, what experiences they are! This game is so dense in Act 3 that it almost is a little overwhelming. 

Baldur's Gate 3 IS the most polished game I've played in ages, and for once I don't feel like I bought half a game and will be buying the rest of the game later, one dlc at a time.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 505,051 user reviews for this game are positive.",best videogame decade curled great book 281 hour binge watching epic series challenging super rewarding storytelling amazing actual development thing expect thing act case 100 hour choice matter friend activity feed especially fun totally different mean solid replay value already planning next next playthrough not_100 perfect ui particularly inventory party management system cumbersome larian t_emphasizedake care modding community damn close year early access act clearly tested follows buggy experience wow experience dense act 3 overwhelming baldur gate 3 polished age bought half buying rest dlc

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Here is my take from a 39 year old who grew up loving the jets on N64 with Curtis Martin and the Z button being the Juke move that broke players ankles like crazy and then played most Maddens until 2016 then stopped mainly because  they put in designing your own plays and having your own playbooks then stopped that.

Some things you must know.  
1.) i rarely play it online
2.) Ultimate team is not something i get into because it just feels like those PTW ""free"" games on a mobile ap that means whoever has the biggest wallet wins.  
3.) i enjoy playing franchise mode
4.) i play on simulation
5.) I dont use the sticks for much of the hitting or ball placements except in rare occasions as its just to much to relearn all the time 

Its a solid football game.    Its far from perfect and there can be a lot of things that could be improved, but its got the players in the NFL, its got stats, whether you agree with them or not is subjective, tit plays well.  I run the game on my laptop and i use my Refurbished deck, which the only reason i even got it was the sale price and the additional 20% refurbished version was a steal for this madden game.  I do have to run it in streaming mode but once i run it in streaming mode the deck controls work perfectly and its fantastic.  Now if they made it work fully just on the Deck Alone... i feel like they might hit another market out there.   

I say all this so you understand, i run the game on my LAPTOP gaming computer with 16 gigs of ram a 3050 and a I5 CPU, that streams the game to my Deck and i just turn the deck to 10 fps and watts to use it as a controller only and get 6-8 hours of battery off of it and watch the game on my laptop or use an HDMI cord to plus the laptop into the TV and play it that way.   

I don't experience input lag, in fact this is the first madden in such a long time i can remember enjoying the running game A LOT in.  Blockers picking up blocks is a huge thing.  Having a shitty blocker in front of you with bad awareness or run block stats is really noticeable.   (Makes me really wish they would put more love in to the full backs so that they would be as effective as they are in game but small gripe)   The running in the game is just crisp.  the days of tacklers just brushing against you to tackle you while engaged must have stopped a while ago.  The holes open and close in zone running schemes in ways that feel like you can pick the hole and run through.  

The passing can seem pretty interesting as i have seen line backers vary their depth against the same play, albeit very rarely but  i have seen it, and the speed of receivers and route running ability is still pretty damn paramount.  I quite enjoy taking the game, and just playing it.  Its not a game i want to buy at 70$ USD, honestly id buy it at launch if they made the single player game 30 or 40$ USD at launch and sold the multiplayer separately.  Madden to me is best played in the house with people around so that if you want to talk shit or be bitter you have to do it face to face.  Want to try to run out the clock?  take the verbal barbs of being called all kinds of names for ""not playing the game"".  

This game is not transcendent or some kind of perfect football game by any means but for fans of teams... especially those teams that are not playing great in a  season it certainly quenches the thirst for sure.  I wont bu the game at full price  maybe ever again, but all these reviews that say its terrible?  Just don't buy it for a few years and keep playing the same one, eventually the game will feel good again.  Its not an every year purchase unless you want to chase that ultimate team money sink...

Cursing after getting killed, screaming after winning, a lot of joy, excitement, frustration... This is PUBG. Sorry - it was PUBG. After patch 7.2 this game is not for me anymore.

236390,War Thunder,"I have played this game since I was first introduced to it by jingles. (Jan, 5 2013) When i first started playing i was in love. It was the only thing I ever did all day. The thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time. The game was great. Then the updates started to come... At first it was just harder to make money and xp. People hated it but I kind of liked it. Then the BR system came and balance left. Matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad. Then the russian bias got real. Im not one of those people that complain that I died to X russian plane/tank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying. (planes putting out fires, t-34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the side, ext) But even this wasnt what made me quit this game. It's the company. They are absolutly terrible. Constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs. They threaten to ruin RB if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters? And even steam isn't safe. They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative. I can forgive russian bias. I can forgive the terrible BR system. I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community. To Anton Yudintsev, you made a game that was amazing. I loved it so much and always will.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"For months and through numerous requests by the developer after every update, I have considered how I was ultimately going to post my review for this game. For the first 9 months of playing this game, it was one of the best games I have played, and certainly the best idle game. The progression system is outstanding, the different areas in this game to progress in are many, and it feels like you are still making progress towards something or other no matter what you are doing. I was ultimately planning on this being a positive review. 

Unfortunately after the most recent update, I can no longer recommend this game, and it's not just for the content in the update, but primarily because of how the developer has handled the situation since the update has been released.  While the update itself was a travesty (adding a very obvious pay to win system introducing some incredibly powerful pet follower bonuses, the average person will need to spend hundreds of dollars (or wait on average several years) for a good chance at getting incredibly [i]game altering[/i] bonuses), I was confident that the developer would quickly identify the criticisms laid out by the community and address them with a plan on how to fix the new system. Instead, he's banned numerous people making complaints, deleted criticism from posts made on the subreddit which he moderates, and hasn't issued a single statement since the update was released, which at this point has been more than 10 days ago. That silence speaks louder than words.

The developer and his mod team ban people and delete criticisms constantly. I say this as an outsider who has never been punished in any way. I can no longer stay silent on their behalf. The dev, unfortunately, has what appears to be a long history of making bad decisions when it comes to punishing people in his game, on discord, and on the subreddit. It's shameful, and ultimately the people they end up banning or punishing (just look at how he handled those who used the sailing exploit) are usually the game's biggest supporters and i'm sure many people who have spent money on the game.

The developer constantly touts ""solo dev"" as if that were a positive. From what I have seen, that also means he's never held accountable to anyone but himself. When he comes up with a terrible pay to win system, there's nobody in his corner to tell him it's a bad idea and to rethink the system. When he issues bans to numerous members of the community, there's nobody there to review the legitimacy of the ban, or to tell him that kneejerk bans are harmful to the game and community.

I think what's more pressing than fixing the most recent update is fixing the authoritarian system of control that's been the norm in this community. Lava should take some of the money he earned from this update and hire a community manager who should be the one handling all bans, and review all retroactive bans. They need a panel of three members of the community (NOT selected by Lava) for this to review them - I am guessing the VAST majority of bans and mutes on discord, reddit, and in game are complete and utter nonsense that no panel of three would uphold. If I am wrong, great, prove it by having a panel go through them all and release a statement on the number of bans and mutes they reversed.

If the developer continues his heavy handedness, there will be nothing but sycophants left to sing his praises, which ultimately hurts the game and the community rather than being able to accept hard truths and work to improve the game based on those truths.

I think there's still a chance for this game to be saved. I'm willing to change this to a positive review, in the end, if instead of a knee jerk reaction that I'm expecting from all the negative reviews he instead reacts with a thoughtful response that both fixes the issues with the update, in game, but also fixes some of the grave concerns I've raised about the heavy handed moderation resulting in numerous unjust bans.

I don't know why the developer has been silent for so long. I am going to guess that, when he ultimately makes a statement, it's going to be something about spending all his efforts on fixing the issues that iOS has had resulting in the update being rejected there. That's ultimately not a good excuse for being silent so long. Most of us want the game to succeed, and with such a backlash, there should have been a statement made the very day of the update, let alone by now 10 days later. I had been holding off on this review to give the dev a chance to make this statement, but it's been too long at this point, and with no promised changes, again, I cannot recommend this game as-is.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",month numerous request developer considered ultimately post 9 month best game certainly best idle progression outstanding different area progress feel progress towards no_matter ultimately planning positive unfortunately recent no_longer recommend not_just primarily developer handled situation released travesty adding obvious pay win introducing incredibly powerful pet follower bonus average spend hundred dollar wait average year good chance incredibly altering bonus confident developer quickly identify criticism laid community address plan fix banned numerous complaint deleted criticism post subreddit moderate issued single statement released 10 day ago silence speaks louder word developer ban delete criticism constantly outsider never_been punished no_longer stay silent behalf unfortunately appears long history bad decision come punishing discord subreddit s_emphasizedhameful ultimately banning punishing look handled sailing exploit usually biggest supporter spent developer constantly tout solo positive mean never_held accountable come terrible pay win corner tell bad idea rethink issue ban numerous member community legitimacy ban tell kneejerk ban harmful community pressing fixing recent fixing authoritarian control norm community lava earned hire community manager handling ban retroactive ban panel three member community not_selected lava guessing vast majority ban mute discord reddit complete utter nonsense no_panel three uphold wrong great prove panel release statement number ban mute reversed developer continues heavy handedness sycophant left sing praise ultimately hurt community rather able accept hard truth improve based truth s_emphasizedtill chance saved willing positive knee jerk reaction expecting negative review reacts thoughtful response fix issue fix grave concern raised heavy handed moderation resulting numerous unjust ban developer silent long guess ultimately make statement spending effort fixing issue io resulting rejected ultimately not_a good excuse silent long succeed backlash statement alone 10 day holding chance statement long no_promised change cannot_recommend
242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Arrr, ye pirates ;)

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag feels slightly different, than the other AC titles. Why's that?
Well, first of all, the main components are still the same. 

You're playing as Edward Kenway, a pirate which ends up being involved in the Assassins vs. Templar war.
The gameplay didn't really changed, as you're still running and parcouring around in third-person. Climbing up on lookouts, to reveal the map, collecting stuff like chests and animus fragments, doing assassination missions and following the main quest about a mysterious observatorium.

So far, everything as usual. The one big thing which changed, or was rather heavily extended, is the ship you are sailing with.
Already introduced in AC3, you're also getting your own ship this time (of course, what would a pirate be without a ship ^^), the ""Jackdaw"". With said ship, you're spending a lot of time travelling through the caribbean sea, hunting down whales and sharks, exploring sunken ships and underwater caverns, battling other ships and boarding them to get gold and ressources in order to upgrade the Jackdaw (eg. more cannons, reinforced hull, different looking steering wheels or sails).

In my opinion, the part where you are sailing around and enjoying the dynamic day and night cycle, checking for profitable ships to hunt down or just enjoying the waves on the sea is the best part of the game.
The Sea Shanties (your crew will sing along on the open sea) are also great for the atmosphere and pretty entertaining (i found myself singing along with them :D ).

The story itself feels a bit bland and is starting off pretty boring in my opinion.
But it gets better throughout the missions and there are quite some interesting and likable characters which improves the story after the beginning.

The graphic is pretty good, nothing groundbreaking, but very atmospheric and it can create some beautiful moments, especially with the day and night cycles.

The world itself is also quite big, with enough places to visit and roam around to fill hours and hours of gametime. If you don't like collecting stuff or repetitive missions/ship battles, then you might be bored after a while. Even though the ship battles feel quite dynamic, at some point, it's still quite the same (especially if you upgraded your ship and you're more powerful).

Overall, i found it to be a ""different"" Assassin's Creed title, as i had the feeling that component wasn't overly present. I had much more fun sailing around and exploring, than following the main mission. But i think that's also pretty subjective. It's still a very good game and i would recommend it to anyone liking the AC titles and/or good action-adventures, especially with a very good pirate-flair.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Disclaimer: I survivor main. 

I play games for fun, not for competition, so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps, oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately, hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops), and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with), then no biggie. Next game please~

I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.

As a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up - there is always the next game :)

That being said, this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it, have fun with it, and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ;) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine - just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!), and even then, recognize that there are jerks who play this game, like any other game, and have fun while you compete!","Very Positive80% of the 512,225 user reviews for this game are positive.",disclaimer survivor game fun not_for competition dbd community bad killer face camp oh die move next good killer find immediately hook bc juke whoop patrol camp 100 ok no_biggie next please community salt killer come dealing rank survivor properly flash killer face legitimate strategy take fun opinion killer horrible called name survivor tell gud older player ruin newer player player 1000 hour relax fun pip next crazy fun saltiness community buying grab fun ignore hard fixate ranking process unless absurdly highly competitive fine not_to push spout anger recognize jerk fun compete
381210,Dead by Daylight,"Out of all the reviews I wrote, This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. 

For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.

But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.

As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. 

I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.

But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. 

I wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!","Very Positive80% of the 512,225 user reviews for this game are positive.",review wrote probably serious wrote starter community suck online wan na talk jerk wan na suck camped blah_emphasized rare nice compliment talk community unlike online game mic worry hearing twelve old cry raging talk beginning start survivor killer survivor chat killer talk mostly good good survivor basically man sneaky screw player good mate rescue hook someone jerk chat not_to save hooked mostly killer fun survivor someone ta killer hear enjoy survivor probably becuase survivor feel horror mate killer trying great community suck ignore community someone raging good leave seeing argue waste mad last word aka good 8 10 wonder read write wan na swear censor heart like read leaving comment someone read peice crap yay

1203620,Enshrouded,"Let me gain xp from building.

I am the Base mommy, my friends go out and I stay behind and build mighty castles from which we operate. I don't know if it's a terrible idea, I want to be able to keep up somewhat with them whilst building! Please tell me if this is a dumb idea!

Edit: This is a list of the suggestions of all the smart sausages and base mommy's in the comment section! (the biggest issue they adress is people abusing base building to boost xp)

1. [u] Stanleys [/u] and [u] Arch-_-Angelos [/u] were the first people to mention true XP sharing. Where everyone gets 1:1 xp conversion. Like Baldurs Gate 3! 

2. [u] GrimTactics [/u] suggested a daily xp cap for building. Meaning builders can still get some juicy xp, whilst stopping exploiters from going hog-wild.

3. [u] Rhys [/u] takes it a step further! He had the idea of introducing an item set that disables the wearers personal xp gain, but whilst home, they gain xp at the same rate as the adventurer who has the other item.

4. [u] Lord Vorian [/u] as the most thought out method I reckon. They suggest an xp reward for every amount of material spend building. Meaning destroying and replacing something still nets the same amount of total material spend, therefor not rewarding any additional xp.

[i] This one is interesting, it is still subject to some cheekiness, but anyone would still need to farm the resources, no matter if they just make a solid cube base somewhere purely for the xp it's their choice if they desire to spend resources in that manner. It also encourages serious players to build bigger, more grandiose bases, which I personally see as a huge win! [/i]

5. [u] Pepito [/u] had the idea of an xp collecting scroll, or perhaps gem, which explorers could ferry around, having it accumulate experience, so they may give it to builders so they can absorb the collected xp.

6. [u] Faris [/u] mentions reducing material returns from deconstructing and the server settings argument. Player freedom or the game dev's vision? Which is more important? He's also made my aware my head is, in fact, a Tomato. I am profoundly discombobulated.

7. And finally [u] mont3000 [/u], claims a slow xp trickle, which initiates after spending 15/30 minutes building would do the trick.

Awesome suggestions everyone! I am already starting to like the character of the community.

Despite all efforts, Rare has been continually fighting the sour preconceived notion
from consumers that have grown cynical from years of being burned by corporate business 
not unlike the initial release of SoT. I'd say that mindset is more than justified.

I believe this game is a massive outlier when it comes to genuine ethical backtracking 
in terms of ongoing work retroactively fixing the game.

Over the past 2 years SoT has recieved close to the most free updates and hard labor of love 
I've ever seen put into a game that never needed it to bring the money in.
Many would say that sort of description already fits games like No Man's Sky, 
but its approach to it and the design decisions are what makes Sea of Thieves stand out.

Unlike NMS, progression in SoT isn't vertical, but horizontal. 
Meaning all of its mechanics can be experienced in the first hour of play 
and will not differ from someone like me, who has played it for over 1000 hours 
on the M$ Store version. 

While this means overall incentive is that not unlike your high score in an arcade game,
if you actually view the game as what is essentially an open world, 
per session arcade experience, the genius behind this design starts making sense.

Every single update the game has received doesn't suffer from the growing pains of any service game that relies on conventional progression systems.
If Rare decides to add a literal grappling hook mechanic to the game 
that lets you hook onto rocks and pull off drift maneuvers, 
you will get to experience that mechanic the moment you log in. 

This is where that approach really shines.

New mechanics aren't just one and done features, every single one of these now gets to be designed to enrich the gameplay loop itself, meaning the developers have full freedom to find all kinds of secondary and primary uses for just a single mechanic.

For example: 

The rowboat was advertised alongside the volcano region in the game, 
but it's not just a tool to savely park your ship away from erupting volcanos.

- Rowboats can be used as a stealth item that lets you hide your ship 
and silently sneak up to another crew to steal all their belongings. 

- If an island holds many treasures, a rowboat is usually the fastest way to gather it all up and bring it back to your ship if you're in a hurry, which you WILL be.

- If your ship sinks, your rowboat remains and you get a second chance to secure your efforts.

- Rowboats also include their own storage space and as of recently are a very reliable source of supplies if you find them on islands. Effectively cutting supply gathering time in half.

This doesn't even touch on how new features retroactively add to previous mechanics as well.
For example, the aforementioned harpoon can be found on certain rowboats as well which, 
if you have it docked on your ship, allows for an entirely new grappling angle.

So yes, Sea of Thieves is a service game. 
As such it has benefited from new content stacked on top of the already existing structure.
Thankfully that structure is incredibly flat and wide, meaning climbing that structure 
to reach said features is non-existent.

This unfortunately means what was already there could hardly be fixed without entirely redesigning the whole structure which has NOT happened. It's still the same game but with most of its holes and gaps being closed up by genuinely great mechanics and content.

Yes, if you played Sea of Thieves on release 
and disliked the ""go from point A to point B, back to A then repeat"" experience,
that has largely been unchanged and the occasional dead air, while now being shorter than ever, will probably still bore you as much as before. 

However when that dead air is gone, you will experience many many more interesting and fun
scenarios with an incredible amount of tools and ways in how you deal with those situations.

The point of this review isn't to just list all the positives and negatives, 
after all you will find plenty of those already, but to explain why people who have stuck with the game all this time consider the new additions it has received to be much more valuable than they might look to someone who's never played it.

Sea of Thieves has proven to not only be one of the most unique 
and fun coop experiences I've ever played, it reminds me of a time 
when Rare took a formula, injected as much of their own personality and charm as they could
and also manage to introduce an incredibly polished and innovative title 
that stands on its own merit... It just took as long as a Steam release to make that happen.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",sea thief long history ups down shaped favorite game hard pinpoint exactly wrong 4 year closed beta started eventually released public price shape reputation year understatement despite effort rare continually fighting sour preconceived notion consumer grown cynical year burned corporate business not_unlike initial release sot mindset justified believe massive outlier come genuine ethical backtracking term ongoing retroactively fixing past 2 year sot recieved close update hard labor love never_needed bring sort description already fit game no_man s_emphasizedky approach design decision make sea thief stand unlike nm progression sot vertical horizontal meaning mechanic experienced not_differ someone 1000 hour store version mean incentive not_unlike high score arcade view essentially open world per session arcade genius design start sense single received suffer growing pain service relies conventional progression system rare decides add literal grappling hook mechanic let hook onto rock pull drift maneuver mechanic moment log approach shine mechanic feature single get designed enrich loop meaning developer freedom kind secondary primary us single mechanic example rowboat advertised alongside volcano region not_just tool savely park ship erupting volcano rowboat stealth let hide ship silently sneak crew steal belonging island hold treasure rowboat usually fastest gather bring ship hurry ship sink rowboat remains chance secure effort rowboat include storage space recently reliable source supply island effectively cutting supply gathering half touch feature retroactively add previous mechanic example aforementioned harpoon found certain rowboat docked ship allows entirely grappling angle yes sea thief service benefited stacked top already existing structure thankfully structure incredibly flat wide meaning climbing structure reach feature non existent unfortunately mean already hardly fixed entirely redesigning structure not_happened s_emphasizedtill hole gap closed genuinely great mechanic yes sea thief release disliked b_emphasizedack repeat largely unchanged occasional dead air shorter probably bore dead air many_emphasized interesting fun scenario incredible tool way deal situation t_emphasizedo positive negative plenty already explain stuck consider addition received valuable look someone never_played sea thief proven not_only unique fun coop experience reminds rare took formula injected personality charm manage introduce incredibly polished innovative title stand merit took long release happen

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"For years I was an every year, 1000s of hours, release day buyer for Madden. Madden 18 was so bad that I vowed to take a break for years to let them sort some shit out. Surely waiting 6 years would make M24 feel like an actual upgrade right? Nope, same old shit. For reference I am a franchise only player so IDGAF about MUT or anything else, my review is ""offline"" (it's actually forced online) franchise centric, considering this is supposed to be the official simulation experience of the NFL.

-Players feel sluggish, and just making them do what you want them to do is a struggle. Making these players do things they could do in real life is the whole point of a football game, but it still feels like running in quicksand. 

-Aggressive catch was useless in M18 and before, it's still useless. Same goes for possession WRs. Madden somewhere along the line decided that it should simply be impossible to complete a pass in traffic unless you're in MUT using Moss. An elite 95+ spec and CIT receiver 1 on 1 with a corner 6 inches shorter in real life is an auto throw and very likely a huge completion. In madden, it is either just dropped inexplicably, picked, or popped up in the air. There just isn't really an animation for catching a pass over a defender. It's utterly bizarre that this has gone unaddressed for a half a decade+. A very common type of receiver and play is simply not viable even 10% of the time in madden. I play with the Colts mostly, and Michael Pittman Jr. isn't Tyreek Hill, but he should be able to separate and make tough catches. But in madden there's simply no value in receivers who win via anything but speed and he isn't any fun to use. Make it make sense.

-these are NFL players, but sometimes it feels like I can't get them to do something I would be able to as a regular person because controls are so sluggish and unpolished. It isn't fun to control these guys, which is a pretty major part of a sports game.

-trench play still doesn't feel realistic. I have Quenton Nelson on my team but he doesn't feel powerful or smart at all.

-it's still very noticeable that the AI has very different rules for itself vs you, which is a terrible piece of game design. The beauty of the NFL is how coldly equal it is for everyone, and you don't get that from madden. Balls my players can reach they'll inexplicably short arm, while the CPU makes plays you know your players never would. 

-The commentators are still the worst in sports games. Delayed and nonsensical reactions. Massive moments don't feel like it, whereas they'll treat a missed preseason FG like it lost the super bowl. Madden should have multiple teams of commentators to keep it fresh, and have much more grandiose of a scope of lines recorded to pull from. If they were innovative I'd say they should start to look into use of AI to help make realistic real time reactions to stuff, I think the possibilities there are so exciting, but we all know EA doesn't innovate.

-still animation based gameplay

Now the thing I am even more qualified to comment on is the inner workings of franchise and team building. OOTP is the gold standard for this and I'll reference it a bunch because of that, but every sports franchise blows madden out of the water here. And again, disappointingly little progress has been made here, sometimes it is worse. 

-AI still feels less alive than any other sports video game. No game is perfect at immersion, but madden is truly bottom tier still. No adjustments are ever made by the CPU. Baffling team building logic. OOTP transports me to a new world, madden makes it painfully clear at all stops that it is a soulless video game made by a company that wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. 

-Bugs everywhere, and the menu is sooo slow. I'm running a 3070/5800x build and the gameplay runs fine fps wise, but the menus still are like pulling teeth. I have heard people with worse computers not even being able to open the game.

-Compounding slow menus, the UI is somehow worse than when I quit madden half a decade back. 

-Scouting, also somehow worse. You literally have to fire your whole scouting department and rehire a new one every preseason to scout effectively. If madden doesn't care to make scouting realistic or fun (this iteration of scouting is neither) then why make it part of the game at all? OOTP doesn't have a scouting mechanic- you hire a scout, with money that you could have used elsewhere, and then you simply have to put trust into that scout that their evaluations are better than other teams' scouts. If you skimped on paying for a great scout you'll have consequences, but paying for the best scout means less money for players, developments, etc. It is different, but 100X more immersive and realistic than madden. I love scouting if done right, but if you don't care to do it right, you end up with a process that just feels painful as it does in M24 and would be better off without it entirely.

-I heard some say madden's created draft classes are improved, but I don't really see it. It's still a shell of what it could be, and still isn't realistic at all. I don't see varied enough skillsets, I still see far too many bad athletes, I see unrealistic skillsets, the terrible scouting system. I did enjoy that scouting grades aren't so specific anymore-""day 3"" as a designation rather than ""round 5"" leaves it open to that player going anywhere from round 3 to undrafted, so if you like a guy you gotta take him. More realistic than before at least.

-not franchise specific per se, but one of my biggest sticking points that I honestly cannot believe has still not been addressed- positional designations. Mind mindbogglingly, draft prospects are *still* shoehorned into being ""LG"" or ""ROLB"" or ""FS,"" when in real life guys are seen much more generally as an OT prospect, an off ball LB prospect, a pass rusher, etc. It makes absolutely no sense, all it does is needlessly complicate things. How has this still not been made more realistic? Get rid of the left vs right BS, that is not how any draft analyst actually looks at prospects, and all it does it add multiple extra menus to scouting that are needless. Especially when madden lets you edit any offensive lineman to any other position with no penalty- another thing they should address.

-Not only do they still bizarrely specify things like left vs right guard, they use positional names out of 2001. LE/RE/DT/OLB/MLB for every team and scheme still? No edge rusher designation? Absolutely embarrassing for everyone involved with this game that this has not been updated in 20 years. Players on defense should be listed as such- interior defenders, pass rushers, off ball linebackers, safeties, corners, with variations within- tweener iDL-edge players, LB/S hybrids, etc. This has been how it works for a long time now IRL, and updating it would simplify it so much! Instead, we *still* have 4-3 teams signing pass rushers with 40 coverage to play off ball, or 3-4 teams with 240 pound 3techs. It hurts my brain how little effort and knowledge it would take for madden to make this change, and what a difference it would make in the quality of their product, and they still haven't. Shameful. 


I could go on, but what's the point? Whoever is making decisions for this franchise decided long ago that integrity or pride was much less important than the bottom line, so they'll keep putting out $70 roster updates designed to take money from small children via MUT. If the NFL understood the importance of a good official video game for a sport, they'd have some standards for EA, but it doesn't look like that will ever happen. TL;DR- buggy, boring, soulless, don't buy. I'll get my hours in, if only to get my money's worth and see if I can get a workable experience to last me another half decade before I give this company money again. But if you're any less than a football starved maniac who hasn't bought madden in 6 years, don't bother, really.","Mixed43% of the 5,008 user reviews for this game are positive.",year 1000 hour release buyer madden_emphasized 18 bad vowed break year sort shit surely waiting 6 year m24 actual upgrade nope old shit reference franchise idgaf mut else offline forced online franchise centric considering supposed official simulation nfl player sluggish struggle player thing real life football feel running quicksand aggressive catch useless m18 s_emphasizedtill useless go possession wrs madden along line decided simply impossible complete pas traffic unless mut moss elite 95 spec cit receiver 1 1 corner 6 inch shorter real life auto throw huge completion madden dropped inexplicably picked popped air an_emphasizedimation catching pas defender utterly bizarre unaddressed half decade common type receiver simply not_viable 10 madden colt mostly michael pittman jr t_emphasizedyreek hill able separate tough catch madden s_emphasizedimply no_value receiver win via speed fun sense nfl player feel able regular control sluggish unpolished fun control guy pretty major sport trench realistic quenton nelson powerful smart s_emphasizedtill noticeable ai different rule v terrible piece design beauty nfl coldly equal madden ball player reach inexplicably short arm cpu make play player never_would commentator worst sport game delayed nonsensical reaction massive moment whereas treat missed preseason fg lost super bowl madden multiple team commentator fresh grandiose scope line recorded pull innovative look ai help realistic real reaction stuff possibility exciting ea innovate animation based qualified comment inner working franchise building ootp gold standard reference bunch sport franchise blow madden water disappointingly progress worse ai feel alive sport video no_game perfect immersion madden truly bottom tier no_adjustments cpu baffling building logic ootp transport world madden make painfully clear stop soulless video company piss fire bug everywhere menu sooo slow running 3070 5800x build run fine shooter wise menu pulling teeth heard worse computer not_even able open compounding slow menu ui somehow worse quit madden half decade scouting somehow worse literally fire scouting department rehire preseason scout effectively madden care scouting realistic fun iteration scouting neither_then ootp scouting mechanic hire scout elsewhere simply trust scout evaluation team scout skimped paying great scout consequence paying best scout mean player development different 100x immersive realistic madden love scouting care process feel painful m24 be_emphasizedtter entirely heard madden created draft class improved it_emphasized s_emphasizedtill shell realistic varied skillsets far bad athlete unrealistic skillsets terrible scouting enjoy scouting grade specific anymore 3 designation rather round 5 leaf open anywhere round 3 undrafted guy ta realistic not_franchise specific per se biggest sticking point honestly cannot_believe not_been addressed positional designation mind_emphasizedbogglingly draft prospect shoehorned lg rolb f real life guy generally ot prospect ball lb prospect pas rusher make no_sense needlessly complicate thing not_been realistic rid left v b not_how draft analyst look prospect add multiple extra menu scouting needle especially madden let offensive lineman position no_penalty address not_only bizarrely specify thing left v guard positional name 2001 le dt olb mlb scheme no_edge rusher designation embarrassing involved not_been updated 20 year player defense listed interior defender pas rusher ball linebacker safety corner variation tweener idl edge player lb hybrid work long irl updating simplify 4 3 team signing pas rusher 40 coverage ball 3 4 team 240 pound 3techs hurt brain effort knowledge madden difference quality product shameful whoever decision franchise decided long ago integrity pride important bottom line putting 70 roster update designed small child via mut nfl understood importance good official video sport standard ea look happen tl dr buggy boring soulless hour worth workable last half decade company football starved maniac bought madden 6 year bother

686810,Hell Let Loose,"My very first game on HLL: I join a server, select the Allies, enter an open squad (yes, they can be locked) and select a machinegunner. As soon as the match begins the squad's officer asks via voip if there are any new players. I answer ""me"", ask him and my other squaddies to forgive me if I make mistakes, and the squad leader just laughs it off and tells me ""no worries, just follow my directions, keep your eyes sharp and your ears sharper and you'll do fine"". And then, we start moving towards a quaint French town called Carentan. 

""See that church at the center of the map?"", the squad leader tells us. ""Our orders are to occupy it and defend the area no matter the costs. Watch out for windows and rubble because there'll be Krauts everywhere."" And there WERE lots of Krauts in the area. I run forward in the open like a headless chicken, and a German rifleman shoots me in the torso. I crumple to the ground, as the noises all around me grow duller and duller and my vision starts to blur as life abandons me. 

""Don't let go and hang in there mate!"", the squad's medic shouts. So I wait, while the medic tosses a smoke grenade to conceal his movements, reaches my dying frame and brings me back to the realm of the living with a quick morphine shot. ""Now dive for cover! Go behind those barrels over there!"", he tells me, which I eagerly do, still bleeding out. Once behind cover, the medic pulls out the bandages and starts to apply a field dressing, while the squad leader checks the surroundings with his binoculars.

""Enemy infantry in those windows! Shoot, damn it!"", and before I ask him exactly which window, he points me a specific one in the distance. I squint my eyes as hard as I can, and notice that there are indeed a couple of indistinct shapes looking at us. I then deploy my mighty M1919 heavy machinegun, ignoring the gunshots that plink all around me, and start laying down a withering hail of suppressive fire against that and nearby windows. I doubted I ever got a single kraut, but that wasn't what mattered - what mattered was that the jerries had no way of peeking out of those windows without getting mulched. With me supporting their advance, the remainder of my squad moves towards the building under the cover of smoke grenades, while our riflemen toss as many grenades inside the windows as they can. I hear gunshots coming from the buildings, a couple of players curse as they get downed while the squad leader shouts ""I've got 'em, I've got 'em! Come here gunner, we need your mg!"" 

I make a mad dash towards the building right as a hail of enemy machinegun fire is poured into the smoke, not aiming at anybody in particular but still managing to hit me - again - and cause me to bleed. Nevertheless, I manage to get inside the building and get the medic to patch me up again. ""This is becoming a habit, mate. I should start to charge you for every dressing"", he jokes. We both laugh, at least until a kraut tosses a grenade inside a nearby window, something the medic does not notice. ""Grenade right behind you! Run!"", I yell at him. We both run as far away from that room as possible right as the grenade goes off, I emerge unscathed from the blast but the medic is hit and starts bleeding. ""Cover me while I patch myself up"", he asks me, but right at that moment one of our squaddies who was garrisoning the building's ground floor yells ""OH s**t, they're insi-"" before an SMG burst causes him to scream. Realizing that there's only one way up the building and that I am right in front of the stairs, I lay on the ground and deploy my machinegun yet again. A kraut climbs the stairs and runs right in front of my machinegun, getting riddled with bullets and falling on the spot. Two more krauts enter after him, both of which get similarly cut down while I yell ""they're coming! Right up the stairs!"". A friendly rifleman arrives, tosses a couple of grenades down the stairs, and I see torn human limbs flying everywhere. ""Germs're sanitized"", he shouts back. The squad leader laughs it off, congratulates us both, and then orders us to keep marching towards the church at the center of Carentan. It's only 100 meters away from our position, but due to a german Tiger parked right in front of it and at least two German platoons, it might as well be miles and miles away.

The Tiger is relentless in its attempts to kill every single yank its spotter sees. At least until a Sherman outflanks and destroys it with its powerful 76 mm gun. Suddenly the tide of the battle has been turned, and the germans are the ones desperately scrambling away from that hulk of steel on tracks, falling back inside the church. Around the church, artillery fire starts falling on the battlefield like rain, tearing to pieces any soldier unfortunate enough to get hit. Undaunted, our assault specialist throws a couple of smoke grenades before getting cut down by submachinegun fire. His heroic sacrifice allows us to enter inside the church in relative safety and engage the last kraut holdouts in a desperate close quarters battle they are hopelessly outmatched for due to their bolt-action rifles and the elevated number of automatic and semi-automatic firearms we possess. 

At long last, the church of Carentan has fallen into Allied hands, but we do not even have the time to pat on each other's shoulders that a massive artillerly barrage rains all around the church. Allied soldiers who aren't quick or lucky enough to get inside are pulverized by the concentrated explosive fire, the sherman that was covering us gets blown to smithereens, and all that's left to defend the capture point is our 5-men squad and a rifleman from another platoon who somehow made it to the church by the skin of his teeth. 

""They're couterattacking. Run for the bell tower!"", our squad leader orders us. We dash for the church's bell tower like madmen, while the rifleman straggler tosses a couple of grenades to cover our retreat. Finally at the top of the bell tower, I realize that it is spacious enough to give us ample room for manoeuvers, gives us a very nice overlook of the entire town, and has only one way in or out. ""Defend the bell tower at all costs, G*ddammit!"", I hear the squad leader scream. Thus, I pick a spot with a clean line of sight to the stairs and deploy my trusty machinegun again. 

Kraut soldiers start coming our way, in unorganized waves that get mercilessly scythed down at first, and in coordinated attacks with grenades, smoke grenades and submachinegunners later. Me and the straggler get shot again, but the medic in our team quickly bandages up again. It is only in that moment that I realise my machinegun is completely out of ammo. ""Out of ammo!"", I yell to my squaddies, which prompts the straggler to drop an ammo box right next to me. Thanking him, I proceed to restock while the Germans keep on assaulting our position. The situation grows more and more desperate until, at long last, it happens.

Allied reinforcements arrive, three whole platoons of soldiers supporter by a Sherman Jumbo. Realising that they have been beaten, the krauts cease their attempts to storm the bell tower and focus on the attackers. It is at that moment that our squad leader orders us on the offensive. With the desperation that only a cornered animal can muster, we toss the very last two grenades we have down the stairway and catch the german defenders in a devastating pincer attack. The church of Carentan is now ours once again, for real this time. The squad leader congratulates us all, me in particular. ""You did very well for a first timer, mate"" - he tells me - ""now try to keep it up with the two remaining capture points. Let's go!""

1172470,Apex Legends™,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"Believe the hype.

I've always been a staunch believer that Larian were a poor choice to continue this franchise. Not because they have ever been incompetent but because in my opinion there have always been better storytellers and Baldur's Gate was always more about story and character than it was about gameplay. No one can argue that Larian's approach to the mechanics of their games have been anything less than groundbreaking. Divinity Original Sin 1+2 set a new bar for different ways to do things both in combat and in terms of choice and consequence; and yet I've never been fully drawn in to either game because I just didn't care enough about the narrative. I always thought that despite being good games they were overrated and overly gushed about by a horde of fanboys - and this was my mindset going into BG3.

Then you have the first area which finds you in a MIND FLAYER SPACESHIP and my first thoughts in early access were ""ok Larian have done Larian, I'm sure it'll be good but in the end this will be another game I'm not keen on. It's not a Baldur's Gate game"". After just a couple of hours I was experiencing the first hints of how wrong I was - about everything.

Let's start with the basics of the overall technical value. In true Larian form there are multiple ways to do things but they have taken what they were known to be good at and improved every aspect tenfold. Every large quest and even most ""side"" quests have so many different possible approaches that it would take thousands of hours to find every secret the game can present but this alone wouldn't normally do anything to change your general experience of playing a game. It NEVER feels like a slog, never feels like you are doing anything just for the sake of it. Every NPC is fully 3D rendered and voiced. There is no ""filling"", no crowds where people are just wandering about to illustrate a mass. No one you can't talk to. No one that has nothing to say. The fact that this extends to wildlife and even dead bodies makes it all the more incredible of an achievement. The graphics and the voice acting are of a standard beyond any other party based RPG ever. I'm aware this sounds like exaggeration but trust me it isn't.

So, Narrative and characterisation? I'm going to be quick about this because there's no way for me to give any examples without spoilers. Any detail you hear about this game, any stream, any walkthrough, perhaps even any screenshot, is a spoiler. Things fit so perfectly from a tale telling perspective that there ARE no side quests - just shorter stories within stories. There are many characters that you will love and more that will annoy you. What's important is that the main ones are fluid. Dialogue will change your opinion of someone who was previously annoying you so much that all you wanted to do was take their head off. These are not cardboard cutouts. They barely feel designed/scripted at all. Sure the game is full of set pieces and boy are they a treat almost every time.

The game world is huge and PACKED. You can barely take a few steps without running into something unexpected or another quest. And it's all entertaining and thoroughly engrossing.

Here's the bombshell; and it's something I never thought I'd say about any game, after a little over 20 hours played it's already looking to be better than anything Bioware (or Obsidian) has ever done. If you ever thought imagine you could have an RPG with Bioware level storytelling and Larian mechanics then this is it - but better than anyone has any right to expect. They took years longer than they said they would to finally get this out and it doesn't take long to see why.

I can't wait to get to the end (which doesn't mean I want to rush to do that), to play it all over again, and to try it in co-op.

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Jedi Survivor is an amazing game and takes everything the first game did and does it even better, worlds are far more expansive and have much more enemy variety. Character customisation is also much better in this game, not just for cosmetics but for gameplay as well. Fallen Order has 3 skill tree pathways whereas Survivor starts you off with 7, with 2 more unlocking later in the game. I found myself struggling to choose between the different upgrades which was much better than the far more linear skill tree of Fallen Order.

While the game itself is great the technical issues are just so bad. At first I thought I was getting alright performance, like around 40+ frames at 1080p, but it just got so much worse, going anywhere between 10-30 frames at 720p medium settings. Plus the game bugs out on the visuals and goes all black and white and all weird, plus the Mogu is so annoying cause if you die to it, all your xp disappears.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.

On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.

All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.

Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB.
Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc.
Until Activision fixes their dogshit anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.

Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.

Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"[h1] At the time of this review I had 169 ;) hours in the span of two weeks and I still haven't even come close to complete the game. Also, completing the game is probably impossible.

[b]World 3 added A LOT more content, which wasn't out at the time I wrote this review.[/b][/h1]

This game being 100% free is the closest thing to robbery. On top of that, it's 100% playable if you are completely F2P. The fact that it's developed by a single person just blows my mind away. The guy is an active member of the community, listens, and is hilarious (protip: read everything in the game).

Legends of Idleon is the master of all idle games. I've dropped $50+ already and I'm easily going to spend more. The event deals are extremely worth it. If you were a fan of MapleStory, chances are you are going to love this game. 

There are so many things to explore and customize in this game, it's insane! Brace yourselves.

1) Damage Classes (more coming soon)
Beginner --> Journeyman 
Warrior --> Barbarian / Squire
Archer --> Bowman / Hunter
Mage --> Wizard / Shaman

Each of these classes have a unique specialization and they all level up independently. For example, warriors can mine or fish better, archers can craft items easier or catch bugs, mages can chop wood or do better alchemy, etc. When you are investing time into each task, their unique exp bar will take over. The best part is that, this way, the game promotes creating multiple characters with different classes that specialise in different things, while they all farm simultaneously. Every time you switch, what you'd be doing in the game changes and provides a great sense of variety.

2) Skill Classes
- Mining
- Chopping
- Catching Bugs
- Fishing
- Alchemy
- Smithing (crafting)

3) Tasks
In the two current worlds (3rd coming early May) that currently exist, there is a huge variety of achievements you can do to acquire merit points and unlock new crafting recipes.

4) Statues and Obols
Throughout your explorations you will acquire Statues and Obols that drop from monsters (you can acquire obols from alchemy too) that you can use to further enhance your build. Statues are applied to the particular character you use them on, while Obols have slots in 2 tabs, personal and family. 

5) Worlds
Currently there are 2 vast worlds (as mentioned next one is coming in early May) that you slowly unlock by killing a certain amount of monster in a particular map or by reaching certain skill levels (mining, chopping, catching, fishing).

6) Guilds
Their functionality is simple but heavily promotes working together to do your guild tasks, earn guild points, and unlock guild skills that further help your progress.

7) Items
- Armor (helmet, rings, amulets, breastplates, leggings, shoes)
- Weapons (spears/swords, bows, and staffs)
- Tools (pickaxes, axes, catching nets, fishing rods)
- Food (boosts certain stats and you have 2 slots available in the beginning)
- Trophies (cool-looking titles under your name that adds stats and effects)
- Premium Items (hats, chat rings, enhanced in-game features that make things happen faster)
- Bags and Shared Storage (you unlock inventory slots for both of them throughout the game)

8) Mini-games
Each skill (mining, chopping, etc) other than alchemy and smithing have their own unique little mini-game that you can play four times per day to acquire more drops and exp. Some are actually really fun.

9) Alchemy
Oh man, so many things here, you just gotta see it for yourself.

10) Smithing (crafting)
There are items that come from an auto-production system that works to build your exp for smithing and, thus, creating higher level items. You basically choose what to auto-produce, go farm, check the anvil, and auto-store all the produced items in your storage, profit.

11) Travelling
You can walk through a map and move to the next one when reaching the kill cap (kill X monsters to unlock the portal). You can also teleport anywhere you want once a day (you can upgrade this once for free or multiple times in the premium shop). This is only not-so-fun part of this game if you don't buy the ""+7 teleports / day"" premium item. But to be fair, it's really cheap.

12) Cards
Oh boy. Another fantastic aspect of the game. Each mob has a unique card that represents it and only drops (somewhat rare) from that specific mob. These cards have added stats that further help you customize your build (eg. +3% money, +5% mining efficiency, +5 base dmg, etc). You can equip up to 4 cards for free, then you can unlock 4 more slots for a premium fee.

13) Bosses
There are a few bosses in the game that drop some unique items, other than the final bosses of each world the battles aren't anything special.

14) Active vs. AFK
You can play the game actively and you can play the game afk, both work. There are builds that focus in better progress through AFK gameplay, and other builds that work better when actively playing. The option is yours.

NOTE: Just so you know, at this point I debated to stop writing my review because this game has so much friggin' content! And it's even done yet (it releases in a year)!

15) Star Signs and Constellations
Mid-late game content, accessed through a telescope and almost hidden little star drawings throughout the game. These constellations enhance your gameplay with bonus effects and stats that are unlocked by doing certain tasks (eg. farm afk for X hour(s) at Y map, reach X map with Y class) when you encounter those sneaky star drawings in a map.

16) Stamps
Throughout the game you will find or buy stamps (in-game currency) that enhance your stats (eg. +X defense, +X% smithing speed, etc.) for all your characters account-wide. 

17) Colosseum
It works like a Tower Defense game. You're placed in a small map, there's a timer, multiple rounds that spawn mobs, and you get to choose if you want to spawn the next wave instantly or wait. As a Barbarian (AoE auto-attacks), you'd go at the spot that the mobs spawn, activate auto-attack (spells activate automatically too), spam ""next round"", SLAUGHTER! Oh man, this is one of the most enjoyable things for me in the game.

18) Post-office
This is one the things I haven't unlocked yet, but from what I've seen it combines the concept of make and collect X items to receive Y reward. Seems kinda plain and monotone, but I haven't explored it yet.

19) Food
Food provides bonuses like:
+100hp if your health goes below 50%
+10% exp and has 80% chance to be consumed after killing a mob

There are some rare Food drops that are golden, which also stack (eg. 2 golden nomwiches give 12.4dmg instead of 6.8) and only occupy 1 Food Slot!

20) Vendors
They sell Rings, Amulets, Food, utility items (return to town scroll, skill reset shard), weapon / armor / storage / inventory upgrades, and stuff like that.

21) Quests
Personally, the least entertaining part of the game. I love the dialogue and the characters as they have unique and interesting personalities, however, the quests themselves are quite plain and monotone. Most of them are ""Kill X amount of Y monster"" or ""Acquire X amount of Y drop"". There are a few unique and fun ones, but nothing too special.

== My Idleon Experience ==
The game is absolutely fantastic if you want to keep yourself occupied with work or something else while you're using Legends of Idleon as a game of management. I set my characters to farm what I need for my next craft, or kill the mobs I need for a quest, or do a task for my guild. Then, IRL, I do work, hangout with the waifu, do the dishes, and lift weights. After all of those things that I [i]actually[/i] do, a few hours have passed by. I open up Legends of Idleon, I visit each character one-by-one, I get lost in the sea of drops that fall on the ground, my character glowing in a ray of light-beams while the EXP bar is going bananas with all my AFK gains, dopamine taking over my body with each single drop and level up... all in life is good again.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",169 hour span week close complete completing probably impossible world 3 wrote 100 closest robbery top 100 playable completely f2p developed single blow mind guy active member community listens hilarious protip read legend idleon master idle game dropped 50 already easily spend event deal extremely worth fan maplestory chance love thing explore customize insane brace 1 damage class coming soon beginner journeyman warrior barbarian squire archer bowman hunter mage wizard shaman class unique specialization independently example warrior mine fish archer craft item easier catch bug mages chop wood alchemy investing task unique exp bar best promotes creating multiple character different class specialise different thing farm simultaneously switch change provides great sense variety 2 skill class mining chopping catching bug fishing alchemy smithing crafting 3 task world 3rd coming early currently exist huge variety achievement acquire merit point unlock crafting recipe 4 statue obols throughout exploration acquire statue obols drop monster acquire obols alchemy enhance build statue applied particular obols slot 2 tab personal family 5 world currently 2 vast world mentioned next coming early slowly unlock killing certain monster particular map reaching certain skill level mining chopping catching fishing 6 guild functionality simple heavily promotes working guild task earn guild point unlock guild skill help progress 7 item armor helmet ring amulet breastplate legging shoe weapon spear sword bow staff tool pickax ax catching net fishing rod food boost certain stats 2 slot available beginning trophy cool title name add stats effect premium item hat chat ring enhanced feature thing happen faster bag shared storage unlock inventory slot throughout 8 mini game skill mining chopping alchemy smithing unique mini four time per acquire drop exp fun 9 alchemy oh man thing ta 10 smithing crafting item auto production work build exp smithing creating higher item basically choose auto produce farm check anvil auto store produced item storage profit 11 travelling walk map move next reaching kill cap kill x monster unlock portal teleport anywhere upgrade multiple time premium shop not_so fun 7 teleports premium fair cheap 12 card oh boy fantastic aspect mob unique card represents drop somewhat rare specific mob card stats help customize build eg 3 5 mining efficiency 5 base dmg equip 4 card unlock 4 slot premium fee 13 boss boss drop unique item final boss world battle special 14 active v afk actively afk build focus progress afk build actively option note debated writing friggin release 15 star sign constellation mid late accessed telescope hidden star drawing throughout constellation enhance bonus effect stats unlocked certain task eg farm afk x map reach x map class encounter sneaky star drawing map 16 stamp throughout stamp currency enhance stats eg x defense x smithing speed character wide 17 colosseum work tower defense placed small map timer multiple round spawn mob choose spawn next wave instantly wait barbarian aoe auto attack spot mob spawn activate auto attack spell activate automatically spam next round slaughter oh man enjoyable thing 18 post office thing unlocked combine concept collect x item receive reward kinda plain monotone explored 19 food_emphasized provides bonus 100hp health go 50 10 exp 80 chance consumed killing mob rare food drop golden stack eg 2 golden nomwiches 12 4dmg 6 8 occupy 1 food slot 20 vendor ring amulet food utility item return to_emphasizedwn scroll skill reset shard weapon armor storage inventory upgrade stuff 21 quest personally entertaining love dialogue character unique interesting personality quest plain monotone kill x monster acquire x drop unique fun one special idleon fantastic occupied else legend idleon management set character farm next craft kill mob task guild irl hangout waifu dish lift weight thing i_emphasized hour passed open legend idleon visit lost sea drop fall ground glowing ray light beam exp bar banana afk gain dopamine taking body single drop life good

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Decided to try it out and see how bad the performance really is. Well, it's weird to say the least. I'm on RTX 3070 (mobile) with Ryzen 7 5800H and 32GB of RAM. Legion 5 Pro laptop. On average I'm getting ~50-60 FPS. Now, the interesting part:

[list]
    [*]Changing graphics preset to Low only adds around 10 FPS in total. 
    [*]Changing the resolution from 1440p to 1080p shockingly has almost no effect.
    [*]Any volumetric effect on screen costs 30% of framerate.
    [*]Even the main menu hovers around 57 FPS (Just like in The Last of Us Part I).
[/list]

In short, there is obviously something fundamentally wrong. Especially considering it doesn't look much better than Fallen Order. The game had 5 patches at the moment of this review and it's baffling how it wasn't fixed yet. As far as I know, at launch it ran twice as bad and it took one patch to get it to the current performance level. Meaning that they made some stupid mistake that took a very short time to fix. Then, in the next patch, they messed up with the resolution scaling. Also, just [b]one line in the config file.[/b]

This is some dangerously serious level of incompetence. The last nail in the coffin is an ""apology"" statement they made. Which was hardly an apology. Instead of admitting they did something wrong, they blamed Windows 10, hardware and [b]users for making a bad decision in pairing their CPUs and GPUs.[/b]

That'll be $70, please.

[b]UPDATE:[/b]

So, Patch 6 was just released, and it seems like in a month they were able to fix only a few minor issues. Performance problems were completely ignored. They also haven't mentioned anything about the performance problems on their official Twitter or anywhere else, which kind of indicates that they are pleased with the money they made. I got my refund.

[b]UPDATE #2:[/b]

I've seen a lot of ""Get better hardware"" comments on the Discussions board and I just want to remind everyone that you shouldn't patch the problem by throwing money at your PC just because some multi-billion dollar company underpays and overworks their developers to the point they just don't care about optimization anymore. 
It's not a user's fault. First of all, there are quite a lot of games that are much more graphically impressive and have no performance issues. And second, do ""System Requirements"" exist only for the store page decoration?

[b]UPDATE #3:[/b]

To make the situation even more ridiculous, a modder by the nickname Snight01 released a mod that fixes the occlusion culling issues and Ray Tracing crashes. The issues that Respawn wasn't able to fix after 6 patches.

[b]UPDATE #4:[/b]

Decided to try it out again after Patch 7, since a lot of people said that it's fixed now. And while it is definitely better, stuttering is still very much present. AO had an improvement, DLSS looks much better than FSR and overall CPU performance is a bit better. I'd say, it's in a much better state now, but still, constant stuttering is annoying enough to ruin all the enjoyment. You can watch Digital Foundry video if you're interested. But I refunded again.

916440,Anno 1800,"[h2]A Brief Summary[/h2]
Anno 1800 is a real time strategy game set during the industrial revolution, focusing on the development of supply chains and logistics between multiple islands. Profits from internal sales and trade can then be used to subsidize the less profitable construction and military supply chains that enable the player to expand and enforce their claims against competitors. While the supply chains are never very complex, the game is slowed down by its obtuse trade route system and extreme lack of instructions on its core mechanics. In spite of its flaws, Anno 1800 generally provides a satisfying level of complexity and progress with little downtime.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2][b][u]City Development[/u][/b]
Each residence will supply workers that can be employed to harvest and process goods. Most goods are consumables which can be supplied back to the island’s population to fulfill their needs, increasing the number of workers per residence and boosting approval. A fully supplied residence can then be upgraded to house workers of the next tier, unlocking new supply chains to support them. Higher tiers bring more complexity, profit, and power. Unlike other colony sims, Anno 1800 is somewhat unique in that workers and storage don’t need to be placed in any particular pattern to mitigate transport time. This pushes the player to maximize the value of their space by packing in the buildings as tightly as possible. The game provides tools to edit and copy blocks of buildings to minimize the effort required to expand existing sectors, leaving the player to focus on new developments.

[b][u]Colony Management[/u][/b]
Warehouses serve as portals into an island’s total inventory, effectively linking nearby structures to the stockpile. To transfer items between islands, the player needs to set up shipping routes. Different islands often have access to different resources that are necessary for certain supply chains. For instance, hops cannot be grown on the player’s starting island and are a mandatory part of the beer supply chain. Further, the island attractiveness system and the space needed for farms push the player to export their low-level and polluting industries to other islands. Concentrating wealth on one island allows for more advanced supply chains and a higher profit margin provided the player can form a robust shipping network. Like most aspects of the game, the player is rewarded for thinking ahead to plan and defend their goals.

[b][u]Naval Supremacy[/u][/b]
With the introduction of steel and weapons factories in the worker tier of citizens, players can begin constructing warships to control the seas. The smaller gunboats are effective at pursuing trade ships, but can be completely deterred by frigate escorts. A Ship of the line carries twice the firepower of a frigate, finding its niche in locking down channels and conquering new areas. While the settlements owned by competitors can be razed, their coastal batteries are able to outclass anything a ship can carry. Large settlements, however, will typically crumble without regular shipments from their colonies. Ships are slow to produce and mobilize, but their costs are more than justified by the value of the trade they can secure.

[b][u]Influence[/u][/b]
Influence is a limited resource that can be allocated to control various aspects of the game to benefit the player. While players with a larger population will have more influence, it comes with a larger area to secure. Every ship and coastal battery consumes influence, as do claims on islands and the ownership of competitors’ shares. A large military and merchant fleet may come at the expense of economic and civil bonuses. The tax gains from propaganda can conflict with the player’s ability to claim new islands. Influence serves as an adaptive budget that can be allocated across both the player’s military, economy, and empire to support their strategies over the course of the game.

[b][u]Difficulty[/u][/b]
The difficulty options in game impact a number of factors that significantly influence the game. The easiest difficulty has larger islands with more plentiful resources. More importantly, the easy rival players are rooting for you, offering donations and alliances without being prompted. The easy difficulty can help an inexperienced player fudge their way through the campaign without cutting out the core mechanics. Higher difficulties are then used to explore worlds with fewer resources, forcing conflicts and demanding more of the player. The cast of characters used on such difficulties is adapted accordingly to be faster, more ambitious, and opportunistic. Though it’s pretty clear that the NPCs cheat to some extent, their capabilities are believable and they are well characterized through their actions. Ultimately, the difficulty options are done remarkably well.

[h2]Problems[/h2][b][u]A Lacking tutorial[/u][/b]
Formally the in-game encyclopedia has a single entry describing what lifestyle needs are, while the campaign demonstrates the early supply chains. [i]That’s it[/i]. Notably, the player is not taught essential mechanics like how to colonize new islands nor are they offered any explanation as to where the money comes from. Spoiler—it doesn’t come from either external trade or even taxes. The bulk of the money is generally obtained by passively selling goods back to one’s own population. Like many things, the details are left to be discovered by hovering over elements in the various menus in the game or, more likely, looking up guides online.

[b][u]Moving Items[/u][/b]
Trade routes can be set to move a specified quantity of items from one island to next on repeat. Though demand is usually measured in items per minute, the trade system offers no prediction to the average throughput of any given route. Should multiple routes pull items from the same island, extra capacity in any of them will suffocate the others. To make matters worse, there is no control to make a one time transfer from one port to another, or even offload the unique contents of a ship when it arrives at its destination. Despite being a game about logistics and supply, it is extremely painful to move items from wherever they are in the player’s territory to where they are actually needed, slowing things down and generally inhibiting the player’s economy in ways that are prohibitively difficult to resolve.

[b][u]Slow[/u][/b]
The amount of fiddling required to move items results in delayed construction and poorer coordination between the player’s islands. The wasted productivity then becomes a substantial loss for one’s treasury, further restricting development. All the while, the player needs to stop to manage the supply and demand charts on top of the flood of reminders that, somewhere, a ship is under attack. While setting up a new supply chain is relatively quick with the necessary resources on hand, constant distractions and logistical difficulties easily inflate what would be fifteen minute tasks to hour long affairs. As a result, the quantity of supply chains and level of management needed to debug them takes up enough time to largely invalidate the upper half of the technologies in the game. Alas, the game is certainly an active experience.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
Anno 1800 is generally a good and capable game. While it does a poor job of communicating its mechanics, the game supports the player with excellent NPC competitors in its difficulty options. While there are a lot of tasks that require the one’s attention on a moment to moment basis, the player is almost always actively planning and engaging with what it has to offer. There is a constant progression and anticipation for greater things throughout the game. The logistics are pretty frustrating though. It’s pretty good, though far from perfect.

I honestly recommand this game when it comes to story telling that makes you feel part of the fight through its challenges, battles & each boss felt like a darn boss alright since I like souls games and tales of series, Thats why since it has wonderful visual combat & atmosphere and each character with their unique fighting style that you may build them according to your fighting standards of approach as you level up finish quests to earn skill points & get stronk each chapter or mission.

Edit:- 49 hours 
Honestly for knowing there is an aftermath story just made it better for me glad kept doing side missions & putting my characters to work and facing few new bosses for a change.
I like how they're Nerf those at level 100 that are joining off a starter player or around level 60 to keep the boss enjoyable and manageable for both players to overcome it in a good pace.

Edit 2:- 108 hours
After beating the game 100% achievement discovering mini and major parts of the game that you may adept through your journey and experience I honestly would love to say this game deserves the love and attention it seeks as I hope it continues to support its fan base and community with its future development.

Cant wait to see other antagonists bosses and story line within this game to fight em and experience terror 

Low key this game gave me old games nostalgia such as ""White Knight Chronicles 2"" ""Ex Troopers"" ""Freedom Wars"" ""Monster Hunter"" from its Story approach, Mechanical Fighting style Quirks , Character enhancement upgrades, Coop mode online and Mission progress

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"[b] Review After 100% Achievements [/b]

Fires of Rubicon was my entry to the Armored Core franchise and one of the few “mech” games I’ve ever played. Now I am hooked. After playing through the game multiple times to get all the endings and unlock all the missions, I have to say that this is one of the coolest games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. The weapon/build variety is absolutely insane and that goes hand-in-hand with the option to play PvP if you are interested in even more combat. AC6 has been on my radar ever since I heard about them bringing the series back, so I decided to give it a try. Was not expecting to get as addicted to the gameplay as much as I have. All the mechanics flow extremely well and the actions become second nature the more time you put into the game. The story seemed very vague at the beginning (which I love btw) but as you reach the end of your first playthrough and make certain decisions, all the pieces start coming together forming this awesome world around you. Finishing the game three times gives you the true ending and enables you to unlock all the missions that you need to obtain Rank S for in order to 100% this game….that is the most challenging achievement in my opinion. The grind almost drove me mad. Performance is rock solid, music is phenomenal, and customization is other worldly. Playing this game was an experience I’ll never forget.

1623730,Palworld,"Grab this game! Let me put it this way, if Nintendo knew what they were doing and listened to people other than themselves, they'd be releasing the 5th version of this game by now, and they still wouldn't come close to something so full featured.

This is a survival craft, automation, monster hunting, creature taming, 3rd person shooter, RPG. It can be played single player, which is a very relaxing to fairly challenging and tense experience depending on how you set up your world. It can also be played in teams of up to 4 on a server of up to 32, though these numbers will be bumper in the future.
With the amount of content this game has right now, January 21st, in an early access release, I can comfortably say most triple a studios should be at the top of your ""ignore and only purchase on sale"" list.

Plus some day this game will allow the steam workshop. You cannot imagine how amazing that will be until you've sunk a dozen or so hours into even it's current state.

Just go buy it. You absolutely won't regret it.


A few cons: at this moment you can't rebind controls. Pal AI has some problems, though I'm certain it'll get better, and building designs are pretty limited, though they're not likely to be that way for long.

1599340,Lost Ark,"The game itself is magnificent. Surely, it may have some mobile like feel and it does have some of the sins of F2P model, but if you play the game, you can instantly feel that it's a product of love by the development team. Fights are mechanically challenging, graphics are stunning, contents are more than enough to keep you occupied and coming back for more.

So why the negative review? Simple. The game is published and serviced by one of the worst companies I've experienced through out my over 2 decades of gaming. Amazon Games Studio.

They have done injustice to the game since pre-launch. Butchered the original version in the name of ""Westernization"". To watch the original director actually complain about what they've done, changing names of characters and applying censorship changes, on an OFFICIAL interview was simply depressing.

Game launches, guess what happens. Server overload and instability every single day. Maintenance, patching, more problems, more down time, rinse and repeat.

Economy already went to complete ruin because despite the numerous warnings against how rampant the game will be with RMT and botters without proper measures in place to deal with it preemptively. Out of 1M concurrent you see, literally 50% are suspected to be bots because according to steam accomplishment, less than 15% of players even reach the end of leveling tutorial, and how inflated the market is is simply ridiculous. When community kept warning AGS about how this will happen, they said ""they will be monitoring closely"". What a joke.

So they finally ""do something"", mass ban wave. They pay news outlets to publish articles that they're banning 1 million bot accounts and they should be praised for working hard to keep the game clean.

State of the game remains the same. Guess what though, thousands of players get caught up in false positive bans but they have no infrastructure to support the appeal process. Hell, they literally closed down call center couple weeks ago after Lost Ark's explosive launch. People get stuck in endless loop of sending ticket and receiving macro response without even getting an answer on why they got banned.

You have people getting perma banned for refunding founders pack PRIOR TO GAME LAUNCH, in many cases, to upgrade to a more expensive packs.
You have people who getting perma banned for trying to break down barrier that takes 15 minutes to break while listening to music.
You have people who getting perma banned for buying skins in Auction House because seller of the skin refunded.
You have people who getting perma banned for receiving mail attachments.

What a complete and utter shitshow. What exacerbated the situation is that initially, Community Managers tried to gather information on the community forum to help the cases get reviewed.
The next day, different CM closes down the topic.
Next day, these topics start getting deleted.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"I have over 6 thousand  hours in this game, so I'd have some ground to stand on when it comes to posting an honest review of this game:

It's a fun game, when you are playing with the right people and don't really care too much about actual game-play. But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out. 

Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game. 

Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning. But, there are so many issues that need to be resolved that Krafton are just not addressing which is why I can't whole heatedly recommend this game.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[b]Is this game, like, multiplayer Skyrim?[/b] No. 

[b]Is this game Skyrim 2?[/b] No.

[b]Can I heal mid-battle by shoving 50 cheese wheels in my mouth and then unpausing?[/b] No. 

[b][i]So what is this game?[/i][/b]
This game is an MMORPG. It has the story elements that are familiar to Elder Scrolls fans, but the format is similar to that of any MMORPG. There is a lot of content you can play solo, but there is also content that can or must be done in groups. 

[b]Story[/b]: Depends on the zone, can range from 4/10 to 11/10. 

[b]Quest Design[/b]: Depends on the quest and on play style. Can be a 9/10 if you're interested in the lore, but if you're more interested in skipping any and all relevant dialogue and just doing tasks, it can get dull. 

[b]Content[/b]: 11/10, I am far-too-many hours in and I have about 30%-40% more content left in the game in terms of quests and areas alone, not including dungeons and trials. 

[b]Graphics[/b]: 9/10, the fantasy style means that the game ages well despite being 2014. 

[b]Difficulty[/b]: 3/10 to 9/10. (Easy to learn, difficult to master.) 

[b]Combat[/b]: 6/10. It's average, nothing too insane but not horrible either. 

[b]UI[/b]: 5/10 in its base form, but can be raised much higher with addons on PC. 

[b]Price[/b]: Low. It goes on sale often, and if you get the non-upgrade edition of the newest expansion (Greymoor at the time of this writing), you get all of the past major DLCs as well, so you don't need to play catch-up. Unlike what others may claim, [i]subscription is not required[/i]. You can get the subscription if you want to try out the DLC or if you are a hard-core player or interested in doing major crafting. However, if you are just a casual once-in-a-while player, there is no need to buy the subscription. This also means that if you are about to have a busy time irl, you can pause your subscription without being locked out of the game if you still want to plat occasionally but not enough to warrant it.

Yes, there are crown crates and a crown store and stuff that does cost real money in most cases. No, you can't collect everything in the game, even if you toss a Jeff Bezos salary at it. And that's part of the beauty of it -- no two people have the exact same stuff. Besides, all of the things that people cry are super expensive or in the crown crates? [b][i]It's all cosmetic!!![/i][/b] I really don't see why people are losing their ***es over it when they're the ones willingly paying stupid amounts of money for minor cosmetic changes. 

You can play the game 100% without ever needing to get anything from the crown store or paying any more for it. This ain't World of Warcraft, people,

374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"It finally clicked. Now I get why the Dark Souls series has such an active, enthusiastic, and [i]borderline[/i] [b]obsessed[/b] community. Although I was hesitant to start [b]Dark Souls 3[/b], I can now say that it is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have had. 
 
[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*]Absolutely gorgeous. It was clear that a lot of thought and effort was put into designing Dark Souls 3. Each area uniquely beautiful and expertly put together; the attention to detail creates a truly immersive experience. I especially enjoyed how spectacular the scenery and menacing the bosses are. 
[*]The developers did a great job at incorporating shortcuts. Since the areas are quite large, you often get disoriented as you progress (especially during the first playthrough). At a certain point, you come across unlockable door(s) or elevator(s) that connects to a previous area and acts as a shortcut. The sudden realization that you went around in one big circle or that you’re directly above/below a previous area always left me baffled. I really wonder how much time was put into the level design. 
[*]Amazing combat. Honestly, I’ve barely skimmed the surface when it comes to combat but it is enough for me to recognize how incredible it is. There are so many weapons, movesets, spells, infusions, and more. Plus the combinations you can put together are only limited by your imagination (for the most part). There is a reason why several people spend hours putting together the perfect PVP character(s).
[*]Exploration is greatly rewarded. Seriously, there are items, NPCs, and interesting rooms hidden everywhere. It’s gotten so bad that I feel paranoid when I reach a pointless dead end and find nothing - “there HAS to be something here”. Finding a secret felt like finding candy on a scavenger hunt and was thrilling from beginning to end. Keep a look out for fake walls, suspicious ledges, potential jumps, and chests. [i]Beware of mimics though.[/i]
[*]I really liked the decision to grant the ability to teleport between lit bonfires almost immediately, and to include a safe hub (Firelink Shrine), where most of the important NPCs/vendors can be found. This made Dark Souls 3 more user-friendly (especially for beginners) than Dark Souls 1. Although this made Dark Souls 3 more linnear, I found the clarity of knowing more or less what to do and where to go (also being able to teleport back in case you went the “wrong” way) more enjoyable than the uncertainty I felt when playing the first Dark Souls. 
[*]For those who don’t know, inter-player interactions play a large role in the Dark Souls series. You can leave notes (to either help or trick others), you can summon other players for a co-op experience, and you can invade other people’s worlds for PVP. I think this is another reason why the Dark Souls community holds strong - despite being portrayed as a single player game, you are rarely alone. I found that the online features (co-op and PVP) worked very well most of the time. Naturally, there are some instances of lag or disconnection, but it is very easy to set up again. Initially I hated being invaded, but I’ve learned to love it for two reasons: 
[olist]
[*]The excitement/fear you get from being invaded is intense. It is like a sudden emergence of a mini-boss whose only purpose is to hunt you down. While the defeats are definitely sour, victories are so damn sweet. 
[*]All the pain you receive from getting invaded can be repaid by invading other people. It’s a sort of S&M relationship, I know, but it adds near-infinite extra hours of excitement and replayability to Dark Souls 3.
[/olist]
[/list]
 
[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*]I’m kind of torn about this following point. On one hand, I still find that Dark Souls 3 is not very beginner friendly. More specifically, I had to look up some basic guides before starting the game to understand which stats do what, and what sort of build I should go for. A lot of information, for example stat soft-caps, is not particularly clear to begin with. I find that this steep learning curve, in addition to Dark Souls’ notoriety for being difficult, pushes a lot of beginners away. On the other hand, the Dark Souls series has come a long way, 3 being the most user-friendly and clear game in my experience. After playing it, I realized that I could have easily learned how to build my character through a little trial and error. Granted, my character would not be perfect, but like many veterans say: “no point in Vigor is wasted”. Dark Souls is the kind of game that expects you to pour countless hours in to before you “git gud”, such that a veteran with awful equipment will almost always beat a beginner with God-tier equipment. It should be emphasized that [b]YOU ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE MISTAKES[/b]; the complexity of Dark Souls 3 is exactly what makes it so spectacular. 
I was honestly hesitant to begin playing Dark Souls 3, but it has quickly become one of the greatest gaming experiences I’ve ever had. If you are on the fence, I urge you to give Dark Souls 3 a try. Be patient, learn from your mistakes, and don’t give up - only then will you prosper and praise the sun. 
NOTE: I’m not complaining about combat/mechanics difficulty - while challenging, I honestly believe that the death/learn-from-your-mistakes system is the number one selling point of the whole series.

236390,War Thunder,"[h1] As someone with almost 1600 hours on this ""game"", don't waste your time on this game with a ridiculous grind. [/h1]


[h1] Basic explanation of the in game economy [/h1]
This ""game"", like many other free to play titles features an in game economy which includes a non premium ""Silver Lions"" and a premium (bought with real life money) ""Golden Eagles"" currency. These currencies are used to purchase in game vehicles and various other items, with the latter ""Golden Eagles"" currency used to by premium content which lets you speed up the grinding of new vehicles.

[b] While this all looks fine on paper, Gaijin, the creator of this ""game"", have been abusing economy for years now to milk as much money from its playerbase as possible. This is done by making the grind extremely difficult (especially at the stages with more modern vehicles) for players that have not spent any money on the ""game"". This difficulty then puts pressure on the free-to-play player base to spend money. [/b]

[h1] And its only been getting worse. [/h1]

Very recently, Gaijin has released a patch that changed the economy and balancing of the game. These changes have made it even more difficult by forcing players to grind more vehicles (a good portion of which are often not fun to use) to reach the ones they are interested in playing. Another cruel change is the increase of repair costs, which is an amount of ""Silver Lions"" you need to pay in order to repair your vehicles and use them again after dying in them. This increase in cost means players have to earn more ""Silver Lions"" from their battles on average in order to profit, making the grind even less sustainable for free-to-play players.

[h1] In fact, a staff member on the official WarThunder forum even stated that the grind was only designed to be profitable with premium vehicles/content. [/h1]


[h1] TLDR; The devs have, and will continue to ruin the game by being greedy and making as much money as possible off of the player base, do NOT play this garbage, it is NOT worth the time investment.

230410,Warframe,"[h1] Not pay to win [/h1]
Before I start my review, I want to dispell this notion. Anyone who tells you this game is pay to win is wrong, or lying to you. Most of the good weapons are mastery rank locked and even if you buy things to bypass the grind, you still have to level those Warframes and weapons, you still have to play the game to grind and get mods for your weapons and Warframes to make them actually perform well in end-game content. You're blindsiding yourself if you're going to make the argument that this game is pay to win. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's get to the actual review.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
I had to start off by reviewing the graphical quality of this game, because it's [i] so beautiful. [/i] Everything is well polished and good-looking, the appearance of Warframe will not hesitate to immerse you into the environment. On top of that, graphically the game is extremely well optimized compared to other games, and can run on many older computers without an issue. There is no section of the game that is forgotten about in regards to visuals. Clearly, a lot of love has been put into this game and you can tell that immediately just by looking at how beautiful and immersive the game is.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Warframe's content and gameplay are some of the best for any free-to-play game out there. Everything in Warframe is available without paying if you are willing to grind for it. One of the best freemium models out there, seriously. You can earn Platinum, the premium currency, in-game without ever spending a cent on it. As for the Warframes themselves, each one is unique, and there are over 35 of them. 35! That's a lot of different characters to choose from. Each of them has 4 unique abilities that do different things, and you can typically mod a Warframe 3 different ways or more to focus on a specific part of their ability kit. That is a fantastic amount of customization and one of the things I love most about the game. I will say that the star chart content can get a bit repetitive at times, but if you stick it out, fill out your star chart, and get into high level content, it'll feel less repetitive in due time. At higher levels the combat gets much more complex. Try staying for at least an hour in a survival mission if you decide to play, and you'll see what I mean.

[h1] Cosmetics [/h1]
I had to talk about the cosmetics in Warframe because let's face it- fashion, looking good and uniqueness are important aspects of any videogame. Warframe has a ton of cosmetics, and they're all extremely beautiful and wonderful. Once you get through all the star chart content, you may find yourself grinding for Platinum to purchase a new set of clothes- or outright buying it with real money, I won't judge you for it. In fact, some of the best cosmetics in the game can only be purchased with real money- the TennoGen cosmetics are handsomely crafted with love by individual creators, and your money goes back to those creators, supporting them and allowing them to make more wonderful content for the game.

[h1] Grinding [/h1]
I'll flesh out my review by saying this. If you don't like grinding or MMO-type games, Warframe probably isn't for you. I would still give it a go even if you don't like those types of games, but you're probably not going to enjoy it if you aren't a patient person. Grinding is the name of the game in Warframe, and RNG affects many activities in the game. If you don't like the fact that you aren't guaranteed certain things and have to wait for warframes and weapons to finish building before you can use them, or that you have to farm resources to build them, then you probably won't enjoy the game. Still, if you invest your time into the grind, you can acquire nearly anything you want for no cost at all.

[h1] Updates [/h1]
One great thing about Warframe is that they are constantly updating the game and delivering new content to us. Year round, we get new Warframes, quests, and content, albeit they can be buggy at the start. We received Sanctuary Onslaught, a new gamemode, and The Sacrifice, a new quest, earlier this year, and we're getting Fortuna, an open-world area on Venus later this year. That's a lot of content for one year! While it's not always the best and most optimized content, I see more love poured into Warframe content than that of any other game at the current time. The devs maintain a strong relationship with the community and actively ask questions to the players about what they want to see and what they want changed, and do frequent livestreams for fun and for discussing where they are in terms of development with the game. Their strong community commitment is one of the great things that many people love about Warframe- DE's transparency and willingness to maintain a strong bond with us is something that not many other game companies can brag about.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
So, if you read my entire thing and some of my points sparked your interest, I would definitely reccommend giving the game a go. I have loved every second I've played of Warframe and I can honestly say it's one of the only games whose future updates I'm currently excited for. There are no downsides to trying the game out- after all, it's free to play and if you don't like the grind then you can stop at any time and uninstall the game.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"--Update--
I have found Super Credits during Mission at Quantities of 10x.

--Review as of 1.8 hrs on 08FEB24--
I cannot speak to any crashing issues, because I have not crashed.
I cannot speak to any performance issues, because it runs flawlessly on my rig.
I cannot speak to any Multiplayer or Cross Platform just yet because I have not used it yet. 
Single player is possible for easier difficulties so far.

I thought I was going to be disappointed by this game (especially after reading the reviews), I was wrong.  It is exactly what I wanted. For me, this game feels good and is a good successor to the original game. Game play loop is strong so far.

***The ""Store"" and 'Premium Currency'.***  
BLUF: All material is available if you play the game without need of spending actual money.

I have to speak the truth on this because there are comments that do not understand what has been employed.  

First, there are a couple of things to note first:
-You have EXP (normal progression), Requisition Points (for unlocking Stratagems), Samples (different rarities for unlocking Ship Modules), and Warbonds (for unlocking weapons, cosmetics, etc.).
-All of the above resources are given for mission completion at a pace commiserate with difficulty of mission performed or found on mission. 
-There is what appears to be a seasonal progression type system with 10-steps and ~8-unlocks per step.  You have to buy the entire step of weapon and cosmetics before progressing to the next step. ...and then a premium section (I will get to this).

YES, there is Premium Currency, ""Super Credits"" that you can spend real money on. 
HOWEVER, My observations:
-If you progress through the 10-steps you unlock 10x batches of 100x ""Super Credits"" each. (Total 1000x)
-There is a Premium Season that costs 1000x Super Credits. 
-Once admission is paid you can spend WARBONDS for the normal unlock process on the Premium stuff. Essentially a competing/secondary use for Warbonds.
-Also, Super Credits can be spent on the ""Super Store"" to unlock Cosmetics. (Currently only 4 things are available)

THEREFORE, you can buy Super Credits to get access to unlocking the Premium stuff if you want, or you can play the game and earn access then unlock as normal.  I think of it more like the 'End Game Material'.","Mostly Positive75% of the 62,617 user reviews for this game are positive.",found super credit mission quantity 10x 1 8 hr 08feb24 cannot_speak crashing issue not_crashed cannot_speak performance issue run flawlessly rig cannot_speak multiplayer cross platform not_used single possible easier difficulty far thought disappointed especially reading review wrong exactly wanted feel good good successor original game_emphasized loop strong far store premium currency bluf material available spending actual speak truth comment not_understand employed couple thing note exp normal progression requisition point unlocking stratagem sample different rarity unlocking ship module warbonds unlocking weapon cosmetic resource given mission completion pace commiserate difficulty mission performed found mission appears seasonal progression type 10 step 8 unlocks per entire weapon cosmetic progressing next premium section yes premium currency super credit spend real observation progress 10 step unlock 10x batch 100x super credit total 1000x premium season cost 1000x super credit admission paid spend warbonds normal unlock process premium stuff essentially competing secondary warbonds super credit spent super store unlock cosmetic currently 4 thing available super credit access unlocking premium stuff earn access unlock normal material

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"First and foremost I am a solo player. I am just going to compare this to WoW and my personal preferences as a solo player. This game seems to be a better fit for me than WoW.

I enjoy the leveling process in WoW, but lose interest fast once I hit max level. I am simply not interested in raiding, playing in groups, or PvP. I like being able to walk away from the game or take a break at any time. In WoW the quests are pretty boring, they're primarily text, etc. Your character just really cannot become more powerful playing solo past a certain point. However, I have a pattern of re-subbing WoW every time an expansion comes out and quitting shortly after hitting max level.

Now I am giving ESO a go and I've been enjoying it a lot. Why? The quests are amazing. It's fully voiced over which means I am actually engaged and paying attention to what's going on (all I did was skip the dialog in WoW). The quests are far more detailed when it comes to the story behind them, the tasks, the environments, etc. It's so much more than the zillion fetch quests or kill X monsters quests in WoW. The main story quests in WoW were good, but that's it. The rest of them are not. In ESO there is just no end to high quality engaging quests. I opted for ESO plus as well which opens up a million more. I'm only level 19 after 71 hours and having a great time.

I prefer the combat in ESO. It's simpler. I'm OK but was never really good at WoW. Just OK. ESO lets me keep it as simple as possible. I run 1 bar of 5 skills; that's it. The combat is less twitchy, but still very reactive in nature. You have to block, roll, interrupt caster, and use your 5 abilities, but it's just way simpler. Those basic functions of rolling, blocking, and interrupting are way more intuitive in ESO in my opinion because you're using your movement keys and attack keys to do it; not a special ability. The monsters in ESO are easier to ""read"" compared to WoW. In WoW you really need to sort of memorize different types of attacks, abilities, etc. to know how to avoid or counter them. In ESO there is a target on the ground to avoid, it's always the same interrupt, always the same roll, etc. It's been easy to manage for me as an OK player and, honestly, more fun for me. I don't feel like I suck. I also feel like ""meta"" probably matters less in ESO and small mistakes don't really ruin anything. I might be wrong because I am still new, but that is the feeling I am getting.

Anyway, that's me! Solo player, just OK or decent at playing MMOs in general, needs voiced over content to keep me engaged, etc. I am really liking it and definitely recommend it. Hopefully this helps someone with a similar preference or background make a decision.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",foremost solo compare wow personal preference solo fit wow enjoy leveling process wow lose interest fast max simply not_interested raiding group pvp able walk break wow quest pretty boring primarily text cannot_become powerful solo past certain pattern subbing wow expansion come quitting shortly hitting max giving eso enjoying quest amazing fully voiced mean engaged paying attention skip dialog wow quest far detailed come task environment s_emphasizedo zillion fetch quest kill x monster quest wow quest wow good rest not_in eso no_end high quality engaging quest opted eso plus open million 19 71 hour great prefer combat eso s_emphasizedimpler ok never_really good wow ok eso let simple possible 1 bar 5 skill combat twitchy reactive nature block roll interrupt caster 5 ability simpler basic function rolling blocking interrupting intuitive eso opinion movement key attack key not_a special monster eso easier read compared wow wow sort memorize different type attack ability avoid counter eso target ground avoid interrupt roll easy manage ok honestly fun suck meta probably matter eso small mistake ruin wrong feeling anyway solo ok decent mmos general need voiced engaged liking definitely recommend hopefully help someone similar preference background decision

WIP

[h1] Old 'happy' Early Access Review: [/h1]

They wrote ""SWAT 5"" wrong.

Seriously, though; the game is sick!
It is made to be highly replayable and punishing.

It has all the great things late SWAT titles had plus ergonomics simulation.

Pros:
Punishing.
Made to be as realistic as possible.
Weapon sounds are the BEST around, I'd risk saying.
More features coming on top of what we encountered over previous games.
Hostile AI is a challenge. (harder the better, without escaping from realistic)
Maps are well made.
Outstanding lighting techniques on graphics.
AMD FSR to keep your GPU happy and cold.


Downsides:
Graphical glitches.
AI glitches.
Limited content as in early access.
Weapon customization design makes it impossible to have flashlight and laser at the same time. (Escape from Tarkov still is king on weapon attachments).


Notes: RON doesn't compare to Ground Branch. If you have one, the other one will add a lot as they overlap each other very little.

PLEASE, DEVELOPER: Don't make this game focused on PVP. Single player and Co-Op is where the longevity is. Keep it as replayable and creative challenging as possible. Update the AI and keep that content coming...","Very Positive88% of the 127,116 user reviews for this game are positive.",1 0 wip old happy early access wrote swat 5 wrong seriously sick highly replayable punishing great thing late swat title plus ergonomics simulation pro punishing realistic possible weapon sound best risk saying feature coming top encountered previous game hostile ai challenge harder escaping realistic map outstanding lighting technique graphic amd fsr gpu happy cold downside graphical glitch ai glitch limited early access weapon customization design make impossible flashlight laser escape tarkov king weapon attachment note ron compare ground branch add overlap please developer focused pvp single co overpowered longevity replayable creative challenging possible ai coming

1721470,Poppy Playtime,"Paid $5 for this months ago before finding out the devs are pieces of crap (stole the idea form a 15 year old and then threatened them when they tried to speak about it) and greedy (turned the whole game into just an NFT ploy, even advertise them on menu in game). Since then I refused to play it and support people like that, now i saw today that the game that everyone paid $5 for people is now free and the second chapter costs another $10, which is possibly the worst monetization scheme I have seen in gaming so far (I'm sure EA will adopt it soon at this point).

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"I've always asked myself, how can people play a game for 1000+ hours and then give it a thumbs down? 

Then I played PUBG.

The European servers are in tatters, ruined by cheaters. I log in to 4 or 5 new perm-ban reports each session, but nothing changes. Cheats are readily available and are pre-installed in internet cafes in many parts of the world. Hit the death cam to spectate a HUYATV or DOUYUTV account and watch them 6x spray you with an AK from 100 yards, every shot hitting you in the head.

And it's not, GET GUD or REKT M8 - it's just sad. It takes all of the fun out of the game. I've played for over 1000 hours, I've paid for season passes and I've been promised changes and improvements - it just isn't happening. The devs don't care about about their player base and they don't listen to feedback.

PUBG still offers something other BR games don't and this is the game I want to play. When this game is good, it's probably one of my favourite games ever - certainly the game I've played the most.

I can put up with bugs, I can put up with poor geometry and I can put up with not being the best player at this game. But I can't put up with cheats.

Don't REGION LOCK CHINA, build a better cheat engine. I will happily play against anyone from anywhere in the world, but I don't want to play against cheaters.

It makes me incredibly sad to have to give this game a thumbs down.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I'll keep this really quick. If you can get this game on sale and you already enjoy Assassin's Creed games, then this one is an easy buy. 

BUT, this game isn't the best in the series, and after 150 hours of playing, I can safely say it varies between fun and frustrating in equal measure. The top reason is that it's not REALLY a stealth game, and not entirely an AC game. It's more of a viking game with AC elements. 

Honestly, as a fan of the series, it really felt like Ubisoft gave up on any sort of 'modern era' plot that they'd been going for after Desmond Miles' death. Layla is a character I hated and thankfully we didn't have to spend much time with her in this game, but I was shocked at exactly how little time or effort is spent tying this game to other games with the modern era cast. 

As for world inside ""the Animus"", male Eivor is definitely the way to go, the voice actor is amazing. But the story is really most a long series of short stories around this character and his alliance building throughout England. Very little time is spent with series staples like the Assassins and Templars, (which in this game are still ""The Hidden Ones"" and the ""Order of the Ancients""), Eivor really isn't part of either faction, and the DLC's expand on the ISU lore mostly through the trappings of a fantasy lens filter. Most quests went fairly smoothly, except for the ones where i forced to do one of the mini-games, (like drinking game or dice game) as part of a main mission, which is a type of filler I despite. It only happened a few times, but I hate being forced to play a mini-game I don't like as a MSQ requirement. 

Overall, I found the gameplay mostly fun, the stealth kind of frustrating since it's cutting and borrowing from dissimilar systems from previous games, and the ending was very dissatisfying.  But, many of the short stories, their characters, the world exploration, and the combat was fairly fun, which is what you'll spend a lot of time doing. It's just that you'll ask yourself 'why' when you hit the end. 

I didn't finish every DLC out of fatigue, but I did finish the core game, hunting all the Order members, and everything but the end of Ragnarok. Customizing Eivor with hair, beards, tattoos, and a lot of different gear was always fun until I landed on what I felt was my 'canon' look. That was a big step up from previous games. But a big step down was that the ending seemed to put the series' fate in the hands of the villain. I'm not wild about that. 

Overall, fairly fun to play if you're aiming for axe wielding combat. If you're more of a stealthy player, this game can be frustrating for how it shoe-horns in things like half-a$%ed social stealth or a distracting cloak that feels more like a bother than a boon.  

However, the game is gorgeous, there are a ton of locations, some fun playstyles and gearing options, and a few genuinely fun stories. The negatives of the game are well-documented and true, which is why this game is a good bet if it's on a good sale, but otherwise, very skippable in this series.","Mostly Positive71% of the 17,395 user reviews for this game are positive.",quick sale already enjoy assassin creed game easy t_emphasizedhe best series 150 hour safely varies fun frustrating equal measure top not_really stealth not_entirely ac viking ac element honestly fan series ubisoft gave sort modern era plot desmond mile death layla hated thankfully spend shocked exactly effort spent tying game modern era cast world inside animus male eivor definitely voice actor amazing long series short story alliance building throughout england spent series staple assassin templar hidden one order ancient eivor faction dlc expand isu lore mostly trapping fantasy lens filter quest fairly smoothly except one forced mini game drinking dice mission type filler despite happened time hate forced mini msq requirement found mostly fun stealth kind frustrating cutting borrowing dissimilar system previous game ending dissatisfying short story character world exploration combat fairly fun spend ask finish dlc fatigue finish core hunting order member ragnarok customizing eivor hair beard tattoo different gear fun landed canon look big previous game big ending series fate hand villain not_wild fairly fun aiming axe wielding combat stealthy frustrating shoe horn thing half ed social stealth distracting cloak feel bother boon gorgeous ton location fun playstyles gearing option genuinely fun story negative documented true good bet good sale otherwise skippable series

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"[h1]5/24/23 EDIT - THE FINAL STRAW[/h1]
Lava and his echo chamber of a community have been writing off legitimate complaints being written at this time as ""people are just whining because they got caught"": https://imgur.com/2g6JMyX As if what happened yesterday isn't a PERFECT, SHINING example of everything that Lava deserves criticism for.

[u]What happened:[/u]
[olist]
[*]Yesterday, this NPC offered more gold bars in exchange for gold bars (effectively an infinite gold bug): https://imgur.com/8QHNFZz
[*]This bug was predicted to happen by a third-party tool and was spoken about multiple times in the official Discord: https://imgur.com/CO7EYyL
[*]The main problem was that if someone went high enough AND had a very late-game, specific Artifact, they would be able to influence other areas of the game such as Sampling, Atoms, Alchemy. And then, if they went TOO high with the gold bars, the numbers would break.
[*]Some samples of things Lava said after waking up: https://imgur.com/a/4uVxA6Y
[*]After Lava confirmed that accounts would be ""severely reset"" and people would be ""put in their place"" for interacting with this bug ( https://imgur.com/a/MzFIqyr ), he goes on to reset progress for anyone he decided met the cutoff for being an ""exploiter."" Note: players who started with more gold bars would be able to click WAY fewer times to get into w/e the arbitrary ""exploiter range"" was.

[*]He did the same thing for everyone, which meant that some late-game players got their progress SEVERELY set back, while exploiters newer to W5 actually got buffs to some things (I am in this camp). He not only reset sailing progress for everyone (including eldritch artifacts), he reset Atoms, Alchemy, Sampling, and probably other things that I don't know about. He was dishonest in what he actually reset: https://imgur.com/a/88nYTo3
[*]For non-players, gold bars are NOT the main currency of Idleon. They are materials that are largely isolated to the Sailing skill. If you aren't a late-game player, you could not have gotten any meaningful gains with infinite gold bars unless you had also purchased Bottled Winds (instant AFK time) from the premium shop, which some people definitely did.
[*]Lava has let slide MULTIPLE other exploits that are now treated as ""you should have been there when it mattered,"" which have resulted in LITERAL YEARS of progress for other players. NOTHING was done to remedy, which is a pretty clear message to players to ""get it while the gettin's good."" Why was this situation different? Lava makes a lot of money by resetting progress.
[*]This game has a longstanding history of making players ask the question: ""is this intended or not?"" Lava prides himself on being ""troll"" and this is a huge part of the actual game.
[*]This game is not an MMO in a way that actually matters. there is no player economy. no one can trade with each other. there is no PvP, there is no ranking system, and the party dungeons are isolated from any outside gains. it is effectively a single player game. So why the harsh, vindictive punishment and language?
[/list]

[u]On ""exploiting"":[/u]
[list]
[*]People are saying ""Lava has to punish people."" What? Lava's role is not to ""discipline"" his playerbase. That's insane. A normal response would be ""Whoops, there's a bug, sorry about that, fix will be out soon."" NOT ""you all are at fault for exploiting it"" and whatever the fuck this is: https://imgur.com/a/nRjQOOi What kind of dev talks to their playerbase like this?
[*]The exploit that happened is also not some obscure thing that the average player would never know about. It's not ""press this sequence of buttons and clip through the floor, crouch, ragdoll into the wall."" No. It's right there in the interface of the game. It asks you to trade with it. It requires no cheats, no third-party tools, no extra knowledge.
[*]""But you should have [i]morals[/i], you should be a [i]good[/i] player and not do something so OBVIOUS"" Lava and I are not friends. I have no obligation to him. HE, however, the creator of this game that people have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on, has an obligation to deliver a clean product.
[/list]

Lava has successfully cultivated a community of the most toxic players I have ever experienced. He constantly pushes an ""us vs. them"" mentality about whatever thing he arbitrarily decided he is mad about that day. Him and his community are perfect for each other. They protect Lava like he's some poor, sad, rescue mutt that has tried to eat your niece like ""pleaseee things are soooo hard for him right now"" HE'S AN ADULT who can make his own choices. Own up to your mistakes or hire a team instead of trying to pick and choose what you want to experience as a solo dev.

You may be wondering why I leave the comments open if all of the above is true. I want you all to see for yourselves what having a parasocial relationship with Lava does to you. 

To any reasonable people reading, let this be a sign to leave this game. Something like this WILL happen again. You don't have to be around for it. Nothing about this game is actually fun anymore - it all died long ago. I'm uninstalling for good, and I won't miss it.


[h1]Original Review:[/h1]
I only started playing because a close friend advertised it to me as a game with a solo developer who is super cool and often interacts with the playerbase. When I first started in April 2021, I definitely got this impression. I tuned into the dev streams and even watched as he made an improvement I suggested. I even spent money on it, and I very rarely engage with the microtransactions in ANY game. 

Since then, it seems like I've only been disappointed.

[h1]What I dislike about the game:[/h1]
[list]
[*] That you HAVE to be connected to the Discord to receive any useful details about updates, explanations on how a particular skill works, gameplay issues, etc. No one would otherwise know what all of the utterly inscrutable language in the in-game text even means. The dev's descriptions of things are largely unhelpful, the UI can be very unintuitive (where tf do I click for things?), and more.
[*] Some parts are just not idle. You get hundreds of times more gains playing ""actively"" (leaving the game on in the background) than by actually idling. Some things ask you to check every 20 minutes. Another feature gives you the most returns if you check every 2 minutes (though not explicitly). That's nuts. 
[*] For a game that LOOKS like it would be pretty easy to run on even the cheapest setup, it is so poorly optimized that it makes my laptop (which can generally run most things I throw at it) scream bloody murder. What the hell is this game doing that is making the fans go insane?
[/list]

[h1]What I dislike about the developer:[/h1]
[list]
[*] He does not care about bug fixing, only about creating new content. Some bugs that are still there have been there from the start. 
[*] He says his game is not pay-to-win per his values, but every single update he comes out with also comes with a host of new microtransactions that would literally, LITERALLY, take free-to-play players MONTHS TO YEARS of playing to acquire without gems. Some purchases are literally buying stats. 
[*] So much of the game is ""create the problem, sell the solution"" on the dev's part. He often advertises new updates by saying ""good news! with this new thing, you can play the game LESS!""
[*] He moderates the Idleon subreddit and any negative posts about the game get removed.
[/list]

I think the saddest thing for me is to see beloved members of the community either get banned or leave. I can't tell you how many times I've searched up a well-made guide someone posted just to find out that the person is no longer in the Discord or no longer plays the game. The dev apparently also deletes any evidence of his own toxic behavior.

Before this it had been many years since playing ANY games. So, I am floored by this game. To me its amazing. Now I set the combat at an easy level and I bumble around in here and am in no hurry. I explore around sometimes doing nothing but looking around. I have gone through a fair amount of the story line - again - its all amazing to me. In short I love it. I now am branching to more games, as I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time. I love the characters of this game, the visuals of it, and have no complaints. Occasionally I run across a very minor glitch of getting stuck or something, but this does not bother me. I do not expect perfection. But I want to emphasize this is very rare.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I have nearly 4,000 hours in this game. Team17 recently bought this game and is wholly incompetent with updating this game. There are 6 major issues.

1) Recent updates didn't fix any major outstanding bugs, and instead added new ones like a double reload animation on bolt rifles, XP not being awarded for duplicate actions, and several others. 

2)They released the British faction with historically inauthentic British uniforms, incorrect dates on loading screens, and incorrectly themed weapons like naval SMG's for infantry units and ww1 bolt rifles / machine gun during a ww2 themed game.

3) Not only was this faction historically inaccurate, but it was unbalanced in the negative. Their guns sway more than existing guns, their guns take up more screen space than existing guns (making it harder to see targets), their weapon spread across classes leaves them outgunned by the Germans, Russians, and Americans. The heavy tank for the British faction is using pre-armor overhaul driving mechanics and it's front armor isn't working properly. In short, the faction is trash. 

4) Most controversially, they increased the run speed for all infantry by 15% which allows infantry to effectively chase down heavy tanks and zigzag across open fields effectively. This change was not asked for and it has ripple effects through the game - Negatively impacting armor, small unit tactics, medic's usefulness, etc. The best part - Black Matter (the previous developers) used to have this 15% increase and in Update 8 they outlined EXACTLY WHY they lowered the run speed in the first place (it was for game balance, pacing, and to prevent zig zagging). Team17 didn't do any homework into the history of the previous developers and why game design decisions were made and instead decided to make a muck of the meta just because. 

5) Team17 also decided to add a new game mode which only can contain 50 players total instead of the 100 players total of every currently existing server. Which means people hosting servers will have to purchase an entire new server simply to host this new game mode. Never mind that the new game mode is antithetical to the premise of hell let loose in the first place and wasn't really asked for by serious players of Hell Let Loose.

6) The icing on the cake was the Devotion to Duty trailer which was so embarrassingly bad they had to take down from their official Youtube account and publicly apologize for. It still exists by PC Gamer channel if you want to look at the pure mediocrity.

This game is going to die and deservedly so.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Back in my high school & college days of the late 1970's and early 80's, I had spent many hundreds of hours, sitting around tables with a bunch of friends, playing paper & pencil Role Playing Games (RPG), like Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).

But I had to give up RPG games as I continued my education and pursued a working career. The time required as a Game Master/scenario designer was just too time consuming and my other worldly responsibilities took priority.

Many years later in 2016, I was invited by a friend to join them playing the grand daddy of all Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG) World of Warcraft (WoW), so I started reading up on MMORPG games.

Little was I prepared for how huge the online communities were in MMORPGs, with MILLIONS of players, creating characters, joining their friends online, & losing themselves in the online worlds of these games.

Nearly all MMORPG have integrated central story lines, continuous character progression, & hundreds (if not thousands) of separate side-quest objectives to play, all without the need of a Game Master, the game developers handle all those time-consuming chores. All players need do is play the game.

At first, I started playing just WoW, but soon I succumbed to the allure of another huge MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (FFXIV: ARR).

As the name implies, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is part of a franchise of numerous Final Fantasy video games. Unlike most of this franchise, which are standalone single player RPGs, the 2002 Final Fantasy XI & 2013 Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn are both MMORPGs.

Contrasting the vintage 2004 WoW game mechanics & graphics to that of the decade newer FFXIV: ARR, there is no real comparison for many new players of which of the two MMO games to play. Between the game’s beautiful graphics, music, & writing, FFXIV: ARR completely immerses players in the expansive world, characters, & story of its mythical land of “Eorzea”.

Within the first months of entry into FFXIV: ARR, I had recruited my wife & many of our friends to play the game as well. It became nearly a nightly ritual to login, form a party of friends in game and take on some quest, dungeon, or trial.

In the next 2 years, even more of our friends would join, helping us form an in-game “Free Company”, together clearing all the game’s original 50th level endgame content. But far from being the proverbial “game over” you would expect, the game developers had spent those years creating even more content, in the form of many add-on patches & full game expansions, like Heavensward, Stormblood, & Shadowbringers.

Although this additional content continued to entertain us, this is where my cautionary tale begins. One must remember that MMO game developers are businesses, with the responsibility of maintaining game servers, in-game support, creating new content, growing their player base, and most of all, making a profit.

No MMORPG are truly free-to-play (F2P) for the reasons stated in the paragraph above. Different MMO game developers use various methods to pay their bills.

Some company’s MMO games are F2P, that are free to download, install, and play, but count on micro-transactions of an in-game store to sell digital character outfits, emotes, pets, & mounts. As long as players continue to buy a sufficient amount of these items, the MMO game will stay afloat.

Other MMO games opt for a Buy-to-Play (B2P) model, where players buy the base game and optionally pay for additional Down Loadable Content (DLC) & game expansions. Once again, the MMO game will only continue online if it stays profitable.

But one of the oldest styles of MMO game monetization is subscription. Where players are required in some MMO games, and optionally in others, to pay a monthly subscription fee, usually $10.00 to $15.00 per player/month, to play that MMO game, or gives players some advantages in-game that makes the game much more fun or advantageous to play.

You might be asking yourself this, “why is he explaining all these different MMO game monetization methods for a review of a single MMO game?” The answer is simple, FFXIV: ARR uses all the above to keep itself profitable. Players buy the base game, pay for all expansions, make real money micro-transactions for in-game items on the “MogStation” store, and MUST pay a monthly subscription in order to play.

So, one day while discussing with a friend our Free Company’s next duty in FFXIV: ARR, they said they were going to take a break from playing and try some other MMO game instead. When I pressed them further for a reason, they admitted that the constant cost of playing FFXIV: ARR was becoming a little too much for the few times a month they got to play it.

A little shocked by this news, I then reviewed my own cost of playing FFXIV: ARR over the last 3 years... Purchasing the game & all expansions for Christine, myself, & gifting some to friends, check… Throw in all those “MogStation” store micro-transactions over the years, yikes… Add in all the monthly subscription fees for us & a few we also gifted, OMG… The total tally for us playing FFXIV: ARR for 3 years was over $5,000.00!

In the final analysis, is FFXIV: ARR fun and worth playing, hell yes! It is a beautifully realized fantasy RPG and fully immersive MMO game experience, full of the standard Final Fantasy swordplay, magic, Chocobos, and sentient crystals, that you can share with family/friends, giving players many hundreds of hours of blissful play. Can it be expensive to play, you bet it can(!), especially if you are not watching your cost closely.

My major take-away for this review of this amazing MMO game follows. Pay ONLY for what you need to play FFXIV: ARR. Buy add-ons items & expansions when you NEED them and not one minute earlier. Subscribe when you & your friends have an abundance of time to play it & let your sub lapse when you do not. These measures should help you save a fair amount of money & enjoy the game even more.

For those of you reading this that might still be hesitant because of the possible cost of playing this MMO game, I have some good news for you! FFXIV: ARR does offer a Free Trial membership with no expiration time, that allows players to create characters of all classes and play a lot of the game up to the 60th level, including the entire Heavensward expansion.

There are quite a few limitations with this Free Trial membership. But, you DO get an awful lot of content included and without having to pay a penny. So much so, I always recommend new FFXIV: ARR players to start with the Free Trial membership at first. Then, if you like what you see, buy it & pay the sub a month at a time.

Even with taking all this into consideration, I do highly recommend players try Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. But, paraphrasing that ""drink"" part of those beer commercials we see on U.S. television, remember to ""play (& pay) responsibly.”","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",high school college day late 1970 early 80 spent hundred hour sitting table bunch friend paper pencil role game role dungeon dragon d_emphasized role game_emphasizeds continued education pursued working career required master scenario designer consuming worldly responsibility took priority year 2016 invited friend join grand daddy massively multiplayer online role game mmorpg world warcraft wow started reading mmorpg game prepared huge online community mmorpgs million player creating character joining friend online losing online world game nearly mmorpg integrated central line continuous progression hundred not_thousands separate side objective master developer handle consuming chore player started wow soon succumbed allure huge mmorpg final fantasy xiv realm reborn ffxiv arr name implies final fantasy xiv realm reborn franchise numerous final fantasy video game unlike franchise standalone single rpgs 2002 final fantasy xi 2013 final fantasy xiv realm reborn mmorpgs contrasting vintage 2004 wow mechanic graphic decade newer ffxiv arr no_real comparison player massively multiplayer online game beautiful graphic music writing ffxiv arr completely immerses player expansive world character mythical land eorzea month entry ffxiv arr recruited wife friend became nearly nightly ritual login form party friend dungeon trial next 2 year friend join helping form company clearing original 50th endgame far proverbial expect developer spent year creating form add patch expansion heavensward stormblood shadowbringers additional continued entertain cautionary tale begin remember massively multiplayer online developer business responsibility maintaining server support creating growing base profit no_mmorpg truly f2p reason stated paragraph different massively multiplayer online developer various method pay bill company massively multiplayer online game f2p download install count micro transaction store digital outfit emotes pet mount long player continue sufficient item massively multiplayer online stay afloat massively multiplayer online game opt b2p model player base optionally pay additional loadable dlc expansion massively multiplayer online continue online stay profitable oldest style massively multiplayer online monetization subscription player required massively multiplayer online game optionally others pay monthly subscription fee usually 10 00 15 00 per massively multiplayer online give player advantage make fun advantageous asking explaining different massively multiplayer online monetization method single massively multiplayer online answer simple ffxiv arr us profitable player base pay expansion real micro transaction item mogstation store pay monthly subscription order discussing friend company next duty ffxiv arr break massively multiplayer online pressed admitted constant cost ffxiv arr time shocked news reviewed cost ffxiv arr last 3 year purchasing expansion christine gifting friend check throw mogstation store micro transaction year yikes add monthly subscription fee gifted omg total tally ffxiv arr 3 year 5 000 00 final analysis ffxiv arr fun worth hell yes beautifully realized fantasy role fully immersive massively multiplayer online standard final fantasy swordplay magic chocobos sentient crystal share family friend giving player hundred hour blissful expensive bet especially not_watching cost closely major amazing massively multiplayer online follows pay ffxiv arr add ons item expansion not_one minute earlier subscribe you_emphasizedr friend abundance sub lapse not_these measure help save fair enjoy reading hesitant possible cost massively multiplayer online good news ffxiv arr offer trial membership no_expiration allows player create character class 60th including entire heavensward expansion limitation trial membership awful included pay penny recommend ffxiv arr player trial membership pay sub taking consideration highly recommend player final fantasy xiv realm reborn paraphrasing drink beer commercial television remember pay responsibly
236390,War Thunder,"I didn't want to leave a negative review, but Gaijin's blatant contempt for their own players has forced my hand.

War Thunder is a game like no other, with a comprehensive damage system, combined arms, and variety of beautifully modeled tanks, aircraft and ships. 

Unfortunately, this ""uniqueness"" has left Gaijin with little real competition over the years. What started off as a ""free to play"" title has over time become less and less free. Gaijin keeps adding nations and vehicles, while at the same time increasing repair costs and lowering RP/SL gain. A premium account isn't enough to comfortably progress anymore, now you also have to buy premium vehicles in every nation.

For the new players reading this, Gaijin has recently admitted that they balance free vehicles around a negative SL income for average players. That means they WANT you to lose money by playing, so you'll be forced to buy a top tier premium vehicle.

This isn't just greedy, it also destroys the matchmaker and the balance of the game. Since you only profit using premium vehicles they often end up being spammed. In battlerating 8.7, more than half the players on each team are in premium tanks. This results in rampant ""one death leaving"". These players only spawn their premium tank and leave when it's destroyed, leaving their team in a bad position. Sometimes the premium is their only tank for the tier, othertimes it's because ""free"" tanks aren't worth the high cost to repair.

Gaijin and their purposefully frustrating economy is ultimately to blame for this. There's so many other issues and scandals I could bring up, like how you can't repair or extinguish flames on your new tank before unlocking ""parts"" and ""FPE"". Gaijin wants you to pay gold to skip the grind for these essential tools.

In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. That might seem hypocritical considering my hours spent in this game, but believe me. It's new players who suffer the most. Gaijin doesn't care about me, you, or the playerbase. Don't make the same mistake as me. Find another game that values your input, and respects your time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit, July 26: 

Much has happened since May and the publishing of this review.

Most importantly, on 13th of June, Gaijin published a roadmap of planned economy changes. 

Most recent roadmap update as of this edit: https://warthunder.com/en/news/8374-roadmap-following-the-roadmap-battle-pass-available-in-simulator-battles-en

This was an unprecedented event, as we have never seen this much transparency from the Devs before.

Despite tempered expecations and a healthy dose of skepticism on the part of myself and many others, the roadmap is actually progressing according to schedule.

One of the key criticisms in my review, that of SL (Silver Lions) has been (largely) adressed, earnings were increased across the board, and repair costs adjusted.

All ground vehicles now have a basic version of Parts and FPE available from the start without needing to unlock the Parts and FPE modifications: basic parts can repair components to partial functionality, while basic FPE is single-use.

Aircraft with countermeasures now start with a basic flare loadout, while mixed / full countermeasure loadouts require unlocking the flare modification.

You no longer have to pay repair cost when teamkilled (finally), and newly purchased premium vehicles now include 15 free backups (extra spawns). 

Backups are a consumable however, and as such it doesn't fully alleviate the ""one death leaving"" issue, as players will quickly spend their 15 backups and continue this behavior after. Gaijin needs to consider making the backup permament.

I don't mean to diminish these changes, they were sorely needed, but there's still a long way to go.

As of today, no changes have been made to RP (Research Point) gain, which is the main cause for slow progression, especially in Ground Forces Mode.

The matchmaking system desperately needs a major overhaul, and battle ratings need to be decompressed. While matchmaking changes are mentioned in the roadmap, it remains to be seen how Gaijin chooses to handle this issue.

All in all, while the changes are positive so far and show a lot of promise going forward, my review will stay unchanged until the roadmap is concluded, and the full effects can be seen.

Lastly I want to thank you all so much for your attention and gracious awards! Thanks to you I have amassed just over 2.5 Million Steam Points! That's mind-boggling, I could've never anticipated this much engagement writing my little review back in May. I apologize for the late update, and let's hope for more good news.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Final Edit: Patch 7 finally made the game playable for me with DLSS frame gen.
Emphasis on ""playable"" - stutters still occur regularly, 1% lows sit about 40% below average FPS, optimization is still poor across the board, but luckily DLSS 3+FG hides those issues enough to make playing an enjoyable experience. Now I can finally play the game! ...months after I bought it

Sparse patches, game still runs terribly on my setup (Win10, 4080, 13700k, 32gb DDR4). I'm sure it's a great game, I adored the first, but this is unplayable performance. YMMV.

Edit: Patch 6 was just released - performance is the same / worse for many players (me included)

Edit 2: Patch 6.5 did not claim any performance changes but I tested anyway. Performance still sucks, details below:

Ultra settings, RT off, ""Quality"" Fidelity FX
Average FPS fluctuates between 50-80
1% lows are 20-30fps lower, sometimes as low at 10-20fps

Ultra Settings RT on, Fidelity FX off
Average FPS ~ 40-50
1% lows often below 30, I've seen them below 10

The game does not perform better even on the lowest settings, it's still a stuttery mess. Some people don't experience this so you might get lucky, you might not.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"It has taken me several years to like and get into Crusader Kings 3. It's a complicated & intriguing game which always left me cold when my ruler died - as your precious realm is split apart by partition.

Recently I found a historical focused youtube series by 'Realm Builder Guy' (I highly recommend) who introduced me to the 'secret' of enjoying Crusader Kings:

[i]You are not there to build & defend a nation (a modern concept). Your role is to further your noble House influence and legacy, to bring stability and prosperity to your lands. CK3 is about Dynasty, not empire.[/i]

When I stopped trying to power-game the system, stopped frantically acquiring territory in a race to make a larger Kingdom, stopped making stress decisions 'out-of-character' for an advantage, the game started to click with me. Instead of jumping in trying to manage an entire Kingdom, I chose a humble English Earl in 1066 and spent 40 years tending to my family, my faith and the needs of my people.  The Pope granted us several Duchies from the heathens in Wales and suddenly we were a Duke. I had rivals, friends and a benign King who I served faithfully. It was completely absorbing.  

So that's my main advice for new players; ignore the huge kingdoms and the Irish tutorial, play someone small and navigate that persons life. Don't sweat your realm splitting up on death, focus on the wider picture of your House glory and the long game becomes much more compelling.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Its a great game with a lot of good stuff to do, although I recommend having friends and not playing solo

But this comes with a warning as well. You will have hours of progress taken from you from other people. People will hunt you down and bully you for literally no reason. The community (mostly) isn't toxic, but it is highly encouraged to hunt other people instead of working on your own profit. Even making an alliance is flawed, as you only get half value on things other members sell. Speaking from experience, you simply have to put up with the fact someone can come along and ruin your day at any time. It's quite unfortunate, some of the best parts of this game are with other crews, but you have to treat others with so much caution that fun interactions are few and far between. If these things are a dealbreaker, then I don't even blame you, and I recommend you either find some friends (preferably skilled ones) or avoid solo at all costs.

Also, you can have public ships, but I wouldn't trust those with my life, outside of arena

Edit: because people seem to be misunderstanding, I have no problem with people focusing more on the pvp than the pve, and targeting other players for profit. What I do have a problem with, however, if often people will just outright assault you, even if its clear you don't have any loot on you, and sink everyone they see for the sake of sinking people. it drives new players away, and just makes it even harder to get people to trust you. The fact that I have to warn new players that you can and will get bullied for literally no reason should be enough of a point, but the fact people still use the ""Its Sea of Thieves not Sea of Friends"" excuse for them not robbing, just murdering for no reason really drives home how some of the playerbase are, and how badly they want to feel in the right for attacking people for no reason.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I was very skeptic to play Final Fantasy XIV at first. Coming from Phantasy Star Online 2 back in 2015, FFXIV looked slow, stiff, and overall not challenging to play. The subscription model made it even harder to justify playing it, as I had always seen monthly subscriptions as a way to milk players' money as much as possible. When I was gifted the game by a friend (there was no free trial back then), I decided to give it a try just to confirm my thoughts. I could not have been more wrong.

Disclaimer: as of writing this, I have around 500 hours of playtime on the standalone version. I've played through two of the first expansions and I'm halfway through Shadowbringers.

As someone who usually ignores stories in video games as they tend to not conform to my standards, I was blown away by how captivating this game's narrative is. It's incredibly refreshing to come across an MMO that not only has a good story, but *knows* it has a good story. FFXIV has no problem throwing you 10 quests in a row where you don't fight a single enemy, because it knows the story alone is enough to keep you interested, and it is absolutely right. Every sentence was crafted to enhance your immersion in the world through character development that goes way beyond what I've come to expect from JRPGs, and story beats that hit you like a truck when you least expect them. If you care in any way about story-driven video games, you cannot miss this game.

The combat, at first, is slow. You'll be pressing the same three buttons over and over for a good couple of hours when you first start this game. While I considered it a problem as an MMO veteran when first starting out, it makes sense as an introduction to non-MMO players, or even people not used to games in general. That said, the game quickly develops on your class' toolkit giving you action after action until you have two hotbars of skills that are all universally useful in the right situations. Some of the more fast-paced classes (Ninja, Astrologian) feel like playing Dance Dance Revolution as a kid, all while dodging whatever the gigantic f*****g monster you're fighting throws at you. I've not yet done end-game raid content, but from what I've seen of my guild mates they expand on this even further.

If you don't play this game, it's completely understandable to be flustered by the payment model. Paying for a game, expansions and a monthly subscription on top of that rings a siren in the ears of any sane consumer, but this is different. Final Fantasy XIV does NOT pull any tricks to keep you subscribed. You get a good game with a huge amount of content and that's *it*. If you play for the story, you can subscribe while there's story content and simply stop paying until the next patch. If you play for raids and end-game content, you can pause your sub once you're tired or feel like playing other games.

Three years ago, a japanese player asked YoshiP (the game's director, Naoki Yoshida) how to stay motivated to keep playing in between patches, when content naturally dries out for a little while. His response was the following:

""It's alright not to play it everyday. Since it's just a game, you can stop forcing yourself if it's hard on you to keep that up. Rather, it'll just pile up unnecessary stress if you limit yourself into playing just that one game since there are so many other games out there. So, do come back and play it to your heart's content when the major patch kicks in, then stop it to play other games before you got burnt out, and then come back for another major patch. This will actually make me happier, and in the end, I think this is the best solution I can answer for keeping your motivation up for the game."" (source: /u/elevenmile on /r/ffxiv)

Reading this response is what made me realize what kind of experience I was paying for. In PSO2, to play end game content you *have* to log in at certain times of the day where such content is available, otherwise you miss out completely. After playing for years I grew resentful of the game because it felt more like a job than an enjoyment for me, yet I couldn't quit because I'd be behind if I did. In Final Fantasy XIV, you're experiencing the world on your own terms. No pressure, no time gated content, no manipulative tricks to keep you subscribed. If you don't feel like playing, just don't. The developers very clearly respect the player's time and it shows in game.

I can't force you to play this game, but I hope my thoughts helped you decide for yourself. Even if you ultimately decide to not play it, I recommend you watch Noclip's FINAL FANTASY XIV Documentary on YouTube. The development cycle of FFXIV and how it went from a financial disaster to SquareEnix's biggest hit is a great story.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"This isn't an unplayable game, it just lacks any personality or soul and is the weakest FC game to date. I have played Far Cry games since the very first game came out of nowhere in 2004 and blew everyone's minds (and graphics cards) but they seem to get further and further from what made the first game so great. 

The game is paint by numbers modern FC in game play and mechanics, they did not majorly evolve game play into anything new or groundbreaking but that isn't my biggest issue. 

For me it is just like they followed a formula and took zero risks and made a game that ticked all boxes at the expense of having anything remotely unique or engaging about it. The characters are mostly forgettable to just plain annoying and I could not get involved or invested in the characters story arc, so I started just skipping dialogue to shut them up. And they never shut up. 

The game is quite easy too and I am not exactly a competitive shooter god but I had to crank up the difficulty and remove enemy outlines otherwise it was so easy it was just beyond boring. However for some reason I could not stop showing enemy outlines, so I basically had unwanted wall hacks the game doesn't need. 

I really liked FC5 even though I expected to hate it, as at least it had some soul and humour to it. But this lacks it all imo. 

The good? Well it looks nice and the world is really pretty too. I really liked the moments where my allies actually STFU for a minute and I could just do my thing and briefly I would feel immersed... but sure enough, they just will not shut up and would shatter any immersion with irritating chatter.

For the ~$20 price it is an incredibly huge and pretty polished game and I may be able to stomach some mindless enemy base clearing moving forward.

899770,Last Epoch,"First things first, i love ARPG's, played Diablo 1,2,3,4 Grim dawn, Torchlight 1,2,3 over 1000 hours in POE. 

TLDR :: Last Epoch is as fun as the best ARPGs I have played. which are D2, POE, and T2. 

Only thing that i find extremely detrimental. online requirement. They have offline characters so this helps a lot. but if you dont have online access for some reason to log in, you cant play at all. THIS i would ask gets changed asap. make offline... truly offline. 

The game itself feels fun, I feel rewarded for playing. I feel rewarded for exploration. I feel suprised and find enjoyment while i go from zone to zone. Quests have rewards that are actually meaningful. (for the most part) Side quests give you actual points and item slots. 

I am admittedly early game, have not reached end game, have not completed a build and have not seen what the game has to offer in full but i am still having fun. I play minion builds most of the time and the game 100% hits on that fantasy. The Necromancer is the class i have played so far and i have built a full minion build that feels powerful yet not over powering. They get what makes minion builds powerful and what weaknesses they need to have. 

Loot
The loot is good. I admit i am still figuring it out but it seems simple enough to understand. I find that unfortunately i dont see many worth picking up as i go though. I see the potential but over all this is one area i feel it can suffer. Item bases are extremely interesting and i find them the most interesting out of most ARGS. They feel purpose built and finding new ones feels rewarding and you are semi excited for finding new ones. This game has loot that actually benefits minion builds VERY well. I feel the unique items are one of the strongest in the genre. As an example i found one that had 4 great affixes that was better than what i had. Also something with Weaver charges... No idea what that did. As i found out though as i killed mobs it would randomly add a new Affix and or buff one it already added. I dont recall an item that ""grew with me"" it made me excited to have it on and very excited to find another one at some point. No idea what the end game looks like but so far so good.

Crafting. 
Crafting is maybe the best ive seen so far in any ARPG. It has the ""crafting item currancy"" like POE has, but instead of the ENTIRE F$#$ing system being random (like POE) LE's crafting is a lot more targeted. you can adjust, empower, add, remove, and much more all specifically targeting what you need on an item. I feel this is the strength of the itemization of LE. Each item can only be upgraded so much so you are encouraged to find new ones, and the amount each item can be crafted seems to be random as well. Can find God tier loot with great crafting potential. Legendary's set and more all appear to have something to do with this i just havent gotten so far. It has A TON OF END GAME POTENTIAL. We shall see when i get there.

Character 
There are classes to chose from, each class has its own play style and skill selection. So no POE freedom of choice here. That said i dont feel this is bad persay. You know what you like to play it is not likely you will want to throw a fireball when summoning a skeleton. Stats are not... obvious though. For example Int does NOT give mana like you might think upon first glance. Attainment does? Odd choice honestly. Each character has 3 subclasses, you can chose one to master granting you a special ability. You can still chose from the first half of each tree in the non mastered subclasses though ( think) So far so good, lots of selections and enough freedom with out it being overwhelming. Skills are given based on points in each class/subclass. No attribute points from leveling though... just from gear i think. Characters are solid but not strong in my opinion. I personally would like to see a little more choice in the skill options in each tree. 

Skills
Skills are one of the most limiting areas. Each character has a handful of skills to chose from. 20 for Necromancer (as of now). You can only have 5 active. Abilities must be actively chosen to remain active. Aka cant summon something then switch it out. This is the down side. The upside is I havent found this an issue. Each skill can be switched out easily and quickly. Find out what you wanna use and no worries if you dont like it. You can just switch it out. The skills are learned by adding points into the character so you are not limiting your skill selection in this way. That said you get 5 skill specializations slots. This is where the LE skills SHINE in my opinion. You like summon skeleton? add it to your skill specialization and customize it even further by leveling it up. each level allows you to slot into its own skill small skill tree.

Graphics and art design.
its a cut above many. The way the story is told allows for some REALLY fun environments and good environmental story telling.  i would say its not D4 levels of sophisticated but its damn close in my view. 

Story
So far its basic enough to follow and still go kill a bunch of stuff. however the story allows for some really neat mechanics. It also allows them to EASILY add more areas and expand upon the game later on. voice acting is good. 

 For now i will gladly continue playing this.  dont know how many may read this, but if you like ARPGS this is easily one of the best ones out in 2023.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Runs great on both PC and Steam Deck (despite not being validated), only one cutscene doesn't work on SD but it is at the very end of the main story. 

I've never played GBF before and i just did know little about this series of games. My friend who played more titles told me it was a close genre of Monster Hunter for Relink and being a HUGE fan of MH i needed to play it ! 
And yes it is. It is not a hunting game per say, but it does the job just fine (esp if you are waiting Wilds like i do).

Story wise it doesn't breaks 3 legs of a duck but it is fine, classical JRPG story, good vs bad and power of friendship and boobas is here to help you go through everything even the end of time. The cast is very diversified with tons of heroes to get to play and also a very refusing to die bad guy who always find a way to bother you.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3158225005

Once you finished the story (bout 15h-20h) you start the farm, for mastery points, weapons and level. The game being well aware of the ars it can be, they added a botting system for the lower level to help players go up to the harder difficulty of the game. (it is not as hard as some games, but if you can't push dodge button you will have troubles).

The game eventually falls into the ''price tag might be too much'' if you are less of a farmer person and more of a ''i want to do the story and be done''. Wait for a sale.
If you think you will play the game and make worth the ''1e/1h'' thing, it will be fine enough as you will easily reach past 60h of farming after the main story.

We already have a road map with 2 new heroes and 1 boss being released soon as another patch being ''surprise'' with more content to do. 
And since the game is based on a already existing franchise, we will surely get more update with heroes and bad guys from past games.

A really good find for me, need to thank my friend for this.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I dont normally review games, but this is not merely any game. It's lightning in a bottle. However, before I get into my review of the game I want to start by clarifying a few points:

1. You might have noticed the abnormally high amount of play time I have accumulated at the time of this review. This can be simply explained by describing the nature of the game. Idleon is an ""idle"" game, which means that most of the game progression is accomplished offline. Despite the offline nature, there is actually a lot to do online; crafting, fighting mobs or bosses, and completing quests are some of the active features a player can enjoy. A player can simply leave his or her character actively fighting mobs while they go get a coffee or read a book, hence the reason many players have boosted hours played when in reality ""active"" play time is probably much lower .If you are familiar with the notorious amount of mobile games in this genre, with their premium currencies and scantly clad female heroines, you might turn your nose away from this game in disgust. But fear not, this game elevates the genre as much as an idle game can be elevated by modern game design.

2. It is in my opinion that the developer of this game does not in any capacity understand the technique of game design. After watching one of the dev streams on twitch an viewing him live code a bug fix, it is apparent that he has little programming experience as well. The code language he uses seems to resemble Scratch code, a block-based coding language, and it is inconceivable to me how he was able to use such a language to create the complex yet beautiful mess that is Idleon (this alludes to my lightning in a bottle theory). His poor naming scheme for variables alone justifies putting him in an institution. Additionally, the complex systems of an idle game, with player progression relying heavily on math (make numbers bigger in various ways), seems to resemble a house of cards that could fall at any minute. Yet, surprisingly, game breaking bugs are far and few between (at least those that affect a large swath of the player base).

3. The attribution of MMO does not quite apply to this game and possibly leads to disappointment and a feeling of being tricked for the average player who has played actual MMOs before and has stumbled upon this game. technically, the game is multiplayer, and technically it is online. There are guilds, and there are dungeons in which players and their friends, or complete strangers, will band together to complete for worthwhile rewards. But in truth, the game stretches the limits of what can be called an MMO. Unfortunately, this review is long enough as it is, so I will refrain from going into any more detail, as this point is not nearly relevant enough to deserve the effort, only noting and moving on.

Now at this point, it must seem absurd that this game could be as successful as it is; I have done very little to give you confidence that one could possibly experience any enjoyment in Idleon. As it so happens, the developer has succeeded in making a game that is simple enough to attract the most casual MMO enthusiast while also implementing a complex enough system to scratch the itch of the most avid min maxer. The best part is that players in between those two ends can enjoy the game as well, because their is no PvP to require more acute balancing. To be more clear, even though the most OCD player will ensure they are progressing at the fastest, most efficient rate, their advantage has no affect on another player's casual attitude toward progression. Each player can progress at a rate comfortable to them without the necessarily feeling a pressure to make the most out of every mechanic of the game to prevent falling behind. While there exists some debate as to whether the game contains ""pay to win"" features, the reality is that it only would be a problem if there was a PvP feature, for without PvP, their is no ""winning"".

Idleon has many things that a idle game enjoyer would look for, and some things that they would not expect. The developer clearly has a passion for his game and listens closely to community feedback. As the game is constantly adding new features such as worlds, items, and quests, you have no worry about hitting a progression ceiling for too long. There is crafting, fighitng, skilling, exploring, bosses, secrets  and more. In the free time you have while your characters are whacking away you can think about the meaning hidden within the game. You watch your characters grow and become stronger and think what it is like to be a little pixel character in a world where all they know is fighting and gathering materials to craft better gear to fight stronger monsters and gather better materials. On and on and on and never a moment of rest. Even while you are asleep they toil away, and in the morning when you wake up and open the game, they are there, waiting for your next command. They can eat food of course, but only to heal their wounds or buff their stats. They cant even choose what to eat. I wonder if they can think, if they aware that they are unable to control their bodies. Do they feel pain? Surely the developer would not give them a conscious. What if we are simply idle game characters whose every movement determined by a ""player""?
