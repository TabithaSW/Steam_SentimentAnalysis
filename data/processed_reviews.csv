553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"This game is awesome and you should play it.  

Pros
* Premium currency system is probably the fairest i've ever seen, earnable in game, either through the base progression system (warbonds) or found randomly in maps. worth noting too that the store armors aren't even remotely expensive, costing the equivalency of 2$ in the premium currency if you bought it
* bug blasting is fun
* If you get bored of bug blastin you can swap to shootin terminators, completeing changing the game
* nice in depth weapon/orbital assistance call in system + different armors+different guns makes loadout styles feel nice and varied
* global progress in the war against bugs make you really feel like your doing your part, liberating .0002% of a planet per mission. Im doing my part! 
*Each mission feels extremely varied due to differenet objectives/map layouts
*Difficulty scales up in a super fun, challenging way (enemies dont scale up in health, but new special enemies are introduced and you'll fight more of them) 

cons:
* glitchy, probably will run into matchmaking problems or the occational crash
* kernal level anticheat, while basically unavoidable these days in half the multiplayer games out there, is still sketchy","Mostly Positive75% of the 62,617 user reviews for this game are positive.",awesome pro premium currency probably fairest earnable base progression warbonds found randomly map worth noting store armor remotely expensive costing equivalency 2 premium currency bought bug blasting fun bored bug blastin swap shootin terminator completeing changing nice depth weapon orbital assistance call different armor different gun make loadout style nice varied global progress war bug liberating 0002 planet per mission im mission feel extremely varied due differenet objective map layout difficulty scale super fun challenging enemy dont scale health special enemy introduced fight con glitchy probably matchmaking problem occational crash kernal anticheat basically unavoidable day half multiplayer game sketchy
553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"I'm very passionate fan of Helldivers 1 despite not having [i]that[/i] much playtime in it across PS and PC, so my review will be just a bit biased, but I'll try to give my honest opinion from what I've personally experienced so far.
Game seems to run quite well at around medium to high settings on my GTX 1080 FE + Ryzen 7 2700x. It seems like performance degrades after playing for an extended period of time or on specific planets with certain conditions. It doesn't look like there is a memory leak when I checked so I assume it's a much trickier problem to fix.
Crashes [i]do[/i] occur during non critical gameplay (menus/hub), your mileage will probably vary.
Edit: after sleeping and playing more, I'm not getting crashes anymore. Still keep in mind that the game [i]may[/i] crash for you but it's less likely now.
Controls feel fine, nothing amazing or notable.
Graphics settings have stupid stuff enabled so make sure you turn it off (such as motion blur)

Actual optimization doesn't seem to be the issue. Ss far as I can tell, it's mainly compatibility. The game is failing to launch at all with certain setups.
So unfortunately my biggest advice is; [u]you will want to test if the game agrees with your computer first[/u] because there is a chance it may not.

Supposedly there is a kernel level anti cheat (same tier as Vanguard level anti cheat). Something to consider, though it doesnt seem to have any impact on the game. Unless you're using Kali Linux or something with Tor browser and a VPN... You probably don't need to care about it.
In any case, the existence of the anti cheat is kinda stupid and they should remove it or move to something more reputable. Should that be a make or break point? Not really. Please voice to the devs that it was probably not a great choice though.

[strike]At the moment of the review (day 1), the game's matchmaking is broken, so keep in mind that you will have to play the game alone, or specifically play with people on your friends list.
Edit: Currently matchmaking is working fine, sounds like it was fixed VERY fast. Crossplay isn't working however so keep in mind that you should disable it until it is fixed and you won't be able to play with anyone on a different platform.
You can probably expect this issue to be fixed after about a week [i]at most.[/i][/strike]
Wow, they actually fixed it very fast. Surprising.

The game has monetization. I got a better look at it recently, so I just rewrote this section entirely to explain what it really is.
From what I could tell, there are 3 pages. A page for buying premium currency, a page for buying items with only premium currency, and banners which act similar to a battle pass. The second page I mentioned has exactly 4 items on sale which seem to change after a day or two. These have almost [i]zero[/i] impact on whether you play better or not. [u]The gear obtained with microtransactions have the exact same stats and passives as gear you can obtain through playing the game, and it's not particularly amazing either.[/u] You'll pretty much just be buying it for cosmetic value. The third page I've mentioned is the main progression for the game. It currently has two banners. The banner for the main game which has 10 pages of progression in it, completely free. Each page will generally give you a set of armor, a weapon, a banner, a little premium currency, and a couple of other random things. You do not have to unlock all of them to proceed to the next page, you only need to have spent a certain amount of in game currency which increases for each banner.
The premium banner has only three pages and the gear seems to be on par with the main banner. You also still need to spend in game currency to progress it I believe. (needs verification) In essence, it's DLC. Something Arrowhead and every other studio has been doing for YEARS. It's not timed, it's not going away, there is zero FOMO. It's DLC but in a slightly different format which has been causing people to panic. It's just DLC, which the last game also had.

At the time of the review, the game is rated mixed, which I expect will balance out to around 70-90% positive once more people test out the game and day 1 issues get fixed.

Can't be that bad of a bad purchase at $40 dollars when other studios are dropping steamy piles for a game at $70. (Lookin' at you Suicide Squad.)
Overall I'd give the game about a 7/10. I think the game will be a major hit or major miss for most people, largely depending on if your hardware agrees with the game or not. The gameplay itself is [i]extremely[/i] fun and challenging depending on your difficulty, with quite a lot of replayability with friends. (You got friends, right?) And hopefully the hiccups here and there that the game has get ironed out pretty quickly with early patches.

I [i]do[/i] care about the game, and want it to be the best it can possibly be. Therefore;
[u]If the game starts to decline in quality after this review, it will certainly be updated to reflect that.[/u]

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"This game is phenomenal. Personally, I enjoyed the first Helldivers game for all that it offered, and I think that this game is a top tier sequel. From the visuals and scenery, to the open exploration, and the unique creature designs, not to mention to destructability of some environments, this game does a lot of things really well. It's worth $40.

That being said, I cannot explain to you how demoralizing it is to play a 40 minute mission with 20/20 samples, 2 side objectives done, and the main quest finished, only to disconnect as we extract and lose all of that progress. And to do that multiple times? F*ck that. That's horsesh*t. I'll be keeping an eye on patch notes, but I can't play a game that is going to waste my time like that.","Mostly Positive75% of the 62,617 user reviews for this game are positive.",phenomenal personally enjoyed helldivers offered top tier sequel visuals scenery open exploration unique creature design not_to mention destructability environment thing worth 40 cannot_explain demoralizing 40 minute mission 20_emphasized sample 2 side objective finished disconnect extract lose progress multiple time f ck that_emphasized horsesh keeping eye patch note waste

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"This game is absolutely [i]riddled[/i] with bugs. 

I hope it stays that way, since I love smiting them down in the name of Democracy. As for actual bugs, yes there are several. Matchmaking problems are frustrating, and I have experienced more than my fair share of crashes. However, Arrowhead has been very transparent about how they are addressing them and are providing frequent updates. Several issues have already been mitigated or resolved within the week.

The devs are doing their part, and I'm doing mine. Extremely fun even with current problems, highly recommended.","Mostly Positive75% of the 62,617 user reviews for this game are positive.",riddled bug hope stay love smiting name democracy actual bug yes matchmaking problem frustrating experienced fair share crash arrowhead transparent addressing providing frequent update issue already mitigated resolved week mine extremely fun problem highly recommended
553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"I absolutely love this game, BUT there are some issues. This is not an attack on the devs or the game, I just feel that it's very important to bring legitimate criticisms to light, despite my love for the game. I want you to be informed on your purchase instead of being disappointed.

1. Anti-Cheat: This can significantly impact performance during gameplay, especially on older CPUs (including those within the minimum and recommended specs). Many have reported problems on a variety of newer cores as well. 

2. General Performance: The game seems to not properly utilize the GPU and as such, pulls a lot from the CPU. Performance is quite spotty. One night, you'll be running at a solid 70-80 fps with very few drops, the next night you'll struggle to get over 45. Sometimes, the game allows for very little room to run extra apps like Discord in the background and it can impact performance of your whole PC significantly. Again, this has been reported by many people on older AND newer cores. Crashes can also be very frequent. For me, reinstalling the game a couple of times fixed many of these issues.

3. Super Credits and Monetization: Now to the microtransaction issue. I have very mixed feelings about how the premium currency is handled in this game. On the one hand, there is NEVER a good reason to include MTX in a PAID game. But on the other hand, it's going to happen regardless and this is one of the least intrusive MTX systems I've seen in recent history. The reason why I'm not fully against it is because you can find Super Credits in most missions in packs of 10, just be sure to check Minor Points of Interest! I have found as much as 50 SC in a single mission (And they're shared with your teammates!), though you can go quite a few missions without seeing any at all. Not only is it present in the missions, it is also available in the FREE and premium Warbonds in packs of 100 or 50. I was initially impressed with the low pricing of the Super Credits store, but recently they added items in the store that can cost as much as 400 SC. That's ~$4 worth of Super Credits for only one item. Further, what pisses me off the most about this is that there are PREMIUM Warbonds that cost 1000 SC. Which brings me to my next point.

4. The Warbond Progression System: The main progression system is through what the game calls ""Warbonds"". Warbonds are a 1-1 replica of Fortnite's current Battle Pass system. You have pages of items that you unlock with Medals that you earn from completing missions. However, you must spend a certain amount of Medals before moving onto the next page of each Warbond. Each page has 8 items each, consisting of one pack of Super Credits (quantity changes depending on the page), one weapon, one suit of armor, one cape, one helmet, one emote, one player card, and one different piece of equipment per page. The problem is, many of the items are not worth spending medals on, yet are required in order to progress to the next page due to the Medal threshold. Good news is that Medals are pretty easy to unlock in mid-high difficilties.

The next problem regarding the Warbond system are the [i]Premium[/i] Warbonds. These are Warbonds that cost Super Credits to access, then Medals to progress through. The current one costs a whopping 1000 SC. It consists of modified versions of basegame weapons, as well as the usual armor set, emote, etc. The weapons are mostly just slightly buffed versions of some of the basegame weapons, but none of them are the best weapons in the game. In fact, most of the Primary and Secondary weapons are very viable throughout the game, they really just feel different in terms of playstyle. You won't have much of an edge over your teammates in terms of weapons if you have the Premium Warbond. The issue I have is mainly the price. While, you can earn SC in the game, you'd have to save every single one in order to make enough to purchase the Premium Warbond. You won't be able to afford any other SC items if you want to earn the current Premium Warbond through playing the game (unless you want to grind for even longer than it already is). Premium Warbonds [b]HAVE TO GO[/b]. Make all of the Warbonds FREE TO ACCESS FROM THE START. Or, make it a progressive system where you unlock the next Warbond after completing one. Having it use Premium Currency significantly hurts the progression system and makes grinding for it a slog. 

Last thing before I move on: There are only 2 Warbonds at the time of writing, so most of what I just said is SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Also, Warbonds are PERMANENT and will not go away when new ones come out (At least, according to the developers).

5. Non-Warbond Progression System: This is something I really enjoy in this game, but still has some problems. There are 2 other forms of progression in the game: Stratagems and Ship Upgrades. Stratagems are support utilities that can be called upon in-mission. You unlock these through Requisition Credits that you earn by completing objectives in missions. Ship Upgrades are general upgrades that improve various stats for your character (these do NOT apply to your entire team afaik). Stratagems are also level-locked, meaning you'll have to reach certain levels to unlock more to purchase. Ship Upgrades are unlocked with Common, Rare, and Super Rare Samples you pick up in missions. Higher rarities become available in higher difficulties. These are a bit harder to earn as you drop them when you die (they can be reclaimed, but it can be very difficult sometimes). Both, Req Credits and Samples are shared with your team. The problem with both Ship Upgrades and Stratagems is that, while there are insanely good ones, there are also a lot of useless ones. I have found that it's better to just save up for the stratagems that are clearly better. Most Ship Upgrades are minor buffs with some outliers that are very useful. Which, these things are going to happen with any game, but it's still a little disappointing.

6. Matchmaking and Server Issues: Many of the matchmaking issues have been resolved over the last few days. They are still present, just not as much. I, personally, have not had many issues with matchmaking. Also, if you get a matchmaking error, spamming the button usually works. Though, playing with friends is a lot more reliable than random matchmaking. Rewards are now being properly distributed at mission completion. The devs are hard-at-work, trying to resolve the remaining issues. But, if you don't have friends to reliably play with or are simply on the fence about getting this game, join the Discord server to keep up-to-date and team up with others. Hell, I'd still recommend the game right now because it's still fun as hell XD.

7. The Problem of Live Service Games: Lastly, the problem with all Live Service games. You really depend on the servers to be running properly. This prevents you from being able to host completely private matches that connect directly to the host's PC. This also basically gives the game a limited lifespan as once the game loses most of it's playerbase, the servers may shut down and anyone who still plays and enjoys it won't be able to (though, this definitely will not happen ANYTIME soon). Hopefully, Arrowhead adds a way to connect directly to each other so even when the dev-hosted servers go down, we'll still be able to enjoy it with our friends.

Overall, I [b]HIGHLY[/b] recommend this game. It is incredibly enjoyable and for every negative I listed, there's at least 5 positives. To name a few: the wit is hilarious, the ever-changing Galactic War system is very interesting and works great, the potential for new alien races is limitless, the enemy variety provides very interesting enemy desgins, the gunplay is FANTASTIC, I could go on and on about the good things in this game. Definitely pick this game up because it's an absolute BLAST!

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"The game its self, for the most part, is great. Some of the best 3rd-person gunplay since MGSV; fun, challenging gameplay and mechanics. It's lacking much in terms of features and content compared to the first game - time will tell if that's addressed, but for the moment it's still very enjoyable.

The main reason for the negative review is that Helldivers 2 uses nProtect GameGuard - a kernel-level anti-cheat software, aka a rootkit - and widely regarded as amongst the worst of its kind. It runs at the highest possible level of privilege in your PC's system - enabling it to monitor files and control hardware. It acts as a keylogger, monitors which programs you have running, and still lingers after uninstallation..

Presenting a gaping security vulnerability, a huge invasion of privacy, degrading the performance of the game and having the potential to brick peoples' PCs - and not even preventing hackers from creating cheats for the effort - it's already a bit of a stretch for games that take themselves seriously as competitive arenas.

I had no real network issues and was able to play quick play the whole session just fine. Had some people d/c out of a mission here and there but some of them likely just quit cause they were getting torn to shreds.

Gameplay wise, I had a ton of fun. I think the customization/stratagem abilities are incredible and look forward to unlocking more weapons of mass destruction. Mostly played on ""challenging"" difficulty, which is a step up from normal. It is definitely challenging already and I'm looking forward to getting slaughtered by bugs in the harder modes. Maybe my perspective is helped because I had 0 expectations going in, but I was pleasantly surprised. The game is just fun to play and I think the systems are well designed.

The p2w stuff is completely overblown and you can earn the premium pass for free anyways. I do not feel any FOMO over the premium stuff and look forward to grinding this one out.

The anti-cheat is what it is, but I remember all the same complaints when Valorant launched with Vanguard... Is it ideal? Nah, not by a long shot, but based on some of the issues I heard about from cheaters in the first one, I'd say it's probably the lesser of two evils. I don't buy into the BS about the anti-cheat being there to protect their ""P2W"" model, since i think the p2w complaints are wildin after getting hands on with it.

Anyways, glad to see the reviews have turned mostly positive as I think this game scratches that co-op itch in a way other games haven't in quite awhile.

i love the mission to mission gameplay a lot in this, i wasnt someone who played helldivers 1 so i can't talk too much about some of the finer details but i do sincerely think they translated this game 1:1 from 2d to 3d and thats an impressive feat.

but due to the nature of the [strike]game crashing[/strike], being always online, and the upgrade/monetization system ill talk about soon have me not wanting to give it a total thumbs up. i am going to 'hypocritically' continue playing the game despite this

edit 2/9/24: a later in the evening day one patch has improved this significantly, theres still been some crashing followed by lobby privacy issues but its infrequent now.

there are three progression systems in the game, utilizing four currencies one of which has three tiers.
the currencies are ""Requisitions"" which are used to unlock new stratagems.
samples, returning from 1, which come in three tiers and are used to unlock multi-tiered permanent upgrades to your stratagems.
medals, your method of progressing the battle pass (we'll get there.) to unlock new gear.
and super credits, your standardized buy in bundle predatory MTX (Microtransaction) currency.

focusing on the super credits, you are capable of finding them ingame. presently across the 9 or so hours i spent in the game ive managed to find around 50 credits.
for a sense of scale it requires around 250-300 to buy something from the rotating superstore, and 1000 to buy the premium battle pass. 
for the sake of context, please understand that i have been playing on difficulty 3-4 of a 9 tier difficulty system, rewards likely (i hope) scale with challenge.

so, gear progression right? everytime you clear a mission you get Medals, which can also be acquired from exploring in missions. think of this like EXP and levels but instead of getting something set per level you can choose what you get, this is handled by the battle pass which offers tiers in pages that unlock with a certain amount of medals spent in the pass.

now the average person read 'gear is in the battle pass' and primed to explode, lets be entirely clear: **THESE BATTLE PASSES DO NOT EXPIRE**, they are more or less dlc.
does this make them cool? in my honest opinion no not at all, people hate the vermintide 2 class dlcs for having separate purchases for cosmetics that you then have to clear challenges to unlock.
similarly here, the battle passes that helldivers 2 offers are just DLC but you have to farm and grind to actually get the content you paid for.
assuming of course that you did pay for it instead of farming to get the pass to farm.

like any good drug dealer you can get some cheaper samples by using your medals to acquire bundles of 100 super credits from passes. the free pass has quite a few of these so that it feels good but the premium pass offers 3 opportunities for this. this translates to recovering 300 of the 1000 super credits spent.

this is monetization that ive seen time and time again with the average gacha game, premium currencies that steadily dwindle to enable you to want to spend real money. this is typical f2p behavior... wait how much did this game cost again?

edit 2/11/24: it seems to be super credits spawn relatively reliably, and thorough farming seems decently viable. around 20/hour on average. further testing is needed but i felt like this was important to add to this section for folks personal judgements

again, ontop of this, i must clarify that the game is fun and that i do genuinely enjoy it, i look greatly forward to playing it with my friends. but in terms of my overall statement on it and how i would like my opinion to be contributed to a ratings factor i would not recommend it, and i genuinely think the studio, or sony, whoever is actually responsible, should reconsider how this is handled. it really stinks. especially because to my understanding in helldivers 1 weapons could be customized or augmented but now the augmented variations are only within a 10 dollar dlc pass. 

the other thing about this that grates me is the announcement for said battle pass & store systems. remember the super store i mentioned earlier? it rotates in and out cosmetics* that can be purchased using super credits, the MTX currency.
(*armor carries perks, theres only so many armor perks in the game and all of them can be acquired for free. thus while you can use MTX to acquire perks 'early' they are not exactly stat items.)
the reason this pisses me off is that in the post where this was announced, a line i have come to mockingly quote regularly is posted:
""Do you hate FOMO? We do!""
yes, you sure do, you hate fomo so much you had fomo preorder bonuses, you hate fomo so much you have a rotating storefront encouraging people to keep eyes on unless they miss out on something. you hate fomo so much that your special edition has a arcade cabinet that is in your ship nomatter what and only works if you fork the 20 dollars over for it to work.

this particular point has been sticking with me for a while, the direct ""look at how cool and generous we are uwu"" bragging followed within seconds by more predatory bullshit makes me genuinely nervous, and is the primary factor as to why i give this a thumbs down.

if you've read all this, firstly thank you for taking the time to hear my rambling out and consider my opinion.
secondly, if you've read what im upset about and you do not feel that it would bother you, you think that this would be a particularly fantastic co-op game with your friends, etc. do not let me hold you back, please.

553850,HELLDIVERS™ 2,"--Update--
I have found Super Credits during Mission at Quantities of 10x.

--Review as of 1.8 hrs on 08FEB24--
I cannot speak to any crashing issues, because I have not crashed.
I cannot speak to any performance issues, because it runs flawlessly on my rig.
I cannot speak to any Multiplayer or Cross Platform just yet because I have not used it yet. 
Single player is possible for easier difficulties so far.

I thought I was going to be disappointed by this game (especially after reading the reviews), I was wrong.  It is exactly what I wanted. For me, this game feels good and is a good successor to the original game. Game play loop is strong so far.

***The ""Store"" and 'Premium Currency'.***  
BLUF: All material is available if you play the game without need of spending actual money.

I have to speak the truth on this because there are comments that do not understand what has been employed.  

First, there are a couple of things to note first:
-You have EXP (normal progression), Requisition Points (for unlocking Stratagems), Samples (different rarities for unlocking Ship Modules), and Warbonds (for unlocking weapons, cosmetics, etc.).
-All of the above resources are given for mission completion at a pace commiserate with difficulty of mission performed or found on mission. 
-There is what appears to be a seasonal progression type system with 10-steps and ~8-unlocks per step.  You have to buy the entire step of weapon and cosmetics before progressing to the next step. ...and then a premium section (I will get to this).

YES, there is Premium Currency, ""Super Credits"" that you can spend real money on. 
HOWEVER, My observations:
-If you progress through the 10-steps you unlock 10x batches of 100x ""Super Credits"" each. (Total 1000x)
-There is a Premium Season that costs 1000x Super Credits. 
-Once admission is paid you can spend WARBONDS for the normal unlock process on the Premium stuff. Essentially a competing/secondary use for Warbonds.
-Also, Super Credits can be spent on the ""Super Store"" to unlock Cosmetics. (Currently only 4 things are available)

THEREFORE, you can buy Super Credits to get access to unlocking the Premium stuff if you want, or you can play the game and earn access then unlock as normal.  I think of it more like the 'End Game Material'.","Mostly Positive75% of the 62,617 user reviews for this game are positive.",found super credit mission quantity 10x 1 8 hr 08feb24 cannot_speak crashing issue not_crashed cannot_speak performance issue run flawlessly rig cannot_speak multiplayer cross platform not_used single possible easier difficulty far thought disappointed especially reading review wrong exactly wanted feel good good successor original game_emphasized loop strong far store premium currency bluf material available spending actual speak truth comment not_understand employed couple thing note exp normal progression requisition point unlocking stratagem sample different rarity unlocking ship module warbonds unlocking weapon cosmetic resource given mission completion pace commiserate difficulty mission performed found mission appears seasonal progression type 10 step 8 unlocks per entire weapon cosmetic progressing next premium section yes premium currency super credit spend real observation progress 10 step unlock 10x batch 100x super credit total 1000x premium season cost 1000x super credit admission paid spend warbonds normal unlock process premium stuff essentially competing secondary warbonds super credit spent super store unlock cosmetic currently 4 thing available super credit access unlocking premium stuff earn access unlock normal material

730,Counter-Strike 2,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.

I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.

It's a great mix between a survival game and a monster collector game. While it obviously has same elements as most other P named monster collector games, I would say Palworld has it's own identity and gameplay and it's own legs to stand on.

I definitely thought it's a meme game before I got to test it during network test access and I was completely blown away with how it beat all my expectations to the point it's instant buy for me.

There is some lore, but it's mostly hidden and scattered throughout the game in text form. Don't expect much story from it or some quests, treat this as a survival game.

UI is a bit lacking, but you get used to it.

Pal models are great to the point that I can't choose what to have in my limited main team because of how cool all the later level pals look.

1623730,Palworld,"What a banger of a surprise drop this is, but I'm sure you've already heard something about this game - hell its even already made it to the top of the steam charts and its been out for less than a week, so let me throw out some opinions and read on and see if this game suits you;

If you're a Pokemon fan, you may or may not have been disappointed with the franchise's latest releases, and while this may not have the evolutions and trainer battles you crave, it certainly scratched that cool and cute animal collector itch for me.

If you're a fan of Ark, this game has a very similar gameplay loop - harvest mats, fight beasties(Pals), level up to increase your stats and unlock new technology, repeat. I believe the devs are also working towards implementing PVP, which will increase the ""Arkness"" tenfold.

If you're a gamer whose been burned year after year buying $40, $50, $60, and now even $70 games, rest assured in knowing that this game, despite being in early access, shows a considerable amount of polish and has quite a bit of content, for the low low price of $30. If you follow the dollar-per-hour guideline, you can easily hit and surpass that ratio with this game. Whats more worth it, 1 copy of Starfield, or 3 copies of Palworld? They have about the same amount of content, but one is still being developed AND has multiplayer.

You may have also heard some of the grumblings on the internet that inevitably follow when anything in this cut-throat industry gains success, there's plenty of developers out there shilling their dogshit opinions mirroring the events that followed Baldur's Gate 3's release - Ignore them, they are pissed that such a simple yet lovable game has gained so much traction, and heres hoping it'll spur them (I'm imaging game-freak and Nintendo, but you can imagine whichever company you deem fit) into action again. Some people are even so salty they are trying to claim the game outright steals Pokemon designs and used AI to produce the pals, Afaik, this game has been in development for like 3-4 years or so, which makes it older than the current AI craze we've seen over the last year. As for Pokemon designs being stolen, sure there's some resemblance, but that's because just like Pokemon, it uses real animals for inspiration for the most part. Believe it or not, this world is large enough for there to be multiple fantasy games with weird penguin things and it not be considered ""ripping off Pokemon"".

1623730,Palworld,"Most of my game time is on Gamepass since i have friends in both places but mostly play on there.

I wonder what Game Freak and the Poke'mon Company must be thinking right about now. About how this game just took the world by storm as something with clear and present MAJOR parallels to their work. About how something new and refreshing has been desperately needed from the franchise for years now and this game just came and ate their lunch. it's too soon to tell if Palworld will be able to rise to the challenge of being as great as it has the potential to be, but it couldn't have asked for a better foundation. The following will be more of a first impressions and a wishlist for what should come in the future. Palworld is VERY Early Access, especially on GamePass where it's a few versions behind Steam, and writing a formal review for such a game is silly.

At it's core, Palworld is no different than the likes of Ark. You level up and gain points you can put into new recipes and skill points to increase health, carry weight, damage dealt and so on. You start with nothing and collect rocks and twigs off the ground to build your first bit of gear and then set off to build a base. You even beat creatures near to death and then tame them. All the familiar trappings are here, and the execution is solid but could use some polish. 

The difference, of course, is in the aforementioned clear and present parallels to everyone's favorite children's JRPG starring adorable anime creatures. Pals are, without question, the best thing about Palworld for a myriad of reasons. Just like in Poke'mon you can make apparatuses to catch Pals, and a Paldex to keep track of the ones you've seen and caught, and the addictive ""gotta catch 'em all!"" feeling is here in full force and it feels great to do it in a game that feels decidedly different from what is essentially the same game we've been getting for years. But another one of those reasons is the acknowledgement that the initial Poke'mon audience in the days of Blue/Red/Yellow Version are grown adults. Palworld isn't afraid to tackle some of the more grim and darker topics surrounding our cute and cuddly friends that Poke'mon halfheartedly tried to do with Black & White but ultimately, in my opinion, failed to really do anything with. 

The game also does suffer a bit from tonal issues that can hopefully be cleaned up. I get the feeling the idea is that you as the player are meant to make the choice for yourself, will you abuse your Pals for your own selfish ends, or will you find a better way that doesn't involve you being a piece of human trash. But this doesn't come through clearly, and it's hard to tell if Pocketpair are making fun of Poke'mon for not doing this, are memeing in their own game about these more grim topics, or are genuinely trying to tell a darker story than Poke'mon is willing to and just aren't there yet. I hope it's the latter most option and we see development occur that pushes this idea further. The game also seems to suffer from a lack of identity. Beyond the designs of the Pals, you can see a lot of influence in other games taken and placed here. This ranges from the aesthetics of the HUD (The Breath of the Wild temperature meter) to things that exist in the game world. One of the game's field bosses (a Penking) is trapped in a straight up Evergaol from Elden Ring. There's also a church that bares a striking resemblance to a location in Limgrave, and the gigantic tree that can be seen in the north gives me Erdtree vibes. The mining animation is straight from Fortnite, the list goes on and you get the idea. I'd like to see Palworld move towards it's own unique style. It's ok to make references and easter eggs and homages and I actually love the idea that the Evergaol boss is a thing. But there's a difference in making an homage and ripping off of another work, and right now Palworld does feel somewhat like it's leaning to the latter, especially with Elden Ring (I don't care that some of the Pals look all too similar to actual Poke'mon, when Game Freak and The Poke'mon company develop some respect for their aging IP and actually do something interesting then we'll talk, for now they're just sitting on what are essentially unused assets and wasted potential).

A lot of what I think would be good additions have already been mentioned by the devs; arena fights, bosses that require Guilds to take down together, and updates to existing systems all sound good. Beyond that, seeing more of this world wouldn't go amiss, new maps like Ark that become available once you've beaten the bosses and more civilization wouldn't hurt either (there's at least one small village in the game you can visit).

I'm recommending Palworld because that's the best chance it has for success, for everyone to jump in and give voice to what they want to help make this game realize it's potential. And it's success would be important not only to it, but also to Poke'mon. Game Freak and The Poke'mon company have no incentive to take any kind of risk, to do really anything other than continue to pump out the same tired JRPG every two years like they've been doing since I was roughly 7 years old, with very little in the way of meaningful change. That CAN change, but only if they're given a reason to do so.

While it does need updates and bug fixes, the game's rock solid foundation make for an interesting combination between ARK and Pokemon, and does it with enough originality to be an incredibly enjoyable experience.

Looking forward to seeing new Pals added in the future. I'm onboard for the long haul.

1623730,Palworld,"Grab this game! Let me put it this way, if Nintendo knew what they were doing and listened to people other than themselves, they'd be releasing the 5th version of this game by now, and they still wouldn't come close to something so full featured.

This is a survival craft, automation, monster hunting, creature taming, 3rd person shooter, RPG. It can be played single player, which is a very relaxing to fairly challenging and tense experience depending on how you set up your world. It can also be played in teams of up to 4 on a server of up to 32, though these numbers will be bumper in the future.
With the amount of content this game has right now, January 21st, in an early access release, I can comfortably say most triple a studios should be at the top of your ""ignore and only purchase on sale"" list.

Plus some day this game will allow the steam workshop. You cannot imagine how amazing that will be until you've sunk a dozen or so hours into even it's current state.

Just go buy it. You absolutely won't regret it.


A few cons: at this moment you can't rebind controls. Pal AI has some problems, though I'm certain it'll get better, and building designs are pretty limited, though they're not likely to be that way for long. The amount of content is still large enough to make it a better purchase than most triple a releases.","Very Positive94% of the 220,720 user reviews for this game are positive.",grab nintendo knew listened releasing 5th version close featured survival craft automation monster hunting creature taming 3rd shooter role single relaxing fairly challenging tense depending set world team 4 32 number bumper future january 21st early access release comfortably triple studio top ignore purchase sale plus allow workshop cannot_imagine amazing sunk dozen hour state regret con moment rebind control pal ai problem certain building design pretty limited not_likely long large purchase triple release

1172470,Apex Legends™,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before... 

To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that shit is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase. 

What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it. 

I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, shit, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES. 

It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some shit. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday. 

It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and shit, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.

1172470,Apex Legends™,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it.

You know your doing something right when other developers like EA/Ubisoft/Blizzard, etc, come out saying, ""Baldur's Gate 3 should not be the new standard"". 
To put it simply, they are just mad because Larian Studios will not have a battle-pass, micro-transactions and expensive DLC's.
Which after all, is all us gamer's want. Just a polished game with unlimited hours of fun. Well done Larian Studios! You can tell you actually care about games, and have bought back what it felt like 15 years ago for me.

EDIT:
reading through the comments and you can see the majority rules. when i speak of DLC's i'm referring to things that should already of been included in the base game for example, Total War Warhammer (great game btw) should, in my opinion, already include the chaos race in the base game. i shouldn't have to pay an extra $30 for this particular race, (once again just my opinion). now id happily pay for an ""expensive"" DLC/add-on whatever you want to call it for BG3, especially if its the same quality as Blood and Wine.

Then I read the Tweet.  You know the one: the prominent game developer who said that we cannot allow Larian to define our expectations of RPGs.  Oh, really?  I immediately bought the game and spent hours downloading it out of pure, unadulterated spite.

I am 3 hours in.  Three.  I am blown away.  I spent the first hour creating my character.  I pulled out my Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Player's Handbook and marveled at what BG3 had enabled me to do - this is the full blown 5E character creation.  The maniacs at Larian  took Divinity: Original Sin and made it into D&D 5E, full stop.  Amazing.

And then I played for a couple of hours.

I haven't fallen in love with a game like this since Dragon Age: Origins and there is so much more depth to BG3 in the short time I've played.  Case in point: I found a lockpick, broke into a crypt, looted a burial site and was promptly incinerated by a flame trap over a greased floor.  Thank you, Larian, for reminding me of the F5 key.

The graphics are amazing.  The voice work is the best.  The cut scenes are riveting and that's usually when I go make another whisky!  The sound design is unbelievable.  Why am I noticing sound design?  I don't care about sound design!

I've misclicked so many times.  There's so much to click!  I've died in so many ways.  There are so many ways to die!  There are so many bugs, but I don't even care because in a game as complex and deep as this, you're going to experience lots and lots of FUN. 

Larian, you've done it.  You've made a game so incredible that other developers are banding together to warn us not to play your magnum opus or we won't enjoy the next Stranger Things Click Quest game or whatever garbage they're shoveling out.  

I cannot wait to spend days in Baldur's Gate 3.


* Edit 8/1/2023 after ~60 hours *

Since this review got some attention, let me give you an update after about 60 hours of Early Access.  My initial review is, obviously, hyperbolic, but that was my real-time reaction to finding a truly great game in a genre and style that I thought had been abandoned by game producers who are more interested in games as service, micro-transactions and shooters.

The best review of BG3 I could give is that this is the game I've been hoping for since Dragon Age: Origins.  I play games for systems, not so much story, and I really like both the systems and the story of this game.  If I really like a game, I look forward to starting over and trying something new (I play XCOM 2 and Dwarf Fortress a little bit.)  This game also scratches that itch, which seems strange to say about a story-driven RPG, but it really is a game that encourages you to experiment.

As it stands, on the verge of release, this game is a 10/10 for me and in my pantheon of favorites.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"After ~210 hours and almost three months, I've finally completed the game (I'm a completionist and a slow player who likes to absorb the world carefully and slowly, explore everything, read everything a couple of times, etc).

The sheer level of complexity of interconnected stories, dialogues, outcomes, various characters, and factions is simply unbelievable. Hats off to Larian for managing to create such a rich, complex and meaningful world with hundreds of characters, dozens of factions and interesting groups, vast maps with an abundance of interesting locations to explore and secrets to uncover... While being almost completely nonlinear and giving players the opportunity to do everything in the way they want to do it.

Pros:

- Character models and animations (especially facial animations) are some of the best I've ever seen. It adds so much to the immersion. No matter how important or unimportant an NPC is.

- Superb voice acting, done with so much love, passion and care. And most importantly, with an understanding of the characters they give voices to.

- Generally, the writing is great. It successfully balances Larian's signature humour and silliness with a more macabre and serious tone of the world and the game's story.

- A diverse cast of memorable companions with their own agendas, personalities, personal stories and major questlines. I will miss every single one of them.

- Combat is mostly fun and rewarding. It rewards a tactical approach, experimenting and thinking out of the box.

- Every encounter is a meaningful experience, every combat is hand-crafted, every questline a story on its own, and every location is a unique place. There are no fillers or padding.

- Dozens upon dozens of interesting side stories and quests of various scales and importance.

- Great level design with attention to detail. It’s a pure joy to explore various locations and just look around.
 
- Memorable and multilayered villains with distinctive personalities and agendas.

- Amazing music by Borislav Slavov. Kirill Pokrovsky would be proud.

- Excellent implementation of D&D rules into a video game.

Cons:

- The game's tempo varies. In the early game, it seems that some relationships with companions are developing extremely fast. On the other hand, in Act 3, there is a dichotomy between the urgency of the main quest and the amount of quests, side stories and general stuff you can do and explore in the city of Baludr's Gate.

- Bugs and some general unpolishness become much more obvious in Act 3. Luckily, Larian is actively working on ironing out everything and making the experience truly complete.

- There are some balance issues when it comes to combat, gear, and classes. But that’s also something that will be fixed over time.

- Inventory and companion managing is absolutely horrendous, by far the weakest spot of the game. It’s a nightmare when you try to juggle between characters, find and store items, etc. Recommend using modes for this.

- I personally don't like that almost every companion is player-sexual. It kinda kills their uniqueness and takes away from the immersion when they can all fall in love with you.

- The game should have some kind of a codex where it will store all books and notes that you find, info about characters you’ve met, info about the types of enemies you have encountered, etc.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 505,051 user reviews for this game are positive.",210 hour three month finally completed completionist slow like absorb world carefully slowly explore read couple time sheer complexity interconnected story dialogue outcome various character faction simply unbelievable hat larian managing create rich complex meaningful world hundred character dozen faction interesting group vast map abundance interesting location explore secret uncover completely nonlinear giving player opportunity pro model animation especially facial animation best add immersion no_matter important unimportant non superb voice acting love passion care importantly understanding character voice generally writing great successfully balance larian s_emphasizedignature humour silliness macabre serious tone world s_emphasizedtory diverse cast memorable companion agenda personality personal story major questlines miss single combat mostly fun rewarding reward tactical approach experimenting box encounter meaningful combat hand crafted questline location unique no_fillers padding dozen dozen interesting side story quest various scale importance great design attention detail pure joy explore various location look memorable multilayered villain distinctive personality agenda amazing music borislav slavov kirill pokrovsky proud excellent implementation d_emphasized rule video con tempo varies early relationship companion developing extremely fast hand act 3 dichotomy urgency quest side story general stuff explore city baludr gate bug general unpolishness obvious act 3 luckily larian actively working ironing truly complete balance issue come combat gear class fixed inventory companion managing horrendous far weakest spot nightmare juggle character store item recommend mode personally companion sexual kinda kill uniqueness take immersion fall love kind codex store book note info character met info type enemy encountered
1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"Believe the hype.

I've always been a staunch believer that Larian were a poor choice to continue this franchise. Not because they have ever been incompetent but because in my opinion there have always been better storytellers and Baldur's Gate was always more about story and character than it was about gameplay. No one can argue that Larian's approach to the mechanics of their games have been anything less than groundbreaking. Divinity Original Sin 1+2 set a new bar for different ways to do things both in combat and in terms of choice and consequence; and yet I've never been fully drawn in to either game because I just didn't care enough about the narrative. I always thought that despite being good games they were overrated and overly gushed about by a horde of fanboys - and this was my mindset going into BG3.

Then you have the first area which finds you in a MIND FLAYER SPACESHIP and my first thoughts in early access were ""ok Larian have done Larian, I'm sure it'll be good but in the end this will be another game I'm not keen on. It's not a Baldur's Gate game"". After just a couple of hours I was experiencing the first hints of how wrong I was - about everything.

Let's start with the basics of the overall technical value. In true Larian form there are multiple ways to do things but they have taken what they were known to be good at and improved every aspect tenfold. Every large quest and even most ""side"" quests have so many different possible approaches that it would take thousands of hours to find every secret the game can present but this alone wouldn't normally do anything to change your general experience of playing a game. It NEVER feels like a slog, never feels like you are doing anything just for the sake of it. Every NPC is fully 3D rendered and voiced. There is no ""filling"", no crowds where people are just wandering about to illustrate a mass. No one you can't talk to. No one that has nothing to say. The fact that this extends to wildlife and even dead bodies makes it all the more incredible of an achievement. The graphics and the voice acting are of a standard beyond any other party based RPG ever. I'm aware this sounds like exaggeration but trust me it isn't.

So, Narrative and characterisation? I'm going to be quick about this because there's no way for me to give any examples without spoilers. Any detail you hear about this game, any stream, any walkthrough, perhaps even any screenshot, is a spoiler. Things fit so perfectly from a tale telling perspective that there ARE no side quests - just shorter stories within stories. There are many characters that you will love and more that will annoy you. What's important is that the main ones are fluid. Dialogue will change your opinion of someone who was previously annoying you so much that all you wanted to do was take their head off. These are not cardboard cutouts. They barely feel designed/scripted at all. Sure the game is full of set pieces and boy are they a treat almost every time.

The game world is huge and PACKED. You can barely take a few steps without running into something unexpected or another quest. And it's all entertaining and thoroughly engrossing.

Here's the bombshell; and it's something I never thought I'd say about any game, after a little over 20 hours played it's already looking to be better than anything Bioware (or Obsidian) has ever done. If you ever thought imagine you could have an RPG with Bioware level storytelling and Larian mechanics then this is it - but better than anyone has any right to expect. They took years longer than they said they would to finally get this out and it doesn't take long to see why.

I can't wait to get to the end (which doesn't mean I want to rush to do that), to play it all over again, and to try it in co-op.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"EDIT: 

I created a video review for Patch #8. If you want to check it out I put a link at the end of this review. I know a lot of people found this initial review helpful and I hope my most recent one can help people decide whether or not they want to buy the game! 

So should you get Baldur's Gate 3? If you really like Larian RPG games then probably yeah, it's a lot like their other games with a few major differences that might make you not enjoy the game: 

1) The skills don't have CDs like in other games, they're based on 5E D&D so they're based on your class, so your class selection is very important and you'll need a balanced party.

2) If you're big into D&D games like me you might be frustrated at some of the Larian game mechanics, like Ray of Frost leaving ice beneath the feet of enemies and similar spells leaving fields on the ground that debuff or damage targets. Ray of Frost is the biggest offender since slipping on ice ends your turn, or your opponents turn making it the best mage cantrip for its RNG value. 

Is this game a sequel to Baldur's Gate 1 and 2? 

No, so far it seems like it has nothing to do with the other Baldur's Gates game besides the fact you're trying to get to Baldur's Gate to some degree but can't because monsters are fucking around in the countryside, as per usual. Your character is also not a Bhaalspawn so I'm not sure why they called it Baldur's Gate 3 when more accurately it should be like: Baldur's Gate: The Mind Flayering or something similar. 

Does the game run well? 

Depends on your machine, mine is fairly powerful and with the game ready Nvidia Driver the game runs smooth, however textures kinda pop in weirdly, the game is in Early Access so it's expected that the graphics aren't full up to snuff yet. 

Does the combat feel good? 

Yeah, it feels pretty good they got the 5E stuff in game to work really well and they added in special weapon attacks that make a big difference. The Combat is deadly, but fair and you have loads of options to subvert encounters and crush your enemies. Beyond that it's not a big murder hobo affair either you do murder many things but I was surprised when I actually found some friendly monsters who'd normally be murder hobo fodder. Larian also wisely shot the alignment system of D&D in the head behind a shed which was a good move since 5E doesn't really use that system very much anyways. I find the AI however has a hard time handling stealth attacks, where I can sometimes get three free stealth attacks against monsters if I have my rogue hidden well, perhaps that's a bug or a reward for good positioning I can't say. 

How is the Story? (Don't worry, no spoilers)

Story is pretty fine and the characters you meet along the way are interesting. Some are a bit hostile towards you but due to the situation you find yourself in I think it's 100% natural that your party will be distrustful towards each other and your character. However I found that even the more nasty characters do warm up to you quickly, or at the very least treat you as a decent person. I read some reviews after playing where reviewers complained that the party ALWAYS hated you. But I only ever felt that one NPC hated me, and now after a few hours into the game they talk to me as an ally and have even confided into me about some of their own secrets making me feel like it's something that could easily become a true friendship. One praise I'll give it that others will call negative is that some persuasion options might not be good ideas. Please use your common sense, you might not want to tell sensitive things about your situation to certain people or even if you pass your check it might have a negative outcome, in this case passing the check makes a really bad situation a bit less bad. You also get special dialogue options due to some special magical powers you get rather early on in the game though I'll avoid calling them by name because that could be a spoiler which give you OP persuasion options that you cannot fail, however I like that the game implies that by using these powers you can get some negative backlash, these options even let you learn extra details about certain characters that share your condition though I have opted not to use them since I assume it will worsen my relationship with the character. The only downside of conversations is that in single player you can't change who is talking to perform skill checks. I had a Dex check in a conversation to pick a lock but couldn't let the rogue do his job to pick the lock. There was also lacking a dialogue option of me just using the key I had on me to unlock the shackles the guy was trapped in. The animations in conversation are also fairly stiff looking and your character only has a few stances they take, they're kinda annoying and I hope they add more variety to them. 

So how good is the game in Early Access? 

I'd say pretty good, you get a large area to explore and the characters are varied and the story interesting if a bit high fantasy, though I feel Baldur's Gate was also High Fantasy, I will say I'm not a fan of certain named characters existing in the world like Volo who I found, but I was happy to learn you can also mindlessly murder such refferences and rob their dead caracasses with only minimal consequences (I bribed a guard like 200 gold after I killed Volo and stole all of his swag, it was super worth I'd recommend murdering Volo in every game he's in.)  Beyond that I'd say the game is on the right track to be a cool RPG, though the game requires patience if you want to avoid murder hoboing, the game gives most characters even goblins actual names which makes talking to them and learning their secrets worthwhile, I'd recommend talking to as many people as your patience can handle to solve problems non-violently since some fights are nearly unwinnable. Also don't forget to scout around with your rogue to find shenanigans to cheese encounters and make sure you're not about to walk into a hornets nest.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"I kicked a goblin into the abyss while he was peeing.

Game of the Year.

100 hours in.
Still creating my character.

I genuinely don't know how human beings made this game. It's like the video game version of the pyramids. It’s better than the hype. It's the best money you will spend this year.

As someone who played Dragon Age Origins so many times as a teen, playing this game felt like meeting a long lost friend and it made me so happy. To me Baldur's Gate 3 felt like a fully realized version of DAO.

After the first 20 hours, I was simply stunned. They managed to take everything that I've loved about D&D, and distilled it into a video game. To say it’s been worth my time is an understatement. This is like showing up to play D&D and your DM has every battle map, mini, a binder of world lore ready to tie into your own backstory, voices every character perfectly, lets you pickpocket the boss because it’s fun, and tells you they got nowhere to be so you can play for the next four days.

I literally cannot get the game out of my head. The combat. The lore. The story. The sheer audacity they thought they could this and they did. I love it very, very much - pretty much everything is of such an outstanding quality. The voice-acting, the plot, the visuals, the cinematic qualities, the soundtrack (ohh, the soundtrack) It's intense and beautiful, hauntingly sad. It's about deeply flawed people, about redemption and love and forgiveness. There is a vast amount of quests, often compellingly written. You get attached to characters, you take your time reading notes because not only do they tell you more about the lore, they help you understand what is happening and make decisions upon it. This game is 123GB and they're all used for something that matters.

I think the complexity of the game is its selling point.  The world is so dense with content, filled with characters who directly influence the story and are directly influenced by it.  Even a random NPC that you chat with in Act 1 could end up playing a major role in the story by Act 3... or no role at all if they die instead.  You can see the layers within the decision making, which gives weight to everything you do.  Who you save, kill, team up with, etc. all end up telling a different story, making the game really feel like it's YOUR story being told. Then they did that thing that separates good writers from average: make absolutely memorable characters, make you invest yourself emotionally in them and then put them into impossible situations where they can’t possibly win.

The fact you can play 100+ hours on your first playthrough and come back for round 2 to have a literal UNRECOGNIZABLY DIFFERENT STORY play out is part of the magic. There will be ""did you know in Baldur s Gate 3"" videos for years to come as people find more and more. It’s actually so amazing, my wife’s boyfriend is doing his own play through and then doing one with me and he's getting a completely different experience and dialogue. 

I have three saves right now & each one feels so dramatically different from the others. From timing changing world events, to origin companion dialogue, to choices you make as you're playing - there're so many aspects that change completely. It’s so interesting and shows your actions really do change the story. This game rewards creativity in an almost infinite number of ways. The choices presented to the player during the course of the story are staggering in number and a lot of them are impactful. Few games will reach this level of excellence. Well done Larian.

I also really can't get over how every little piece of extra attention you give to an item or an area is rewarding. You can go from stumbling onto a regular book or chest in a random area to having a 3 hour quest you'd otherwise have totally missed. There's probably 50+ hours of content minimum that the game doesn't steer you towards at all. Like there's entire areas you can only find by hovering your cursor over a small hitbox that some players may never discover. All my friends who played had vastly different playthroughs from one another.

The voice acting alone makes this game perfect. It just feels like you are part of a big adventure and there is so many things to do and so many ways to do it that it begs playing it over and over again. Even letting the dice fall as they do vs save scumming is a strategy. The characters take me back to caring like I did back in Mass Effect. And it's true turn-based which I have grown to love as I've fallen out of FPS's and moved to a primarily single player game player.

The rule set, which is the hardest thing to comprehend for non D&D people, is pretty accessible and the tutorials work well.  It does require some planning, but you can watch a video or two and get a gist. There's also no Ironman mode or anything, so you can literally mess up an infinite amount of times with no repercussions. If you get it, make sure to save frequently! The game saves at odd times and isn't very consistent. There's no rolling ""save every 15 mins"" or anything.

On top of that, the tactics of the combat is immensely satisfying.  It can be obtuse at times because there are LOADS of status effects, environment effects, spells, items, and conditions that can overwhelm you if you're not paying attention.  But to those who WANT to pay attention, there is nothing more fun than examining an enemy, determining their weaknesses, seeing they have a weak WIS and using a spell with a WIS save to completely neuter them. In that way, fights have a way to be incredibly difficult if you're not paying attention to the details or an absolute breeze if you know how to use every tool at your disposal.

Yes, this really is a once in a decade kind of game. Crazy it is also a $60 no strings attached no shops, no passes, no DLC, just one huge and complete game. Truly has permanently raised Larian into RPG developer godhood among the likes of those like Square and Bioware. I'm convinced this masterpiece will be studied by many game developers for years to come. It’s a game that will be referenced for decades. As far is the specific genre goes and arguably gaming in general it just set a high bar. Much to the displeasure of dogsh*t publishers and devs everywhere.

BG3 is not a perfect game but man the experience, replay value, freedom is unparalel to anything I have ever seen. You can just feel that every person involved with this game has put all their efforts and devotion to this. It's made with so much love. It's a game that stays with you.

If you like Dragon Age Origins, I guarantee you'll like the game. It's a CRPG but also a successor to BioWare games like DA, Kotor, and Mass Effect (and obviously the original Baldurs Gate games if you're old like me). I highly recommend it.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"This is absolutely my GOTY. One of the best CRPGs of all time, perhaps the best mainstream CRPG ever made. My playtime is real (minus the 12 hours I spent in EA), so you can see the game is HUGE. And all that playtime is filled to the brim with well-executed content.

So if you like RPGs, tactics, huge adventures, and bears, the game is a must-buy. It's not a question. The only real question is: is [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] a 97/100?

Short answer: Act 1 absolutely is. And Act 1 took me 56 hours. If the game [b]only[/b] consisted of Act 1 with some sort of ending, it would already have been brilliant. Think about it: less than one third of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is already a better game than most other CRPGs on the market. How is it even possible?

Later, however, it starts to crumble under its own weight — and I don't just mean the bugs. Those will be fixed; the meaninglessness of many final choices and lack of companion interaction likely won't. 

And it's a damn shame.

[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]
Larian RPGs aren't simply RPGs, they border isometric immersive sims, and it's a great concept, brilliantly executed here. You have your ordinary RPG fare: classes, abilities, XP, lockpicking, traps. And then you have a simulated world that you can interact with in creative and sensible ways. Can't pick a chest? Just take it away to open in camp. A boss is too tough? Surround him with explosive barrels pre-encounter and blow to smithereens. Or befriend him — you can side and kill any faction in the game. Can't reach someplace? Aside from various teleportation spells, you can also just carry a bunch of boxes to build a tower wherever you need.

Traversal is a separate — and unique — feature of the game. Most CRPGs are flat, apart from terrain in some battlefields, sometimes. Larian uses the Z axis to its full extent. [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] has interesting jumping puzzles (what right does a CRPG even have to have those?). Some of its areas, like the Monastery, feel like legacy dungeons from a FromSoft game, and I mean it in the best way possible. They're [b]fun[/b] to explore and find routes through, secrets in. It's a game as much about exploration as it is about story and combat.

(Not to mention that it uses verticality for spectacular visual impressions in some areas.)

Another critical aspect of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]'s exploration is just how dense it is. Even the emptier areas are [i]packed[/i] with content. You find characters, secrets, reactivity, small stories. Figuring out a secret sometimes requires unique interactions, like reading a scroll in a certain location or casting a specific spell. It's brilliant, and fun, and the best aspect of the game by far. 

No other product on the market offers anything remotely comparable.

[b]STORY[/b]
It's hit and miss.

I'd put it this way: in this game, Acting > Characters > Story. [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is incredibly well-acted, I can't remember a single character, even minor, that would be presented as anything less than good, and most main characters are just charisma personified — to the point where I was disappointed I couldn't have more interactions with someone like Ketheric. So whenever a character arc struggles a bit (being too cliche or too melodramatic), the acting makes up for it. And since most characters are interesting enough, their personal stories make up for the less brilliant part of the overall narrative. So in the end, it works. 

Writing has never been Larian's strongest suit. Since you can befriend or kill any character in the game, their writing in Divinity tended to be skin-deep — and it's definitely MUCH better here. So that's progress.

The tone of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] would probably not be for everyone. It rarely takes itself too seriously — and it's at its best when it doesn't. The small comedic storylets (like with the smart orge) and characters (like Minsc) just ooze charm. The erotic scenes are honesly very cool — if, again, you don't take yourself too seriously. With many of them, you're not meant to.

It's also very black-and-white, almost outdated in this regard. You can absolutely have an evil playthrough, but do understand that ""evil"" means ""cackling sadistic evil that enjoys splattering squirrels and forcing people to kill themselves with their own daggers in front of you."" Good and evil are objective qualities here — and there is no grey area, no attempt at deconstruction. It's all fun if you go with it; just keep it in mind.

The game's pacing is also great. You need to rest from time to time, usually after harder fights. And most long rests launch cutscenes that explore one story or another: of your party members, weird urges, or mysterious Guardian. Companions also have a LOT of reactivity and interjections in random events. It's all mixed up to create a very natufal flow. I don't think a lot of players even notice it — rare occasions of unique reactivily (like characters having reactions to having been killed and resurrected by you) are flashier. But don't underrate the importance of overall pacing. Pacing can make or break a game.

[b]SO WHAT IS WRONG HERE?[/b]
Act 1 is absolutely brilliant and one of the best games I've ever played.

Act 2 makes some odd choices, but at least they're clearly artistic. After a dense location filled to the brim with content and reactivity, you find yourself in a huge open area with trash mob ambushes. I appreciate the Bloodborne-esque aesthetics as much as the next gal, but why does the game willingly forefit its best assets: the interesting secret-packed exploration, the reactivity, the interlocking events, the verticality?

Hint for future players: defy your natural instincts and follow the main story in Act 2 instead of exploring everything before getting to it. It'll send you off to explore anyway, but in a more fun way.

Act 3 is... huge. It's probably bigger than Acts 1 and 2 combined — which makes sense, you expect the city to be lively. And the stories are still all right in theory, but — well, half of them just don't deliver. 

The game fails to fulfill its ambitions.

You can side with [spoiler]Gortash[/spoiler] and his sensible evil proposal — except all you get is the inability to finish some companion quests and discover perhaps the biggest twist in the story, you can't get a ""normal evil ruler"" ending. That deal with the devil you made? A short cutscene in the end and nothing more. [spoiler]A non-illithid can't control the Netherbrain[/spoiler], except if you make a treacherous choice in the final cutscene, where you suddenly totally can. It feels good to gather allies for the final battle, but each of them only utters a single phrase — less than random characters in the street!

Generally speaking, siding with evil never feels like an equal choice past Act 1. It feels like a way to skip a boss fight. You're never rewarded by content for it.

You can't even discuss the final events with my whole party — only the three characters you took with you! How does that make any sense! Not to mention that companions have little to say over the course of the whole act, and there are zero to none unique interactions between them (like the conflict between Lae'zel and Shadowheart in Act 1) — and this is in the part of the story where I want their insights the most, to see how they've changed.

Don't get me wrong, the final conflict is still... all right. It offers no surprises and has too many moving parts, and your mysterious Guardian plays a role too technical and not compelling enough. And you're very much railroaded into the good ending. But it's still interesting and epic compared to other games.

It's just that my expectations were set much higher. Because Act 1 was so brilliant.

[b]CONCLUSION[/b]
Still one of the best CRPGs ever. Buy it. Play it.

Just temper the expectations Act 1 sets. The game won't hold to the same insane standard of quality, and honestly, it's okay. Even 50 hours of that quality is a treasure.

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"This is the best videogame I have played in decades. I feel like I curled up with a great book for 281 hours while binge-watching an epic series, all while playing a game that felt challenging but also super rewarding. The storytelling is amazing! There is actual character development, and things don't always go the way you expect they will when you start off.

Things you experience in the first act come back around way later (in my case over 100 hours later) and your choices MATTER. Playing this at the same time as a lot of my friends (and activity feed) was especially fun because everyone had a totally different experience, which means that there is solid replay value here. {I am already planning my next-- and the next after that -- playthrough!)

It's not 100% perfect, the UI and particularly inventory and party management systems could be less cumbersome (and if Larian doesn't take care of that, I am sure the modding community will) but it is damn close! With years in early access, the first act has clearly been tested much more than what follows, and there are some buggy experiences. But, wow, what experiences they are! This game is so dense in Act 3 that it almost is a little overwhelming. 

Baldur's Gate 3 IS the most polished game I've played in ages, and for once I don't feel like I bought half a game and will be buying the rest of the game later, one dlc at a time.","Overwhelmingly Positive96% of the 505,051 user reviews for this game are positive.",best videogame decade curled great book 281 hour binge watching epic series challenging super rewarding storytelling amazing actual development thing expect thing act case 100 hour choice matter friend activity feed especially fun totally different mean solid replay value already planning next next playthrough not_100 perfect ui particularly inventory party management system cumbersome larian t_emphasizedake care modding community damn close year early access act clearly tested follows buggy experience wow experience dense act 3 overwhelming baldur gate 3 polished age bought half buying rest dlc

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"This review is going to put aside all the controversy as well as some of the push-back from other studios etc. This is about BG3 itself, not involving politics, social acceptances/unacceptances and social norms, etc. So if you are interested in that type of review that doesn't include all that stuff, keep reading. 

[h1]NEGATIVES[/h1]
If you are looking for instant gratification, you won't get it, actually you may not even want to read the rest of this review because it is long and detailed as this game truly deserves it.

Some bugs exist particularly later in the game, you may notice slower dialogue, or scenes that just appear to stop or have awkward pauses in them. It is not unexpected with a game of this scope. With that being said, do yourself a favor and actually read the patch notes. They are actively being worked on and fixed. I myself came across a few particular bugs on I think it was August 6th or 7th and quite literally in the August 8th Hotfix the bugs I came across were fixed.

There are some quests that appear to be broke or contain some misinformation. They are not [b]MAJOR[/b] quests or won't result in full on blocks to the story but they are noticeable. Most of the time they appear to sort themselves out but can potentially confuse a player. My suggestion is to use the report feature but don't let it stop you from continuing forward.

Dice rolls, honestly there are times where I feel like the Dice are weighted against the players. I mean 95% chance of success on an attack and you get a Critical Miss (which means you rolled a Nat 1) when that single attack would have ended the encounter if it hit. But now the enemy gets one more turn and manages to take out 2 of your best teammates? Huh?

Skill checks, there seem to be a lot of skill checks that you can outright fail and then have no way of knowing what it was you missed and no way to go on and discover it. This may upset some people as they cannot get the satisfaction of knowing what was there, only knowing that something was there since it was clearly a failed check.

No True Guidance - Take this as a negative if you will. I am posting it here because often times people are always looking for guidance for something. This game does not hold your hand. It provides you with objectives and marks spot on the map for you. It is up to you to decide when you will do it, how you will do it or even if you will do it. With that being said it is certainly possible to lock yourself out of other quests and encounters or parts of the game entirely because of decisions you made. (To my fellow Dark Urge players, you understand.)

Clunky - there are parts of the game that seem to be incredibly sluggish at times, especially if playing for long sessions. I imagine this is being actively worked on but really only starts showing itself in like the middle to later part of Act 3. I have made reports about it myself, but for you performance lovers out there, you may see some performance dips especially later in the game or during long play sessions. 

Steam Deck performance - Performance on the Steam Deck is good, however the controls seem to be a little bit clunky. The game runs fine but the controls require some getting used to especially if you are like me and play actively on both the Steam Deck and the PC. 

[h1]POSITIVES[/h1]
BG3 is an excellent game that even with 306 hours I still have so much more to do. This game is a [b]COMPLETE[/b] product. You pay your money and you get a [b][u]COMPLETE & FULL[/u][/b] experience. No battle-pass, season-pass, yearly-pass, whatever-pass. No content locked behind a Pay-Wall. Nothing. Just a genuine full and complete game like back in the old days when I started gaming almost 25+ years ago.

The amount of work that was put into this game is 100% apparent. The sheer amount of details that the Developers took into consideration when making this game is astonishing. I can't begin to say how many times I have done something out of the box and the game ""anticipated"" it. The atmosphere in this game truly exhibits a notion of ""This is your character, you do what it is you want,"" and the game acts accordingly. It is not the reverse where you act according to the game. 

There is something to be said about the attention to detail that the developers put into Baldur's Gate 3. You can tell it was a labor of love and dedication to a project. Not just some new Title that needed to be released to satisfy a deadline and bring income. The Development Team truly loved creating this and loves continuing work on this project. Just look at the Hotfixes. You can see it if you step back and just think about what must have gone into creating this masterpiece. 

The mechanics and gameplay itself are excellent. It isn't ""handed"" to you, especially in the later acts. You need to think, you need to utilize your brain and take into account all that is going on, who you are up against, etc. etc. You need to author your story. The satisfaction one gets from completing a difficult fight is next level. There is one particular battle that involves a particular soundtrack, that I KNOW will stay with me forever, and that says a lot.

Moving to the next point. The Soundtrack of this game. It is another masterpiece within a masterpiece. The atmospheric scenes created with the sound, the battle music. It is all next level and truly is something so underrated. There have been a number of times where I just stopped, just to listen to the music. Even side-missions like with a particular Bard in a particular grove has an entire cinematic scene dedicated to the music and it is just awe-inspiring. Just stop for a moment and think just how much went into making that one scene. That is the type of love and dedication that the studio put into this game and you just don't often see that anymore. 

The World feels alive. You go into a Grove, or you go into a town, and it is bustling with NPCs carrying on their routines, having an argument, fighting, training, [b]commenting on something YOU as a player did because they heard about it but have no idea it was you as it was just a rumor[/b] and are having this conversation [b]with another NPC[/b]. Just step back an appreciate that and think about how much effort was made for the game to adjust itself to one of the tons of different ways you could have done/accomplished/failed something.

Combat - combat also is rewarding. There are so many different options, use your environment, perhaps you picked up some barrels from the tutorial zone and have been holding onto them since the beginning of the game and decide you want to toss them into the battlefield and detonate them, or maybe you been lugging around some barrels of alcohol that you now want to utilize on the field. Go for it. Maybe you bit off more than you can chew and need to make a tactical retreat. Combat is so dynamic, there is no ""set-way"" to do something. Your options are numerous. Maybe you do want to just truck through everyone and don't want to think tactically. Sure go right ahead. The mechanics themselves are intricate, with the different damage types, resistances, buffs, debuffs, etc. All within the nature of Dungeon and Dragons. 

The Story - it is yours to craft and how you get to the end is up to you. It is detailed, it is interesting, it has its twists and turns that will make you say ""no way,"" ""are you serious,"" ""I knew it,"" and the list goes on and on but you are the one who creates the story.

[h1]TLDR[/h1]
If you are looking for a full and complete game with wonderful music, a studio that cares about their community base and product, great mechanics and an outstanding story that you create with your decisions and you can look past some minor over-sights in a game of this magnitude and slight performance issues that are actively being worked on then Baldur's Gate 3 is for you and you will get your money's worth, with or without any DnD experience.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"I will spare you of a long explanation.

- This is more like Gerty than Vampire Survivors.
- There is no multiplayer. You're going to have to wait for DRG Rogue Core for that.
- If you played the demo, you'll notice that the game has become harder and the grinding for upgrades will be a lot longer.
- Supply Pods now require cleaning of the landing zone before arriving. A bit annoying at first but manageable once you get some upgrades and/or know how to make the bugs clean the area for you.
- The bosses at the end of each one the 5 stages of the run have a ""Stonger Enemies and Spawn new Enemies"" Trigger during their battles. You can't take your time to kill them anymore and this trigger can be activated multiple times.
- There's still a chance that you will die on the first floor of the first stage on Hazard 1 more than once (The devs have slightly nerfed Haz 1 difficulty on Feb 15th). Don't get frustrated with that.
- Cryo is OP.
- Lootbugs can only be killed with the Pickaxe. They will block your shots and WILL block your path while the Dreadnought prepares their 100+ damage jumping attack.
- Golden Lootbugs are really rare in this game.

I think these are the most important things to know before buying. i suggest waiting for the game to leave Early Access if more than one of those keypoints bother you.

The current early access feels so much nicer to play from the demo people got access to last year! Like, that was fun too but overall the gameplay loop is much smoother and the fact that there's biomes and more to unlock is amazing.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"I want to love this game but beyond the mining and destructible environment (which is very satisfying and a cool mechanic), the gameplay is just so boring. There is SO MUCH POTENTIAL here that is not being used and it's just a little sad. Play Brotato instead. Much more variety and replayability there
Pros
- Mining is a fun and unique mecahnic
- Can play with one hand while still being engaging
- Visuals and sound are great
Cons
- Guns feel very uninspired. I haven't unlocked ALL of them, but 11 hours and about 15 victories in, they're just kinda boring
- Meta Progression is slow and boring. Yay another 2% damage increase or 4% pickup radius...
- Overclocks are underwhelming and the fact that you usually have to waste a run to even get them is ridiculous. Like, 25% more damage and reload speed? That's like two levels worth of upgrades and you get about 40+ levels per run or more. 
- Artifacts are the only thing so far that seem to actually affect the way you play your run in a meaningful way. And even then, there's only a few that do that. And you can't reroll them either for some reason
- You NEVER feel overpowered. In a rogue-lite, that's the most satisfying thing, finding a fun combo that makes you feel strong. That doesn't happen here. The  most satisfying and powerful way of clearing enemies is when an exploding enemy makes a chain reaction with other exploding enemies. Why can't YOUR BUILD do that instead of it being in every wave by default, making whatever build  you chose kind of meaningless? 
- Characters do not feel very different. The driller for instance starts with +20% mining speed. You can get that from ONE upgrade. All the characters are just a few upgrades away from each other. Sucblasses are sometimes unique but rarely affect the way you play.

Some things I would like to see:
- More unique weapons or weapon synergies
- Better upgrades. Small stat increases are just boring if that's all there is. What about On-Crit modifiers or element combinations, different mining bonuses other than just speed and resources
- Make the characters more unique
- I hate the overclocking unlock mechanic. Just change it or make the overclocks available on the run you level the weapon

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"I'm sorry but this is just not a good game in its current state. I want to like it, but it just doesn't hold a candle compared to the other bullet heavens/survivor-likes on the market. 

The game has nothing going for it other than branding and graphics.

None of the items do cool stuff together or synergise particularly well together, other than occasionally being upgraded by the same upgrade (such as 'increase rate of fire of all medium type weapons').

The upgrades are boring and uninventive, I've played almost 2 hours and haven't seen a single upgrade that wasn't one of:
- increasing damage
- increasing rate of fire
- increasing reload speed
- a combination of the above
- ""overclocks"", which are special upgrades at lv6/12/18 that something slightly different like change the damage type but still don't really change the gameplay substantially

Most egregiously, the meta-progression is basically non-existent which is a slap-in-the-face to the entire genre. You do a bunch of runs and collect a bunch of resources just to go into the upgrade page and increase your damage by 4%, or EXP gain by 2%, or pickup radius by 4%. The unlocks that come along the way in terms of new guns and characters and such are okay, but take way too long to unlock and you have to go out of your way in runs to unlock them (unlike other games where unlocking them feels exciting because you did it incidentally and they genuinely bring something new to the table).

The game has no feeling of progression or becoming broken as the run goes on - it plays more or less the same 2 minutes into a run as it does 20 minutes. The closest thing you can get to a chain reaction of killing enemies is if there happens to be an explodey enemy in the swarm and it kills the others, so you don't even get the satisfaction out of it as you would in other games.

Hoping they improve the synergy of the weapons and upgrades available, as well as the meta progression (upgrade page). Give us more projectiles, or chaining projectiles, or anything remotely interesting beyond just tweaking numbers.

Overall a bland, forgettable experience.","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",sorry not_a good state hold candle compared bullet heaven survivor like market branding graphic item cool stuff synergise particularly occasionally upgraded upgrade increase rate fire medium type weapon upgrade boring uninventive 2 hour single upgrade increasing damage increasing rate fire increasing reload speed combination overclocks special upgrade lv6 12 18 slightly different damage type substantially egregiously meta progression basically non existent slap face entire genre bunch run collect bunch resource upgrade page increase damage 4 exp gain 2 pickup radius 4 unlocks along term gun character okay long unlock run unlock unlike game unlocking feel exciting incidentally genuinely bring table no_feeling progression broken go play 2 minute 20 minute closest chain reaction killing enemy happens explodey enemy swarm kill others satisfaction game hoping improve synergy weapon upgrade available meta progression upgrade page projectile chaining projectile remotely interesting tweaking number bland forgettable
2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"A resounding ""meh"" from me so far.

1. It's not fun. This game is difficult and stressful. Other ""survivors""-style games tend to have a nice flow between power fantasy and razor's edge success. They're fun but still challenging, making you want to try again and again. After 8 hours of gameplay and unlocks in this game, each run leaves me either feeling unfulfilled or frustrated.

2. Dives are too short for the progression path. A successful mission takes about 15 minutes to complete. While that is a great amount of time for this style of game, the entirety of that 15 minutes is spent desperately trying to stay ahead of the difficulty curve. By the time my upgrades and gear start feeling powerful, I'm already on the final boss and it's over.

3. Upgrades and weapons are bland. Perhaps I'm spoiled by this game's competition in the genre, but the weapons and upgrades available here feel lackluster. If this was an isometric ARPG, these weapons would feel right at home. As a ""survivors"" genre game, they're not very exciting. With few exceptions, you shoot bullets and throw grenades. 

4. The mining mechanic feels out of place. Each level takes place on an island which you will regularly skirt the edges of during normal gameplay. Throughout the levels are walls that you can mine to dig tunnels and find resources. This is a really neat feature, but I feel like it is implemented poorly, given the island level design. If levels were larger or even procedural, this mechanic would feel so much cooler than it currently does. You don't have time to plan and dig out a ""maze"" similar to a tower-defense game. Also, a surprising amount of the weapons are directional-based. If you're mining a wall, you're not facing monsters, and if you're not facing monsters, you're not attacking. 

Overall, the game is alright. It looks great, runs well, and has a gameplay loop you'd expect. Compared to its competitors in the ""survivors"" genre, I'd suggest you spend your money elsewhere. If those other games aren't hardcore enough for you, give this one a try, it might be what you're looking for.","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",resounding meh far 1 not_fun difficult stressful survivor style game tend nice flow power fantasy razor edge success fun challenging 8 hour unlocks leaf feeling unfulfilled frustrated 2 dive short progression path successful mission take 15 minute complete great style entirety 15 minute spent desperately trying stay ahead difficulty curve upgrade gear feeling powerful already final bos 3 upgrade weapon bland perhaps spoiled competition genre weapon upgrade available lackluster isometric arpg weapon home survivor genre not_very exciting exception shoot bullet throw grenade 4 mining mechanic feel take island regularly skirt edge normal throughout level wall mine dig tunnel resource neat implemented poorly given island design level larger procedural mechanic cooler currently plan dig maze similar tower defense surprising weapon directional based mining wall not_facing monster not_facing monster not_attacking alright look great run loop expect compared competitor survivor genre suggest spend elsewhere game hardcore
2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"It's... A game. Sadly doesn't stack up very well against others in the ""survivor"" genre. Almost 2 hours into the game and 6-7 runs and there is no sense of becoming more powerful or unlocking anything fun. 

All the guns so far just have a variation of the same bullet projectile. You have to waste a run leveling them to the point where you unlock overclocks for them, because those overclocks won't appear until the next run. Balancing is very bad, it takes way too much time to kill bugs even when focusing damage upgrades, meta progression is too small to matter as other reviews have pointed out.

The game is at odds with itself. You're supposed to mine minerals to get meta upgrades, or gold and nitra to buy upgrades between floors. Doing the supply pod event gives you some fairly worthless upgrades. Doing anything but fighting and xp grabbing wastes your extremely limited time on each floor. Same for the bonus objectives, by floor 3 or 4 they're barely worth half an XP level and you've spent the entire time conjuring up a floor full of bugs that you haven't been attacking while gathering things, and you get overwhelmed. If you instead focus entirely on fighting bugs, you end up having to kite massive hoards around to get your XP back, because they're too spongy to shoot through, which is super punishing because you only spend a few minutes on each floor. You might only get one lap in before the boss spawns. The moment the boss spawns, it stays stuck right to you and you're practically forced to kill it, which triggers a 30 seconds timer to leave. The timer is so short that you practically have to drop whatever you're doing and suicide run to the drop pod. Goodbye leftover materials, goodbye big XP pools.

It's impossible to do everything at once comfortably, that the game demands from you. You're just left unsatisfied no matter what you invest time in during a run. Need to mine? You need digging speed upgrades. Now you're short on the already abysmal damage upgrades. Need to damage enemies? Kite enemy hoards to try and grab the xp behind them, and now you get trapped in a bad peninsula of void surrounding you kiting enemies and can't escape at the edges and die because digging is too slow.

It is a bad feeling that your only significant DPS is baiting exploders into chain blowing up a hoard of bugs, and then when the dust settles there's still dozens of praetorians that didn't die, and you can't grab all the XP from the dead grunts without dying or having to kite again. Oh, there's another swarm approaching. Never mind.

This game needs major overhauls to be fun. It feels like an approximation of a survivor game without understand what makes them fun. At launch, I sadly cannot recommend it.","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",sadly stack others survivor genre 2 hour 6 7 run no_sense powerful unlocking fun gun far variation bullet projectile waste leveling unlock overclocks overclocks appear next balancing bad take kill bug focusing damage upgrade meta progression small matter review pointed odds supposed mine_emphasizedrals meta upgrade gold nitra upgrade floor supply pod event give fairly worthless upgrade fighting xp grabbing waste extremely limited floor bonus objective floor 3 4 barely worth half xp spent entire conjuring floor bug attacking gathering thing overwhelmed focus entirely fighting bug kite massive hoard xp spongy shoot super punishing spend minute floor lap bos spawn moment bos spawn stay stuck practically forced kill trigger 30 second timer leave timer short practically drop whatever suicide drop pod goodbye leftover material goodbye big xp pool impossible comfortably demand you_emphasized left unsatisfied no_matter invest mine digging speed upgrade short already abysmal damage upgrade damage enemy kite enemy hoard grab xp trapped bad peninsula void surrounding kiting enemy escape edge die digging slow bad feeling significant dp baiting exploders chain blowing hoard bug dust settle s_emphasizedtill dozen praetorian die grab xp dead grunt dying kite oh swarm approaching never_mind need major overhaul fun feel approximation survivor understand make fun launch sadly cannot_recommend

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a Vampire Survivors spin-off from Ghost Ship Publishing and is a smokescreen in terms of data collection. Extensive data is collected for the title without users being able to object.

[h1]What Does This Product Do?[/h1]
Upon starting the game, various trackers and geodata services by Unity Technologies are activated, collecting comprehensive data from players. The issue here is that customers are only informed about this behavior within the product itself, by then it's too late. Data is gone. There is also an opt-out option in the settings (thanks to my previous review of Deep Rock Galactic, the developers learned), but this feature is meaningless for the aforementioned reason and users are still tracked with disabled ingame placebo options!

[h1]Who Operates the Product?[/h1]
Ghost Ship Publishing

Ghost Ship Publishing is a subsidiary of Ghost Ship Games and was founded in 2023. The company is part of the Embracer Group.

[h1]Where Are the Service Providers Located?[/h1]
Ghost Ship Games - Wildersgade 41A, st., 1408 Copenhagen K, Denmark
Google, LLC - 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California, 94043, USA
Unity Technologies - San Francisco, 30 3rd Street, CA 94103, United States

[h1]What Data Is Collected?[/h1]
Too much. A legitimate interest is hardly present here, especially with the data theft occurring as it does.

[b][u]Unity Analytics[/u][/b]

},
""coreBusinessMetrics"" : {
""enabled"" : true,
""timeToWaitForUserInfoS"" : 60
}
},
""performance"" : {
""enabled"" : true
}
}[/code]
The settings indicate that analytics for automation and core business metrics as well as performance measurements are enabled. User tracking is not restricted, and the player has not opted out of tracking (the player doesn't even get to know about it!). It waits up to 60 seconds for user information.

Users should note that these settings are almost universally active in every product with the Unity engine, without users knowing about it, let alone consenting to this data collection. In short, user consent to data collection is akin to data theft, self-legitimized by Unity Technologies.

The core metrics can be deactivated by developers based on the Unity license, but very few do so.

[h1]Privacy Policy/Terms of Use and Opt-Out/In?[/h1]
Nothing is visible on the product page on Steam. Information about product behavior is completely missing.

In summary, ""Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor"" has implemented an extensive tracking and analytics framework that collects detailed user data, including specific events and configurations. While some measures for compliance with data protection regulations are evident, such as consideration for GDPR and CCPA, the collected data and their unique identifiers could potentially lead to individual user identification.

This raises questions about transparency and user consent, as well as the possibility of identification based on collected data, especially since these data are collected prior to in-game consent. An opt-out option in the settings is therefore meaningless.

[h1]Can This Behavior Be Blocked?[/h1]
Unity services can (and should) be completely blocked without affecting the gaming experience. The UnityCrashHandler64.exe or *.32.exe in the installation directory should also be deleted.

How to best describe this game: Underwhelming.

You never feel powerful in this game, even with upgrades you are barely surviving, the game throws constant swarms at you, enemies everywhere, you basically spend most of the time kiting big swarms around, the weapons are not intuitive for this task, you can not aim the game has auto aim and there are weapons that only shoots forward in the direction you are moving combined with weapons that shoot in certain set directions.

Hopefully this game will improve a lot over time but right now the only thing it has going for it is the Deep Rock Galactic aesthetic.

Even at it's lowest difficulty (Hazard 1), this new version is balanced around having multiple Weapon Overclocks unlocked. Unlocking Weapon Overclocks, however, takes a LOT of tedious grinding. Be prepared to throw away dozens of runs just for these Overclock unlocks. 

The worst part is - those runs you've use to unlock Overclocks? You won't get to use those Overclocks for that run - enjoy your level 12 squirt gun and better luck next time!

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"This game is about as satisfying as... Wrestling a greased pig? 

Upgrades — the ones you get from levelling up during a dive, AND the meta ones you purchase on the main menu — just feel like they do nothing and have no variety or synergy, what [i]should[/i] be fodder enemies are way too tanky, and I'm pretty sure said enemies also scale their stats each level, ultimately obsoleting the already awful upgrades.

I know it's early access, but it feels like the game has somehow progressed backwards from the previous demo.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"It's just not a good game in the current state. It's as if the devs have played vanilla Vampire Survivors when it released and not a single different game in the genre that has released since. It's lacking a lot of QoL that other games have implemented and doesn't innovate nearly enough to compensate for this. The mining mechanic is an ok gimmick but gets old really fast, especially since the rushing of levels never allows you to fully explore the mining aspect anyway. On the flipside, sessions are still quite long, but you're constantly being rushed, leaving XP left and right because pickup range and magnets are way too rare. I'm also puzzled about the lack of weapon synergies that almost every other game in the genre has, but at the same time not having a single decent wave clear weapon on the characters. This seems like such an obvious thing to include, especially since you're getting perma swarmed by trash on higher Hazard levels even outside of swarms. On that same note, I wonder how the base DRG movement skills have not made it into this game, when you notice and get frustrated by the lack thereof after playing 1-2 games. 

All in all, it's a very meh game in a genre with plenty of really good games that are even cheaper than this one at that.","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_a good state vanilla vampire survivor released not_a single different genre released lacking qol game implemented innovate nearly compensate mining mechanic ok gimmick get old fast especially rushing level never_allows fully explore mining aspect anyway flipside session long constantly rushed leaving xp left pickup range magnet rare puzzled lack weapon synergy genre not_having single decent wave clear weapon character obvious include especially perma swarmed trash higher hazard level outside swarm note wonder base drg movement skill not_made notice frustrated lack thereof 1 2 game meh genre plenty good game cheaper

Having played Vampire Survivors and Halls of Torment, I will say this game falls short of both but has a nice shiny DRG coat of paint on it that gives it some charm. Endpoint character progression in this feels less god-like than in the previous two mentioned games. There are also several frustrations I have with the core mechanics of the game that make me not recommend this game.

1) Each level is on a strict timer because of the drop pod. If you miss the drop pod at the end of the level, you automatically fail. Because of this timer, the foremost goal isn't actually to kill the enemies, it's to complete your objective and gather minerals. Enemies exist as a barricade between you and your next objective/mineral. I strongly feel this is antithetical to this genre.

2a) Aimed attacks with keyboard movement. Certain guns fire where the playing is looking, or in the case of the Gunner's first default minigun, fires only when looking at an enemy. Keyboard movement lacks the radial precision for this type of gameplay, being that WASD can only move in eight directions. This is exacerbated by the following problem.

2b) Aimed attacks with mining mechanic. Mining requires the player to be facing a mineral or a wall. As such, two core mechanics are in direct opposition with each other. Similar to point 1, rather than encouraging the player to kill enemies AND get stronger, you must choose between killing enemies OR getting stronger. I find this frustrating design.

3) Weapon overclocking is poorly structured. Unlocking new weapons should feel exciting but feel underwhelming to use because they are grossly underpowered until you fully level one up in a single run. Only on subsequent runs is a weapon fun to use. It feels like you are encouraged to sandbag a run just to level up a weapon to max before having fun with it. I think this is poor design, as this structure undercuts the exciting feeling of unlocking new weapons.

4) Meta-progression is not exciting. Surviving an entire run just to upgrade my meta-progression reload speed by +2% or my movement speed by +2% is not exciting. There is no variety in these progressions: no extra projectiles, no increased damage of a specific elemental type, no upgrades to Bosco, not even a revive that is common to this genre of games. I do not excitedly look forward to my next meta-progression upgrades; I upgrade because there's a red icon that says I can.

5) This is a minor gripe but within the context of Deep Rock Galactic, movement in this game is poor. In Deep Rock Galactic, each class has a unique way to traverse the tunnels: scout has a quick grappling hook, gunner has a slow but permanent zipline, engineer can create stairs or close gaps, driller can terraform many times faster than the others. I think not adapting each class's unique traversal to this game is a mistake.","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",rock stone vampire survivor hall torment fall short nice shiny drg coat paint give charm endpoint progression feel god previous mentioned game frustration core mechanic not_recommend 1 strict timer drop pod miss drop pod automatically fail timer foremost goal kill enemy complete objective gather mineral enemy exist barricade next objective mineral strongly antithetical genre 2a aimed attack keyboard movement certain gun fire case gunner default minigun fire enemy keyboard movement lack radial precision type wasd move eight direction exacerbated following problem 2b aimed attack mining mechanic mining requires facing mineral wall core mechanic direct opposition similar 1 rather encouraging kill enemy stronger choose killing enemy stronger frustrating design 3 weapon overclocking poorly structured unlocking weapon exciting underwhelming grossly underpowered fully single subsequent run weapon fun feel encouraged sandbag weapon max fun poor design structure undercut exciting feeling unlocking weapon 4 meta progression not_exciting surviving entire upgrade meta progression reload speed 2 movement speed 2 not_exciting no_variety progression no_extra projectile no_increased damage specific elemental type no_upgrades bosco not_even revive common genre game not_excitedly look forward next meta progression upgrade upgrade red icon say 5 minor gripe context deep rock galactic movement poor deep rock galactic class unique traverse tunnel scout quick grappling hook gunner slow permanent zipline engineer create stair close gap driller terraform time faster others not_adapting class unique traversal mistake

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"A fun game, with unskippable intros. Well worth the launch price I'd say, more than that I'm not sure.

Here is what I know from some limited play today and previous experience in the demo.

As an overall look, this game doesn't play like most other action-roguelite autobattler games, it doesn't seem to perform the usual twist or synergy weapon dynamics that most of this genre use to let the player go from struggle of ""barely holding them off"" to the fast and frantic ""armies die under my crazy magic fireball goose boots mwahaha!"".

This game is pretty much all uphill struggle. Sometimes you level up fast enough to feel like you're getting powerful, but it never lasts long.

BASICS:
You move with the WASD and/or arrow keys. Attacking is automatic when enemies are in range/line of sight. Digging is automatic as you press against rocks or resources, though I have noticed that sometimes it will stop if you don't keep pressing yourself into the thing that you are mining.

You spawn with a side objective such as ""mine morkite"", which is optional but rewards decently for completion, you should find resources and start mining everything available that you can until the boss spawns. Small minion-type bugs spawn frequently and wander toward you, your dwarf automatically attacks them, they die and drop XP orbs. Kill enough bugs to fill the bar on screen and the boss bug will spawn and come after you.

Bug spawn rate increases over time and you get more types appearing as well, especially as you hit the swarm timer milestones. If you take too long to kill the boss (a bit too busy mining are we?) all bugs get stronger, over and over again until you squish the big bad. Once the bossbug goes squish you get 30 seconds to escape to the drop pod amidst the remaining swarm, or it'll leave without you.

Once you reach the last level of the run there is a big boss to kill

PER-RUN PROGRESSION:
Collecting XP makes your per-run level go up, each level up gives you a choice of random upgrades and every so often you get to add another weapon to your arsenal. All weapons fire at the same time, each at their own pace and with independent aim and reload timings.

Some of the upgrades make your weapon(s) increase in level, and every so-many weapon levels you get to choose 1 of 2 random overclocks to add (if you have unlocked them for that weapon). Sadly sometimes these limited choices force you to change your weapon in a way you didn't want, but even an undesired choice brings its own benefits.

There are announced supply drop-pods which will provide unique per-run boosts such as gaining XP every time you take damage, and otherwise-unattainable benefits. These show up as a circular ping on the map if you are near the drop point. Upon reaching them you will need to A) clear all rocks and other fixed obstacles in the circle shown, and B) stay in the circle until the icon fills, which takes a few seconds. The drop pod will crush and push back nearby enemies, then just touch it to claim your free thingy.

Between levels you are afforded a chance to buy from a larger selection of upgrades using your gold and nitra (the red gold), as well as refill your health if you really need it. You can buy as many of these as you can afford and don't be afraid to reroll the remaining options if you have plenty of gold left.

META PROGRESSION (between runs):
As your class' meta/persistent level increases you gain access to more varied resources appearing in each run, and more weapons are unlocked to choose from when increasing your arsenal.

Meta progression is performed via the UPGRADE menu where you can improve different global stats such as overall reload speed, mining speed, critical hit chance and so on. These upgrades cost both credits and some of the unique resources you will find on your run, though you can also buy/sell resources within the upgrade menu if you have an abundance of one thing and not enough of another. The benefits provided from this menu are both diminishing and extremely expensive toward the top end. Definitely a feature in need of rebalance.

OTHER STUFF (notes):
The timer (it's a kill-counter) feels very tight at the start play, though no doubt that limit will become much easier to work with as meta progression is achieved.

Unfortunately at the start of a run it is rather easy to fall into a cycle where you are unable to damage the boss because there are too many minions in the way, and because you don't kill him fast enough all the aliens get stronger over and over, leading to more minions which just get harder and harder to kill. Don't hold off on killing the boss too long.

While supply pods are incredibly useful they can be positioned in really precarious places that get you killed, such as surrounded by A LOT of rock which you will probably die clearing if your guns can't hold back the swarm yet.

Take note that if you don't like the choices presented, most choice options in the game can be re-rolled (usually at the cost of a little gold) before you pick one.

Gold seems to be the king resource per-run as it is used for more things than Nitra.

Some of the best upgrades to focus on seem to be reload time (until you have a frequent stream of attacks going) and anything that will improve multiple weapons at once (sometimes you will miss the benefits of these if one or more of your weapons were forced into an elemental overclock, diverging your damage types). But don't overlook basic things like armour, move speed and dig speed too, especially if a rather large bonus pops up. It's not all about the guns....well okay its mostly about the guns.

Lastly, if you don't rock and stone....

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"TLDR: the game loop literally revolves around trying to keep the boss alive so you can gather resources. 

surviving the boss is essentially punished, because it immediately stops any resource gathering. 
this game is about avoiding killing the bosses by accident. pathing through the map so it can't be hit by your bullets. choosing weaponry and upgrades that don't accidentally kill the boss. that's this game. (I played the full demo through in October. they changed none of the core mechanics as I just saw)

-----------------------
horribly bad survivor game. absolutely abysmal. they did not listen to even a word of criticism from the Demo in October. 
none of the garbage design mechanics were changed.

this is NOT a survivors game like Vampire Survivors or Halls of Torment, or Yet Another Zombie Survivors Game (which is *excellent*, absolutely excellent by the way) or any of the many other survivors games.

this is the worst ideas from Deep Rock Galactic put into a game and change the perspective a bit.

why is it not a survivors game?

- you get punished for doing what you're ostensibly trying to achieve:
your goal is not to survive as long as you can, but your goal is a stupid mission objective which is diametrically opposed to what you're trying to do.
your meta progression is tied to the resources you gather and only those resources.
but doing the mission, i.e. killing the bosses , ends the mission. and ends it in a way that can kill you, or leave you unable to do even basic resource gathering. 

it doesn't even make sense inside the lore: your goal should be to extract resources. but the game's rounds end immediately when you get rid of the boss.

and the boss sticks to you like glue, so as soon as it spawns, you'll kill it by accident simply because it always flies to you and makes it impossible to do any thorough mining.

so the game loop literally revolves around trying to keep the boss alive so you can gather resources. which is something so idiotic that everyone realized this immediately in the Demo. so instead of fixing their game, they buy the usual positive reviews.

there is no way anyone who plays this does not figure out within 1 round how insane it is that the game is about keeping bosses alive essentially. and the fun from gathering resources will immediately end if you accidentally kill the boss

the ticking clock at the end is the worst idea I've seen in a game in a long time. it feels like a kick in the balls as a reward after you won. this is the opposite of motivating.

especially in the lore, it's absolutely nonsensical to not let you mine the mission after you've dispatched the threats. this isn't a corp about exterminating aliens. it's about mining ore.

but the game is designed so you can't mine as soon as you do your ""objective""","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",loop literally revolves trying bos alive gather resource surviving bos essentially punished immediately stop resource gathering avoiding killing boss accident pathing map bullet choosing weaponry upgrade accidentally kill bos demo october changed core mechanic saw horribly bad survivor abysmal not_listen word criticism demo october garbage design mechanic changed not_a survivor vampire survivor hall torment zombie survivor excellent excellent survivor game worst idea deep rock galactic perspective bit not_a survivor punished ostensibly trying achieve goal not_to survive long goal stupid mission objective diametrically opposed trying meta progression tied resource gather resource mission e killing boss end mission end kill leave unable basic resource gathering sense inside lore goal extract resource round immediately rid bos bos stick glue soon spawn kill accident simply fly make impossible thorough mining loop literally revolves trying bos alive gather resource idiotic realized immediately demo fixing usual positive review no_way play not_figure 1 round insane keeping boss alive essentially fun gathering resource immediately accidentally kill bos ticking clock worst idea long feel kick ball reward opposite motivating especially lore nonsensical not_let mine mission dispatched threat corp exterminating alien mining ore designed mine soon objective

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"It has the bones of a good game but it needs some serious balance. The maps feel small but that's because you get objectives with no indicator of how to find them, so the map needs to feel confining. Swarms happen too often and too early. Then the bugs get stronger too often in the second half. Supply drops often feel like hassle and currently they risk bugging out with a unclosable window. Level up rewards are pretty generic and boring. 

The Collecting orbs mechanic doesn't feel like it works in this game. You are constantly kiting enemies, trying to dig through walls and making a circle around the giant stage, so often you can't get back to the orbs you dropped until much later. 

The upgrade system doesn't feel good. You have to be on the lookout for rare minerals in the level. They take a while to mine and you need multiples. You also need money, which you can get from objectives but also from selling minerals. So you might want to target mining speed, but that doesn't matter if you don't have the minerals for it. This probably feels better later, but early on it feels bag.

When you finally kill the main enemy of the level, a 30 second countdown starts. It doesn't matter where you are in the level or how bad of condition you are in, you have to make it to the drop pod or you lose instantly.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"I'm not sure I like this game, even though I played it for 4 hours straight at release. I think this could be a good game but it needs a lot of improvements. But I still want to keep playing it, I just don't think I would recommend it to anyone in it's current state.

My two main pros for the game are also it's cons:

1. There is a ton of stuff to unlock, which is awesome. But in my first 4 hours of playtime I felt like I was bogged down trying to unlock stuff rather than actually try to complete the mission successfully. The reason this is an issue I think is because the game is quite hard and does not pull it's punches on the first difficulty! You will be overwhelmed, you will be rushed, you will not be able to finish the level how you want to!

2. It is fairly distinct in the ""vampire survivors"" genre. All the mechanics added in to make it feel like a Deep Rock Galactic mission are all really cool ideas. But I'm not totally convinced that the mechanics are good. Every mission, as soon as the boss is dead, the drop pod will arrive and you have 30 seconds to leave. This leaves you in the weird mindset that you actually do not want to kill the final big bug, because you need to explore the level to collect more resources to help you later in the run. In theory this is perfectly fine and challenging, but in practice it can feel frustrating and not make a lot of sense. The difficulty will quickly ramp up to try and either force you to finish the mission or die.

If you've read this far, buy it anyway.

This game is the worst Survivors clone I've played, including free ones like HoloCure.  I wanted to like it because it has great graphics, but there's nothing fun in it.  The weapons suck and the classes only have minor starting differences, and the enemies/combat are very poorly balanced.

Unfortunately, this game seems to miss what makes the bullet hell genre fun. Its a completely serviceable and polished game. The upgrades are fun. But the current loop and power levels dont make you feel like you've got to play just one more game. 

Nearly every ""Survivor"" like game I play I get completely addicted too. After less than 2 hours, I feel bored of this one already.

Bullet Heaven with a unique feature of 'mining' that lets you alter the world and thus, enemy pathfinding. This makes the map much better than most other games that tend to have boring open areas.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"So far, I'm impressed. 

There are a few minor flaws with balancing and whatnot, but Ghost Ship has always excelled at listening to critique, so I trust most of these will be patched by the time the full version drops. 

DRG: Survivor is fun and engaging. In my opinion, it toes the line between needing to ""sweat"" and ""I am become death"" very well. I've obviously not played all that much (especially compared to the time I've sunk into the original) but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. For an early access game, it looks fantastic and runs better than most v.1 games. 

With regard to flaws, the only glaring one is that I seem to be progressing rather quickly. I think veterans of this genre might find it a bit easy or perhaps just short. But I say this knowing that it's not yet finished, so I'm not too bothered by it at present. 

Many people seem to have a problem with the difficulty level, but I don't feel the same at all. I'm most impressed by the games ability to make each class feel unique and therefore more memorable. I think it's excellent thus far and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future.

2321470,Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor,"The biggest positive for me is that it's DRG and the charm of a brand that I like a lot is very present.
As a horde survival game it's pretty mediocre and due to the lack of unique upgrades and variation it becomes pretty same-y after a few runs.

Percentage based stat upgrades just don't give you the satisfaction that the unique upgrades of other games bring, which come with significant modifications to weapons and overall playstyle. While a 10% damage upgrade makes the hit number a few digits bigger, it's just not really the same feeling.

In these types of games I'm looking for a bit of power fantasy somewhere down a run. In DRGS I'm mostly being chased around by way too many enemies that feel sponge-y and most of the time don't die because of my weapons but due to a chain of Bulk Detonators exploding, which have stacked up over 3 hordes.

It's still a moderately fun game to play, but if I had to look at it from the perspective of someone not invested into the DRG franchise, there are lots of other options in this genre that are a lot more satisfying to play.","Very Positive82% of the 4,735 user reviews for this game are positive.",biggest positive drg charm brand present horde survival pretty mediocre due lack unique upgrade variation pretty run percentage based stat upgrade satisfaction unique upgrade game bring significant modification weapon playstyle 10 damage upgrade make number digit bigger not_really feeling type game bit power fantasy drgs m_emphasizedostly chased enemy sponge die weapon due chain bulk detonator exploding stacked 3 horde s_emphasizedtill moderately fun look perspective someone not_invested drg franchise lot option genre satisfying

899770,Last Epoch,"So I bought this for myself last week as an avid ARPG enthusiast with well over 2000 hours on Path of Exile and god knows how long on D2 back in the day, I blink, and 50 hours have passed. This game shows phenomenal promise, the devs are super active and pumping out content and fixes at a rapid rate and have been faithfully following the roadmap plan.

Last Epoch is far easier to get into than PoE, with a much more approachable passive and active skill system. Every weapon type can be used by every class which allows for some juicy build diversity, there's plenty of synergy between skills and passives and all upgrade points feel rewarding with a satisfying bump in power. 

Let's go over some pro's:

- Tons and tons of character customisation, got all the basic equipment, rings, belts, amulets and idols, a neat item that provide powerful buffs to stats. A 4x4 grid is provided to arrange idols in whatever way you want, with smaller idols providing smaller or more generic buffs such as flat health or a small % increase to fire damage, and larger idols providing big specific buffs such as % lightning damage but the value is doubled if you have over 300 max mana. These idols allow for a lot of extra customisation. 
- Enjoyable story campaign with good voice acting on top, granted the story isn't fully completed yet but I had fun! Time travel, cosmic horror, many biomes and environments, immortal emperors and imperious gods! What's not to like?
- Telegraphed enemy attacks!!! Words cannot describe how gratifying it is to see where the massive void bomb thrown at you is actually going to land, allowing you to dodge or time your defensive abilities accordingly. And if/when you do die, there's a death screen showing you what attack you died to and what damage type/s that attack dealt.
- An approachable deterministic crafting system is something PoE has been crying out for, and thankfully LE provides. Yes it does still require some luck, but basically how it works is thus; you find affix shards all over the place as a lootable ground item which provide a single use ""craft"" to forge onto an item or to improve an existing roll. Every possible affix can drop as a shard, or you can shatter an item with an affix you want to apply to another item and get a random amount of shards back from all the affixes on the shattered item. It's easy to play around with, and shards fly out of mobs and barrels so there's plenty to experiment with! The highest tier rolls (T7) are drop only, with item forging allowing a maximum affix tier of 5 so you can't fully power a basic roll therefore keeping loot valuable late-game. Fracturing an item prevents it from being modified anymore, and can even lower your affix tiers so it's basically a game of chicken if you want to upgrade your item more and more.
- The Monolith of Fate is a solid endgame grind, allowing you to unlock permanent character upgrades upon completing the mini quest lines contained with each Monolith stage. Endless Arena keys can drop from the Monolith loot chest allowing you to challenge the appropriately named Endless Arena against waves of mobs providing a good chunk of xp.
- Advanced affix descriptions provide a description of an affix, for example ""chance to inflict shock"" is a possible item affix, and if you hold ""alt"" while hovering over the item it will tell you exactly what shock does. All the defensive mechanics show the maths behind them. Basically the game is exceptionally well explained! 
- Level setting, backgrounds and atmosphere are top-notch and the End of Time ""town"" has a freaking black hole in the background which is cool as fuck.

Consequentially there are some cons:

- Gold isn't particularly useful yet, and items aren't worth picking up to sell as you get plenty from it dropping from mobs and breakables. However I imagine when the bazaar is introduced and allows player trading it will become much more useful!
- You can't modify uniques or set items which can be annoying if you get one with low rolls or implicits.
- While the game does run well generally, some skills and enemy attacks do slow the framerate down particularly the big screen size ones that can be used repeatedly. 
- No random terrain generation, as in if you run ""shining cove"" multiple times, the zone layout is the same every time. Personally I don't mind this but it could get a bit same-y doing the same layout over again.

Overall, Last Epoch has incredible potential and is already a super fun ARPG with a good story, great itemisation, satisfying character upgrades through levelling and item upgrades and a great dev team who deserve your support. Give it a shot, as if Last Epoch is kept true to form and continually supported I can see it challenging Grim Dawn, Torchlight, Diablo and hell even Path of Exile!","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

As for negative reviews complaining that development is slow. It's not like they're some massive triple A studio that can pump out games at will. They're just a group of remote indie devs. I rather them take this route and make sure they release a proper and polished game, instead of an unfinished mess like Wolcen.

899770,Last Epoch,"Just as a reminder this is a review during Early Access. Some things will change before 1.0 Release version.
I'm Playing during 8.1 March 18, 2021, and have played since sometime around 7.0. 
The game is an Action RPG like Diablo 2, Titan Quest, and Path of Exile. It has many things that the players would like in this genre. 
Classes Types (this is not class names in the game, but the general role they fill).  Necromancer, Wizard, Warrior/Paladin, Druid, Ranger. These classes have 1 base class, and 3 specialization trees within them that help you play the game in a way you may enjoy. Each with abilities that unlock once you advance, while also helping you define your character and playstyle further.
Lots of Abilities to choose from and alter through their ability skill trees.

Gear, and Gear Crafting. Not only do they have a large range of Armors and weapons, but you can also craft a more defined piece of gear. Some higher end gear or gear sets may help define a build you are playing.

Gear Gambling. A merchant that lets you gamble away your gold on a possible item. Helpful at later stages of the game. 

A decent challenge from both normal monsters all the way up to the various bosses within both the story of the game and end game content.  

Things That Are currently missing but are being added/ worked on and can be read on their Roadmaps.
Multiplayer, More content and bosses for story and end game, Other gear options, More abilities, More class trees. (The game is currently missing 3-5 Talent trees for the current available classes)

I do not know about PvP. Seeing as how I am not personally interested in it. From what I can tell It is not currently in the game. You will have to do this research on your own.

I personally enjoy the game even in its current state, which does feel a little lacking, but not by much. Another note. The company is rather helpful and communicates with its player base.

899770,Last Epoch,"As many of you reading and playing this game, I am a veteran of Diablo 2, 3, Path of Exiles, Grim Dawn, Torchlight, etc. etc. I have been playing Last Epoch off and on now for a year or so, and it is without a doubt one of the most consistently enjoyable games in the genre. 

The depth of customization of skills alone is unmatched, but not only that, it is incredibly accessible and beginner friendly. Skills and nodes are clearly tagged with related stats and attributes, letting new and veteran players know what their gear should look like in order to get the most out of them. 

I believe this game straddles the fine line between Path of Exile's overwhelming passive and skill system and Diablo 3's underwhelming simplicity of both gear and skills with considerable grace. 

I would recommend this game to anyone who feels potentially alienated by the mainstays of the genre, or who is looking for a fresh and rewarding experience. I have found nothing in either PoE or D3 that matches the feeling of finding a new unique or set and beginning to build in your head a character around that item.

899770,Last Epoch,"This game is just like Wolcen, in no way whatsoever. 

This review is specifically about my experience in the game and with the community throughout the Alpha and Beta. With over 500hrs I feel like I am in a unique spot to hightlight the good and the bad. 

First, the price... Even at the current price of $30 or so the game is an absolute steal. For those who choose to wait and not pay a premium for beta access, the game will be $15 at release. The developers have confirmed that the real money shop will be purely cosmetic. 

This game has two major things going for it, the extremely customizable gameplay and very active and transparent Dev team. The development team has been very prompt when it comes to new content. From what I have seen a new patch is out about once a month, and every other patch has major improvements/additions to the gameplay. Devs are not ashamed to push back an update or a feature in order to ensure quality. Don't get me wrong, there are still bugs in the game but they are addressed quickly and usually fixed by the next patch. Overall, probably the best dev team of any game that I have followed closely. 

Now to my second point, customization. As I mentioned, even at the current price you will have no problem getting your moneys worth. There are 5 classes(still missing one, Rouge) and each class has 3 very distinct passive trees. Each different passive tree of every class has 1, if not multiple different possible builds that can be explored(most can be competitive). Now to the truly ""juicy"" part, every single active skill have their own skill tree(excluding some skills  who's skill trees are not released yet) This means that not only do you have a ton of choices when it comes to passives, but you also have the ability to change how fundamentally some of your active skills work. At 500hrs, I still haven't explored all possible builds. Not to mention that there is a ton of content yet to come out which would only add to the game. 

The main question I have seen from people contemplating buying the game is, ""Is it worth the money?"". If you like RPGs you will like this game. You just need to understand that as of right now(Jun 2020) this game is still early access and may not be as polished as other major games of the genre such as PoE, D3, and Grim Dawn which have had years to improve. One thing I have never had to worry about with this game is the solid development and the steady improvements of gameplay and bugs. 

I hope this helps and If you choose to get the game, enjoy!

I like ARPGs since Diablo brought this Genre to life. As a huge Diablo II fan I was waiting for a successor. As many others I was disappointed with Diablo 3. It’s a good game but it cannot follow in the footsteps of D2. Torchlight and Path Of Exile both couldn’t either (for me).

When Last Epoch got my attention I was skeptical towards the presentation of the game. The Graphics were not that impressive and in gameplay videos the combat looked not that smooth.

What convinced me to participate in early access was the Reddit community. There was so much confidence in the skills of the developers and the potential of the game. So I jumped in and I don’t regret it.

[u]I will start with the current issues of the game from my point of view:[/u]

[b]Graphics:[/b]
Although the engine got updates and the game looks ok now the game does not look like state of the art right now. LE is not able to compete with Warhammer or Wolcen not to mention Diablo 4 or Path Of Exile 2. The same goes with the physics – not state of the art.

I am sure there will be additional updates and tweaks but I don’t expect LE to transform into a visual blockbuster. 

[b]Gameplay / Combat:[/b]
The combat actually feels not as smooth as in other games. But this is something the devs work on with improving animations, effects and sounds. This definitely will change till full release.

[b]Performance:[/b]
There are many complaints of people with high end systems that the game has low fps and stutters. This is a problem right now that the devs prioritize, but it is not solved, yet. The weird thing is that I don’t have a high end system and are playing at maximum settings without issues – rare fps drops but far away from being unpleasing.

[b]Content:[/b]
Because I am writing this preview about the actual state of the game right now during Beta and Early Access this is an issue. The story is not finished, yet. Not all announced classes are implemented. There is no multiplayer. There is no pvp. The endgame content after completing the game is not implemented. There are two endgame game modes, Monolith and Arena. According to the devs the Arena is just a placeholder and Monolith is not what the devs want it to be when it is finished.

On the LE homepage you can look up what is planned for release. This sounds promising but many of those mechanics are not implemented.

So why do I think that this game is worth its money at its current state? Because the game really has so much potential. [u]Here come the pros that outweigh all the issues:[/u]

[b]Variety of classes:[/b]
There are 5 base classes that divide into 3 sub classes each. Even with the subclasses the playstyle changes drastically within a base class. The classes feel very unique and are very well thought out

[b]Skill trees (Passives):[/b]
There is one passive skill tree for each base class and one additional passive skill tree for each sub class. With every character level you get 1 skill point you can spend in that skill trees. With progression in those skill trees you also unlock active skills that are specific for the subclasses. For Example: By spending points in the Necromancer skill tree (Necro=subclass of Acolyte) you can unlock the skill “Summon Skeleton Mages”.

At some point in the story you have to permanently choose a subclass. This provides some passive bonuses as well as a subclass specific skill. While you can still spend points in all skill trees of a base class you can only choose one profession. This decision is permanent. All passive skill points can be respeced.
The level cap is 100 and there are quests that grant additional skill points.

[b]Skill trees (Skills):[/b]
Every active skill has its own skill tree. These skill nodes provide passive bonuses for the skills like increased critchance, damage and stunchance (and so on..) as well as playstyle changers. For example a melee attack can be altered to be cast at range (Sentinel/Forge Guard - Forge Strike).

You can specialize in 5 skills at a time. You earn skill points by getting xp. But you level your skills separated from your character level (passive skill points). You can respec single skill points or despecialise the complete skill to choose another skill to level. In both cases you lose you progression and have to relevel skill points. But this goes relatively fast and even more the higher your level is.

[b]Variety of builds:[/b]
There are myriads of builds and variations, countless synergies between skills and passives. It’s like an ARPG sandbox where you can build every kind of character you can think of. It’s fun to theory craft exotic builds that are viable at higher levels. This is where the meta game begins.

[b]High complexity:[/b]
LE’s set of rules is very complex. If you take a look at the character sheet you will see 4 tabs of stats (damage, defensive, minion and other stats) with 81 different stats (e.g. health on hit, slow chance, increased minion health generation or spell critical strike multiplier) on top of the general stats like health or fire protections.

There are 7 different damage types and additional defenses like chance to receive a glancing blow or block protection.

To get behind all these mechanics you have to spend a fair amount of time read the tooltips carefully and spend some time on the forums to read some guides and tips.

For me this is the most important argument to play the game. The very high complexity is what makes LE outstanding compared to all other games.

[b]Items / Crafting:[/b]
There are different rarities of items with up to 4 affixes per item that improve its stats. There is a crafting system where you can add affixes to items and / or upgrade them to a certain level.

There are unique items that have stats that change your playstyle or require a specific character alignment to fully develop their potential.

[b]Developers:[/b]
Eleventh Hour Games does an awesome job. The devs are very responsive. They discuss many aspects of the game with the community. They take criticism and suggestions very seriously and react to the player’s opinion.

There is a very good [url=https://forum.lastepochgame.com/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bcd43769917a08a0cdb7e9f530ab435ca08260d5.png] early access forecast [/url]. They adhere to their deadlines and release patches and updates very regularly. Admittedly EHG delayed the release of LE. But this was for a good reason and was well accepted in the community.

You can feel the spirit and that the devs work on this project with much blood, sweat and tears.

I have no doubt that LE will become a very good ARPG. It’s not mainstream. It is for those people that miss complexity in the Genre and want to dive into a game.

899770,Last Epoch,"Hello, 

credentials: 78hrs in Last Epoch, 3000+ hrs in PoE and other top down ARPG's.

My main comparison will be PoE as its the bench mark for the genre but by most means both games are not perfect.

Pros;
- Less Complex that PoE
- Fluid progression
- Easy to understand Game mechanics
- Easy to understand Endgame mapping system 
- Good Graphics
- Good immersion
- Good Music

Cons; 
This is a big one for me but if all you need is the then play the game but i will be doping it. 
- Meta Builds

Explanation: the game developers have selected a couple of abilities from each class that are viable for a beginner player then a several more skill viable once you have an established account e.g. have access to certain unique(s) that change a build from zero to hero. 

My experience is a Sentinel main class with Forge Guard Specialisation sub-class, using the ""Forge Strike"" as my main skill manual casting it.  I use Smite, Sigils of Hope, Ring of Shields, and a controversial shield bash which gets swapped out depending on the end game boss i'm fighting (for the guaranteed stun and block). 

However despite spending 13hrs with about 2hrs of intermediate break so about 11hrs and 39 attempts at killing a boss, the developers show to me that the game is better to play with the meta top 5 to 10 builds for beginners then if you want to play end game pick from the other meta builds once you have obtained the unique from your first build. 

This shows just like PoE despite having 1,000,000 build variants 5 to 10 are given love, then a had-full more. Don't get me wrong I understand the a very good game will require the illusion of diversity, but this game only offers surface level diversity. 

that why on one hand I would recommend the game if you have £30 to spend, but on the other hand you have PoE 2 and Diablo 4 just around the corner, which have promised to improve on these systems. 

thanks for taking the time to read. 

have a good one","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

899770,Last Epoch,"[b]INTRO[/b]
(Review character limit !@#$)

This game is a top down looter/hack and slash ARPG, this review is aimed at those familiar with such games and there will be comparison with Path of Exile and Diablo, as both are THE genre, currently.

So I wont bother explaining basic stuff but rather introduce the plate briefly,
then dive into the ""meat and potatoes"" of the game.

My point of view is someone who has over 1k hours in PoE, 300 in the Diablo franchise, and about 50 into this one 
(Steam hours are misleading, as I have played the game on other accounts as well) Rookie numbers, some might say, and rightly so.

In that case, feel free to add words or provide counter argument to mine. I will also try to keep this review updated as the game continues to develop and grow.

[b]THE PLATE[/b]

First of all I would like to start by saying that the game is absolutely [b]worth[/b] its current price tag (30 euros) in its [b]current[/b] state: Early Access, version 8.1

The game has easily 50-100 hours of pure gameplay content, before any future ""seasons/leagues"" that have already been foreshadowed by the devs, and which will be set in time periods [b]between[/b] the already existing ""leagues"" of its main competitor, PoE.

I feel this is an important topic that needs to be adressed, as these types of games are usually played in ""bursts"" of content updates, alongside other players, in an ""asymmetrical"" competition/cooperation marathon.

There is also currently NO multiplayer but its been scheduled to be included within 2021. The only current form of social features are global/personal chat and friend list. There are also plans to include PvP, but frankly, these games are never balanced or designed around that, so its just an extra side feature.

[b]HARD COMPARISON WITH ESTABLISHED PATH OF EXILE SYSTEMS[/b]

This is the only part of my review where PoE will be mentioned directly.

This is by no means a ""PoE hate rant"", I just want to highlight that there is a very clear difference in systems and design philosophy, permeating through the entirety of the game. Obviously, at the time of writing, and most likely a while longer, this early access title is hardly near the content of one of the most notoriously complex games on the market that is approaching nearly a decade of constant updates.

First of all, you do not need to download a lootfilter or watch several video guides totaling hours to understand and enjoy the majority of the game as a new player. 

This game has learned from both the successes and missteps of the genre, as I feel all games must. It strikes a nice balance between the overwhelming complexity of PoE and the baffling simplicity (that is close to insulting intelligence) of Diablo 3.

Damage numbers! Seeing the constant rise of numbers you deal while progressing through the game is a nostalgic feeling I constantly miss during my PoE playtime.

In the case of lootfilters the game has an excellent and easy way to setup multiple personalized ones, IN GAME. If you really want, you can still download and import a ready one. 
In the case of understanding deep game mechanics, the game has an in game encyclopedia providing even detailed mathematical equations/formulas.

There is also a clear abhorrent of menus-within-menus and constant tedious micro management like constant use of vendor recipes or drag-dropping and switching mechanics like watchstones, scarabs, sextants. 

And designed to avoid clicking and wasting the players time as much as possible like constant re-rolls.

It also features a [b]deterministic crafting system[/b], frankly, the steam review limit is not enough for me to write about that alone.

So unlike Path of Exile, the overwhelming majority of gaming time is meant to be spend [b]ingame[/b], killing/looting stuff rather than constantly alt-tabbing to several browser pages, using external third party apps, crawling throughout tens of stash tabs and calculating percentages to create ""efficiency"".

Also, there are no real-money micro-transactions that provide quality of life stuff, like extra stash tabs or premium stuff that enable or simplify basic gaming concepts like guilds, trading and visual clarity.

And regarding quality of life

Oh 
my 
god

The game is packed with those

If you come from Path of Exile, your wrist will constantly thank you as you play this game.
No flask piano or constantly holding/casting certain abilities (the devs are clearly against that, in terms of design and communication with players)

No unidentified items, no portal scrolls. (portal is a hotkey and items are meant to be constantly upgraded, even during leveling)

Vacuuming ""currency/craft materials"" and autostashing such loot with the click of a button, even outside a stash menu.
As well as a sorting button, both in inventory and stashes.

Its hilarious that this counts as a feature in 2021... but there is even a training dummy and death recap screen!

[b]VISUALS & SOUND[/b]

The game frequently changes tone and setting due to its ""time traveling"" theme. This creates a nice  frequent change of pace.

One moment you are an ancient colorful valley filled with dinosaurs, the other you are in a medieval abandoned town or a post apocalyptic distant future cave complex as humanity has retreated from the surface, seeking refuge down below.

Usually those locations are in the exact same locations set in different time eras and often you can't help but stop and admire visuals and background ""noise"". 

Game speed and visual clarity is at a comfortable place where you can understand whats going on the screen at all times and thats the most important thing in such fast paced games.

The animations especially for the most recent class (Rogue) are very snappy and precise, enemies have good telegraphs and very dangerous moves have very clear areas of effect.

The voice acting and sound design is, in my opinion, the weakest part of the game.

Its not always the case in the entirety of the game but I feel often the voice acting aproaches ""porn quality"".

The music can also be improved vastly, boss themes are reused too much and tracks have small durations, resulting in a repeating, boring ambience.

[b]STRUCTURE & LAST THOUGHTS[/b]

5 classes to choose from, 3 sub-classes to each one.

The level cap is 100, at around 25-30 you choose the subclass, the current ""endgame"" starts at lvl 50-60.

I strongly suggest that you just dive in, you don't need any outside information or build guide for even your first character.

Respeccing is easy and rather cheap, and [b]the only permanent option currently is the master class.[/b]

The game is a joy to play in both Softcore and Hardcore (permadeath) mode.

It does a wonderful job with pacing and introducing mechanics.

It does not insult your intelligence by making you use 1 or 2 abilities for hours, within minutes you will have plenty of choices and most importantly, you will be able to easily switch out and try new stuff on the fly without any significant costs or requirements.

There are obviously passive and skill trees but the game rewards correct movement/positioning and cooldown/resource management more than min maxing and game knowledge.

Managing such aspects and creating synergies such as ""your dash now create shadow clones that mimic your abilities"" is the bread & butter of the game.

If there is one drawback, the leveling is ""too easy"" coming from other games.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

899770,Last Epoch,"Like the lovechild of Diablo and Path of Exile that has the best features of both, Last Epoch is everything I'm looking for in an Arpg.  From the diverse classes, to the unique boss attacks and patterns, to the robust filter--Last Epoch gets all the small details right. However, I have to say it's the intuitive crafting systems for both skills and items that's the real winner. I never liked crafting in other games because it was always buried beneath a byzantine system of checks and balances. Here, they handle crafting as a more WYSIWYG affair. You know what you're getting and, with the items, you know the success probability of it being crafted without a hitch. No more mixing recipes or putting runes in a certain order--do you want to add damage, or speed, or cheaper mana cost. Then by the effing gods that's what you need to find and that's what you craft onto your item. Period.

Once multiplayer is added and the story to completion is added, I literally think this has the foundation to blow 95% of the other Arpg's out of the water--including Grim Dawn and PoE. The barrier for entry is low, but the path to mastery is still long and exciting. In my book that's the winning combination.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

899770,Last Epoch,"So, approaching this as a POE player. There's a lot to like, for one, crafting. In the eternal words of Todd Howard, it just works. It's RNG, yes, but it's RNG in a way that flavors the player. Instead of getting something incredible or something useless, you get something good, or something great. They're adding onto this too, with legendary items becoming a take on the unique system that really shows that the devs are listening, and giving players ways to use build enabling items. 

The combat is weighty, with lots of follow-through and some degree of intentional clunk. This is not path of exile with tailwind and reduced action speed, and it definitely takes some getting used to. But, its fun, and fast. Build variety is immense. The game may not have the enormous skill trees of POE but by focusing on not being a one button game, it enables a lot of variety, and the crafting system means if you want to try something, you can easily make the gear to enable it. Plus, respeccing a character is very easy, meaning changing builds is a cakewalk. 

Endgame wise, it is lacking. The developers are continuely putting effort into this, adding new dungeons and the like, opting for a different system than just reskinned rifts or maps from POE, but with a monolith of fate system that serves that goal as well, albeit one that is outdated at this point, although the devs have spoken on their intentions to update that somewhere down the line. 

The devs get criticism for being slow, especially with regards to multiplayer, which has been coming soon for over a year now, but they're taking their time to get it right. They're open and transparent about it, and if multiplayer is make or break for you, when it comes out, it will be in a working fun state.

If you enjoy diablo 4 for a couple hours, but then end up getting bored and remembering you paid 70$ for that. Buy this for 35$ and let the regret of diablo 4 be a part of your past

Only 10 hours in, I'm at level 46, playin minion necromancer coming from Diablo 4 playing minion necro at level 70. I AM ANNIHILATING EVERYTHING! I HAVE A HORDE BY MY SIDE! EACH OF MY MINIONS HAS THEIR OWN SKILL TREE ON TOP OF MY OWN! MY GOLEM, MY ARCHERS, MY MAGES, MY WRAITHS ARE ALL BURNING WITH AMBITION! IF I SO DESIRE THEY COULD SET THE WORLD ON FIRE! PUT THE WORLD IN A ICY HELL! OR JUST MELT IT ALL AWAY WITH ACID AND POISON! 

In all seriousness, this game is HALF the price of diablo 4 with 20x the build diversity. Each ABILITY has a skill tree. and you have 4 passive trees so less complicated than PoE, more fun than D4. Not to mention the fact the grind is made simpler with the crafting mechanics. Overtime you collect affix shards (minion dmg%, fire dmg%, yada yada) and can just put them on your gear.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

899770,Last Epoch,"Last Epoch has the pacing and difficulty of Diablo 2, with learnings from newer games in the genre such as Path of Exile, Diablo 3, Grim Dawn, etc. Their philosophy steers clear of many of the shortcomings of games like Diablo 3 (gear sets bring the primary focus, 500% damage increases dominating everything, 1 build to rule them all, etc.), and emphasizes build diversity and experimentation without overly harsh penalties for trying something new.

Skill trees and power creep issues currently dominate the 'meta builds' for many classes, but they are making adjustments as patches come through. That doesn't mean it's impossible to play your own unique build, just that there is probably a much easier version of your class that you could play instead. Still, the community continues to experiment and try out interesting new combinations on a regular basis. I'm hopeful that the new subclasses and 'old' class reworks will allow for rebalancing to effectively smooth out the power curve.

End-game needs a massive rework, and is mostly what I would consider 'legacy' at this point. The developers have continued to add new forms of content to the end-game, but have not had the chance to tweak the 'old grind' to match. This leads to your first many hours after the campaign being a slog through slow paced and easily cleared content. Once you clear that though, there are more challenging pieces of content ahead. Randomized modifiers need adjustment, but the overall feel is positive.

Many people continue to wait for the multiplayer patch which has been slated to come out this year. If you're someone who likes to play ARPGs with your friends I would recommend waiting for that patch to come. If you're someone who is willing to learn and play around until multiplayer comes out, there's tons of content and fun experimentation to be had.

Overall, I would rate Last Epoch one of the best modern ARPGs on the market with the potential to be the best once the balance/rework patches and end-game progression tweaks come. Highly recommend.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

899770,Last Epoch,"Normally I wouldn't recommend an Early Access game, but this one is far cheaper than the quality would warrant, and thus, worthy of an exception. Last Epoch already offers solid ARPG gameplay with lots of great core systems. 

The crafting and endgame systems in particular are incredible. It's a breath of fresh air after having dealt with Path of Exile's increasingly grindy and bloated nonsense over the years. I love that rare items only have 2 suffixes and 2 prefixes, which limits the top end power of rare items. Last Epoch allows you to craft in a semi-deterministic manner without the risk of completely breaking your item. You can pretty much guarantee that you get the mods you want on your items, but getting the highest tiers of those mods is subject to randomness with diminishing returns.

The endgame lets you quickly jump into somewhat short maps with a single objective, while building a web of modifiers on them that increase difficulty and reward for the next few maps, and simultaneously fill up a stability bar that lets you engage a boss and move on to the next tier of endgame maps. Much like the crafting, the system is relatively simple, but powerful and satisfying. The difficulty starts out fairly easy, but can scale all the way up to level 100(the character max level) and beyond, so there is content to challenge even the strongest character builds.

In terms of complexity Last Epoch hits the sweet spot between Diablo 3 and Path of Exile. There is great depth to the builds and skill customization, but it's reasonably streamlined, so you can go in blind and experiment on your own. You don't have to spend thousands of hours doing tedious research to create a functional character and get to the endgame. The gameplay is slower and more controlled than Path of Exile, without feeling sluggish. You can actually see what the monsters and bosses are doing, and move out of the way of dangerous attacks. It is fair, and challenging, and you will probably die a few times while learning certain encounters, but you can always just try again without having to arbitrarily farm some randomly dropped item to access the boss again.

Last Epoch has some incredible quality of life features that puts other games in the genre to shame. The in-game loot filter editor is both powerful and intuitive, so you can decide which items you want shown for each individual character. Skill and passive respeccs are very accessible so you can experiment with different builds. Almost any question you could have about game mechanics can be looked up in-game through a nice game guide menu. The tooltips of skills will tell you which item stats you can use to scale their power. There is a target dummy in town so you can test your build's damage numbers.

Last Epoch is still in a fairly early stage of development, but it has already come a long way, and at this rate it is on pace to become a true competitor and rival to both Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2.

899770,Last Epoch,"I recommend the game to any ARPG fan, but it's a ""mild"" recommendation for now. The game has a lot in it, and definitely worth playing, but as I reached the endgame, some things started to bother me more and more. Below, I'll talk about three biggest issues I have with the game, but please keep in mind, as an Early Access game, things might change; I hope they'll change. 

[h1]Map Variety[/h1]
Last Epoch has no procedural map generation. In the endgame, the ""Monolith""s you choose will often feature the same subset of maps, along with same subset of enemy archetypes. You'll face similar enemies on the same maps over and over in other words. Sometimes, you get to play on the same map that you've just finished. 

In my opinion, in ARPGs, a map is a canvas, and having a different canvas' each time keeps things fresh by putting you under an illusion that keeps your mind away from the idea of you doing a repetitive task over and over. This is certainly not the case in this game. 

A proper procedural map generation is urgently needed in short. Without it, I get burnt out rather fast, and it could be the same case for you as well. Other aspects of the game has been keeping me from feeling the burnout so far, but I'm afraid I'll buckle before reaching 100+ hours just because of this reason alone. I've started making other characters to keep myself interested further.

[h1]Endgame: Monoliths, Echoes[/h1]
I like the base endgame, you select a monolith (storyline) that is available to you, and essentially design your own maps as you progress through echoes (maps). After each echo, you are given two options to pick from, which adds a modifier to the enemies, and may last a few echoes, stacking the difficulty up. I really like it. However...

At the end of the monoliths, you get to choose one blessing among three, and these blessings are drawn from their own pool, and has a power rating attached to them. They could be simple drop rate boosts, to a vital stat improvements that'll enhance your build. You need to complete 3 quest echoes, and while the first few monoliths are easy, the later ones require you to maybe go through 30 echoes in order to finish a monolith, or even more as encountering a quest echo is chance based.

The problem with this is, if you were after these blessings, you only get a chance after a long patience, and are at the mercy of the RNGesus to get a blessing you want with a good roll. If we could improve our blessings somehow; like incrementally raising their power roll for each completion, it wouldn't be a big issue for me as the long wait would yield something rewarding. But right now, the reward for completing a monolith could be extremely unsatisfying.

I hear you asking; is the game about loot, or is it about blessings? Well, blessings are part loot in essence, but let me stop being a smartass for a second. It is of course about the loot, further enhancing your character at the core. And the next part is dedicated to the itemization & crafting, specificly in the endgame.

[h1]Itemization & Crafting[/h1]
At first, the game might look like the complete opposite of the PoE, especially crafting. You use affix shards to add up to four affixes you want to an item, or improve their tiers up to tier five. You have support runes and glyphs that you can use to do different stuff, like removing an affix, randomizing affix values on an item within their tiers, and so on. However, with each crafting done on an item, you add instability to it, and higher instability may cause a fracture during crafting, at which point, the item cannot be worked further on.

When you get to the endgame, you realize that there is another rarity for items: ""Exalted"". The affix tiers go up to T7, but you can only craft up to T5. Exalted items are rare items that feature these higher tier affixes on them, and you can only get them as drops. This makes crafting more of a supplement; before this tier; it's a pre-determined risk & reward to progress your character further to the max, but with this tier, getting to the max is entirely at the mercy of RNGesus.

Some affixes are extremely hard to come by. From my experience, the class-specific affixes found on class relic items are extremely rare, for example. If you fracture (damage) an item while trying to add these, or shatter (salvage) an item in order to try and get your affix shards back and get nothing, it's extremely annoying. 

To put my experience in crafting for this game in PoE terms, you have ""orbs of annulment"" in the form of a rune, but the affix removed is one at random. Then you have ""exalted orbs"" in the form of affix shards, but the added affix is pre-determined, and the same affix shards can be used till you reach tier 5. Then you have ""divine orbs"" in the form of another rune that randomize the values within their tiers. However, every craft action will add some sort of instability, and the higher instability the item has, the higher chance a fracture may occur. Fracture is similar to ""corrupt""; cannot work on the item any further, and you may lose some affix tiers in the process if it is anything but a minor fracture.

Lets say you want to craft a good item. Due to the added instability, trying to craft an all affixes @T5 item from the ground up from a white item is highly improbable; the higher quality items, will have much less instability on them for the affix tiers they've got, and you'll have a better chance to craft the item through those. If you want a specific T6/T7 affix, you'll definitely need it drop anyway. So you seek an item with the affixes you can work with as a base, and try to add the affixes you want, remove the ones you don't want, or improve existing ones up to T5. 

If you are unlucky, a fracture occurs. You can use glyphs (crafting supplements) to have a chance to reduce the added instability, or mitigate the damage of the fractures. A minor fracture locks the items, major / destructive fractures lower the tier of some affixes in addition to locking them. 

During crafting, if the affix you want gets removed, or de-leveled, or if the item gets fractured before you are done with the affix you really want, the item is essentially bricked. And I've bricked way too many items without any wins in between as RNGesus told me to fuck off even with a 1% fracture chance. Yeah, I'm mad...

I really hope that the devs will add very rare crafting supplements that'll protect your item when you are working on it, or something like a very rare ""magic glue"" to put the fractured item back together, because finding a good base is a big hassle, and when you do find one, seeing it fracture is extremely annoying, especially if the fracture occured on a very low percentage, and/or on the last step of the crafting.

In short, crafting is still as dependant on RNGesus as any other ARPG out there, and you [i]will[/i] brick good items. There is a risk involved in crafting, and you'll experience extremely unsatisfying results, and reliefs here and there after a successful craft. Just because I have some negative views on the matter due to my bad luck (streak) doesn't mean you'll definitely have a similar experience.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I've listed (cried about) the points that I don't like very much about the game but could be improved. If some of the things I mentioned bother you, you might want to think twice; I want to highly recommend the game, but these things make it a ""mild"" recommendation for me. 

The developers seem to be listening to feedback, and not entirely disconnected from their playerbase or from their game like some other devs (*cough*PoE*cough*) are. As a game still in Early Access, nothing is set in stone. 

If you are in-love with ARPG as a genre, get it. It'll keep you busy for at least 20-30 hours even if you are not that into ARPG as a genre, in my opinion. A solid entry to the genre, I hope it won't get bloated over time.

899770,Last Epoch,"There have been recent review bombs because of multiplayer ""launch"" issues. Basically, the developers spent a long time working on making their single-player game multiplayer, and launch got hammered by 3-4x their expected player numbers, so the servers had massive issues. I personally don't think people should review games based on server issues that are in the process of being fixed in a game that's still in beta, but I digress. 

At the time of writing this I have 30 some odd hours on steam, but maybe 100-200 with their standalone launcher throughout the past few years. I've watched this game grow from the most barebones, amateur looking RPG, to a super polished, promising soon-to-be competitor to the loot-based ARPG behemoths (PoE, d4). 

Last Epoch is an uncut gem. I've watched the passionate developers work based on community feedback and vision for years now. I cannot wait to see where this game is in a year or two at this trajectory, because the 0.9 multiplayer launch has already far exceeded my expectations. I don't think it's in a position to compete with PoE and D4 at the moment, but as it grows and gets better and better it definitely will. This is a developer team to watch closely, and It would be dumb for GGG and Blizzard to not take a look at how they've taken outdated systems from other ARPGs and made them a lot better. 

This game as is pre-launch is already a 7/10. As they flesh out end game, add their 3 launch classes, and stick to their philosophy on game design and working with the community to make a good game, I can easily foresee it being a 9/10, and I expect that it will end up sharing the top few spots in viewer numbers with PoE in the ARPG genre.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

899770,Last Epoch,"I wasn't going to buy this title until is came out of early access, but I got a gift card for Christmas and I couldn't resist...

I've played: 
22 years of D2,
2000+ hours of PoE,
1000+ hours of Grim Dawn,
300+ hours in Wolcen and more.

This is easily the best title in the genre.
I'm 25h into the game so far, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. Unlike similar games, going through the beginning stages of the game does not feel like a grind. Leveling and developing a build feels exciting and is part of the experience, rather than something to get through.

The crafting system is gold. It doesn't rely on pure luck like PoE, so you're not going to spend tons of materials on crafting something just to end up with nothing useful and no materials.
There is some luck involved, but often times you can choose what stats you'll be adding to an item. It's simple enough to get into as a Newby, but complex enough to be engaging and exciting as you become more experienced.

The skills are awesome.
I went full lightning mage.
I feel like a thunder god!
Every skill has a skill tree and can be changed and augmented in a ton of different ways. I also like that the game encourages you to use more than 1 ability as a primary ability, without nerfing the usability of any of the skills. My current set up has a lightning nova skill for AoEing big packs, chain lightning as a single target DPS skill - chaining multiple times on a single target and adding a ton of shock stacks, a teleport skill that triggers lightning nova, a static charge skill that passively triggers Chain lightnings, and fireward which gives me ward (think temporary energy shield), plus a myriad of damage and defensive buffs for several seconds.
My whole screen is lightning pew pew and exploding baddies.

899770,Last Epoch,"BETA RELEASE REVIEW

It's a fun ARPG, in the genre of Diablo mixed with a part of Grim Dawn and a part of Path of Exile.  Currently there are 4 classes, with the Rogue class still in it's initial phase of development without a timeframe for release yet.  You still have the opportunity to play as Acolyte, Primalist, Mage, and Sentinel.  These are the typical base classes you find in these games, with each one having three Mastery choices.

Many of the builds currently stress damage mitigation and health, with most of the character builds being fleshed out to their highest efficiency way before you reach cap level.  So basically, between level 50-75 you'll most likely have your skills maxed and already have either bis gear or near it.  That leaves little incentive to continue on to cap level 100 for an occasional passive point to reward your effort.  There isn't an endgame currently either, making it even less desirable to continue on with the character.  You'll probably get more enjoyment by starting a new character with a new build you want to try out.  Hoping to see this being fixed way before full release.

For the storyline and quests, it's quite intriguing I have to say.  Not to give too much of it away, but you'll be sort of a time traveler, opening portals to different eras (or epochs as in the game title) from the infancy of humanity to the year 2281, The Ruined Era or Last Epoch.  This is where your story begins.

I have had a few bugs so far while playing, nothing too serious, but it could of been.  When breaking tables and furniture with your weapons there's chance that money or even gear will drop.  On a few occasions I've had my drops either floating in the air or outside the play area without any way for me to recover them.  Luckily the weapons and armor were not Unique or Set items, and the amount of gold was negligible.

Another issue that has happened twice so far, when entering an area or trying to speak to a npc, the game suddenly would just freeze as the camera view changed.  I was left with no other choice but to alt tab out and do a manual exit of the game.  Nothing too serious so far, and it is still in beta after all.

I still only scratched the surface of the game to date, but plan to continue on playing throughout the beta phase and hopefully see a completed released version of the game in the near future.

899770,Last Epoch,"Last Epoch is currently hitting a very difficult market in ARPGs, in that it is very easy to approach as a game, but has increased depth and 'theory crafting' opportunities as you progress through the game. It doesn't take a  massive build guide just to have an operational character, or take an excessive amount of time to craft an item with the exact affixes you need.

899770,Last Epoch,"*Editing review on 25.12.2021 after playing some hours on new patch*

Alright i think after over 100 hours its time to put down my review on this game :) First disclaimer, i am Path of Exile veteran (multiple thousands of hour sank into that game - something like 10k at this point, playing since beta pretty much) so since i have most experience in a genre with PoE there will be lot of comparisons. 

So i purchased this game almost year ago, i believe it was 2 big patches ago (third is coming in 2 weeks with some amazing new content :)). I am gonna talk about good things first: 

- Combat and visual clarity. Combat feels pretty fluid most of the time, what makes me happy the most unlike in PoE you actually have very good visual clarity, when you die you always know what did you die to and why (most of the time it is because you fucked up). Bosses are very well designed and all have unique mechanics that are well telegraphed and are easy to get used to. Amazing thing that was added in last big update is Shade of Orobyss which is endgame encounter that have different combination of skills from huge pool of possible combinations every time you meet it. It is pretty exciting and fun and increases repeatability of that boss encounter. 

- Graphics and performance. Graphic is pretty good, game looks visually nice. Its not as good as some other games in genre, but its good enough and skills and skill effects feel really satisfying on all builds i have played so far :) Performance is solid, i have decent enough rig and game was running pretty smooth almost all the time. Exception to that are moments, where i am really deep into monolith with some really tanky mods on monsters which are making them clutter into huge groups, seems like game engine cant handle that too well. 

- Crafting system and chase items. With last big patch we got slight rework of crafting system and whole new tier of items added (legendary items). New crafting system feels way better, adds more deterministic options for high tier crafting, while keeping that right amount of rng that makes it ""risky"". Legendary items are whole new level of chase items and they are awesome. You basically get your unique item and slap more affixes onto it, which makes some extremely rare drops extremely exciting. Great idea and job well done, eventho powerlevel of some extremely rare things is beyond ridiculous :) 

- Endgame systems: So far game has 3 endgame systems (that is definitly subject to change in future) that is arena, monolith and recently added dungeons. Arena and monolith are both  endlessly scaling systems (which is great for players such as myself who like to push their characters and see how far they ll go) and both are pretty fun to interact with (i prefer monoliths and pushing corruption more atm). Latest addition is dungeon which adds some new mechanics and options for future development that are really exciting and has probably toughest endgame encounter in highest tier of the dung. Pretty well executed and they promised adding more dungs over time, so i am really excited for future :) 

- Great devs and community. Devs of this game show real promise. I am on their discord and they do dev stream weekly, where one of their team plays a game and talks to viewers, answers their questions about everything game related which is really great. They have active members on a team that react to the stuff on the discord aswell. Community itself is very helpful and non-toxic enviroment. So far i havent seen any elitism or toxicity on discord, nor in game global chat. As it usually is with these small indies studios in begining, devs are really in touch with their community so far and hopefully that wont change for a long time :)

Cons:

Okay, its really hard to evaluate cons of this game, because so far all of the things that i am ""missing"" (namely trading, MP) in this game will be added eventually as it is still early access game. When i will think of something i will put it up here :)

- Seems like game engine is having similar problem to PoE, when you have too many mobs on screen it begins drop fps pretty rapidly. My rig is pretty good and even handles PoE on solid fps, this game runs smoothly for 99% of the time, but when i am pushing really deep corruption on my top chars i get to the instances, where mobs are insanely tanky and i cant clear them fast enough, so they start to stack up on the screen to the point i loose big chunk of my fps. 

Verdict:

Game is great, if you like games like diablo/path of exile/grim daw, just buy it, even in its early access state its already serious competitor to those giants and from what we have seen it is only gonna get exponentially better.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

899770,Last Epoch,"If you've played other ARPG's, such as Diablo 2, or Diablo 3, or Path of Exile, and already know you enjoy that style of game, I am confident that you will enjoy this game. 

When I think about how to compare ARPG's, there are three elements that I consider. First is the difficulty/complexity of the game, the second is how open-ended the classes/characters are, and the third is how engaging the crafting/gearing system is.

Each element of this list can be represented as a spectrum. The first spectrum is about complexity/difficulty. I would put PoE and D2 at the high complexity/difficulty end of the spectrum, and Diablo 3 and Minecraft Dungeons at the other end. Last Epoch is on the complex end of the spectrum, but much closer to the middle than PoE.

The second spectrum is regarding how much guidance/limitations you have on your character. Path of Exile would be right at the end of the spectrum correlating to no guidance and no limitations. At the other end would be Minecraft Dungeons, with tonnes of guidance and a lot of limitations. Diablo 3 is close to that end of the spectrum too. Last Epoch again falls close to the center of this spectrum. It has guidance, and limitations to your character, but there are many more options for each character you play as opposed to D3 where your power seems completely tied to a small number of Sets, and the decisions you make as far as what abilities you use and what sort of damage you deal are all made for you. Last Epoch feels like you CAN play anything, although some things are probably more optimal than others. It also gives that great feeling of finding a unique item, and think to yourself, damn, this would be super strong with X class/ability, now I want to make a character  to use it.

This is leading into the third spectrum about how engaging the gearing/crafting system is. Again, the simple and unengaging end of the spectrum is seen in games like Minecraft Dungeons, and Diablo 3. The opposite end would represent very engaging and very complex gearing/crafting, and as usual Path of Exile holds the title there. The trend for Last Epoch continues, and it places somewhere between the center of the spectrum and PoE. It's a much more linear crafting system than PoE, but it's still a relevant crafting system that feels rewarding to interact with. It allows you to do all the things you need to do to items, and I'm sure that it will be developed further as the game grows.

Another notable feature in Last Epoch is that it has some wonderful quality of life features that other games (Path of Exile mostly) are lacking. Inventory sorting with a button, separate storage for crafting supplies, auto pick up gold, one click pick up all nearby crafting shards, loot filter in the game itself with awesome customization, and probably some more stuff that I can't think of at the moment.

TL;DR BELOW -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a great investment of a game if you know that you enjoy ARPG's already. It has more complexity than Diablo III, but it's quite a bit easier to grasp than Path of Exile. It has more guidance for your classes, giving you spells that correlate to your class, but you can specialize and change how the class feels way more than you can in Diablo III. The gearing and crafting is simpler than Path of Exile, but it feels quite impactful, and works well at all points in the game.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

899770,Last Epoch,"From a Path of Exile perspective, this looks like a simpler but more polished version of it.

- The crafting is simpler, but way more accessible and easy to get into it.
- The skill system is simpler, but way easier to understand and create your own build.
- There is a item filter builder in game, which is also easy to understand and create your own (no need to rely on external tools)
- There is a dictionary/guide in game, that you can easily search for terms that you still don't understand.
- The visuals/graphics are awesome.
- Bosses have well telegraphed moves that rewards players that engage with its mechanics, instead of just building to burst the boss from full to zero in two seconds.
- Slow gameplay, ""rare"" monsters have unique moves and defensive layers that are easy to understand.

Excited to see what this will become in a year or two.

899770,Last Epoch,"First things first, i love ARPG's, played Diablo 1,2,3,4 Grim dawn, Torchlight 1,2,3 over 1000 hours in POE. 

TLDR :: Last Epoch is as fun as the best ARPGs I have played. which are D2, POE, and T2. 

Only thing that i find extremely detrimental. online requirement. They have offline characters so this helps a lot. but if you dont have online access for some reason to log in, you cant play at all. THIS i would ask gets changed asap. make offline... truly offline. 

The game itself feels fun, I feel rewarded for playing. I feel rewarded for exploration. I feel suprised and find enjoyment while i go from zone to zone. Quests have rewards that are actually meaningful. (for the most part) Side quests give you actual points and item slots. 

I am admittedly early game, have not reached end game, have not completed a build and have not seen what the game has to offer in full but i am still having fun. I play minion builds most of the time and the game 100% hits on that fantasy. The Necromancer is the class i have played so far and i have built a full minion build that feels powerful yet not over powering. They get what makes minion builds powerful and what weaknesses they need to have. 

Loot
The loot is good. I admit i am still figuring it out but it seems simple enough to understand. I find that unfortunately i dont see many worth picking up as i go though. I see the potential but over all this is one area i feel it can suffer. Item bases are extremely interesting and i find them the most interesting out of most ARGS. They feel purpose built and finding new ones feels rewarding and you are semi excited for finding new ones. This game has loot that actually benefits minion builds VERY well. I feel the unique items are one of the strongest in the genre. As an example i found one that had 4 great affixes that was better than what i had. Also something with Weaver charges... No idea what that did. As i found out though as i killed mobs it would randomly add a new Affix and or buff one it already added. I dont recall an item that ""grew with me"" it made me excited to have it on and very excited to find another one at some point. No idea what the end game looks like but so far so good.

Crafting. 
Crafting is maybe the best ive seen so far in any ARPG. It has the ""crafting item currancy"" like POE has, but instead of the ENTIRE F$#$ing system being random (like POE) LE's crafting is a lot more targeted. you can adjust, empower, add, remove, and much more all specifically targeting what you need on an item. I feel this is the strength of the itemization of LE. Each item can only be upgraded so much so you are encouraged to find new ones, and the amount each item can be crafted seems to be random as well. Can find God tier loot with great crafting potential. Legendary's set and more all appear to have something to do with this i just havent gotten so far. It has A TON OF END GAME POTENTIAL. We shall see when i get there.

Character 
There are classes to chose from, each class has its own play style and skill selection. So no POE freedom of choice here. That said i dont feel this is bad persay. You know what you like to play it is not likely you will want to throw a fireball when summoning a skeleton. Stats are not... obvious though. For example Int does NOT give mana like you might think upon first glance. Attainment does? Odd choice honestly. Each character has 3 subclasses, you can chose one to master granting you a special ability. You can still chose from the first half of each tree in the non mastered subclasses though ( think) So far so good, lots of selections and enough freedom with out it being overwhelming. Skills are given based on points in each class/subclass. No attribute points from leveling though... just from gear i think. Characters are solid but not strong in my opinion. I personally would like to see a little more choice in the skill options in each tree. 

Skills
Skills are one of the most limiting areas. Each character has a handful of skills to chose from. 20 for Necromancer (as of now). You can only have 5 active. Abilities must be actively chosen to remain active. Aka cant summon something then switch it out. This is the down side. The upside is I havent found this an issue. Each skill can be switched out easily and quickly. Find out what you wanna use and no worries if you dont like it. You can just switch it out. The skills are learned by adding points into the character so you are not limiting your skill selection in this way. That said you get 5 skill specializations slots. This is where the LE skills SHINE in my opinion. You like summon skeleton? add it to your skill specialization and customize it even further by leveling it up. each level allows you to slot into its own skill small skill tree. This changing the function of the skill entirely or buffing aspects you like. 

Graphics and art design.
its a cut above many. The way the story is told allows for some REALLY fun environments and good environmental story telling.  i would say its not D4 levels of sophisticated but its damn close in my view. 

Story
So far its basic enough to follow and still go kill a bunch of stuff. however the story allows for some really neat mechanics. It also allows them to EASILY add more areas and expand upon the game later on. voice acting is good. 

 For now i will gladly continue playing this.  dont know how many may read this, but if you like ARPGS this is easily one of the best ones out in 2023.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

899770,Last Epoch,"This is coming from a mainly PoE player with over 3.5k hours.

Also playing this game completely blind so take this with a grain of salt. (not that I'm blind, blind as in no guides/no videos nothing has been looked up before playing)

Pros:
 - has a unique crafting system and drop system, drops feel meaningful and it feels great to look for gear upgrades quite freaquently, crafting your desired affixes onto it is quite straightforward as well. (e.g. you find a magic bow with 2 prefixes, t3 phys dmg and t3 increased bow dmg, you could easily get those to t5(max craftable) and be set with a really nice phys bow until you find a new base)
 - performance, I can't stress this enough coming from PoE. No longer do I have fps loss while interacting with certain mechanics (looking at you delirium and legion) and most importantly, I haven't encountered a single crash.
 - boss fights, this game has reminded me of soul games, all boss attacks are telegraphed and most importantly you actually know what killed you, what dmg type and what kind of mistake you have made.
 - loot filter, easy to understand and tweak for your needs. helps that all items drop identified.
 - looting, damn have I been spoiled, picking up all the little crafting materials in a click, vacuuming the gold that drops. This is MASSIVE pro compared to PoE. I have missed the vacuum type looting for little things since Diablo.

Cons:
 - no multiplayer, this is quite a bummer. Might be a deal breaker for you.
 - global chat is very bad, just like PoE. Be cautious and turn it off right away.
 - lacks endgame, you're stuck doing echoes until the end of times (kinda the point of the game) but it gets boring real fast. Your entire endgame is -> open echo -> kill boss/wave type activity -> repeat. Don't get me wrong, they can improve a lot here but it still is lacking a lot.
 - endgame mob density, this is something that can be tweaked right now, theres little to no monsters that you fight, sometimes you see like 20 in a pack sometimes 5, very inconsistent.

Overall this game is worth it, cons are eventually going to improve. The game is currently going under its Beta phase so we will get there. If you like ARPG games, this game is worth a shot, especially if you're tired of PoE.

Small note: if this game gets enough support and becomes a real competitor to PoE, both games will eventually improve at a faster pace!

I originally waited a few months before playing in hopes multiplayer comes out, but decided to try it anyways after disliking the direction of POE, I didn't regret it in the slightest.

Last Epoch is lacking content, a lot of the core gameplay loop is there but some classes are not done, the story is not all complete, and there isn't a ton of uniques/set items yet.

899770,Last Epoch,"I have played 30 hours (not counting AFK time, maybe 23-25 hours) I will edit my review over time. 

I am a Kickstarter backer, but I decided to give it some time to get fleshed out before I tried really playing it. 
I check in on the progress from time to time, but only sat down to play this past week.
It is a good game it seems, and it has potential; so, I will give it a thumbs up... for now...

The skill system is great, I like the diversity in each class to have 3 master classes PLUS you can still use a bit of each mastery class as long as you stay under the vertical 50% mark of each mastery, AND you have a lot of choices to flesh out some truly unique builds. 
The skills are numerous, and are complimented by the mastery system very well. Each skill has it's own passive tree and that blows my mind, Even more diverse than I had thought!

My biggest complaint is... it seems dull and drawn out. 
Currently I have not reached the end game, a lot of people say it really picks up the pace there, but what about the leveling / storyline part? that is sorely needing some *oomph*!  
In the beginning, I explored EVERYWHERE... but later I found myself running to quest markers just to get stuff done. and see if something exciting would occur... but not even the boss fights intrigued me, and it all just seemed so easy.. except for an occasional monster that had some odd combination of affixes to make it difficult. I wish I could describe my view on this lackluster gameplay better than this, but I just cannot pinpoint it exactly.
I hope the devs do something to breathe life into the gameplay in the early parts of the game... because I just closed the game due to lack of interest.
I know I will get flamed for this statement, but Wolcen was a game that kept me interested..yes it was busted, but I still enjoyed playing.. and the story kept me wanting for more. 

That is my honest opinion of the game so far, and I am not going to apologize for it. you don't have to like it, but it is highly unlikely you will sway my decision... the devs have to do that!","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

899770,Last Epoch,"This game is easily shaping up to the one of the better ARPG's in recent times, especially if you are into the Single Player experience. Lots of classes, build options, item interactions and an engaging crafting system with a fairly balanced loot system.

You might notice this month (December), Last Epoch has gotten review bombed. This is boiling down to a few things.

[b]1.[/b] There has been a year-long update stall whilst the development team has been investigating MP. Contrary to what seems to be uneducated and popular belief, the game is [i]not[/i] abandoned. The dev team is active on their subreddit if you want more engagement. The reason this took so long is also related to the team not wanting to have a disaster MP launch like Wolcen and some other titles. What ever happened to the sentiment of [i]""Do it right, do it once""[/i]?

[b]Offline Singleplayer will still be available for those that want it.[/b]

[b]2.[/b] There is controversy over the team's stance on item trading between players. Essentially, they have come to the conclusion that attempting to balance a proper player economy is going to be difficult. Drop rates would have to be adjusted (see: nerfed), and you would end up in the PoE-like situation where people just go and buy all their gear rather than grind/farm. With a restricted system they can keep drop-tables as they currently are, knowing players will actually be playing the game to get loot. Better drop-rates and player satisfaction as a result is surely a good thing, but what do I know?

899770,Last Epoch,"I'm having fun, and looking forward to MP so I can play with the husband.  

As others have said, it's not overly complicated to build a build, which is magnificent news to me.  I loathe building builds, and want to spend my time playing rather than min maxing.  Could I have a better build?  Likely.  Does it matter all That much? Not really.  I'm able to progress while keeping my head attached, with the occasional zerg death because I'm impetuous sometimes.  Especially when it's getting late and I need sleep, but I don't want to because I just want to finish this One thing before going to bed . . . y'all are gamers.  You understand.

The only real beef I have is the zone resetting when I need to go sell.  I cleared it, it should remain clear until x amount of time passes, or I log out.  There should be an option to reset a zone, if someone truly wants to repeat the process.  I do not.  I have limited time to play anything these days (woe) and thus I want do overs like I want a hole in the head (I don't care for one, thank you).

PoE is fun as well, but I find myself simply using others' builds because I get overwhelmed with the choices.  For those who enjoy tinkering with builds I'm sure this is a blast.  For me it is not.

Overall I recommend this game.  People who bag on it are likely looking for not this game, and I say good luck to them.  In the meantime, I'll be over here having a right good ol' time with LE.","Very Positive85% of the 26,109 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1203620,Enshrouded,"I've seen some down-votes due to a misunderstanding with the co-op. Ppl are saying that you cant make your own base/chests/etc. This isn't a MMO-lite with multiple guilds/tribes. Its a single player or CO-OP game. Co-op meaning the game and world is shared, not at each persons own pace.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Completed the game in a group of 4 people (finished all quests).
General impressions and information regarding the content for Early Access:
-Level cap at level 25. After reaching level 25, you receive 0 XP, which can demotivate further grinding, but it takes time to reach it.
-Altar cap at level 6. The last Altar unlocks a very small section of the desert biome where enemies can be level 30.
-The winter biome is unavailable in early access.
-The surrounding fauna changes depending on the biome, but enemies or mini-bosses not (I'm talking about bandit camps. It would be nice to see diversity in this aspect in the future).
-Temples of the Sun, etc., add a very interesting puzzle aspect to the game, giving depth and a pleasant feeling of exploration.
-Waiting for some resources to craft can take 10 minutes, which I believe artificially extends the game time.
-Boss fights are often engaging and give off a very Soulslike atmosphere due to the difficulty level and combat system.
-The building system is enjoyable, although initially it may seem clunky.
-Lack of ability to change enchants or enchant armor. Considering how rarely we are able to find new equipment (not talking about crafting), such a feature should be available, and I also hope this will change in the future.
-Exploring the map is fun. Finding villages, resources, interesting locations creates the impression that behind every hill, we can discover some interesting point. The world definitely gives the impression of authenticity.
-The lack of physics when cutting down trees or destroying surfaces can detract from immersion.
-Skill tree could offer better and more useful skills.

Despite numerous flaws or unmet expectations in several areas, for an early access game and at a reasonable price, I consider it worth recommending for those who enjoy games like Valheim. There are clear inspirations from Dark Souls, Zelda, and Valheim, but this does not hinder the game from delivering fun. I don't remember the last time any survival game has hooked me enough to play it for three days straight.

It's worth supporting this game at this stage, it's fun a can be much better in future.

1203620,Enshrouded,"A friend of mine gifted me a copy of this game. 

At the time of writing of this review, I've put about 50 hours into this game. 

Here are the Pros: 
The game is beautiful. The building, is simple, but very fun. Homes can be as complex or as basic as you want. While I believe that Valheims building was vastly more complex, not every game needs to have building like Valheims. I can still make my grandiose homes with ease in Enshrouded. 

I enjoy the Souls-Like stamina based combat. As well as the perk/skill tree. And the lore is fantastic. I'm a lore junkie and I LOVE archaeological storytelling which this game has in spades. 

The map is massive, and filled with so much to do. It's rare to find dead zones on the map. I'm always stumbling across enemies to fight, mats to farm, and ruins to explore. 

The Shroud mechanic is great. 

The performance of the game is excellent too. I have had zero crashes, lag, screen tearing, none of it. 

I've discovered less than a handful of bugs, which is unheard of for an Early Access game. 

Oh, and finally, the Glider is a BLAST to use. I get massive amounts of enjoyment out of flying all across the map with the glider. 

The Cons: 

Magic and Ranged are so overpowered it's not even funny. I'm a Tank main, so I was very excited to see that there were perks/skills for Tanking. Except that Melee players get completely shit on the farther you go into the game. Despite massive levels of Con, and Armor, I don't feel any Tankier than I did when I started the game in rags. So the classes need more balancing, badly. 

The AI is very stupid, and extremely easy to cheese. Just get a little bit of elevation and you are untouchable. 

The difficulty spikes are quite unbalanced. You go from feeling insanely overpowered, to hitting like a wet noodle and getting deleted when an enemy looks at you. *Glares are the poison coated dual-wielding enemies* 

There's punishing difficulty, and then there is unbalanced difficulty. I want the former, but currently it's the latter. 

The parry timing is inconsistent. I parried the world in Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring. I Mikiri Countered my way through Sekiro. I think I'm qualified to judge the timing on this games parries. Lol

Conclusion: 

The game is one of the best Early Access games I have ever had the privilege to play. The devs know what they're doing and are consistently pushing out hotfixes and updates. 

Enshrouded is vastly more polished than most AAA games that release these days, it's massive, filled with content, and very fun to play. 

For the asking price, you will definitely get your monies worth and hours upon hours of content.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Let me gain xp from building.

I am the Base mommy, my friends go out and I stay behind and build mighty castles from which we operate. I don't know if it's a terrible idea, I want to be able to keep up somewhat with them whilst building! Please tell me if this is a dumb idea!

Edit: This is a list of the suggestions of all the smart sausages and base mommy's in the comment section! (the biggest issue they adress is people abusing base building to boost xp)

1. [u] Stanleys [/u] and [u] Arch-_-Angelos [/u] were the first people to mention true XP sharing. Where everyone gets 1:1 xp conversion. Like Baldurs Gate 3! 

2. [u] GrimTactics [/u] suggested a daily xp cap for building. Meaning builders can still get some juicy xp, whilst stopping exploiters from going hog-wild.

3. [u] Rhys [/u] takes it a step further! He had the idea of introducing an item set that disables the wearers personal xp gain, but whilst home, they gain xp at the same rate as the adventurer who has the other item.

4. [u] Lord Vorian [/u] as the most thought out method I reckon. They suggest an xp reward for every amount of material spend building. Meaning destroying and replacing something still nets the same amount of total material spend, therefor not rewarding any additional xp.

[i] This one is interesting, it is still subject to some cheekiness, but anyone would still need to farm the resources, no matter if they just make a solid cube base somewhere purely for the xp it's their choice if they desire to spend resources in that manner. It also encourages serious players to build bigger, more grandiose bases, which I personally see as a huge win! [/i]

5. [u] Pepito [/u] had the idea of an xp collecting scroll, or perhaps gem, which explorers could ferry around, having it accumulate experience, so they may give it to builders so they can absorb the collected xp.

6. [u] Faris [/u] mentions reducing material returns from deconstructing and the server settings argument. Player freedom or the game dev's vision? Which is more important? He's also made my aware my head is, in fact, a Tomato. I am profoundly discombobulated.

7. And finally [u] mont3000 [/u], claims a slow xp trickle, which initiates after spending 15/30 minutes building would do the trick.

Awesome suggestions everyone! I am already starting to like the character of the community.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Valheim comparisons, in general, aren't doing anyone any favors. I purchased V Rising because of all the reviewers calling it ""Valheim with vampires"". V Rising isn't remotely like Valheim, and I couldn't squeeze even 2 hours out of it. Valheim has good game mechanics, but a significant reason for its mesmerizing immersion is its art style. The musical score could inspire Dvorak or Mendelssohn, the subtle pixelation combined with masterful lighting makes it less like computer animation than impressionistic painting, and the creature design looks like it was taken from a 9th century tome. Only a shameless copy could hope to re-evoke the same feelings.

Enshrouded is instead its own game. The graphics are appealing, reminiscent of Immortals Fenix Rising. The voxel building & landscaping is innovative and fun. The map is interesting and large (although EA boundaries are discovered pretty quickly). If you want to explore a new world, or if you want to engage in veratile base building, Enshrouded may be for you. It is quite good. And the shroud mechainc I find quite compelling.

There are some immersion breakers, which hopefully will get addressed during EA. First, resource respawning is way too quick and without variation, much like Conan Exiles. Your character in the early game (which is all I know) seems overpowered. Mobile assets like animals and bosses frequently get stuck quivering in complex landscapes. You can't drop inventory items, but istead must delete them. The day-night transitions are beautiful, but seem too rapid. 

I find many of the criticisms less than generous, considering this is early access and not intended to be a Valheim clone. Even with its problems I find it more compelling than most AAA titles that debut at 2x the price.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Valheim but has friendly NPCs, voxel based building, tunnel digging (including through floors and walls).

Day 1 purchase, nuff said.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]Observations after 20 Hours[/h2]
It's quite clear as originally indicated the game has a lot in common with Valheim.  While there are some differences, overall if you liked Valheim you'll probably enjoy playing Enshrouded.  In addition, if there were things you didn't like about Valheim, there are also things you won't like about Enshrouded.

[b][i]Some Noteable Similarities:[/i][/b]
[list]
[*]Some recipes get discovered by acquiring a material or crafting item for the first time.
[*]A significant portion of gear/technology progression is tied to the elimination and looting of bosses.
[*]In combat, generally speaking the player wants to avoid facetanking enemies.  Blocking/parrying/dodging are a good idea even in 1 vs 1 engagements due to the relatively high damage of some enemies.
[*]Consuming food is for buffs and health/stamina regeneration.  The player won't die standing still and not eating (i.e. no hunger/thirst mechanic).
[*]Getting the rested buff by being in the presence of fire and comfort items in a sheltered area.
[/list]

[b][i]Some Noteable Differences:[/i][/b]
[list]
[*]The player can build with very small blocks of all building type materials, allowing for a much more refined final creation.  Building has no structure integrity in Enshrouded.
[*]Enemy difficulty is based on levels and there aren't champion/elite variants in Enshrouded.
[*]Enemies don't respawn in the presence of the player in Enshrouded.
[*]Progression in Enshrouded is tied to both boss killing and NPC crafter acquisition and subsequent quests (to collect crafting related items so you can make additional workstations).
[*]Player growth in Valheim is largely influenced by skill-ups but in Enshrouded it's from leveling, ability points and upgrading the Flame Altar.
[*]Valheim is significantly more visually atmospheric when compared to the non-shrouded areas in Enshrouded.  The weather effects and biome specific lighting are top notch in Valheim.  Outside of the shroud in Enshrouded there aren't weather effects like rain and storms, it's either light during day or dark during night with a small sunrise/sunset transition in between as appropriate.
[*]There's a significant amount of lore notes and quests in Enshrouded as opposed to the handful of objectives you get in Valheim.
[*]Enshrouded's map isn't procedurally generated.  I've noticed the design of the POIs is a bit more involved and the traversal/exploration based puzzles associated with them are pretty satisfying to solve.
[*]There are no PvE raids in Enshrouded like there are in Valheim.
[*]Don't appear to be set-bonuses for armor in Enshrouded.
[*]Seems more convenient to get gear upgrades by finding high rarity drops in the world and upgrading them with runes rather than crafting in Enshrouded.  Perhaps this changes later in the game.
[*]Health potions aren't on timers in Enshrouded.
[*]There aren't elemental effects to worry about in Enshrouded that requires specific gear (such as extreme cold).
[/list]

[h2]Observations after 70 Hours[/h2]
Overall a very solid entry into Early Access with a strong foundation capable of significantly differentiating itself from other titles and providing a satisfying experience for fans of the open world crafting survival/survival-like type games.  Though it certainly will still give off strong vibes from other games, such as Valheim.

The following are some lasting thoughts on some key differences between Enshrouded and Valheim:
[list]
[*]No real logistics around the transport of key resources (i.e. metal via boat).  Magnified by the fact there's no weight mechanic and you can use a glider to traverse long distances as well as teleport between Ancient Spires and Flame Altars.
[*]No structural integrity mechanics for building.
[*]No real consumable/gear requirements for traversing different zones based on weather effects.
[/list]

1203620,Enshrouded,"Been waiting for this game for a while and it hasn’t let me down.. 
The combat feels great no matter if your using a wand kitting mobs or your up in the mobs face dodging attacks. The building seems very straight forward and if I can do it anyone can.  The crafting is endless, the world is pretty as …

Do I recommend buying it….
Yes I do! If you enjoy getting lost in a game for hours exploring, crafting, base building and killing challenging mobs, solving puzzles this game is 100% for you. It’s a cross between Valheim, Zelda with quiet difficult mobs abit like a souls game and it’s coop! 

Enjoy!

1203620,Enshrouded,"To ""complete"" the Early access game, it took me about 110 hours; all quests; unlocking all achievements and a lot of building stuff. Now to wait for more content... 

So what kind of game is this, its basically a survival game, where one can build at your own pace, its also a voxel world, so everything can be mined and destroyed. You can build uniquely in your own style. Plenty to discover, and lots of enemies to kill, although there are only a limited amount of different enemies and bosses for the moment. 

You can completely play this solo or with friends, lots of classes to explore, It also uses a valheim saving system, so you only need to create one guy if you dont want to start over, playing with friends or on a public server. 

great looking vistas, fun way to travel around, really fun and easy building system, voxel world, great soundtrack to get you into the mood, and lots of lore to discover through questing.

1203620,Enshrouded,"Damn this game is [b]good[/b]!

With [I]Enshrouded[/i], Keen Games isn't trying to reinvent Open World Survival Crafting. They're just trying to make the best OWSC game on the market. And they're in the running for doing so. We are barely past the first week of Early Access and it is already among the best OWSC games I've played.

This voxel-based building/adventure game takes from some of the best games in the genre, such as [i]Valheim[/i], and implements them with craft and polish. I could gush about the awesome things in this game... and since this is a review, it is the perfect place to do so! 

The game is open world, but excels in giving you guests that will take you into areas of interest. And those areas are dripping with lore that enriches the experience. In this game, you are not a renaissance paragon who is somehow a warrior/farmer/blacksmith/alchemist/etc. Rather, your character is an adventurer who is tasked with rescuing others of your kind, and [i]they[/i] have the specializations. These NPCs, once rescued, can be placed at your base where they will give you quests to advance their ability to use their crafts. Rescue the blacksmith and he will enable the creation of a forge, then give you a quest to find the crucible needed for him to create a smithy.

The game is full of much-loved Quality of Life mechanics. Your inventory is limited by space but not by weight, so you can develop your characters statistics as you really desire without feeling required to dump points into managing carryweight. As popularized by [i]Valheim[/i], you have three food/drink slots in your stomach, and the foods you eat give important buffs. But you will never perish from hunger or thirst, so you can spend the hours you work on your base without interruptions to manage needs, and even leave the game running during Real Life interruptions. Plus, as with games like [i]Valheim[/i] and [i]Raft[/i], there is no food spoilage. 

Other QoL include very limited corpse drops. When you die, you drop a random selection of your materials, but not your weapons, armor or vital objects like quest items. No more running back naked to try to get your gear from an area you couldn't survive when you had it. An additional nice feature is that your tombstone will be on the last safe-to-stand place you were before you died. Something I discovered when I crashed my first glider and found my corpse was a [i]long[/i] way from where I died -- it was back on the edge of the tower I had jumped from.

Some QoL is locked behind progression. It takes a good amount of gameplay before you can rescue the Carpenter who will provide the expertise needed to craft magical chests that enable crafting from containers. It can be a painful wait, but it makes getting there so much sweeter. And on the subject of storage, let me [b]thank the devs so hard[/b] for making all storage containers the same size externally. Finally! How many games have forced me to completely redo my storage area because the upgraded containers can't fit in the same place, or worse, have a larger footprint that makes them less space-to-storage efficient than the basic ones? With [i]Enshrouded[/i], none of that! And the storage chests stack! It's like the devs have played games and know what gamers need.

I also have to give a shout-out for being able to remove things without destroying everything on top of it. If I want to yank the lowest storage chest in a stack and replace it with a magical one, I can do so without the hassle of having to empty and move the ones stacked above it. If I want to change the material used for a section of floor, I don't have to move the furniture first. (With, for some reason, the exception of my bed.) Devs: thank you!

And a special thanks for the lack of raids, destructive weather, or other nonsense that interrupts building or threatens to destroy everything you have spent hours creating. There are plenty of games for that. But with [i]Enshrouded[/i], I am free to build the base I want instead of feeling forced to make the most defensive structure I can.

Other elements of the game are blissfully streamlined. I don't have to water and babysit crops. There is a cool danger factor in being able to have your weapon break in combats, yet I have never been a fan of weapon/tool degradation because repairing always felt like added grind that doesn't improve the game experience. So I [b]am[/b] a fan of being able to repair all your weapons/tools with a single click at the crafting bench with [b]no material cost[/b]. 

And speaking of combat: it's good. Special shout-out to the addition of a short-range, low-damage, fast weapon that doesn't use mana or ammo. Wands are effin' amazing. My character has little strength or melee skill -- she's a freaky acrobat who uses dodge rolls, double-jump and her glider to dance around enemies while peppering them with wand shots until they are dead. And it is glorious.

All of this isn't to say there are no issues, nor things I wish they developers would consider as they expand on and improve the game. There are bugs. I play with max quality graphics 99% of the time, but I have to drop that down to balanced or even performance quality inside some of the trap-laiden towers or the game crashes. The game occasionally struggles to load high-quality textures. And then there is the ballad of rake-mageddon.

And we are not free of the silliness that seems inherent in OWSC games. I'm always amused by some of the nonsensical results from the gamification of resources. Like needing 52 screws to make a computer in [i]Satisfactory[/i]. So far, the crown of absurdity goes to [i]Dysmantle[/i] for requiring electronics to upgrade a baseball bat. But [i]Enshrouded[/i] is the first game to make charcoal a multi-component resource that requires [i]dirt[/i] as well as wood. 

Lo, I am but a lowly dirt farmer.

Such issues are few and barely mar my enjoyment of this beautiful game. Which does bring me to a small wishlist of improvements: first and foremost being an increase in character models and options.

1203620,Enshrouded,"10hrs in and I must say, this has the potential to be one of the best survival games of all time. In its current state, I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys single player adventure survival games. The multiplayer aspect is mid, at best.

 The game uses a shared progression system which means if you are playing with friends, you’ll have to all play at the exact same time or risk missing out on quests, XP and skill points. Unfortunately for me, my friends who are interested in this game won’t play it because we have mostly different schedules. Which sucks, because I love playing these games with friends.

The game, overall, is incredibly fun. The combat is well thought out, and it doesn’t have an overly complicated stats system. The food/water buffs are easy to understand. The building is what sets this game apart, however. There seems to be plenty of materials to build with, and the voxel based building is insane. A highlight is the fact you can build onto existing structures found in the world with ease. Renovations galore.

There are a few things I wish this game would change.

1. Let us build on diagonals. Everything is set to 90° angles which limits creative expression. Probably the biggest let down for me.
2. Get rid of shared progression.
3. Let us have pets, mounts and farm animals rather than going into the wilds to find food. I want to build a homestead.
4. Give us difficulty settings, and ways to tailor the gameplay to our own liking.

1203620,Enshrouded,Wild that a game half the price of most games nowadays gives you way more enjoyability and time for half the price.,"Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",wild half price game nowadays give enjoyability half price
1203620,Enshrouded,"so an overview of what it is like relative to other survival games (its not particularly survival):

No rotting/expiration of food
you don't drop Tools on death, just materials
no carry weight, just slots
building system is extremely generous, you get a lot of pieces for pretty low initial resources
no hunger/thirst, just valheim type benefits for foods (game is basically valheim, in many ways, and then changed in others)
can fast travel between Flame Altars, their equivalent of the workbench in valheim or the C.A.M.P from fallout, its the building zone and you start being able to have two, and that is upgradeable
terrain/resources respawn outside of player claimed zones
character creator is extremely simple, very much like valheim's so not a lot there (although for whatever reason they literally have a bunch of BG3 hairs, i don't think its like ripped models, its just the same hairstyles lol)
a single world, not procedurally generated, it is like Ark in that it is a story map, so there are old structures from the kingdom that used to be there
their roads and paths in this kingdom reduce the amount of stamina consumed by sprinting, so you are encouraged to use their roads. (i do not know at this time whether the player can eventually make roads or not, haven't gotten far)

overall it is an extremely casual game, seems mostly like a exploration/story/building rpg, more than a survival game. there are areas of 'shroud' that are like blue caelid xD and thats the main story thing, is that you are trying to fight back against the shroud, you can only stay in these zones for a limited amount of time before you presumably die, idk i haven't tried that yet lol

there is fall damage
fall damage becomes less relevant once you have a glider, as long as you use it before falling too far
you can dig really, really, really, really, really, really far down
especially in the areas that are raised up, it seems the raised up portion is itself all diggable terrain
because unclaimed terrain regenerates, you would need to make sure your claimed area was not in such a way that you get trapped, although if that was truly what could happen, that would actually be kinda cool

i don't think there is any friendly fire with non-explosives or pvp elements at all

2 hotbars, you switch with alt, although i switched it to control because alt feels better as dodge
dodge roll mechanics
rpg passive skill tree type thing
relatively simple gear and weapon system
magic weapons, wand is infinite ammo, doesn't use stamina, fires short range tracking bolts
staff is a ranged weapon that uses 'ammo' and the spells ive found so far are just frost bolts, they are limited because they are ammo, but since everything respawns you could theoretically just go loot more of them from the chest that has them.

But yeah it's a decent game, pretty simple, I can see it getting boring for people who aren't creative and don't care as much about building to just build. I hope they add a little more danger to it, but I actually really like how overall chill it is, a lot of survival games go too far into the hardcore experience for me, which i totally get is some people's thing, but i prefer things to be a little more relaxed until you want challenge. (Conan's new purges are opt-in, which i think would be great for this game, if enemies would attack but on an opt-in basis)

I would love to see more variety in enemies, more animals and plants (make the world more alive), and more weapon types (dual wielding? lol)

Definitely not a AAA game, (Would a AAA game be this fair with the price?? lol) but pretty fun to explore and I hope they continue to add to it.","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",overview relative survival game not_particularly survival no_rotting expiration food drop tool death material no_carry weight slot building extremely generous piece pretty low initial resource no_hunger thirst valheim type benefit food basically valheim way changed others fast travel flame altar equivalent workbench valheim c p fallout building zone able upgradeable terrain resource respawn outside claimed zone creator extremely simple valheim s_emphasizedo not_a whatever literally bunch bg3 hair t_emphasizedhink ripped model hairstyle lol single world not_procedurally generated ark map old structure kingdom road path kingdom reduce stamen consumed sprinting encouraged road not_know eventually road not_haven gotten far extremely casual mostly exploration building role survival are_emphasizedas shroud blue caelid xd thats trying fight shroud stay zone limited presumably die idk t_emphasizedried lol fall damage fall damage relevant glider long falling far dig really_emphasized far especially area raised raised portion diggable terrain unclaimed terrain regenerates claimed not_in trapped truly happen kinda cool t_emphasizedhink friendly fire non explosive pvp element 2 hotbars switch alt_emphasizedhough switched control alt feel dodge_emphasized roll mechanic role passive skill tree type relatively simple gear weapon magic weapon wand infinite ammo stamen fire short range tracking bolt staff ranged weapon us ammo spell ive found far frost bolt limited ammo respawns theoretically loot chest yeah decent pretty simple boring creative care building build hope add danger chill survival game far hardcore totally prefer thing relaxed challenge conan purge opt great enemy attack opt basis love variety enemy animal plant world alive weapon type dual wielding lol definitely not_a aaa a_emphasizedaa fair price lol pretty fun explore hope continue add

1203620,Enshrouded,"I've noticed some negative feedback stemming from a misconception about the co-op aspect of the game. People are saying that you can't create your own base, chests, etc. This is not an MMO-lite with multiple guilds or tribes. It is a single-player or co-op game, where the game and world are shared, not at each person's own pace. While it's unlikely that many people will see this message, I wanted to address this misunderstanding for those who might be discouraged by others' confusion.

1203620,Enshrouded,"This game is amazing. Basically Valheim but IMO better than valheim was when it first released and honestly can hold its own against present valheim. Mostly all positives but there are a couple things i would like to see changed. For one, setting options like palworlds has would be nice, being able to switch loot dropping on death to it not dropping on death. I honestly hate that in survival games considering its not a difficulty thing per say, its just a time consuming thing which imo is a waste of time. I wanna be exploring and doing productive things not going back to my dead body cuz i accidentally slipped off a ledge into fire. Again imo thats not difficulty its literally just wasting the gamers time.
I also came across a little issue with roots, playing coop in my cousins hosted game, i destroyed a root when he wasnt there and he didnt get the skill point for it and when he went to the spot the root was still gone. we thought he might be screwed out of the point but we just had to restart the server. but what if your playing on a server you pay for thats always online, then what? Another little nit pick, the hit boxes sometimes seem a little wonky, example ill be standing completely behind an enemy and theyll swing, the axe makes no contact with me yet i take damage.. 
Again tho those are little nit picks cuz overall without question i recommend buying this game. Shit I wouldve paid 59.99 for this game, its far better than some triple A titles! I love the variety in skill tree, might of put double jump inside the circle  with skills like the wood cutting and mining skills, rather than on one of the class part of the tree but again this is an opinion based nit pick. The building in the game is SOOO good. The fact you can place square by square for roof and wall pieces, most games just have full walls and limited roof pieces.. Im excited to see 6 months from now some of the insane builds people come up with. 
THE MAP IS INSANELY LARGE.. i was shocked at how big this map is.

1203620,Enshrouded,"After 22 hours, I don't recommend playing Enshrouded [i]yet[/i]. The game has lots of potential, but several kinks and growing pains to work out. Here are some of my thoughts divided into specific categories: 

--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Exploration: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]The world feels a little hollow and empty. Too many open and winding roads with no POIs, enemy NPCs, or interesting ""hey what's that?"" The world needs more density.

[*]Many building types are copy-pasted and have the same layout. I'm surprised many people aren't mentioning this because New World got obliterated for this same thing. Once you've seen a tomb/basement/decrepit house/campsite, you've seen them all.

[*]The ancient spires, which have a 'Legend of Zelda dungeon crawler with puzzles"" feel to them, are very simple and lack challenge. Hopefully they'll add more difficult puzzles in later spires.

[*]You can simply break down doors that require switches, thus bypassing the puzzle altogether.

[*]While a neat concept, clearing a shrouded area and chopping the giant red shroud root becomes tedious after the 2nd time. They are not unique enough at this stage in the game, containing all the same enemies, aesthetics, and gameplay. Again, once you've seen one, you've seen them all and unfortunately Enshrouded currently locks skill points behind clearing them, making them more or less mandatory. I'd like to see this system improved upon by adding in some of the puzzle systems from the ancient spires.

[*]The large overworld map lacks essential details like bridge locations/decals once discovered. This should be painted into the base artwork of the map. The map also doesn't differentiate between biomes. The map only shows verticality and important POIs like shrines and quest areas.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Combat and Enemies: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]Though simple, the combat feels responsive and fluid. All weapon types appear viable based on damage numbers.

[*]The skill tree is fun and offers unique gameplay experiences, but leaves me wanting more. I look forward to seeing this expanded.

[*]PvE and AI are incredibly underwhelming and simple. They often cycle between one or two attack animations, including special boss enemies.

[*]There aren't enough mob types currently. After exploring the playable areas in EA, you'll find the same enemy types scattered throughout. The ones that currently exist, look nice and polished.

[*]What enemy NPCs lack in mechanical depth, they grossly overcompensate in numbers and are overtuned. Even with food buffs and a tankier build, some enemies will still 1HKO, even if they are couple levels below. 

[*]While I'm sure a bug, enemies will often get stuck underground or on terrain. 

[*]There is no CC or stagger protection after a certain point. Meaning if you get swarmed or cornered, you can easily be chain staggered to death.

[*]Dodge rolling doesn't roll through enemies due to collision, meaning if you're cornered you'll likely be staggered to death.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Loot: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]Enshrouded commits the greatest cardinal sin when it comes to loot: You can find epic and legendary quality items early on, only to replace them with an uncommon green a couple of levels later. Often the raw damage upgrade is far better than the minor perks from upgrading a lower-level legendary weapon. It NEVER feels good to move from a unique legendary with a cool model to a common green because of numbers. Epic and legendary weapons should be saved for end-game PvE and crafting.

[*]Looting items can add them to your hotbar with no option to toggle this off.

[*]Loot often feels underwhelming. I feel like after 22 hours, I've seen 95% of the possible loot drops. At this stage, it feels like Diablo where I'm waiting for a specific weapon to drop at higher quality for the extra upgrade slot.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Crafting: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]Crafting is fine. What you'd expect from a crafting survival RPG, is not bad, but nothing inventive either. 

[*]Crafted gear options look nice and function well.

[*]The game offers a ""craft from chests"" system by requiring items be placed in specific ""magical chests"", making other chest types completely obsolete. This feels redundant and should be the baseline for any chest.

[*]You can't salvage gear you've outgrown. Giving back at least a small amount of materials like cloth or metal scraps would feel better than simply being forced to delete the item.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[h2][u] Other: [/u][/h2]
[list]
[*]I experienced very few technical issues.

[*]UI can be confusing and tedious with so many windows to cycle through trying to figure out what you're looking for.
 
[*]Gliding is quite fun and needed for a map with so much verticality.

[*]Fall damage is VERY unforgiving, sliding down a slope means taking massive damage once you finish sliding.

[*]The friendly crafting NPCs are slightly annoying, especially the blacksmith who is constantly berating you.

[*]Sound design is excellent.

[*]You can roll up a steep hill, while helpful, looks very unintended and goofy.

[*]Mining sulfur yields WAY too much EXP. Sulfur instantly breaks and yields 10EXP per swing. Within minutes ~level 10, mining sulfur leveled me up. I did this for several levels, as the EXP rate from mining sulfur felt more efficient than exploring and killing NPCs at my appropriate level.
[/list]
--------------------------------------------

[b] TLDR; [/b] The game lacks density, difficulty, and depth. It needs more time to cook in the oven and needs to greatly improve upon it's selection of enemies and their combat. I don't feel incentivized to explore, as even the later areas in EA share many of the same loot tables and gear drops from early areas.

This game isn't bad, but I wouldn't say it's great either. Right now I'd rate it a 5/10. I'd say wait at least 6-12 months before investing time and money into Enshrouded. I will revisit my review as the game updates.

Edit: Grammar

Edit #2: In response to some comments, these are my observations and primarily a list of things that came to mind as I was playing over the 22 hours. You're welcome to like the game in it's current state, and I certainly don't [i]dislike[/i] the game, however that doesn't mean I feel its recommendable as is. I love this style of game and would love for it to succeed. I have no problem supporting the game in EA and expect some hiccups, bumps, and incomplete gameplay. That doesn't excuse it from criticism as it's still a product that I paid for. Nothing I saw in Enshrouded seemed particularly unique to make it stand out from other competitors in the market. This is primarily the reason I rated it a 5/10, as it feels middle-of-the-road in it's current state. I have played many games in EA, and most get better over time as development continues. As stated in my OG review, I will revisit upon subsequent game updates.","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",22 hour recommend enshrouded lot potential kink growing pain thought divided specific category h2 exploration h2 world feel hollow empty open winding road no_pois enemy npc interesting hey world need density building type copy pasted layout surprised mentioning world obliterated tomb basement decrepit house campsite ancient spire legend zelda dungeon crawler puzzle simple lack challenge hopefully add difficult puzzle spire simply break door require switch bypassing puzzle altogether neat concept clearing shrouded chopping giant red shroud root tedious 2nd not_unique stage containing enemy aesthetic unfortunately enshrouded currently lock skill point clearing mandatory improved adding puzzle system ancient spire large overworld map lack essential detail bridge location decal discovered painted base artwork map map differentiate biome map show verticality important poi shrine area h2 combat enemy h2 simple combat feel responsive fluid weapon type appear viable based damage number skill tree fun offer unique experience leaf wanting look forward seeing expanded pve ai incredibly underwhelming simple cycle attack animation including special bos enemy mob type currently exploring playable area ea enemy type scattered throughout one currently exist look nice polished enemy npc lack mechanical depth grossly overcompensate number overtuned food buff tankier build enemy 1hko couple level bug enemy stuck underground terrain no_cc stagger protection certain meaning swarmed cornered easily chain staggered death dodge rolling roll enemy due collision meaning cornered staggered death h2 loot h2 enshrouded commits greatest cardinal sin come loot epic legendary quality item early on_emphasizedly replace uncommon green couple level raw damage upgrade far minor perk upgrading lower legendary weapon never_feels good move unique legendary cool model common green number epic legendary weapon saved pve crafting looting item add hotbar no_option to_emphasizedggle loot feel underwhelming 22 hour 95 possible loot drop stage feel diablo waiting specific weapon drop higher quality extra upgrade slot h2 crafting h2 crafting fine expect crafting survival role not_bad inventive crafted gear option look nice function offer craft chest requiring item placed specific magical chest chest type completely obsolete feel redundant baseline chest salvage gear outgrown giving small material cloth metal scrap simply forced delete h2 h2 experienced technical issue ui confusing tedious window cycle trying figure gliding fun needed map verticality fall damage unforgiving sliding slope mean taking massive damage finish sliding friendly crafting npc slightly annoying especially blacksmith constantly berating sound design excellent roll steep hill helpful look unintended goofy mining sulfur yield exp sulfur instantly break yield 10exp per swing minute 10 mining sulfur leveled level exp rate mining sulfur efficient exploring killing npc appropriate lack density difficulty depth need cook oven need greatly improve s_emphasizedelection enemy combat incentivized explore area ea share loot table gear drop early area bad great rate 5 10 wait 6 12 month investing enshrouded revisit update grammar 2 response comment observation primarily thing mind 22 hour welcome state certainly dislike recommendable love style love succeed no_problem supporting ea expect hiccup bump incomplete excuse criticism s_emphasizedtill product paid saw enshrouded particularly unique stand competitor market primarily rated 5 10 feel middle road state game ea development continues stated og revisit subsequent update
1203620,Enshrouded,"Please note that this is a review after only 10 hours play time, after playing for longer now, there have been some changes to how mechanics work due to my progress, so please take this review as a sub 10 hour experience and nothing more.

[h1] This game ticks so many boxes for me. [/h1]

[h2] The good stuff [/h2]

[h3] Great game feel [/h3]

Walking, running, jumping, gliding, swinging, gathering, terraforming and fluidity of combat all feel really solid and play major roles in the world in their own unique way

[h3] Fun Exploration [/h3]

it has enough different meaningful encounters that you want to see what's upstairs in that derelict building, or cave that seemingly goes on forever. Usually when you go out of your way to explore, you are rewarded.

[h3] Seamless and interesting Questing system [/h3]

Quests aren't slow or meaningless. You're trying to find your next follower who have their own back stories to follow, or you can just happen to stumble upon a letter left by a [spoiler] mysterious princess in some shabby abandoned camp [/spoiler] which lead to scandals and secrets later on in your play through.

[h3] Less frustrating food and drink system [/h3]

You don't get hungry or thirsty, yet you can eat and drink. Why? Because they act as buffs! It's the best of both worlds because it's not a system you have to micro manage, yet if you use it, similar to potions, you will have an easier time, and it's totally your choice!

[h3] Clear map [/h3]

It's so easy to know what you need to do, and where you need to do it. You can place custom way points and uncover the fog of war system as you explore, it's so easy and intuitive. There are also teleport systems you can find (and ones you can build too) to make traversing the world much easier.

[h3] Upgrading weapons [/h3]

Really fun and easy upgrade system that lets you sacrifice weapons you find in the world for tokens which can be used to upgrade your favourite weapons to make them even more powerful. There are also other ways to get these tokens too.

[h2] The things i didn't like so much [/h2]

[h3] Building [/h3]

The game doesn't require you to build crazy things if you don't want too (I'm thinking like a big fortress to keep out waves of enemies like in Valheim or The Forest) Which is a good thing in my opinion. Building is fairly solid and easy to grasp, and someone with an imaginative brain could certainly create some wonders, however i found the UI for it a bit finicky. It stood out because it didn't feel as smooth as the rest of the game does.

[h3] Crafting [/h3]

I like the items you can craft, and the fact that it's pretty easy to craft stuff in general, but i HATE the fact you need to jump around from the work bench to one of the followers, or tab across to the basic stuff. I would like to see this reworked in a way that all the craftable items you have unlocked are available from the workbench. Do this and you have streamlined this process for us!

[h3] The red stuff [/h3]

Oh my god what a horrible awful frustrating mechanic!!!! GET RID OF THIS OR NERF IT PLEASE! you'll be walking jump and hopping over terrain to get somewhere and there is just this pit of death you couldn't see that kills you within 2 seconds. and most of the time you can't scamper up the edges to save yourself. You lose some of your items (Which is ok), however when you go to retrieve them, they have spawned on the side of the slippery terrain you can't properly scamper across to collect it! My suggestion with this, is make sure all the banks surrounding the red stuff are climbable, and increase the time you can be in there to give the player a fighting chance to recover from their mistake.,and also make the items that drop from you reachable 100% of the time.

[b] As an early access game this is a solid 9/10! There are some bits i would like to see changed in full release for it to keep this rating, but i have a lot of faith in the devs from what I've seen so far. I'm going to continue playing and unlock everything i can. I'm very excited to see where this title goes.

1203620,Enshrouded,"This is a fun, Valheim like survival/adventure game (no eating/drinking to stay alive, you just get buffs) with a whole lot of potential. Personally if you are not to sure about this game just wait for the purchase, but I have been waiting for a game just like this one for a while and I have certainly been enjoying it. 
The multiplayer gets too much hate, this is not a game meant for random people and I don't know why people are pretending it is. With 1-2 friends that are coordinated and don't rush quests there is not issue. If you want to play with more than a few people then issues might arise, but once again just don't rush quests alone. 
The combat is fun, much more fun than Valhiem's, but still needs a bit more variety. I have by no means fought every enemy but most are pretty similar and not too difficult. The skill tree is fine, not to complicated (maybe a bit basic). 
The building is more enjoyable than Valhiem's with much more customizability and depth. The only issues with space (you have a limited area to build than can be moved around) I could think of, is once again when you have too many people playing. The world reverting is a bit odd, but it keep the resources from being a super long grind (like Valhiem's). I think that chests shouldn't respawn, instead everyone on the server should have personal chests but it's not too much of an issue. I see people complaining about cheesing runes with grinding chests and salvaging the loot but it's YOUR choice. If you want to cheese, go for it but don't complain about it. The puzzles are the same for me, yes you can technically break all the doors down and avoid the puzzles but that's not a fun way of playing the game. Don't complain about cheeses when you don't have to do them yourself.

All in all the game is fun, it certainly feels like an upgrade to Valhiem. More depth is needed with characters and biomes and the server-tied quests probably need changing. I would recommend playing it but its not a game you should feel to bad about not getting (yet).","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",fun valheim survival adventure no_eating drinking stay alive buff potential personally not_to wait purchase waiting certainly enjoying multiplayer get hate not_a meant random pretending 1 2 friend coordinated rush quest not_issue issue arise rush quest alone combat fun fun valhiem need bit variety no_means fought enemy pretty similar not_too difficult skill tree fine not_to complicated maybe bit basic building enjoyable valhiem customizability depth issue space limited build moved world reverting bit odd resource super long grind valhiem chest respawn personal chest not_too issue complaining cheesing rune grinding chest salvaging loot choice cheese complain puzzle yes technically break door avoid puzzle not_a fun complain cheese fun certainly feel upgrade valhiem depth needed character biome tied quest probably changing recommend not_a bad not_getting
1203620,Enshrouded,"Valheim but from Germany. 

It's a nice looking open world and doesn't take you by the hand too much. Crafting is straightforward and the battles are simple. Easily playable with controller or mouse and keyboard. I preferred the controller. Weapon balance still needs some tweaking. Ranged and magic is easier and more powerful than melee, but all options are viable.","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",valheim germany nice open world t_emphasizedake hand crafting straightforward battle simple easily playable controller mouse keyboard preferred controller weapon balance need tweaking ranged magic easier powerful melee option viable
1203620,Enshrouded,"This game is so good, i wanna play 24/7 XD everything from visuals, music, mining, farming, crafting to combat is great - controls/UI very intuitive - the building system is PHENOMENAL !!!! you can get lost easily for hours ( or days !! ) creating your base or a whole village,  block by block XD trying different styles and layouts, there's so many materials to work with - builder heaven \o/ 
i just finished rebuilding a half destroyed town up north, with a friend - we stumbled upon it during a quest and fell in love with the layout of the town and buildings .. now we're spending our time fixing walls, bridges, roofs, decorating rooms instead of being out there beating up baddies XD
I never played a game where the player could change already existing buildings to that extent, that's a first for me !
Having the 5 NPCs like the blacksmith, hunter, farmer etc live on your base is also a nice touch, makes it feel even more like a home :) 

The wide variety of weapons, armor, spells & potions and impressive skill trees also allows for a plethora of different builds !
Of course, the game is still in early access, the world is not infinite but also absolutely not small and filled with quests, secrets and treasure \o/ there's a lot to explore already, a good variety of different biomes, animals, enemies, plants, ores etc. .. the shroud itself is also a very refreshing concept .. the thrill of entering a foggy, hostile, nightmarish home to strong enemies that could easily end you or to get the life sucked out of you by the shroud itself if you don't get out in time ! 

all in all, excellent value for the money, highly recommending it ! can't wait to see what else the developers have planned for us XD","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",good wan na 24 7 xd visuals music mining farming crafting combat great control ui intuitive building phenomenal lost easily hour day creating base village block block xd trying different style layout s_emphasizedo material builder heaven finished rebuilding half destroyed town north friend stumbled fell love layout town building spending fixing wall bridge roof decorating room beating baddie xd never_played already existing building extent 5 npc blacksmith hunter farmer live base nice touch make home wide variety weapon armor spell potion impressive skill tree allows plethora different build course early access world not_infinite not_small filled quest secret treasure explore already good variety different biome animal enemy plant ore shroud refreshing concept thrill entering foggy hostile nightmarish home strong enemy easily life sucked shroud excellent value highly recommending wait else developer planned xd
1203620,Enshrouded,"I've put nearly 50 hours into this with my friend after thinking, since its EA, it would be 10 or so hours of content and we'd be done like similar games. That is most certainly not the case here and I'm honestly impressed and pleased.

What I like:
- Building is incredible. I absolutely love building/crafting in these games, so for me, I feel like I've been given too much power in the amount of customization you can bring to whatever you build. There are so many block options that its hard to choose, although there are, as of writing this, only 6 Roof options so I think there should be more to match.
- Progression doesn't feel restricting. There are quests that help you progress in the game to craft new gear, items, food etc, but you can do these quests in any order you wish. You aren't locked into a specific quest and forced to do it and nothing else (looking at V Rising) in order to progress. If you want to craft the best armor, you can simply ignore the other NPC's and do the Blacksmith quests just to get to the iron weapons without the need to do the Hunter quests for some reason. Speaking of, the amount of quests these 5 NPC's have is astounding. You are never short of a goal, which I find refreshing.
- The map is enormous. When my friend and I started playing, we were under the impression it would be one small portion of a much larger map that we'd be restricted to. But only after 30 hours of playing did we finally reach the SECOND area/biome of the game. Granted we do a lot of exploring and stuff, but there is so much to the map and so much more to come its honestly refreshing. Especially for EA.
- Fashion honestly on point (would like Vanity slots because we love fashion).
- The Shroud mechanic is simply great and fun to work around.
- Double Jump is based.

What I think they can improve:
- Enemy AI breaks quite often, with them getting stuck in terrain, and I feel like they do a ton more damage than they should, even with upgraded armor to match the level. Damage and Armor values could probably be adjusted a bit to better match the levels at which you are fighting.
- Logging out (or crashing) and starting back at your base is quite annoying to be honest. I would rather log back in to where I was standing than being forced back home, especially since we can Teleport back any time we want (except in the Shroud).
- Enemy variety. While we have seen quite a few different enemies between the humans, shroud creatures, and dangerous wildlife, I simply think there's room for much more.
- Skill Tree. I'm not quite accustomed to these types of Skill Trees, however this one is quite easy to understand you get what you get. I think there could be better placements in some of the skills and perhaps even updated with better skills in certain places. While Blink is cool, it holds so much less value than Double Jump, which I feel is like a must have at this point, because you can get to so many different places with it.
- TOOL TIPS. My God, what I hate most in games is when you don't know what something is and are forced to resort to a wiki for information. I just want some kind of tool tip, pop out, info entry or something for certain things. What is ""Opportunity Damage?"" What is ""-600 Stamina Timeout Deletion?"" Even after looking online, nobody *really* knows. I should be able to scroll over something or open a journal and it tells me right there that ""Opportunity Damage is the first hit against an overpowered enemy."" (I'm not exactly sure if that's it, so do not quote me on that) Great, thanks. That's easy.
- Weapon Variety. Currently, there are 1 Handed Swords, Maces, and Axes + Shields and 2 Handed Swords, Maces, and Axes + Bows, Wands, and Staves. There are skills that increase backstab damage, so why not add in weapons that are associated with that, such as daggers. What about more ranged options for physical damage dealers like Crossbows, Boomerangs, Chakrams? Spears were the most commonly used weapon, so I think they earn a spot. And then there's Dual Wielding. I'm a rogue at heart and love dual wielding. Please Dev's, let me live my rogue-ish dreams with double daggers :)
- Shroud Roots. Okay, I understand the reason for the Shroud Roots respawning is for other players to destroy them for Skill Points. However, with them respawning, it's making it seem like we aren't making any active change in the world, even though that's technically what getting rid of them does. I don't know how they could be altered to achieve this sense of change in the world, but perhaps there's a way. Even if the set area around the Root is clear of Shroud would be a step in the right direction.

What I think they can add:
- Pets/Mounts/Breeding/Taming. Currently, there some passive animals like rabbits, sheep, and chickens. On the flip side, we aggressive wolves, dino birds, scorpions, armadillo things, tiger-likes in the desert. There are no horses or cows. You can't tame anything, so you are restricted to killing everything in order to get meat and eggs. I think it would be great to have a land vehicle option such as horses and tone down the player speed so they are actually valuable. Let us tame cows for milk, chickens for eggs. Maybe even tame and befriend a wolf as a friend. Anything that would make the game feel a little less lonely.
- Weather options. Currently, there is only a day/night cycle with nothing in between. Give us rain, snow, sandstorms, fog, lighting, to make the world feel more lively and dangerous. Maybe even add like a Shroud Fog, where sometimes it expands unnaturally and you're forced to stay indoors to avoid it or risk venturing out into for new resources and encountering different monsters.
- NPC's. I understand that the lore of the game revolves around us and the 5 other NPC's we rescue being some of the last people because of the shroud, but there are clearly other humans. Most enemies we fight are humans trying to survive. So why not add in more neutral or friendly NPC's throughout the world that we can find and interact with? Maybe they have some small quests or even just basic lore drops (because currently, all the lore you have is from notes and your imagination based on surroundings). I think it would also make the world more lively by having someone hiding away from the scavengers or a small caravan of people escaping their shroud infested town or home. I don't know. And maybe allow us to invite them to live at our home base to make it more like a settlement of survivors.
- Enemy Raids. Currently, there isn't much that makes you feel like you're in danger the majority of the time. Since there are already so many scavengers and people trying to survive, why not add some raiders that attack your home for food and resources? Make us feel like we're in danger more often than not.

All of that was at the top of my head. I'm sure there is more I could write about, but I've brained enough for now. Overall, I think this is already such an amazing game with so much potential to be incredible. I'm super excited to see where they go with this game and how they expand the world.","Very Positive86% of the 31,540 user reviews for this game are positive.",nearly 50 hour friend ea 10 hour similar game certainly not_the case honestly impressed pleased building incredible love building crafting game given power customization bring whatever build block option hard choose writing 6 roof option progression restricting quest help progress craft gear item food quest order wish locked specific forced else v rising order progress craft best armor simply ignore non blacksmith quest iron weapon hunter quest speaking quest 5 non astounding never_short goal refreshing map enormous friend started we_emphasizedre impression small portion larger map restricted 30 hour finally reach biome granted exploring stuff map honestly refreshing especially ea fashion honestly vanity slot love fashion shroud mechanic simply great fun double based improve enemy ai break stuck terrain ton damage upgraded armor damage armor value probably adjusted bit level fighting logging crashing starting base annoying honest rather log standing forced home especially teleport except shroud enemy variety different enemy human shroud creature dangerous wildlife simply room skill tree not_quite accustomed type skill tree easy understand be_emphasizedtter placement skill perhaps updated skill certain place blink cool hold value double different place tool tip god hate game forced resort wiki information kind tool tip pop info entry certain thing opportunity damage 600 stamen timeout deletion online know able scroll open journal tell opportunity damage overpowered enemy not_exactly not_quote great thanks easy weapon variety currently 1 handed sword mace ax shield 2 handed sword mace ax bow wand stave skill increase backstab damage not_add weapon associated dagger ranged option physical damage dealer crossbow boomerang chakrams spear commonly weapon earn spot dual wielding rogue heart love dual wielding please live rogue ish dream double dagger shroud root okay understand shroud root respawning player destroy skill point respawning active world technically rid altered achieve sense world perhaps set root clear shroud direction add pet mount breeding taming currently passive animal rabbit sheep chicken flip side aggressive wolf dino bird scorpion armadillo thing tiger like desert no_horses cow t_emphasizedame restricted killing order meat egg great land vehicle option horse tone speed valuable tame cow milk chicken egg maybe tame befriend wolf friend lonely weather option currently night cycle rain snow sandstorm fog lighting world lively dangerous maybe add shroud fog expands unnaturally forced stay indoors avoid risk venturing resource encountering different monster non understand lore revolves 5 non rescue last shroud clearly human enemy fight human trying survive not_add neutral friendly non throughout world interact maybe small quest basic lore drop currently lore note imagination based surroundings world lively someone hiding scavenger small caravan escaping shroud infested town home maybe allow invite live home base settlement survivor enemy raid currently make danger majority already scavenger trying survive not_add raider attack home food resource danger not_all top head write brained already amazing potential incredible super excited expand world
1203620,Enshrouded,"In short: Valheim had a baby with Zelda BOTW with a little sprinkle of Elden Ring.

Game, for being a very young EA, is beautifully rich with plenty of content. The map is ""only"" half done, which will still keep you occupied for 50ish hours, which will be expanded and developed in the future.

It's a very diverse exploration action rpg game with a simple yet solid building and crafting system. 

Difficulty wise it's pretty easy as the difficulty ramps up so does your power scaling so don't expect a Dark Souls challenge, yet some combats still feel rewarding.

1203620,Enshrouded,"I wish there was a ""thumbs horizontal buy in a year"" option.

+ a technological marvel. Voxels are a difficult foundation to 'get right' and Enshrouded has a mini-voxel world with good performance, attractive to the eye, and enjoyable to explore.

But ... most of the effort has gone into that foundation.

- the world is basically like an MMO; mobs spawn in certain locations and wait for you to come to them

- there's no threat in the world perse. you can build, build big, and never worry about storms, starvation, hostiles, world bosses coming to you etc. And this lack of threat is a big part of the game being very passive.

Threats only exist when you go out to find them, but then the game is extremely gentle: death doesn't really mean anything, fast travelling everywhere - including home - is more convenient as a free uber ride on demand.

You go out to unlock resources you need only for short durations/periods of the game, a boss head you need once, a recipe to complete a quest, and then you turn the page and repeat that in a different part of the world. Fast travel here, beat the spawns, collect xyz, fast travel home. Repeat.

 Without threat and consequence, the world feels like a lovely tapestry to play on and run about the 3d art to get a visual treat ... while never quite being pulled *IN* on a deeper level.

It feels like Conan Exiles, but EA, so without depth of content.

The skill tree is also flawed and I suspect will get some balancing corrections.

AI .. doesn't really exist. It's year 2000 WoW levels of ""spawn here and do nothing unless aggroed, then run at the aggroer""

In all it is not a bad game, it is just a thin game with shallow content. Good for builders who just want to build, but if you are looking for a survival game where every x-time the mobs come to you and wreck your base, or the Shroud covers everything like THE FOG and mobs spawn in a world attack ...... this is not it.

This is a passive game where base building doesn't matter, so you do it just because you can. 

I suspect in a year, in two years, the game will have more meat to the bones ... more purpose ... but it's EA, so ...

1203620,Enshrouded,"71 Hours to complete the Early Access release version. 

I seldom write reviews but Enshrouded has compelled me to put my thoughts down. Is the game good? Yes and No. 

Gameplay is fun and the sense of exploration is fantastic. It has a great foundation to be something special BUT it has some fundamental design issues. 

1) Leveling is very poorly done. I progressed through 40ish or so hours with the exact same weapons. A million common drops or even worse Legendary drops with worse stats than an early Epic really takes you out of grinding. 

2) Enemy variety is lacking. You will encounter 5 or 6 enemy types the entire game. Every area begins to feel the same because you are constantly facing the same enemy types. 

3) Enemy Scaling is garbage. Killing a Level 1 enemy vs killing a Level 30 drops the same exact loot. Why would I farm a higher tier zone? Only point of higher tier zones is for materials tied only to these areas. It is not face stronger enemies with better drops.

4) Building types are pointless. Over the course of your play through you will pick up better build block types. Some even with the Epic tag. The problem with this, there is literally no point in using them. They do not give a comfort bonus for higher tier/nicer build blocks. There is also zero point is having more than 1 base. Place a main base, then only put alters and a work bench to repair weapons/tools if needed while farming. Another problem with bases, they're never attacked. This really draws away from the point of building bigger or more secure. You could live out of a 1x2 with a big court foundation square for your minions the entire game. 

5) Quests are mehhhh, not terrible but not wonderful either. It's basically 3 quest types. Fetch, Kill/Boss Fights, & Area clears. Quests types could really use some variety. 

All in all, I enjoyed my early access time with Enshrouded but I don't think I'll be back for a while. It will need a lot of updates and design changes for me to attempt another play through. My recommendation, give it a solid 2 years in the oven to mature.

Edit: Clarification is obviously needed why I'm down voting aka Not Recommending. The comments have clearly leaned into three areas (Time spent, Value, and You liked it?!?!). 

1) ""You put 70 hours and down vote, clown"" 
2) ""70 hours is a lot of value for an EA title""
3) ""You said gameplay is fun & it has an excellent foundation""

Let me be clear. I enjoyed Enshrouded, but each passing day, that spark dimmed. I want to elaborate why I've set my review to Not Recommended. 

Day 1, ""WOW this map is huge and look at all these icons!"" As time passed, hmmm ok, it's a repeat of the same things to do over and over. Fighting the same enemies, just to receive the same mediocre loot. 

Next high to low moment, building my base. ""Ok, the building controls are solid and work well. ""Damn there are a million build types"", ""Wait, I can't just upgrade the material type? I have to remove and add, why???"" ""Nothing attacks, whats the point in spending time doing all of this?"" At the end I realized that building for the screenshot is nice and all, but having a built in game mechanic, the comfort bonus that does not interface with building qualities that unlock along your journey is very lackluster. One, because building & harvesting resources is a time requirement w/ no payback and two, there is no threat to make you engage w/ protecting your investment. 

Again, same thing with leveling. At the start it's flowing and unlocking all these new crafting recipes, but yet again the flaws start to show. Why am I going to these higher tier zones, getting weapons & armor that is higher quality but worse stats. Then you start seeing weapons and armor on repeat, ohhh ok so the loot table isn't large enough yet. This is one area that could make the game immediately jump up in quality. It needs to feel exciting grinding for better gear. 

I say all this to come to my final point. Yes, I put 70 hours on a $30 game. Does that qualify as good cost to time value, absolutely. I've also reiterated the foundation of the game is fantastic and has the potential to be the best action RPG/survival game that's come out in the last few years. I think most of these flaws will be addressed as they move through Early Access, which come to my final key point. If I had to do it again, I'd wait until these things are addressed. I've completed EA and left Enshrouded feeling like the journey was shallow. That lasting impression is hard to escape, so for that......I suggest anyone on the fence to wait for these areas to be fixed.

The Good

The landscape terraforming in this game is top tier, same with the building, seriously the building is so good and if you really experiment with the smallest block shape, you can really make some fantastic builds! The Lighting and shadows are fantastic, very realistic.  Gliders and grappling hooks rock. Exploration is key to advancing and being able to build/craft new items.  Combat can be alot of fun. I personally have an Nvidia 2070 RTX (not the super), on Ultra graphics settings, and this game runs amazingly smooth, no jittering, no lag, no frame rate drop and I have not had a single crash in 84 hours.  Simple truth. 

The iffy?  (it's early access so I won't say bad)

Player characters could use ALOT more customization and could be able to sit in chairs at least?  Seriously what good is a chair if you can't sit in it? Also.. maybe the ability to choose to identify as tall? What's a hobbit without their tall wizard friend? a dead hobbit. 

Some of the armor..  Helmets specifically, look like .. like when you were a kid and your mom, who has not a creative bone in her body, wanted to save money on your Halloween costume and made it herself and now you have no choice but to wear it out of necessity in order to get your candy, no matter how horrible it looks. Seriously, they are that bad.

No weather, at all.  The NPC's talk about building them a house with a roof in order to take them out of the elements. What elements? Where are the elements? Why do you need a roof, it's always sunny, it never snows or rains or storms! It's the perfect weather all year long! 

Lack of water on the map. Not lack of, there is not a single lake, pond, river or even a puddle. Where exactly is my water well getting it's water from? 

Day/Night cycle-  A vast improvement over the demo, I mean..At least there is a small transition now, could still use some work.  

Exploration- The loot can be just...awful..  A lot of the buildings you find are bland on the inside and you find yourself just rushing through things.  The landscape however is very good. It's just not exciting to find another village..camp..ETC. 

By the time I got the final few building blocks, I really lost the need to build anything at all, especially when buildings hardly have a function or purpose. 

Final thoughts- The game is very good as is and fully enjoyable as well as has a TON of potential if the developers listen to the players. Seriously, new additions/changes for the better to this game could make it fantastic!

1203620,Enshrouded,"Enshrouded is an exploration game with some interesting mechanisms and somewhat boring enemy variety. The game is in Early Access, just like every similar game at their first release, to me this type of release looks more as a scam than a feature, so the outcome of my review is based on the content and fun I received based on the price of the game, not based on future promises.

So the background of the game is…. Ok, so something happened :-D I wish I could tell more but friends were shouting in discord to skip the intro and let's start the game. Shame on me, I have not started a second character yet. One thing is clear, something cataclysmic happened, which wiped out civilization and every human being. Some, including you, survived in sealed chambers. While my friends also kept playing until the end, after a dozen hours all of us continued in single player. Why? I’ll explain that, so let’s check with the problems of the game first:

[h1]Disliked[/h1]

The issue which forced us to play alone, while irregularly joining to the servers of friends to help them against bigger enemies are the quests. Most of the time it was finished only for one of us, while it stayed in the quest log of the other players, just like all the marks on the map for the players who suffered by the bug of the unfinished quest.
I disliked the low variety of enemies. You will find the same enemies in the shroud at level 1 and at areas where the enemies are level 30. Do you like to beat wolves at lvl 1 area? Fine! But I guess you are not curious about them after 20 hours at level 11 areas. A creative mind was clearly missing on the project.
While I liked the build aspect of the game, it might have happened because I have not played many similar games. Even not, when friends keep telling me i should play Valheim, but hey, Valheim don’t have achievements, i don’t play such games 😃 Still, I have a certain feeling of lack, expected more building variety, round object, pillars, and so on. Probably more will come during Early Access, but i said, i review the game based on current feelings.
Some minor bugs, like enemies stuck in the ground, nothing serious 😃

[h1]Liked[/h1]

I liked the shroud mechanics. You go in the “fog”, and you have only a few minutes to explore before it consumes you. Some talents or increasing the strength of your flame altar increases this time, but the risk always touches your nerve system while you get lost in the shroud and trying to find a way out as you run out of your last seconds.
Gliding. It is just awesome. Not sure I mentioned it before, but gliding is AWESOME. Did i? I think not, so: gliding is awesome.
Huge world, there are a lot of areas to explore, different biomes.
Building aspect: while it was in the negatives, because of the lack of round pillars, objects and because I could expect a bit more variety of items, it is important to notice that you can build walls, pillars, etc, from millions of different materials. This is the only aspect of the game where the variety already reaches what is expected in a fully released game.
Not experienced a single crash and was not falling through the floor 😃 Nowadays it is important to mention these ☹️
Btw, Gliding is fantastic 😁

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Enshrouded is not a bad game, there are room for improvements, sure, but I already enjoyed it in current version, was totally worth the 30€(-10%? Release discount, i don’t remember how much it was), and usually i am very hesitating when i need to spend that much on a game, I am usually waiting for deep discounts. If 

[h1]Hey, I am an achievement hunter![/h1]

[b]How to perfect?:[/b] Just play the game. It is long, yes, but eventually you should get everything as achievements really for fully exploring the map, all flame altars (you might get the location marker unlocked by found scrolls, but you still need to go there, marking actually visited flame altars with custom markers is recommended), cutting out all shroud trees, levelling up to max, etc. Nothing really hard or challenging, but as the world is huge, it will take some time. Don’t need to be afraid if none of your friends are playing this game, there are no MP achievements at all.
[b]Perfection Difficulty:[/b] 3/10. As I said already, completion is not difficult, it just takes time, but some bosses/areas might be good, if you have a friend who is also playing the game and can assist you.
[b]100% time:[/b] ~50h+

1203620,Enshrouded,"The game is rather good, but as it is right now (early access), I can't recommend it.

At least unless you want to play anything but a mage.
Melee combat is lackluster at best and you better have some souls-honed reflexes to make it, especially with multiple enemies.

Archery is.... let me paint you a picture. You go out, shoot some enemies. It generally takes 2-3 shots to take down a normal, level appropriate enemy. There's A LOT of enemies, EVERYWHERE. In addition, you have a skill that shoots several arrows at once randomly, which seems to shoot 3-5 arrows. So no matter how many arrows you have at the start of  your adventure, they won't be enough, forcing you to port back to base.

Now, put the anger from not completing your objective cause you lacked arrows for the final push aside, and immerse yourself in arrow making.
Spend 20+ minutes hitting twigs with a pickaxe of all things to farm enough twigs
Spend 20+ minutes farming ores for arrowheads (each new tier takes longer to mine)
Spend 20+ minutes chasing road runners all around the desert area for feathers (they are FAST and have absurdly small hitboxes, so good luck spending less ammo than you want to craft lol)
Then spend another 20+ minutes staring at the smelter as it SLOWLY melts your ore into ingots... that is, if you have farmed enough wood beforehand to make enough charcoal to even smelt the darn things.

WHY. What raging sadist thought this would be fun. I spend like 4+ hours of each day just preparing arrows. I'm still not even at max level. Mages have eternal spells that don't need ammo, and they can also craft single use spells rather cheaply. Fighters don't have to bother with that at all and just hack and slash till their weapon loses all durability (and they can easily carry several and half the enemy camps contain a repair bench anyways). Why are archers getting the shaft?

You can only hold so many arrows. Every kind takes a slot and only goes up to 500 per stack.
- you get no arrows and no damage if you miss
- you lose more than half damage unless you hit the enemy into the weak spot
- you are useless without arrows, because you have no base, unlimited ammo. Only craftable ammo
- unlike all other weapons you can't block at all. Good luck backflipping from all the attack bugs
- autoaim (""target lock"") doesn't hit half the enemies by default (shoots under their feet), and doesn't aim for the weak spot, so it actually actively hinders you
- you can't loot arrows off fallen enemies either, so every time you shoot you're losing 1-5 ammo, and you STILL deal less damage than any other archetype
- oh, and if it wasn't enough, ANYTHING in the way stops arrows from reaching enemy. Fence? Leaves? Tall grass? NOPE, arrows don't have enough force to penetrate a leaf, that's also why they don't stagger enemies either even if you unerringly shoot them in the head (there's only some standard random ~10% chance to stagger as with all player attacks), unless they are programmed to shut down (like Fell Wispwyvern when you shoot it during one special animation)
- hawk eye  perk actively hinders you as well, as the insane zoom makes you completely unable to judge distance and seemingly makes arrows 4x heavier so you miss completely most of the time thanks to arrows hitting the ground before making it to the enemy

You can have your own solo world and private experience by yourself, then take that same character to a brand new server to experience the fun with friends without affecting your save.

When playing with friends, if a quest is completed while you're offline you will still have the quest marker on your map and the quest items/bosses respawn! You can still go to the marker and ""complete"" the quest which will remove it from your quest log and give you XP. 

There's a huge variety of side quests sprinkled throughout the map through Lore books, some are given to you by the NPCs in your base. They're entirely optional obviously but they do help you explore the cursed lands of Embervale. What makes this even better is that side quests are repeatable, so if you have a shared server, people who miss these can go back to grab them at any time or complete them while they wait for the rest of the party to progress together.

The game itself is fantastic, the world feels amazing and full of things to do but that is also a problem, if you play on a server with more than a few of you, the world will not regen its monsters, loot, resources or anything for that matter as its on a 2 hour refresh rate that can also have that timer reset if someone enters that area, this paired with the fact quests are not shared nor the progress and can cause issues for others to not allow them to finish them is a huge flaw in the co-op aspect, and well also this game was marketed heavy towards co-op and multiplayer even the launch trailer was co-op heavy.

I saw a review stating the game seemed more catered to the single player survival game, and i cant help but shake that feeling that this game is more appealing if played as single player as opposed to playing with friends.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"We're all aware of [b]Skill-Based Matchmaking[/b] (SBMM). 

...but have you ever heard of [b]Engagement-Optimized Matchmaking[/b] (EOMM)? That's what MW2022 uses.

Ever feel like one day you're on a roll, but the next day you can't win a single game? There's a reason for that.

Here's one quote from Activision's EOMM patent they renewed in 2019 ([url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US10857468B2]source[/url]):

[quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2] 
    ...responsive to a determination that the first player purchased the in-game item, the player profile may be updated to reflect the purchase and [b]the first player may be matched to play a second gameplay session[/b] in which the in-game item is suitable to be used.

    For example, if the in-game item is a weapon (e.g., an accurate and powerful sniper rifle), the second gameplay session may be selected because the weapon is highly effective in the second gameplay session. Doing so [b]may encourage the first player to make subsequent purchases[/b] due to the satisfaction of effectively using the in-game item during the second gameplay session.
[/quote]

TL;DR: Microtransactions directly influence matchmaking, rather than skill. 

Not enough? Here's Activison's argument for why EOMM was necessary over SBMM:

[quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2] 
Conventional systems further fail to leverage matchmaking processes in other contexts, [b]such as influencing game-related purchases[/b], suggesting group formations, training/identifying non-player characters, and/or otherwise extending the use of the matchmaking process. These and other drawbacks exist with current matchmaking processes utilized in multiplayer video games.

This game is manipulating you. It doesn't care about how good you are. It doesn't care how much fun you have. It cares about your money, and Activision is willing to ruin your lobbies to get it.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.

People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.

Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE. 

The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions. 

You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless. Please spend your money on something better than this.","Mixed57% of the 529,504 user reviews for this game are positive.",terrible warzone get pay shafted developer fed scrap decision driven secret internal algorithm activision us maximize profit cosmetic player long possible make single released birth warzone soulless directionless comparison buying fully priced dlc call game releasing primarily problem call duty fan love fed yearly slop cry criticize lack critical skill required understand criticize hating entire franchise activision consistently repeatedly overwork developer stifle actual creativity obviously apparent zombie mode offering cold war single zombie map 50 reused asset campaign progressed vanguard extremely terrible attempt small scale outbreak single round based map thrown remake modern warfare iii zombie literally warzone dmz zombie environmental hazard no_rounds 60 minute kicked 24 map entirely pve exec activision worst executive video gaming industry shamelessly forcing developer call duty implement worst unfun feature game optimize backend number show spend microtransactions reality macrotransactions not_support support activision blizzard released get lazier lazier activision cry largest innovative offering reality sloppiest soulless please spend

1938090,Call of Duty®,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.

11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on battle.net which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the battle.net servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download battle.net and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially  cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.","Mixed57% of the 529,504 user reviews for this game are positive.",pre ordered vault edition downloaded early access campaign 2 1 2 hour crashed rebooted permanently banned excuse contacted blizzard sent activision repealed ban activison denied unauthorized software permanent activision ban never_cheated no_access oh gladly took 100 dollar non refundable 2 hour imagine bugged server awful no_care customer 11 6 2022 thread amazing laughed hard awhile thank taking comment cod community hilarious fill happened discovered originally purchased battle net inital perm ban occured left reached activision numerous time 0 luck no_information talk work repealed ban instantly revoked received automated response ban enforced permanent requested refund denied battle net server logged 2 hour obviously campaign early access blizzard contacted link ban take blizzard mad wanted campaign purchased created activision great refund 2 hour hence 1 7 hour logged banned 1 7 hour hardware ban insane requested refund instantly whatever tried 3 week wake decide download battle net check status unbanned happened no_idea happened saw thread blowing read comment checked program installed pc constantly running background task manager read potentially cause issue corsair icue 4 software literally app make ram stick color red lol uninstalled safe headache never_know happened 3 ish week disappeared dealing issue cheater wrong hope thread help activision t_emphasizedake responsibility anti cheat software trash t_emphasizedell difference regular software malicious software issue thanks intelligence actual input commented

They promised 2 years of support and it turns out they scrapped that idea and they're just going to release a new COD game this year.

Furthermore, it's been 3 months and they've managed to add 3 new maps, 1 of which is an existing map that was just removed from the game for a while. 

They're primarily supporting Warzone 2.0 and barely devote any resources to the game people paid anywhere from $40 to $70. 

At this point Battlefield 2042 has had a better turnaround. At least they don't just release a new game the following year and are continuing to improve their game.

Also it's not just me who encountered this issue, it's multiple people, they don't get help at all and they are basically getting scammed. If you own a mouse with advanced settings, (EX) Razer Cortex (What I use), I guess you could get banned because having some extra buttons is cheating apparently.

One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me.

After investing hundreds of hours playing, buying ingame credits and thoroughly enjoying this product, I have become one of the countless people innocently perma banned for ""modifying the software"". There is no way to appeal this, get unbanned or even talk with a person. Most disturbing is that now access to the single player campaign mode is also blocked!

While the game itself is a classic, I highly DO NOT recommend buying or investing ANY money in this product as a system crash, any number of unrelated 3rd party software or thier own game crashing, allow the company to unilaterally deny you access to a game you purchased. And, this potentially contaminates any linked account or store (like Steam) you use, even other platforms.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.

The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.

If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.

If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.

I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.

I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.","Mixed57% of the 529,504 user reviews for this game are positive.",clearly crafted care respect cannot_in good conscience recommend exactly buying pretty okay campaign somewhat worthwhile kill 10 hour crux dilapidated abandoned mistreated unfinished barren wasteland classic multiplayer warzone plan warzone warzone no_reason treat classic multiplayer warzone weapon leveling simulator problem perfectly good wz weapon leveling simulator dmz care leveling weapon wz look farming tutorial dmz hand hoping purchasing access quality classic multiplayer like decade ago sorely disappointed betrayed great depth lazily classic multiplayer treated honestly not_worth already wasted writing settle feel 4 map no_9v9 10v10 post launch seasonal focus 95 wz dmz aspect lobby disband open door predatory retention based matchmaking transparently attempt hooked perpetually dopamine dopamine cycle upset potential special cod black ops excited hooked seeing support mw2019 launch post launch release classic multiplayer offering season 2 clear classic multiplayer dead basically maintenance mode four month launch sad no_excuse classic multiplayer franchise consistently make billion dollar shafted

1938090,Call of Duty®,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.

On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.

All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.

Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB.
Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc.
Until Activision fixes their dogshit anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.

Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.

Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release. Everything just feels recycled and it is like Cod is trying to be something it is not.

But the art/animation and what I thought was another entry in my favorite genre (JRPG) motivated me to buy anyway... and this game is simply fun. Fun. Remember fun?

Look, the story is as barebones as it gets. Which is a shame, because it's clear there's a lot of quality lore and franchise history to pull from. The sidekick character is utterly awful to listen to. And the game lacks a good amount of PC settings, has limited frame rate support, and zero ultra wide support (though, it is relatively well optimized, I'll give it that).

But everything else? It's great. It's got high quality character action and stands toe to toe with Platinum's best. It's got more JRPG elements (gear, leveling, systems, parties, etc.) than the newest Final Fantasy. Its world is beautiful. The music is exceptional. The art and graphics are S-Tier. The world, while relatively linear, feels grand and alive. And the combat and boss battles are incredible. And apparently the end game brings PSO/MH-levels of hunting and grinding.

[/tr]
[tr]
[td] ✔️ Very capable party A.I. making progressing through even the postgame content viable for solo players. Likewise, this means developing characters you may not even play but who are part of your regular group feels rewarding.[/td]
[td] ❌Raising multiple characters is difficult to do. Throughout the roughly 30 hours it took me to progress into the final difficulty, I only managed to have one character up to the performance I would deem acceptable for those levels of quests.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td] ✔️ Fantastic presentation due to unrivaled visuals for its art style and a wide cast of accomplished Japanese voice actors, delivering an extremely cinematic experience during the main story.[/td]
[td] ❌ The English localization is infamously atrocious and ranges from awful voice acting on top of an already somewhat shaky script to outright mistranslations.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
[td] ✔️Strong replay value due to the large variety of unique characters and consistent unlocks even very late into the postgame, allowing for further difficulty modes in the campaign and a strong multiplayer component.[/td]
[td] ❌There are some balance issues. Originally, GBF was being called trivially easy, which in part is definitely true due to the Critical Gauge mechanic, but eventually begins outscaling the player during the postgame content.[/td]

[table]
[tr]
	[th]🟨 Miscellaneous Thoughts[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]The main story is somewhat short. If people merely focused on playing the campaign without side objectives for the credits, it would run between 12 and 14 hours. I, personally, got to the credits at 16 hours and then to the True Ending, another roughly 7 hours, which requires some decent progression into the harder postgame content.[/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

[h3]Technical Issues and Performance[/h3]
GBF:R ran without any issues. While there are some reports of people struggling to be able to boot the game shortly after launch, I have not encountered any such problems. The game never crashed, stuttered, or otherwise bugged out. The few hours of multiplayer I have played were stable, although the matchmaking is not exactly fantastic. 

[h3]Graphics and Sound[/h3]
Visually, GBF:R is utterly unrivaled for its art style. Both gameplay and cinematics look gorgeous, and there is an incredible amount of detail in just about every location.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3153437575

The sound design is not quite as impressive, with a soundtrack that is still generally good but not that memorable. The voice acting in the game’s original language is beyond fantastic, with a wide range of extremely talented and recognizable voice actors. The English dub, however, suffers from the aforementioned awful localization, at times changing the meaning of entire phrases, and likewise quite horrid voice acting.

[h3]Story and Setting[/h3]
You play as either Djeeta or Gran, depending on your gender preference for the main character, the Captain of a diverse cast of Skyfarers in a world entirely made up of floating sky islands. While in search of Estalucia, a fantastical utopia, you encounter a religious cult that takes interest in one of your friends who has the ability to seal and summon pseudo-godlike creatures like the dragon Bahamut.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3151952766

Needless to say, GBF is very much a JRPG with some interesting thematical parallels to specifically Final Fantasy, but it sets itself apart by its very unique setting. As a spin-off title to a gacha game, I was somewhat worried that the story may be an afterthought, but was generally surprised for that to not be the case, and as someone who has not played the gacha, I could follow the story fairly easily, though with a constant feeling of just lacking some context as to the interpersonal relationships of the different crew members.

There is a glossary that is just as boring to read as they always are, but it is nice that the game does give you an extensive interface through which you can browse anything from terms related to the world-building to the backstory of various characters and more. Characters also have mini-stories attached to them, which you unlock as you progress through the main story and level them up. Sadly, this seems to be a bit of a missed opportunity, as they are usually inconsequential enough to not provide significant character development and are also merely a few sentences short per episode.

Despite this, while I wouldn’t recommend GBF:R for the story alone, it is certainly on par with similar titles, such as the Tales of […] series, and may even be good enough to be recommended to fans of certain Final Fantasy titles due to the aforementioned thematic similarities.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
GBF:R can be broadly described as a hub-based and mission-centric action RPG. Campaign missions usually take place in a large, but fairly linear, level that encourages some exploration through collectibles and chests that consistently feel relevant and rewarding due to the different methods to progress your characters’ power level.

Side missions, and therefore the bulk of the postgame, take place in smaller segments of those aforementioned levels and range from mission types such as defending a static object to simple boss fights. Unlike other games in the genre, even later bossfights tend to be much faster, lasting typically between 2 and 8 minutes for the longer fights on anything above Maniac difficulty.

Fights are not just fast due to raw numbers, however, but combat tends to be very fast-paced in terms of how quickly attacks come out. To offset this, bigger attacks offer a telegraph a few moments before the attack actually fires. This is something that is very reminiscent of Final Fantasy 14, and I haven’t seen something like this used anywhere else. While this sort of MMO design, at first glance, feels a little odd, it actually does wonders for the game to be able to be as visually striking and responsive as it is, and I’m not sure combat would feel as good without this design decision.

As you progress through the story, you get to unlock more characters for the roster, each of which has a distinct weapon type and a unique gimmick; for example, Io, one of the immediately available characters, is a mage that augments her big spells through basic attacks, allowing for devastating combo-finishers. Each character also features multiple linear skill trees that eventually unlock further active abilities that can be freely slotted in to create unique builds. While this feels impactful, it never felt like I could augment a character towards a distinct role. Rather, the game is very centered around dealing as much damage as possible, even on the later, extremely lethal missions, since outlasting enemies through support just doesn’t feel very feasible.

[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]
GBF:R is fast, flashy, and eventually scales to become extremely difficult in the late postgame. While this results in an awkward difficulty curve, it is an incredibly rewarding experience that still has a serviceable story on top of it all. Looking back at the game, while it probably will not end up breaking any new ground, I can’t really pinpoint any single aspect of the game that is outright bad and was a rare experience that I simply enjoyed going through from booting it up for the first time up until the very end.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Bought it right away for my steamdeck. It work well right out of the box. Standard is the default settings and RECOMMENDED for now. It run stable at 30fps for me. I tried 60 fps but it not stable and fluctuate between 40-55 fps. If you want to play higher than 30FPS, change the Max FPS in game to 60. After that set frame limit to 40 in the Steam Quick Access Menu ( depend if you want or not). Moreover, the only time i see performance drop is while being at the area of Village/Town. The scenes happening there also may cause a bit of performance drop. The minimum i ever get is 27 FPS. There is no significant drop while in-battle,other area outside village,multiplayer. Those work without an issue and pretty stable for me.

Edit 1: After few configurations, i find out Proton Experimental give a little bit of boost to fps but not necessarily needed. You may stick to default if it work fine for you. I also use cryoutilities recommended settings and set UMA Buffer to 4 in Steamdeck BIOS. It does make the performance bit better than default. Do this at your own risk and if you know what you doing. If no, just stick to default setting as long it work fine on 30 FPS. Changing in-game setting from Standard to Higher will impact the performance, so just stick to Standard. Additional notes, doing these not even make the area around Village/Town stable at 30FPS. It still can go below 30FPS. The area is not properly optimised. Also, turn vsync off in game settings.

 Combat:
The combat is surprisingly smooth and really make me giggle. Pretty impressive gameplay and the AI is smart by default on using skills especially support skill (heal). Not only that, you can customize the skill for the character as you level up the mastery. Having the need to do combo and stop to dodge/guard is also very fun as the boss is pretty challenging. 

Steam Deck Control Layout:
The default control on Steam Deck already good enough, but may adjust it to suit your need. As example, i set L4 for sprint as clicking the Left Stick to sprint everytime is quite annoying for me. However, there is in-game setting for auto sprint if you want. 

Multiplayer :
It works well for me and there does not seem like there is a much drop when I play. It can run pretty stable without lagging. Take note, you can repeat the quest with the party if you want.

Overall, i think this is a pretty good game to pickup for Steam Deck as not only it can run by default. You dont need much tinkering to play it and just stick to default. The story is quite enjoyable for me, but the cream of the cake in this game is the gameplay. Doing the Full Burst and Link attack is pretty satisfying. However, there is still room for improvement especially around the area of village/town. If you looking to grab a game where the gameplay is very fun and good story, you can add this to your library. I may change my review depending on what i may encounter in the future of gameplay.","Very Positive90% of the 19,808 user reviews for this game are positive.",bought steamdeck box standard default setting recommended stable 30fps tried 60 shooter not_stable fluctuate 40 55 shooter higher 30fps max shooter 60 set frame limit 40 quick access menu depend not_moreover performance drop village town scene happening cause bit performance drop minimum 27 shooter no_significant drop battle outside village multiplayer issue pretty stable 1 configuration proton experimental bit boost shooter not_necessarily needed stick default fine cryoutilities recommended setting set uma buffer 4 steamdeck bios performance bit default risk no_just stick default long fine 30 shooter changing standard higher impact performance stick standard additional note not_even village town stable 30fps 30fps not_properly optimised turn vsync setting combat combat surprisingly smooth giggle pretty impressive ai smart default skill especially support skill heal not_only customize skill mastery combo dodge guard fun bos pretty challenging deck control layout default control deck already good adjust suit example set l4 sprint clicking left stick sprint everytime annoying auto sprint multiplayer work not_seem drop pretty stable lagging note repeat party pretty good pickup deck not_only default dont tinkering stick default enjoyable cream cake burst link attack pretty satisfying room improvement especially village town grab fun good add library depending encounter future

For now
Overall for how much I've played I have greatly enjoyed my time. There are minor issues like way too many cutscenes in the story part of the game though I can be forgiving for how beautiful the game is overall. When I first heard about how long this game was in dev hell I was worried because games tend to lose themselves to the trends over the years of development and become a mess but with this game it held on to its core of being a very deep well designed horde and boss combat game with a decent story mode that though I probably would not like to play that part again could enjoy for how it acts as an important tutorial to the later part of the game.

For the future
Also I can say this will be a game I Will often revisit because at the time of writing this they are currently planning on adding more bosses and events to the game to keep it fresh well in to the future as well as new characters to try all of which will be free at least for the current roadmap.
https://relink.granbluefantasy.jp/en/updates

For those on the edge
I will say this game is not for everybody it has simple systems overall but incredible depth its a game that will eat up a decent chunk of time to learn and master but is well worth it and you can tell much of it was a work of love and that the devs cared what they were making every character is well designed and fun to play and has unique gameplay for ever persons taste or style my current favourite being Vaseraga who can just say no to dying and is slow like grandma but hits like a meteor. if its on sale you for sure should pick it up but at least for me full price is still worth it for the amount of time and fun I've had already.

I hope that this has helped in some way and hope to see you in game soon.","Very Positive90% of the 19,808 user reviews for this game are positive.",graphic forget reality beautiful good decent bad look long m do good_emphasized mehh watch paint dry audio eargasm good_emphasized not_too bad_emphasized deaf audience kid teen adult grandma pc requirement check paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa spare computer size floppy disk old fashioned workable big eat 10 1tb hard drive entire hard drive hold invest black hole hold data difficulty press w easy_emphasized learn hard master significant brain usage difficult dark soul grind grind care leaderboards rank necessary progress average grind grind life grinding no_story lore average good lovely consuming thought encompassing 5 minute adventure short average long long short price worth price sale spare left not_recommended not_buy nft bug never_heard minor bug annoying ark survival evolved 2 second bug 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 greatly enjoyed minor issue cutscenes forgiving beautiful heard long hell worried game tend lose trend year development mess held core deep designed horde bos combat decent mode probably not_like enjoy act important tutorial future revisit writing currently planning adding boss event fresh future character roadmap http relink granbluefantasy jp en update edge not_for everybody simple system incredible depth eat decent chunk learn master worth tell love cared designed fun unique person taste style favourite vaseraga no_to dying slow grandma hit meteor sale pick price worth fun already hope helped hope soon

Imagine Nier Automata and Monster Hunter had a romantic one night stand while playing FFXIV raids.

I was not expecting this game to hit rules of nature level epic... It did, repeatedly.

The Story of Relink: ----
It's clearly meant to introduce newcomers to granblue, but it's incredibly safe. Incredibly basic anime plot where everything is black and white, redemption is cheap and the plot of granblue remains in limbo. Honestly feels like they were scared of writing a good story or it might butthurt their mobile players.

It's an amazingly fun game to play that suffers in the story side because it's following in a mobile games footsteps without trying to be as good as its predecessor. I hope for expansion content or heck regular content would be amazing and probably be able to improve on this singular complaint.","Very Positive90% of the 19,808 user reviews for this game are positive.",imagine nier automaton monster hunter romantic night stand ffxiv raid world sky realm neat world spectacle not_expecting rule nature epic repeatedly relink clearly meant introduce newcomer granblue incredibly safe incredibly basic anime plot black white redemption cheap plot granblue remains limbo honestly feel scared writing good butthurt mobile player amazingly fun suffers side following mobile game footstep trying good predecessor hope expansion heck regular amazing probably able improve singular complaint
881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Pros
-Tons of content for endgame
-tons of weapon and skill for each character
-Each character have unique mechanics, changing character feels like playing another game (at least for me)
-tons of farming but game is VERY GENEROUS with the reward (also character thats not in party also receive exp making it easy to form different team combination)
-they have a clear roadmap for future content
-pretty decent graphic and they did a good job in changing between cinematic and gameplay

Cons
-translation arent accurate (they mean the same thing but i'd still prefer exact translation for more context)
-story mode is kinda short (but each chapter is memorable and feels packed instead of getting dragged)
-no button layout for ps controller

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"I've only put in 7 hours so far (with plans to put in many many more), but the game has been a really enjoyable experience for me so far! I have personally had 0 crashes, 0 framerate issues, and the game runs a flawless 60 or 120fps for me. 

The story has been nicely paced, keeping you in the action for a majority of its duration, which I appreciate since I think the main appeal of this game is its fun action combat and character progression systems. It is not a long story, which I think is a good decision for a game like this. The main meat of the game are the epic boss fights, grinding your characters up to absurd strengths, and having a blast with the combat while doing so. This formula extends well past the story, where the meat of the game is with its many quests sending you to fight, most of which you can play online in co-op with up to 3 others for a full party of 4. There are more than a dozen characters, and let me tell you - they all play very differently and you are sure to find a playstyle you really enjoy and vibe with to have a lot of fun!

If you like action combat, the art style, and seeing your character get absurdly strong over a long period of time, questing up solo or with a bunch of friends to beat the crap out of enemies to get even stronger to fight even stronger enemies, rinse and repeat, this game is going to be fantastic for you!

It sucks to see so many people having crashing issues during this launch period, and I hope the developers stay on top of things to patch things up soon. Keep an eye on reviews to see if this is the case. With that said, here are my personal issues/things I would like to see in the future:

As of 2/1/2024:
- The game supports dualsense controllers, but no button prompts for PS4/PS5. Come on, guys. It's 2024. Button prompts for playstation controllers, please.
- The game does not support ultrawide, but it does support up to 4K resolution and 120FPS. I understand ultrawide users are a minority, sitting under 1% of users on steam, but it is always very appreciated when I see the implementation. It's totally understandable it does not support this, however.
- This game makes my 4070 TI run 80-100% GPU load at 120fps in 1440p resolution, which is kind of wild. The game runs great, but it is very demanding. The game is very pretty, but it's making our GPU's work hard. Maybe some more optimizations or implementation of DLSS/FSR could really help with this, especially for weaker hardware to increase accessibility for players.

With all of that said, this is a really fun game, and I think if the developers take good care of it, it's going to be a joy to play for a long time coming. Here's hoping they show it strong support after their long 7+ years of development! 

And no, the translation is fine despite the few complaining about it, and the censorship is seriously not significant at all. Please don't listen to the hardcore jrpg fans getting upset over these really minor things, or at least do some research to see how negatively those changes may affect your enjoyment of the game. (For me, it ruined my enjoyment by 0%.)

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"This game is fantastic.  Looks great, sounds great and plays great.  I've been waiting for this game for a LONG time and I would say Cygames has delivered on all counts.  Thank you for taking the time to get everything right.

Gameplay-wise I would say this game sits somewhere between PSO2 and Monster Hunter.  The game feels less rigid and more forgiving than Monster Hunter as you are free to use the dodge or guard button to cancel out of a lot of attacks.  You also have dedicated buttons for your character's skills rather than the MH approach of making them combo based.  A lot of characters also have parry or counter moves that reward skillful play in various ways.  The game also employs a stagger system where you can create your own openings by staggering bosses and eventually stunning them for about 10 seconds or so.  When you counter a boss into a stagger and then knock them into a stun?   It feels SO goooood!   The hit feedback in this game is so CRUNCHY.  I love it SO much!

I found the story, while short (roughly 10-15 hours), to be very enjoyable thanks to the excellent, highly entertaining, very cinematic boss fights.  The game doesn't end after you beat the story though.  There's an additional post game story chapter with more bosses and more difficult versions of what you fought during the story and there's even harder stuff after you're done with that.  All the while collecting stronger equipment and materials to upgrade your characters.

That's the other neat thing this game does.  It gives you a roster of around 20 characters and lets you make a party of any 4 you want.  They're also all playable, fully featured characters each with their own gimmicks and distinct playstyle.  It was hard to choose what 4 characters to build first because every single one of them seems cool and interesting.  The AI itself for your party members is also very good.  I find myself getting outscored by the AI when I play badly.  Coop and matchmaking is also available for non-story quests too if you'd rather run with other players instead.

There is also a complete lack of live service features, and micro-transactions.  You pay once and get the whole game with no restrictions.

I fully believe this will go on to be one of the most fun ARPGs released this year.  I hope Relink gets a big expansion because I am 100% willing to pay for more of this game.","Very Positive90% of the 19,808 user reviews for this game are positive.",fantastic look great sound great play great waiting long cygames delivered count thank taking wise sits pso2 monster hunter feel rigid forgiving monster hunter dodge guard button cancel attack dedicated button s_emphasizedkills rather mh approach combo based character parry counter move reward skillful various way employ stagger create opening staggering boss eventually stunning 10 second counter bos stagger knock stun feel goooood feedback crunchy love found short roughly 10 15 hour enjoyable thanks excellent highly entertaining cinematic bos fight beat additional post chapter boss difficult version fought harder stuff collecting stronger equipment material upgrade character neat give roster 20 character let party 4 playable fully featured character gimmick distinct playstyle hard choose 4 character build single cool interesting ai party member good outscored ai badly coop matchmaking available non quest rather player complete lack live service feature micro transaction pay no_restrictions fully believe fun arpgs released hope relink get big expansion 100 willing pay
881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Alright beat the game made it to the end game can edit my review to give full impressions.

TL:DR: You like ARPG's about killing big bosses or hordes of grunts and pushing yourself and your friends to get the highest scores/lowest times possible on these kills? Do you like MMO raid bosses but wish the combat was more engaging? Do you like grinding to hit achievable and visible improvements in your characters? Sick of FOMO, MTX, Live Service, Time Gating, DRM, bullshit in your co-op games? Buy this game.

Story 8.5/10:
It's honestly paced incredibly well, it comes out the gate letting you know this game is gonna be crazy with a battle against a god on a flying ship in the skies. It takes a short break after that to let you explore the game systems while wailing on much smaller threats. You then immediately take on the primal god of vitality and the roller coaster never slows down from there. The overall premise is a tale as old as time save the princess, save the world. It's been done a million times but the spectacle on display for this more than makes up for the simplicity. The story is roughly 15-20 hours depending on if you do side content and the collectathon elements in the missions. You can probably blitz it in 10 if you skip all the cutscenes and play on the easiest difficulty. It gets an 8.5/10 because it does its simple premise well and while perfect length is a hard thing to achieve if I want more it means what I got was good.

Gameplay 10/10:
This is the best co-operative action combat I have ever played. Building off the backs of games like NieR: Automata, Genshin Impact, and other ability based action games Granblue takes all those elements and cranks them to eleven. Complimented by some of the best boss fights I had the pleasure to do. The action dances really well between these tense mechanic filled moments almost every character can be built to be pure damage, debuff/stun focused, or team support focused. Despite them all having varying ways to build them they all feel functionally unique and offer tons of longevity in just trying them all out. Percival and his mongrel Vane are my two go to characters but every single one I've played is fun in a unique way. When you're in co-op this game knows how to push your hype as a group to the edge especially in the harder fights, the final moments of hard bosses being capstoned by you and your friends cracking the last few percentages of health with the very cinematic ultimate moves in so satisfying. Hell even solo the AI are so smart they might beat you for MVP scores every once in a while they keep the fun just as well as human players.

Music 10/10:
Tsutomu Narita sores on this soundtrack elevating his and Nobuo Uematsu's original compositions for the mobile game to a whole new level and his new tracks for the game are all insanely good. Sequestrian Primal, Vow and Promise, End of Ragnarok, and other titles that have spoilers in them are all incredible. Narita has a talent not only for incredibly peaceful tracks but also tracks that really set your adrenaline pumping to match the chaos on screen.

Visuals 10/10:
It's been a long time since a triple A studio has brought so much work to stylized visuals. Cygames brought their A game to bring the style of Hideo Minaba and the rest of their art team to life here. Backgrounds and Skyboxes are beautifully rendered 2d water color paintings. Literal pieces of art paintings you could see in a museum or art gallery. Very clever use of 2d planes gives life to these paintings by putting moving elements like clouds and clusters of foliage in them. Then by layering it all it gives it a depth that is truly gorgeous to look at. The characters and their equipment are rendered out with such care as well with scoring and pencil marks on them that make them look like they've come right off a page. The black outlines around them are even scored as if made by a pencil. To top it off lighting has some global illumination and point lighting with great shadows but all these stylization efforts meant conventional lighting wouldn't look great so they hand painted tons of shadows, changed colors for shadowed elements to help accentuate them, hand painted BOUNCE LIGHTING EVERYWHERE. Seriously there are spots where lighting should only be possible with ray tracing but since the game lacks it and it wouldn't look great anyway because of all the 2d plane tricks they did they HAND PAINTED IT. All this love and care into the details creates this wonderful feeling of like walking through a play set or pop up book, it's fantastic, whimsical, and warm. I know people will just see typical anime visuals when they step into this game but the dedication Cygames put in cannot be understated this is the best this style of visuals has been done so far. Also as a HUGE plus NO SMUDGY TAA or dedication to upscalers the game renders at intended resolution targets natively. Animations are god tier can't even get into it.

Quality of Life 9/10:
The only reason this gets dinged a point is no native ultrawide support which is absolutely criminal for how beautiful the game can be, and no remapping of controller inputs on PC. Other than that the assist mode is smart and makes it so anyone can play through the entire story and 75% of the endgame. The menus are streamlined and easy to use. Lyria's Journal is probably one of the best game databases ever. Character, Enemy, and Weapon information AND a model viewer for all of them. A music player built in. Key Terms, World Info, and Lore bits. All in one place and it can even be pulled up mid conversation if terms are thrown around you don't remember and it'll bring up that term's page. 

Multiplayer 10/10:
This is where the game shines. The combat and gameplay overall come alive when playing with other people and Cygames made sure these system were polished to a luster. There is at least 100 hours of content here if you do everything. Multiplayer is also INCREDIBLY stream lined, repeat missions right from the end screen, a scoring system and time system to keep you pushing for the best possible clears. Crazy amount of social features you can communicate with people easily without ever typing a word let alone using a mic. Lobby Creation and lobby BROWSER as well as quick match built in day one of a multiplayer game in 2024?! Incredible. Not to mention no battle passes, arbitrary time gates, no FOMO mechanics, no pay to win mechanics, no intrusive anti-cheat for a co-op game, no DRM crap bogging the game down for no reason.

Overall 9.5/10:
This game is an absolute treat and a phenomenal way to start out 2024. Myself and many others were weary after a 8 year dev cycle, but this game payed off huge. It's stunning in every regard and deserves all the love it is getting. The only blips are the issues with launching people had which seems to be dying out and the no co-op for the story. More than anything else I hope Cygames sees the success of this title and keeps adding to it to push it forward. I want Monster Hunter style expansions and small content updates like what is already announced. After the eight year wait all I want is this game to keep going it's the most fun co-op experience I've had in years. Cygames delivers a full experience from start to finish with more than a fair share of additional content and quality of life features, nothing withheld, nothing locked for engagement metrics sake. We should treasure AAA developers who release games like this in this day and age.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"[h1] Edit For Steam Deck users [/h1]
Having now played it on the Deck it runs suprisingly well for how much is happening on screen
what i will say is on the OLED i will drop to 22ish-25 sometimes BUT it is only for millisecond, long enough to register the drop but you dont really feel it ever if that makes sense. i think one benefit of it coming out on the Ps4 is that the 30 lock feels incredibly smooth closer to like 45 or so feels like on there. the menus are also very very snappy and the loading is like instant so that too does not feel like its taxing the system the way it is. also locked at 30 your looking at around 3-5 hours give or take with the time in cut scenes and menus probably 2 and half to 3 if you are just straight running missions non stop. 

i bought this on a whim, i liked how it looked and what i thought it was. im not familiar with granblue other than the hour i played of the most recent fighting game but ill tell ya a purchase of that is now in the future. 

this is a weird blend of Wayfinder, Xenblade chronicles and monster hunter and pretty much in that order. 

runs well for me at locked 120 fps full tilt. i dont think i ever saw a frame drop no matter how frantic it got. 
though im on a 13700k with a 4080. im curious to try it on steam deck here shortly. 

i cant say much about the story other than its totally serviceable. and overall im enjoying it even though im not totally locked into it. What i will say is this game does something ive never seen but if you skip a cutscene it gives you a summer of what your skipping and what plot is happening before you accept making it possible to fully understand it without needing to see it. that said the voice work and scenes themselves are super well animated and framed. if i was more into this style of story telling i think id like it quite a bit i just fine the Characters a bit too silly and some way to serious. i cant really find a middle ground. 

Combats great as youd expect, i could take more from the open areas because i just generally like them and the look of the game itself. but whats offered is fine so far. 

No real microtransactions, no store, no battle pass, You have a full 3d model viewer of every character, enemy and weapon in the game and one for a good chunk of the 2d art which you would see sold separate in a lot of other games now a days

i havent made it to the endgame but im incredibly curious as to what it looks like and or what a roadmap or continuation will look like going forward because i do see myself spending a good bit of time with this and i almost wish it was a live service so that i knew more was coming. 

honestly my only real gripe is that when you pick a character that is what theyre going to look like the entire time, i know people in this niche like this but i could take more outfits or look changes or something to represent my grow in power as it is a power fantasy at the end of the day. 

my only other gripe is no ultrawide support which is a bummer, weirdly the game doesnt have ps4 or 5 button layouts even though it only launched on there and pc as a port so its an odd ommission since the work was already done, but to that end the games ui and layout is exactly the same as a controller as in right hand side has a 4 button diamond for abilities and a bumper and trigger listed same as the left hand side so just looking at the screen youll know exactly where everything is when it matters. though most of us who have used a ps controller on pc for a while will be accustomed to missing button art. 

i dunno i think its good, im really surprised by it, i got tails of arise recently and i now feel like i probably wont be touching that for quite a while.","Very Positive90% of the 19,808 user reviews for this game are positive.",deck user deck run suprisingly happening screen oled drop 22ish 25 millisecond long register drop dont make sense benefit coming ps4 30 lock feel incredibly smooth closer 45 feel menu very_emphasized snappy loading instant not_feel taxing locked 30 3 5 hour cut scene menu probably 2 half 3 straight running mission non bought whim liked looked thought im not_familiar granblue recent fighting ill tell ya purchase future weird blend wayfinder xenblade chronicle monster hunter pretty order run locked 120 shooter tilt dont saw frame drop no_matter frantic im 13700k 4080 im curious deck shortly cant totally serviceable im enjoying im not_totally locked ive never_seen skip cutscene give summer skipping plot happening accept possible fully understand needing voice scene super animated framed style telling id bit fine character bit silly serious cant middle ground combat great youd expect open area generally look whats offered fine far no_real microtransactions no_store no_battle pas 3d model viewer enemy weapon good chunk 2d art sold separate game day havent endgame im incredibly curious look roadmap continuation look forward spending good bit wish live service knew coming honestly real gripe pick theyre look entire niche outfit look change represent grow power power fantasy gripe no_ultrawide support bummer weirdly doesnt ps4 5 button layout launched pc port odd ommission already game ui layout exactly controller hand side 4 button diamond ability bumper trigger listed left hand side screen youll exactly matter p controller pc accustomed missing button art dunno good im surprised tail arise recently probably wont touching

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"I've waited around 5 years for this game to release and i had very low expectations going in, tons of delays accompanied with lack of showcases really made me believe that this game was going to either flop really hard, or not even be released at all. So after spending a good amount of time with the game i can very confidently say that this is the most fun i've had playing a game in a good while. The story is engaging with beautiful cinematics, the combat is fast, fluid and exhilarating.. every character on the roster has a different move set and playstyle which really changes the way you approach each encounter. 

The OST is beautiful and they really incorporated granblue fantasy iconic art style into the world. There are a ton of little easter eggs that gacha players will really appreciate like when you walk around seeing all the duplicate NPC and rackams suicide move to name a few. The roadmap also makes me excited for the future of the game, excited to see faa in action and i can't wait to try out Siete and Song. 

Some improvements i'd love to see:
- Option to automatically hide the HUD outside of combat
- Option to resize HUD, there's a lot of screen clutter 
- Option to tone down effects, the visual vomit can be a little much sometimes

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"I love GBF and I'm happy. I'm eating real good right now. Welcome to my table, friend.

[h1]This game has no right to be this good[/h1]
First, let me open the windows real quick:
Downsides are criminally bad EN voice acting (for the love of god switch to the godtier JP VA) and localization, some stability jank and hub CPU overhead despite the good perfs and instant loading times, badly thought-out co-op downscaling that makes playing with underleveled friends a sad experience, underwhelming rewards for quick-questing, no PC<->PS crossplay, no GBF codes on PC, and multitarget attack magnetism hating you.
Okay, we can breathe now.

[b]We are only in February and it's already my [i]mercilessly[/i] uncontested GOTY.[/b]

Immediately buy it now if you like any of those: Character-action combat (Platinum games), MMORPG raidboss mechanics, Final Fantasy aesthetics, Monster Hunter beast slaying and game loop, Tales of JRPG comfort food, Skies of Arcadia or floating islands in general, or huge angry lizards.
Worth at a discount if you just want to enjoy the short and generic, but explosively spectacular tutorial that is the main story.

[b]Gameplay, presentation, visuals, and soundtrack [i]are at the top[/i] of the J-ARPG genre.[/b]
Count 60-ish hours to complete the game up to the current Proud difficulty last boss. 8-16 intense hours if you only want to play the main story. Hundreds if you want to be that one guy with every character maxed to high heaven. Post-game is very challenging and has some cheesable grind.

[h1]Unexpectedly blue skies[/h1]
Granblue Versus first introduced me to the franchise with a stellar fighting game, and made me fall in love with its world -as a huge fan of anything celestial fantasy- and its characters, from my goofy main bro Lowain to the ever so popular Narmaya. After a while, I made the mistake of touching the browser game and got hooked by its progression, story, grid system, Narita's music ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPjsv056BXE ) and Minaba's pretty draph pictures ( https://gbf.wiki/Character_Tier_List pick your poison).
While every love story has its honeymoon, what follows is often a bitter marathon. [b]And good lord if Cygames isn't a company that masters the monkey paw like no other...[/b]
Every great addition was punctuated by terrible management decisions and very strong disconnections with their games' identities and playerbases. After years of going through nonsensical balancing in VS (and still going, hello 66L), and debacles like GBF's infamous summer fortune, revans weapons BS and simply inhumane grinds, I got used to the ways of that company... Or so I thought.

After 7 tumultuous years of development, what we thought was basically vaporware, came back from development hell to slap our collective behinds, into a now million-selling release on PC alone. And... just wow.

[h1]A game that knows exactly what it wants to do[/h1]
The identity crisis most JRPGs and ARPGs face generally takes the form of a thick layer of bland-tasting fat, with stories that try being impactful but fall flat, convoluted and broken systems, endless padded sidequests and oh my god the pacing! Here, most of it is trimmed, with some remnants to remind you that this is a Granblue game, and to lure you in with some sweet suspension of disbelief. And by the time you realize it, [b]you're enjoying the gameplay so much you just forget about everything else[/b]. You know the story is McDonalds JRPG slop. Relink knows the story is McDonalds JRPG slop. You look at each other and nod, then cut to the chase.

There's the hubs, the main story and the co-op monster hunter-like gameloop. Everything else is treated like the aforementioned fat and aggressively cut. Forget long character intro monologue cutscenes. Here you have a few gists in voiced text blocks in the form of fate episodes. Collectables? There's just a few barely hidden chests in your way. Side-quests? It's just auto-complete stuff you automatically hit as you progress through co-op with some handy repeatables for that endgame grind. Character banter? Percival orders Vane to bark for him as you chain skybound arts together, no need for a dedicated cutscene that cuts your gameplay for 5 minutes.
Dialogues and cutscenes exist to put the fights in context and that's it, and they are all skippable and handily summed up if need be. Hub area, dialogue, short cutscene, repeat. [b]The momentum never stops[/b] and you surprise yourself binge-eating the game at 2 AM, wanting for more every chapter...

...And that's only the tutorial.

All of it is presented in a polished package with one of the most beautiful and tightly executed art directions this techart nerd has ever seen. It's [b]Hideo Minaba's illustrations coming alive[/b], with jaw-dropping vistas and hub areas that brim with life and personality from Folca's retired draph soldiers teaching swordfighting to a bunch of kids to Ghandagoza getting lost in Seedhollow's backstreets.
The visual effects are omnipresent and bursting with energy while staying perfectly readable in some Proud fights' bullet hell situations. I very much know how difficult these things are to pull off and this simply leaves me in admiration.

[b]The game keeps raising the bar on every chapter in every form[/b]. And one I haven't talked about yet is the soundtrack. In short, you are not ready.
As always, Tsutomu Narita + Nobuo Uematsu + Stella Magna is a very deadly combination.
While it sometimes re-uses tracks from good ol' GBF, it has many original tracks that are among Narita's very best works. If you don't mind me spoiling you the battle track for the base antagonist in the game's cover art, Id, here's a sample of what you can expect from this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDq5_PZ57xg

[h1]And now, the meat[/h1]
[b]This is the best-feeling action combat I have ever touched[/b]. It's heavy and observant like Monster Hunter, fast and deep like a bayonetta, over-the-top flashy like a Metal Gear Rising, strategic and demanding like an MMO raidboss, bullet hell-y like a Nier Automata, and has big number soup that goes brrr with insanely complex itemization theorycrafting like.... Granblue Fantasy.
You control one character in a Xenoblade-y party of four, starting with 6 base playable skyfarers and a pool of 12 you progressively choose and unlock as you progress through the game.
They are all incredibly varied, ranging from Lancelot's mash & dodge gorilla gameplay to Rosetta's buff and rose turret uptime rotation, Zeta's pogo stick loops with gradually tighter timings, Narmaya's super technical and fun stance dancing, Eugen's third person shooter mode, Io's cast-for-hours nukes... Every character is like playing a different game, and not a single one of them is boring, with multiple possible builds each. Fantastic kit design.
Teammates can be players or CPU, which are, surprisingly, [i]really[/i] good, like, better than the average player!
You hit, hit harder with another button, do character-specific combo routes, manage character mechanics and stacks/bars/etc, block, dodge, jump, attack in the air, use one of four skills of your choice, break enemy ""parts"", do linked attacks, chain ultimate moves into each other, use a variety of potions, revive teammates, become a doormat, spam silly stickers when the big dragon boss fires a huge laser so that all your teammates can see on their screen is a dumb obscure old man GBF meme bathed in blinding, lethal light.
Your equipment consists of your levellable weapon (customizable stat stick) and slots for sigils which contain traits that conditionally modify your stats or build you a certain way. This is pretty much GBF's grid and weapon mod system, and if there's one thing GBF vets will always say good things about aside from the pretty JPEGs, it's the grid.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Let's get this out there.
I played the Division 1 and 2, did the grind on Destiny, and grind for god rolls on Destiny 2 on the Season of Wish. 3,000+ Hours for both. I can give the beans and how the content is.


[ PROS ] 
- Decent story it's not the best, not the worse. Better than Days Gone, It's quite fast actually. 10+ Hours it took me, might vary if you are a 100%-er.

- Pretty Graphics, it's no Red Dead Redemption 2, but it's more on the side of Dragon Dogma/Breath Of The Wild. It's nice, and easy.

- The Combat, is hands down is my number 1. From Perfect Parrying/Guard to Perfect Dodges, abilities that give you rewards for doing so. Teamwork is HUGE, and it's pretty. Link-Bursts, Bad-ass Super Moves, it makes you feel like your own anime moment. If you chain your supers with your teams? You get huge bad-ass explosions. 'Nuff said  

- Casual or Min-Maxing, The sigil system which to put it easily, it's Monster Hunter's Perks/Charm system. You can crunch your numbers to the point you have to include raising your Damage Cap.

- The Roster, not to shabby to be honest. You like the heavy hitters? Got them, Fast slashing type of folk? Got it, You like trading blow for blow on the enemy? Got that too, and support. Which by the way, you can use the sigils to make almost all of the roster support, dps, tank, healer.

- Music, well. I made it to end game, and I'll tell you. Those bosses have some real DBZ vocal energy. It's goooooood.

- You can play solo and still have the same fun as with a group. The AI are pretty smart.

- Endgame has some bad-ass bosses, and also pretty challenging. Ranks for difficulty: Easy/Normal/Hard/Very Hard/Maniac/Proud and to get to Proud Rank? It makes you work for it but man is it good.

[ CONS ]

- Matchmaking is..50//50. Looking at like 1-4 minute wait times.

- Semi-Live Service game, not much is known about the future after the content drops. (Three to be exact) After that? It's clouded.

- Grind, if you want to survive in Maniac + Proud. If you are planning to go that high be ready. The grind isn't bad, honestly. Way better than Destiny 2.

- Stupid freaking parrot saying sugoi or very good for the 8395287359827th time after transmuting a sigil.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                 I give it a  8.9/10. A fun game, keeps ya busy good to keep you playing for a time to come. Worth it in my opinion and it leads me

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Really polished Action RPG with Monster Hunter-like quest structure. The main story doesn't overstay its welcome & quest system keeps things refreshingly focused compared to your typical big budget ARPG. I think this game could be god tier depending on the quality of challenging endgame content added post-release.
As it is it has all the makings of one but the 'optional' content is very easy and takes a long time to build up (especially if you touch multiplayer) while player side mechanics are really strong.

Combat definitely feels very platinum games-like. A bit simple but each character is very unique from the other. The skill ceiling is still higher than you might think and some characters are more technical than others.
The amount of quality of life features is kind of incredible, from training modes to wishlists etc. As a comparison both of those features are pulled off better than monster hunter. The downtime / busywork you need to do between quests is extremely minimal.
Enemy attacks & AoEs have the cleanest visual indicators i've seen in a 3D action game like this from memory. They can definitely up the difficulty without visibility being an issue.

Misc. gripes:
The disparity between multiplayer and single player difficulty is too big. It's not good if multiplayer feels like an easy/cheat mode. This is a bit like if monhun didn't scale quests to be harder based on player count.

Guard seems nonsensically strong. Many bosses have attack patterns where you can't do anything but dodge until it times out. But guess what. You can just stand in place and hold the guard button. If you got hit it's because you assumed you need to do something. There are very few fights with unblockable attacks, and it's usually some mid-tier monster instead of an endgame boss.

There are many bosses where the only challenging part of the fight is a DPS check. This is pretty cringe & even if the rest of fight was fun in a challenge run (say playing 1 character only) that limitation might make the dps check part impossible. Struggling through a difficult fight with a lowish power party isn't rewarded, rather you kinda get punished for good gameplay through the rest of the fight.

Lock-on and targeting behavior is strange with your character very likely trying to hit something on the other side of the map, if the movement direction matches more.
The auto tracking on your moves is really strong even without locking. If manual aim could be more of its own thing ala monster hunter this could make some characters with slower attacks more fun to play.

Launch version specific:
The endgame quests aren't very interesting for multiplayer play. Only 1-2 quests are challenging for survival if played with random people (main one having multiple bosses at once, one with many unblockables). For others if you are playing multiplayer you can assume there's no chance of quest failure and it's just a speedrun to get to your loot drop gacha. Getting hit also barely costs you time or resources unless it kills you, unlike monhun. Tanking hits is the way to go if you are specced above the quest level. The 'final' farmable quest is more of a setpiece & dps check fest than actual combat which is pretty meh.","Very Positive90% of the 19,808 user reviews for this game are positive.",polished action role monster hunter structure overstay welcome keep thing refreshingly focused compared typical big budget arpg god tier depending quality challenging endgame post release making optional easy take long build especially touch multiplayer side mechanic strong combat definitely feel platinum game bit simple unique skill ceiling higher character technical others quality life feature kind incredible training mode wishlists comparison feature pulled monster hunter downtime busywork quest extremely minimal enemy attack aoes cleanest visual indicator 3d action memory definitely difficulty visibility issue misc gripe disparity multiplayer single difficulty big not_good multiplayer feel easy cheat mode bit monhun scale quest harder based count guard nonsensically strong boss attack pattern dodge time guess stand hold guard button assumed fight unblockable attack usually mid tier monster endgame bos boss challenging fight dp check pretty cringe rest fight fun challenge 1 limitation dp check impossible struggling difficult fight lowish power party rewarded rather kinda punished good rest fight lock targeting behavior strange trying side map movement direction match auto tracking move strong locking manual aim ala monster hunter character slower attack fun launch version specific endgame quest interesting multiplayer 1 2 quest challenging survival random multiple boss unblockables others multiplayer assume no_chance failure speedrun loot drop gacha barely cost resource unless kill unlike monhun tanking hit specced final farmable setpiece dp check fest actual combat pretty meh
881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"**Read Important Note below**
I will say, this game is my favorite game yet in 2023-2024. As a player who specializes on FPS Shooters, I will say I enjoy the game a lot. The grinding is a lot and have some cute anime girls in it, my fav is Cagliostro... don't judge me. As a person who got extremely disappointed with Gensh*t, this game is definitely leagues better than that game. Definitely requires way more skill to play compared to Gensh*t. 

The best part of this game that it is not a gacha game, so not much ""immoral"" practices of draining your wallets out for a chance to get a character. Definitely a money worth  and I am willing to spend money on DLC where you are guaranteed to get certain characters, and doesn't require you to slave everyday (but you can do so, because I did). I am hoping that they plan to add more characters from CyGames universe (Please Kasumi Kirihara... please come home...), and hoping this game will last years to come by them adding DLCs.

For context, I play very limited amount of RPG games. The RPG games I have played and enjoyed are Monster Hunter World & Rise and Pokemon (already stopped playing). I played a couple of gacha games (Gensh*t & Arknights) and was fan of Princess Connect from CyGames. Just a big fan of their character designs over most other franchises so far.

For me, it is worth to get the full price tag (it is cheaper at my place because regional pricing). But if you do not want to dish out as much money, wait for it to go on sale (I doubt it will come any time soon though). I am planning to support game companies that support good practices like selling premium games and having DLCs to add more extra stuff like cosmetics and more story/game modes.

[b] IMPORTANT!!! [/b]
I do want to give a word of warning. I would [b] RECOMMEND [/b] turning off Steam Cloud Save and turn off auto save. The reason is if you are somehow saving and a blackout happens that causes your PC to turn off... or just a BSOD, your save file [b] WILL GET CORRUPTED [/b] and lose your save. This will cause you to start from beginning or find out another solution (using saves). 
Ask me how I find this out...

Your save file will be located in AppData\Local\GBFR\Saved\SaveGames
The easiest way to access this is to type ""%AppData%"" in the directory. Then go to Local after clicking AppData in the directory.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"TLDR: Has bad translation if you play with JP voice using EN sub. But luckily the game is so good you can probably forgive the bad translation. 

Easily recommended

======================================================================
The Bad:

1. Pretty Horrible English Translation
It's really horrible, if you understand even a bit of Japanese, you will easily get confused because the localizer really like to tell their own story with their own wording instead of just translate it as it is. 
If you understand Japanese a little, often what you heard and what you read will be so different.
It's not just complex sentences, even basic ones got butchered. 

They also like to use unconventional English, modern gen-z English, and pretty out of date slang, which really out of place and ruin immersion.
This is important because some characters portrayed differently from the original because of localizer can't help to keep adding/changing stuff in translation.

Example of the worst yet so far:
(JP): Hmm
(EN): A wishful thinking
Somehow they managed to translated ""Hmm"" into a sentence...

(JP): Are you two a couple?
(JP): What!? No, we are just working together
(EN): Are you two an item?
(EN): An item!? Gross, no we are not...
wtf even....

Another examples:
(JP): Exactly
(EN): Exactamundo

(JP): Still talking about that?
(EN): You guys are such a dork

(JP): (dodged thrown spear) That is absurd!!
(EN): (dodged thrown spear) Well that is just happened...

(EN) Often Vryn talks in blabbering childish manner unrecognizable English, can't even understand most part. 

Even sometimes when characters speak formal and common Japanese, they altered it with some slang and impression which made the characters really looks out of place and time.

2. Censored/Altered
Yes, they censored/altered several characters outfit by giving them ugly short pants.

3. Possible cheaters in co-op mode because there is no anti cheat present at the moment.


The Good:

- The game itself run pretty good on RTX 2060, it's not a resource intensive game
- The graphic is beautiful
- Movement and combat almost feel fluid, but not the level of DMC or Bayoneta
- Good amount of playable characters and every one of them is unique
- Satisfying combat
- Good amount of side and end game content especially if you want 100%
- Combat is still fun even in higher difficulty
- Co-op

It's just so sad the translation is so bad and has unnecessary censorship ruining the original visual artistic otherwise a good game.
Japanese game companies really need to wake up fast, listen and make games for your the gamer not the localizer.
Such a good game, ruined by horrible localization and censorship.

If you can tolerate all the negatives especially the translation, then it's safe to buy.","Very Positive90% of the 19,808 user reviews for this game are positive.",bad translation jp voice en sub luckily good probably forgive bad translation easily recommended bad 1 pretty horrible english translation horrible understand bit japanese easily confused localizer tell wording translate understand japanese heard read different not_just complex sentence basic one butchered unconventional english modern gen z english pretty slang ruin immersion important character portrayed differently original localizer help adding changing stuff translation example worst far jp hmm en wishful somehow managed translated hmm sentence jp couple jp no_we working en en gross no_we not_wtf example jp exactly en exactamundo jp talking en guy dork jp dodged thrown spear absurd en dodged thrown spear happened en vryn talk blabbering childish manner unrecognizable english understand character speak formal common japanese altered slang impression character look 2 censored altered yes censored altered character outfit giving ugly short pant 3 possible cheater co overpowered mode no_anti cheat present moment good pretty good rtx 2060 not_a resource intensive graphic beautiful movement combat fluid not_the dmc bayoneta good playable character unique satisfying combat good side especially 100 combat fun higher difficulty co overpowered sad translation bad unnecessary censorship ruining original visual artistic otherwise good japanese company wake fast listen game gamer not_the localizer good ruined horrible localization censorship tolerate negative especially translation s_emphasizedafe

The story was a bit brief for an RPG, but there is plenty of lore hidden in menu's, special quests and items to pick up, and so the game does a good job at rewarding exploration both in-game and in the menu's. 

The artstyle is lovely. I particularly like how the further-away parts were less anime artstyle and more paintbrush strokes.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Runs great on both PC and Steam Deck (despite not being validated), only one cutscene doesn't work on SD but it is at the very end of the main story. 

I've never played GBF before and i just did know little about this series of games. My friend who played more titles told me it was a close genre of Monster Hunter for Relink and being a HUGE fan of MH i needed to play it ! 
And yes it is. It is not a hunting game per say, but it does the job just fine (esp if you are waiting Wilds like i do).

Story wise it doesn't breaks 3 legs of a duck but it is fine, classical JRPG story, good vs bad and power of friendship and boobas is here to help you go through everything even the end of time. The cast is very diversified with tons of heroes to get to play and also a very refusing to die bad guy who always find a way to bother you.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3158225005

Once you finished the story (bout 15h-20h) you start the farm, for mastery points, weapons and level. The game being well aware of the ars it can be, they added a botting system for the lower level to help players go up to the harder difficulty of the game. (it is not as hard as some games, but if you can't push dodge button you will have troubles).

The game eventually falls into the ''price tag might be too much'' if you are less of a farmer person and more of a ''i want to do the story and be done''. Wait for a sale.
If you think you will play the game and make worth the ''1e/1h'' thing, it will be fine enough as you will easily reach past 60h of farming after the main story.

We already have a road map with 2 new heroes and 1 boss being released soon as another patch being ''surprise'' with more content to do. 
And since the game is based on a already existing franchise, we will surely get more update with heroes and bad guys from past games.

A really good find for me, need to thank my friend for this.

881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"Previously having issues, I found out that there was a problem with my PC, and somehow was sussed out by GranBlue Relink.

Playing the game, Graphics are crisp and effects are stylish. My experience so fat (up to the first boss) has been quite enjoyable, though I fear from the initial impression that monsters may be a bit of a damage sponge moving forward.

Gameplay is reminiscent of GodEater and Metal Gear Solid: Revengence ( the MemEs jAck!), fights consists of exchanges between blocks and dodges while getting in their safe zones and attacking them where the sun doesn't shine. GBF players would be familiar with many of the Mobs/ Bosses, their fights reimagined in a 3D space where they can finally not blame their weapon grid for when they fail a boss. Oh yeah, it also incorporates GBF's Burst system as well, and it is satisfying to see each time it is executed ( exhaustion pending).

All in all, GBF: Relink is a great fix for those waiting for MH:Worlds, those itching to see how Gran's battles feel like as he adventures across the realms. 

My only gripe is that I wished they allowed gamepad button binding - but I believe developers are aware of this and am working on it.","Very Positive90% of the 19,808 user reviews for this game are positive.",previously issue found problem pc somehow sussed granblue relink graphic crisp effect stylish fat bos enjoyable fear initial impression monster bit damage sponge moving forward reminiscent godeater metal gear solid revengence meme jack fight consists exchange block dodge safe zone attacking sun shine gbf player familiar mob boss fight reimagined 3d space finally not_blame weapon grid fail bos oh yeah incorporates gbf burst satisfying executed exhaustion pending gbf relink great fix waiting mh world itching gran battle adventure across realm gripe wished allowed gamepad button binding believe developer aware working
881020,Granblue Fantasy: Relink,"For a 13+ Hour Story Gameplay
I honestly recommand this game when it comes to story telling that makes you feel part of the fight through its challenges, battles & each boss felt like a darn boss alright since I like souls games and tales of series, Thats why since it has wonderful visual combat & atmosphere and each character with their unique fighting style that you may build them according to your fighting standards of approach as you level up finish quests to earn skill points & get stronk each chapter or mission.

Edit:- 49 hours 
Honestly for knowing there is an aftermath story just made it better for me glad kept doing side missions & putting my characters to work and facing few new bosses for a change.
I like how they're Nerf those at level 100 that are joining off a starter player or around level 60 to keep the boss enjoyable and manageable for both players to overcome it in a good pace.

Edit 2:- 108 hours
After beating the game 100% achievement discovering mini and major parts of the game that you may adept through your journey and experience I honestly would love to say this game deserves the love and attention it seeks as I hope it continues to support its fan base and community with its future development.

Cant wait to see other antagonists bosses and story line within this game to fight em and experience terror 

Low key this game gave me old games nostalgia such as ""White Knight Chronicles 2"" ""Ex Troopers"" ""Freedom Wars"" ""Monster Hunter"" from its Story approach, Mechanical Fighting style Quirks , Character enhancement upgrades, Coop mode online and Mission progress 
__

-The only downside I had is:-

-The release pre-download where everyone could start playing on time because not everyone has time to download since our schedule could be tight.

-Would be nice to add Playstation control buttons as an option in the menu which is a minor issue ""got used to it""

-Sometimes you may glitch against boss if your character has a striking attack from above like zeta or lancelot against the magma boss and register you as fall while fighting his chest area

[h1]The Guide[/h1]
Soo, due to the steam restriction on the character limit for reviews, I will be putting the following points into a Guide:
[list]
[*] Free to play - why this game has a great monetization model and you don't have to worry about being ripped off.
[*]The Story - yes this game has a story, one which will entertain you for quite some time, combined with all the 'character quests'
[*]The Star Chart - or The World of this game and what to expect of it
[*]The Factions - and the characters which inhibit this galaxy
[*]The Gameplay - which is obviously the most important part here and reasons you will sink hours on hours of your life into this game
[*]The Visuals - the beauty this work of art is
[*]The Sound - and how far you can take it
[/list]
If that is too much reading for you, go ahead and finish this off with my personal verdict and then form your own opinion.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1409926603

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
If you get through the harsh beginning, where you will lack a guiding hand this game will suck you in.
Once the game catches you into its flow of daily activities like the login reward and the sorties - 3 mission endgame action - and keeps you there with hourly temptations like alerts and new void rifts, you will become lost in space and time will just fly by.
Warframe is not without flaws, but it is steadily being worked on and being improved, the devs neither lack creativity nor daring, to try new things.
Although it's easy to forget - this game doesn't cost you any cash, so just give it some time and see what it can give you back.

I hope this review helped you in deciding to give this game a try and if you like it, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

230410,Warframe,"If you're here at the crossroads asking yourself ""Destiny 2 or Warframe?"" - then perhaps this review might clear a few things up for you!

To start with I have around 190 hours at the time of writing review and I approximately started playing Warframe around 3 weeks ago. I initially was looking for a game to keep me occupied whilst waiting for the Destiny 2 PC release.

Now I played Destiny 1 non-stop, I mean I grinded that game so hard for 4 months, achieved absolutely everything possible, obtained everything and then never touched it again. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED those 4 months. But this isn't a review about Destiny, but rather about Warframe... And man is it a good game!

Warframe at times can feel a bit overwhelming, there certainly isn't  the type of hand-holding that Bungie provide you with in Destiny. Whilst this hand holding can seem helpful at the start, it soon turns into a glass ceiling. Forcing you to go in a particular direction or playstyle - there is non of this in Warframe. 

In Warframe the universe is an open book and you approach it however you would like. There is a general linear progression to the missions, you unlock one planet move onto a next and so on, but warframe really lets you choose how you tackle this. The weapon system in Warframe is a prime example of how open it is: You can pick a starter gun, and because of 100's of mods available, this starter weapon can still kick a** in mid to end game! Every Primary, secondary and melee weapon feels unique and there are so many ways to alter these weapons: Want a machine gun that sets enemies alight? No problem, just add a Fire Mod! Want a bow that fires 2 arrows instead of 1? No problem, add a multi-shot mod! Want both of those? No problem, add both mods!

That's just the weapons, wait till you try the warframes! There are about 30 or so different warframes (basically characters) and each has 4 unique abilities. Each warframe is suited to a particular purpose: You like to control the sea and summon a Kraken to throw enemies about? Hydroid's your guy! You like to set every enemy on fire and watch the world burn? Ember's who you're after! Want to heal the rest of your teammates and be the lifeline of the team? Trinity is here! And guess what? Yepp, you can mod these just like you mod the weapons: Want more shield on your tanky Rhino warframe? No problem, we got that! Want more energy to keep using your abilities? Eyyy yepp that too! And that's just 2 examples out of hundreds!

Companions I heard you say? Oh yeah well in Destiny you have a futuristic rubix cube who attempts to make jokes. Whilst in Warframe you have about 6 different companions, 4 war wolves, some cat/fox breed and an epic looking alien bull! All of which have their unique abilities and purpose... And yes you guessed it: You can also mod them!

Next is customisation... Now wow oh wow is this impressive. Warframe lets you customise pretty much about everything. On a warframe you can add skins, you can add armor pieces, you can add sigils (tattoo type things), you can add capes, you can change helmet style and you can change the colour of every single one of these pieces and aspects. The same goes for your companions and weapons. Also you can customise the colour and skin of your ship, you can even change the colour of the walls inside your ship! There's ALOT to customise in this game, it's quite impressive.

Now at this stage you're probably saying: ""Yeah well I heard you gotta buy in-game currency to get access to this awesome stuff."" Incorrect! Warframe has a whole in-game market/trading system that often fuels the crafting system. Meaning that you can sell the drops you get from certain missions to other players for the in-game currency. Or you can keep it for yourself and once you've got all the bits you can craft it! Either way you will eventually earn platinum and be able to buy the epic stuff you wanted.

Lastly, the community. This is perhaps one of the nicest and most pleasant social aspects of Warframe. The community is so close, kind and caring. People have always helped me and some even gave me free stuff! This really is unique in an online game and boy is it nice to see.

All in all, I came to Warframe to keep me occupied and now I'm hooked. I STRONGLY recommend you try Warframe, you will not be disappointed. Great work DE!


* EDIT 1: Thank you all for your thumbs up, feedback and comments! I'll do my best to answer a few valid points that I've seen come up in the past week or in the comments.

1) ""Certain Warframes are OP"" - Well Yes and No, I don't think the term over-powered can be used here. I think certain Warframes are more USEFUL than others, but then again that will entirely depend on what mission or purpose you are doing. For example: Sure I can run through a difficult Spy mission with Ember (an incredibly offensive fire based Warframe) but I will have an easier and smoother time tackling it with Ash (a stealthy, silent, single target based Warframe).

It's also important to remember that a Warframe, weapon or even companion is only as powerful as the mods you put on it. Meaning that you can completely transform a warframe from something ""meh"" to something godly just by using the right mods, and good ones too! But remember, the better the mods, the harder they are to find / more expensive they are to buy with plat!

2) ""The graphics are horrible"" - I'm going to use World of Warcraft to demonstrate my point here (I'm sure there are many other examples, but WoW is the one I can think of right now!): - World of Warcraft is a long-running game and like in Warframe, the often beginner areas (which were created right at the start of the game) look barren and terrible. This is somewhat true about the first few planets in Warframe, certain areas at the start look lifeless and without depth BUT as you progress, the planets become more detailed and graphically nicer.

Furthermore, recently DE just remastered Earth (the first planet) and it looks MUCH nicer! So be patient, DE definitely know that certain areas look crud and they are working on it I'm sure! I expect more planets will get a make-over just like Earth in the near future.

3) ""Plains of Eidolon is boring and filled with bugs "" - Okay sure, Plains of Eidolon (the newest, semi-open world area) is not entirely what we expected but think of this: This is the first time DE have attempted anything like it, they clearly said prior to the release that they were expecting feedback and will continue to add more content to PoE. They are a small studio and don't necessarily have the resources that large studios like Blizzard or Activision might have. Give them time, give them feedback and be patient. I am almost certain that in the coming weeks DE will be adding more content and tweaking the existing stuff to make it smooth and enjoyable.

Also, Plains of Eidolon is not meant to be the bulk of the game, there are still many other planets and things to do! It's just a new area in an existing planet. Everyone chill and give DE some room to breathe and work things out, they have in the past and they will do so now too.

230410,Warframe,"This story requires a bit of setup.

Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a ""Grandmaster"" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.

Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.

On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now.

We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.

I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for).

Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

This game has spoiled me. I will no longer accept anything less than this from any game developer. Be it AAA or indie.

This game is free. Get it? Free. You are not required to spend a single penny in order to experience the full content of the game. All characters, quests and environments are fully disclosed to you on their due time. That being said, I HAVE spent money on this. Why? Cosmetics of course. Fashion is endgame you know?

Now, just what is Warframe? Warframe is a mostly PVE third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay. You have seen games do parkour before of course, but these are space ninjas we're talking about, which means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bullets, rockets and/or high-energy plasma, or just take out your trusty sword/hammer/fists and cripple anything in your path.

What will you face? Humanoids, robots, aliens, you name it. Yes, there are bosses, and they can and will kick your butt.
What will you face them with? Hundreds, and I mean HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from. Each of them unique in its own way, and deeply customizable to suit your needs and/or taste. You can carry three of them at a time. A primary weapon (bow, rifle, etc), a secondary weapon (pistol, throwing knives, and... other things), and of course a melee weapon.

Now, you can always tear through the game solo, but, for the best experience, the game pairs you with up to three other players in missions ranging from a stealthy rescue in the overgrown jungles of Earth, to an all-out extermination in the frozen wastelands of Pluto.
But doing missions is just one part of it, you also have a widely explorable open-world area, with its own assortment of missions waiting for you. And this open-world thing is only going get bigger in future updates. Oh and the updates, they are a regular thing. Like, every other day.

Now what's the story? Can't tell you. Its a secret. No, really, the game community is super protective of the game lore. There is a certain point in the game where you will KNOW, and then we can talk about it, but until then, you gotta find out for yourself. For now just consider yourself a space ninja.

How about difficulty? Scales up with your level, just like most modern mmos. The game will be just as hard as you want to handle. If you want to go at it casually, there's content for you. If you're looking for a challenge, good news, the enemy level can scale up almost infinitely.

------------------------------------
Now, bad things about warframe:

-PVP sucks
-Grinding, lots of grinding.
-There are some cool aspects of the game that are seemingly abandoned and/or have been in development hell for ages.
-Your inventory slots are limited, and you can buy more by using the premium currency. While technically you do not need to buy more slots, since you can simply sell what you don't need or want, it is a huge temptation and it is the most likely reason why you will buy platinum, if you ever do.

------------------------------------
About grinding. This is both a good and bad thing about the game. Most will consider grinding a bad thing but here it's a little diferent. In Warframe, the grind is integratd into the core objective of the game. Grinding is what you do to pass the time. It is so integrated into the game world that you don't really notice it. So yeah, there is a lot of grinding, but you have fun while doing it.
------------------------------------

Final thoughts.

Now, I'm not saying warframe should be game of the year or anything (more like game of the decade), but the level of attention and communication that Digital Extremes (the game devs) has with the warframe community and the display of love for their own game is absolutely marvelous. These people are setting a new standard for the gaming industry, and I can only see good things in the future for them.

In conclusion, we don't deserve Warframe.

Also, you can have a space dog/cat, and PET THEM. 10/10

230410,Warframe,"I've been playing Warframe for a very long time since 2013, been hating it, fanboying over it then hating again. Despite all the negative aspects of this game I still recommend trying it out. 

 I'll leave it recommended to play, but let me tell you... 

- Don't bother understanding this game if you've never played looter in your life, the amount of grind this game requires is humongous especially in ""open world"" areas. 
- The game is not newbie friendly and it won't hold your hand explaining every aspects, you'll have to manually find answers in codex and wiki, and there's way too much to learn as most of Warframe aspects are quite unique and can't be learned through playing other games alike. 
- Warframe as looters tend to be, is a very repetitive game, you'll often find yourself doing same thing over and over again be it farming resources, warframes, mods etc.
- Over last 2-3 years developers seems to be running out of ideas and creativity, with copypasta open world content, to very buggy and plain boring new mechanics and bosses releases. Development of the game nearly stopped and the focus of the game is now to monetize skins, before we hit 1 decent update around 70 new skins are released.
- Game doesn't have any dungeons, raids , good crafting systems (altho it has crafting in OW areas I wouldn't call it anything good or even close to be crafting) 


The prime time in WF development was around 2015-2016 when they kept pushing the story and new content with it. I would highly recommend you to play thru the Quest system in Warframe, it's locked inside of progression system but quick google/youtube search could guide you how to start playing thru Quests within 10-15 hours of gameplay. 

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

- So graphics, this game doesn't have ""real cool shit"" to blow your mind, the graphics are not the prime of this game, however, what compliments it is - unique play models (warframes) and solid optimization, this game can run on potato, beleive me, I've tried. 

Overall 7/10 

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

- Monetization is alright, I would say revolutionary, compared to EA, Activision etc.
I'ts pretty fair, you can even get yourself 50/75% off deals from time to time when you log-in 
Game is not greedy and doesn't force you to spend money to progress or lock you behind paywalls. It's truly a free-to-play experience if you want it to be. 
Altho you can instantly buy Warframes, Weapons and skins/costumizations the core game is 100% playable and you can get all of it's content for free, except skins, but... 
Warframe has trading and you can trade the stuff you farmed for premium currency. 

So the monetization balance is fair for everyone, if you can spend alot of time playing it you'll get rich, or if you can't spend time playing the game but still want to progress faster you can dump few bucks and speed it up. 

Overall 9/10 

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

- Gameplay is quite interesting which blures it's repetitiveness, you have bunch of unique Warframes, weapons, powers and this game is really trying to make you as powerful as possible, like clearing your screen with one button tap - that's Warframe. 

In time this degrades and new Warframes look just like another one but either weaker or overpowered. Game doesn't really improve in mission types, we still have the same stuff as we had before with minor additions and I just can't find a random lobby for archwing/railjack missions as no one plays them. 

Overall 7/10 

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

- Game lore, this game has pretty massive one I'll give it that, for a looter-shooter game it has pretty nice and unique story which you'll find in Quest cinematics and codex.
I've really enjoyed playing thru all of them and even if you don't like grind you can set it aside and play this game solely for it's quests. 

The devs however got pretty lazy with updating their story as it doesn't monetize their game enough so updates on it take years, while other games with less staff giving bigger and passionate updates. 

For what we have 8/10 


-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  


Alright this thing is already too big to drop all my tantrums and criticism 
Overall I'd give this game 8/10, try it, it's free...

230410,Warframe,"I'm bored of this game. I can barely play it. A lot of the new content is more of the same. This is a common theme between veterans, as you can see from several negative reviews from people with 1k+ hours into the game.

HOWEVER...

If someone played a game for this many hours and stopped because of the lack of content, it's not due to the game being unfun. The average player will find the game quite entertaining for the most part. There's just too high of an expectation of being able to play a game 10 hours a day and not get burnt out.

It's an amazing game. By the time you are bored, you'll have spent more time in this game than you'd ever have on several ""AAA"" titles combined. And it's free. The monetization is absolutely fair (and extremely cheap). Seriously, if you get a 75% discount on one of the Daily Rewards (not an uncommon reward), any plat purchased will net so much value and for a long period of time. 

TL:DR Try the game out.

230410,Warframe,"Seeing as Tennocon just happened a few days ago, and has been gathering a lot interests since then, i think it would be a good idea to finally make a review on this thing. I mean i have like, what, [b]1500 hours[/b] on this game, so i think i qualified to talk about this game.

[h1]What is this game even[/h1]
Warframe is a third person PvE loot shooter, where its about collecting resources and items to craft new guns and armor so you can kill things in more ways. You play as a ""Warframe"", which are basically space ninjas. Each Warframe comes with a set of abilities to make them all special, and their mobility allows them to get across the stages with ease, and will become second nature before you know it.

[h1]Whats the bloody goal of the game[/h1]
Unlike most games, Warframe doesn't have a traditional progression system. All weapons and Warframes can only reach level 30, which you can easily get in a hour or two. However, your total rank (known as mastery rank) only ranks up when you level up new gear, and some items are locked behind a mastery rank. This means that it doesn't take long for new players to reach the highest level with their gear, with encouraging them to try new things as they play the game.

[h1]So hows the customization[/h1]
This is one of warframes strongest points. Pretty much all weapons and Warframe can be modded in any way you like. Wanna make your Warframe super tanky? Or maybe give his abilities alot of power for better damage? Thats all up to you. This makes the game extremely replayable, as you can experiment with different builds for your gear.
You can also change the look of your items for [b]maximum fashion,[/b] even as a new people.

[h1]It's free to play, meaning it has microtransactions...[/h1]
Lucky, warframe is one of the very best when it comes to this, Almost all items can be bought from the games shop, but they cost alot compared to how easy some of them are. Its as if the game says: ""Look, i get it, you dont wanna work to get that shotgun, but its gonna cost you quite a bit to buy it.."" The main you will be buying is instead things like weapon slots, warframe slots, boosters, accessories and so on. Theres also a trading system in the game, and it allows you to trade using the game's premium currency, giving the game its own economy.


[h1]Alright, that's good and all, but what are the cons[/h1]
Even tho i just said the game is ""extremely replayable"", this is still a loot shooter, meaning there will be grinding at times. Sometimes its not so bad, other times it goes a [b]bit[/b] beyone extreme. If games with grinding doesn't suit you at all, maybe you wanna skip this one. But hey, i've over 1000 hours on the game, and im still able to enjoy the game most of the time.

[h1]Ze End[/h1]
So thats my short review of the game. I dont wanna go much more into details since i feel like new players should see it for themself, but this is a basic overview of what kind of game it is, and what you can expect from it. If you like what you hear, then give it a try, its free after all.

[h2]Oh boy.[/h2]
 
Before I can get into the nitty-gritty and answer the question of ""Should I play Warframe?"" let it be known that it's impossible to review the entirety of this game with the restriction imposed by Steam's review format. There are too many systems within it to cover them all. We can talk about what works and what doesn’t as a whole, but to truly dissect them we’d need one of those 6-hour-long YouTube videos that are all the rage these days.

The short answer: Yes, you should play it. It’s free, a lot of fun and doesn’t make you feel terrible if you never spend money on it. The long answer; here we go!

[h1]The good[/h1]
[h2] Audio, Visuals, Gameplay, Variety[/h2]

Warframe is an MMO, co-op, third-person shooter, taking place in our very own solar system, at an unimaginably distant point in time, where two major factions vie for control in the aftermath of a great war. Players take on the role of the Tenno – ancient warriors now needed more than ever to keep balance within the universe and protect innocents from the new war they find themselves in. The Tenno operate the titular Warframes, battlesuits with exceptional combat prowess, agility, and space magic.

After choosing your Warframe, you’re dropped into a tutorial where you learn the basics of Warframe’s excellent combat and movement systems. You get a primary, secondary, and melee weapon, and can switch between them on the fly. Each Warframe also has four unique abilities, ie. space magic. Although the game doesn’t have a combo meter, it is very evocative of Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, and similar hack-n-slash games. The movement is cathartic, as you can glide through the air, run on walls, slide, twirl, and generally parkour all over the place. It’s a lot of fun.

After the tutorial, you get your very own spaceship, from which you’ll be able to fly across the galaxy and participate in the abundant content Warframe offers. You can visit all of the planets in the Solar system, and then some. While some of them have open-world areas, the majority of Warframe’s game modes you’ll get to play will be standalone missions, such as Survival, Defense, Assassination, Excavation, etc. As you do so, you will be awarded crafting resources and blueprints on which to use them, usually for crafting new weapons and Warframes. You’ll also be awarded Mods, which you can equip on your equipment to modify its various stats.

You’ll also notice just how beautiful of a game Warframe is, with visuals that make me wonder just how in the world they keep the system requirements as low as they are. There are issues with how lighting works, as certain surfaces can be blindingly bright, but turn off Bloom and you should be good. The audio production is similarly brilliant, with excellent sound design that makes the combat punchy and satisfying, regardless of which weapon you’re using. It’s amazing how every single weapon, no matter if it’s a primary, secondary, or melee, can be auditorily distinct from another, and still sound amazing. The soundtrack has a fitting track for every situation, ranging from ethereal chants when the game is being mysterious, to faster-paced, drum-driven ones that compliment the combat. There’s a bit of inconsistency to it, as some are memorable enough to become known even outside of the game, while others are just something you probably won't think about outside of the moment it's playing.

[h1]The bad[/h1]
[h2]Progression, Difficulty, Story Quests, Design Philosophy[/h2]

So, after you’ve gotten acquainted with your ship and everything you can do around it, maybe progressed through a couple of planets, and tried doing a quest or two, the game opens up and provides very little information on what you’re supposed to do next. Don’t bother with figuring it out on your own, as that’ll only put you off. Look to the wiki and save yourself unnecessary frustration. After the first…40 hours, the game will click. You’ll find a weapon that works for you and continue progressing through the Star map, acquiring more gear and knowledge on the game as you go along, and getting to complete more and more story quests.

If you’re smart, unlike I was, you should probably stop around 400-500 hours, as Warframe’s problems become more apparent as progression continues. I believe that, first and foremost, Warframe was designed to keep player base retention. You may think that every game is, but no. As a free-to-play title, Warframe most likely relies on players to keep coming back; as they invest more and more time into it, the more likely they are to invest money as well. Other, paid titles, won’t mind how many hours you put in since you pay up-front. Warframe isn’t bad in this regard, as pretty much anything that can be bought with Platinum (the game's premium currency) can be grinded for, as you can trade Platinum with other players, so there’s a strong trading economy at play here - but you wouldn't know it from the in-game market. 

The very progression is stop-and-go, as each piece of gear has its own level. As you level them up, so does your overall account level, called Mastery, increase – granting you access to more content and weapons. You’re encouraged to keep swapping between them, instead of getting more powerful with one – which you will have to do as well, at some point. Once this stops at Mastery level 16, you’ve pretty much encountered the hardest Warframe has to throw at you, and you still have another 24 levels to go, with new ones being added as the number of equipment in the game grows. Past that point, all you’re doing is increasing numbers and figuring out the most efficient way of farming for new stuff. You might not mind it as much, but know that the game wasn’t designed with a point of finality in mind, but for you to keep coming back, again and again, to keep grinding and completing content, without much substance to it. Enemies become trivial, as a single press of a button can wipe out entire rooms. Level-design becomes non-existent, as you spam the bullet jump maneuver to blaze through levels as fast as possible, so you can try again if that piece of loot you need didn’t drop.

As such, the developers prioritize new, replayable content to get older players into the grind again. At the same time, it has to be accessible to newer players, so it can’t be made too difficult. Story quests suffer especially, as they’re not designed with replayability in mind. The main plot of Warframe still isn’t finished, and it’s been three years since the previous major quest had been added. There’s a lot of wasted potential here, especially with some of the characters, as such a game can’t really have character development. There's simply no room for it as things need to stay static—characters are bereft of their arcs and remain the same for the sake of replayable missions and grind. 

It might keep all those boxes in your mind ticked so you feel accomplished. I know I did way past a point I should have, but looking back at a good part of those 995 hours, and it feels like time wasted.

230410,Warframe,"Warframe is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I've had moments were I really loved it and there have been numerous moments where I've wanted to smash my desk with a sledgehammer. 
I'll just write a short and simple review.

Combat - 8/10
Really satisfying and fast. But the late game can get stressful and too hectic.

Movement - 7/10
Mostly same as above, but what brings it down a bit is the numerous enemies that kill your momentum and the Co-op elements.

Multiplayer - 5/10
Great in the beginning but it really gets dragged down in the higher levels where all players just speed around the map to the objectives and it starts to feel more like a speedrun. I always found it annoying when people would just race past enemies and do all these exploits just to get through the level faster and I would struggle to keep up.

Story - ?/10
I don't have much to say since the story is unfinished, but the little that I've seen thus far is pretty interesting.

Visuals - 8,5/10
Absolutely stunning. The lighting really makes the game. It's so bright and vivid, and it runs great I might add. And I really like the designs for all the different warframes and cosmetics.

Missions and objectives- 5/10
This is sadly the weakest point of the game. The missions and levels get really repetetive and grindy. And trying to get new gear can sometimes take weeks. (Including build times) This is the part where you're really reminded that this is a F2P game. I would've prefered to pay for a full game with less of a grind since I've already spent way more than 60$ on rushing items and buying cosmetics. I'll add that I'm not a fan of grinding (which is why I've spent so much money on the game.), I know some people are and kudos to you if you're into that stuff but I'm not.


Keep in mind that these are my personal opinions and experiences. Correct me on anything that's wrong and feel free to share your thoughts with me.

230410,Warframe,"[h1]Player(s)[/h1]
[  ] Singleplayer
[X] Multiplayer
[  ] open world

Most missions can be played with up to 3 other players online. There are singleplayer sections as well as some open world areas, but most of the game is for 1-4 players.

[h1]Story[/h1]
[  ] has no story
[  ] not interesting/important
[  ] decent story
[X] good story
[  ] emotional rollercoaster

The game starts out with hardly any story, but gets better the more you get into it and the more you read item descriptions and little details. After that you have a pretty good story in many aspects.

[h1]Long term motivation / play time[/h1]
[  ] very short (<5h)
[  ] relatively short (5-10h)
[  ] decent length (10-20h)
[  ] long (20-50h)
[  ] very long (50-100h)
[X] endless (>100h)

So many different things to do and farm, you can spend thousands of hours if you want to

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
[  ] very easy
[X] doable for everybody
[  ] might be somehow challenging
[  ] very hard
[  ] Dark Souls hard

Not that challenging, you just need to dedicate time

[h1]Controls[/h1]
[  ] few buttons
[X] average amount of buttons
[  ] might need some time to get used to
[  ] wait... which button again?

Besides your movement keys you just have to shoot and use 4 abilities. You need to memorize everything to be fast, but it's nothing particularly difficult.

[h1]Time investment / Grind[/h1]
[  ] relies purely on skill
[  ] need to invest some time, but skill will help
[  ] a lot of grinding
[X] lock yourself up in the basement

you better get ready for some long a** grinding

[h1]Diversity[/h1]
[  ] same thing over and over again
[X] sometimes a little monotonous
[  ] a lot of different levels
[  ] Surprise Motherf***er!

You have a lot of different planets and random generated maps for every mission, but the basic gameplay stays the same.

[h1]Characters customization[/h1]
[  ] none
[  ] few possible changes
[  ] a lot of ways to upgrade your character
[X] essential for the game

Basically everything you do comes down to leveling, designing, modifying your character.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
[  ] complete garbage
[  ] very bad
[  ] okay
[  ] looks nice sometimes
[X] good graphics but nothing special
[  ] visually stunning

[h1]Music / Soundtrack[/h1]
[  ] none
[  ] my ears are bleeding...
[  ] I'll just listen to my own music
[X] can be quite nice
[  ] absolutely beautiful

Definitely hase some good soundtrack that is worth listening to

[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]
[  ] shitey
[  ] yeah, looks good
[X] stunning

The game creates a very good atmosphere especially due to its variety of planets and locations. You really feel like you are part of that universe (well you actually are) and many places like the moon (called Lua in game) or the Void look just super gorgeous.

[h1]In game purchases[/h1]
[  ] pay 2 win
[X] pay 2 skip (everything can be acquired by just playing the game)
[  ] no real money can be spend

You can spend soooo much money, but at the same time everything can be completed by playing the game. As I said before, this game has a lot of grinding, which can be skipped by paying, but it's not p2w.

[h1]Personal thoughts:[/h1]
This game is definitely not for everybody, if you don't like spending a lot of time, grinding and doing some things multiple times, this game is nothing for you. But if you do like those things, this game is excellent. Especially the movement is just so addicting and you have so many different weapons/warframes/companions/planets/gamemodes.
If you're not sure whether to get it or not, just try it out, especially since it's free. Have fun!

230410,Warframe,"[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
2020 RE-review... My thoughts have not changed, this game remains top of the looter shooter genre, with beautiful graphics (finally got a good PC lmao), lots of customization and lots of characters. You'll probably find the frame for you very quickly! I have never played a game that was so perfect in regards to how it treats the customer. I have more below, but just know in recent years so much story, game and UI improvements have been dealt!

[h1] Intro [/h1]
Warframe, a universe thriving with lush, hidden lore. The place where a species of technologically crude, and industrious Grineer have made home. The place where a plutocratic, advanced, and money greedy Corpus have made home. The place where a technocyte plague known as the Infestation has made home. Ah, and of course.. the place where you, the noble, honorable, Tenno; have made home. 

[h1] Warframe Pros [/h1]

Warframe is a free to play done right, everything in this game can be earned for completely free. You know how I know? Well, I've been getting EVERYTHING for free, and have spent a fair amount of hours to get this info!

This game has thousands of mods. Unlike its 'comparable' Destiny, this game has more than a dumbed down skill tree. This game has a modding system. One which lets your power have billions of stat combos.Even the placement of mods will determine their effectiveness!

This game allows for player to player trading. Whether you're looking for 'prime' gear, or platinum (premium currency), trading has you covered. There are people willing to trade you for mods, gear, and platinum.

The UPDATES, now this is a big one. This game Warframe has had so many updates, nearly on a monthly basis that it could EASILY have had a Warframe 2 by now. For a game being completely free, these updates are WELL worth your time. I mean hell, we've recently gotten our third open world. Completely. Free.

The memorable moments. One, undeniable fact, is that this game gets sweeter as time goes on. With monumental quests such as The Second Dream and The War Within, this game will blow you out of your socks. Though, for some, this can take up to 100-200 hours to get to. It's crazy, but gives you the best feeling and memory afterwards. Specifically the Second Dream touched my soul. I have played for 6 years or so and after all that time, to see the truth... I can't explain the feeling. I saved up and purchased the pre-order for the Second Dream's statue bundle to commemorate!

Your Space Mom. Every Tenno needs to feel like they have someone.. SOMEONE! For the longest time, in the game, I was closest to my dear space mom. The Lotus!

The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous, I know this is a random one but it can really hit you in the feels later on. Try looking up ""This is What You Are - Keith"" <- It'll bring you to a Warframe song that is too good..

[h1] Warframe Cons [/h1]

The grind can be unrelenting for some. For people like me, the grind was never bad because of my constant progression, but for people who aren't patient or want things quickly (in a progression system) this might be a bit too much.

The lore is very hidden. There is a story, but for some major lore, and theories on it, you'll have to look it up on YouTube. If you'd like a good series I recommend StallorD

The enemy scaling. For some people who love a hard challenge, the enemy scaling might be too much. Not exactly the ENEMY itself, but more specifically the ARMOUR on an enemy. It can be insane to even damage an enemy after level 100.  

[h1] Improvements? [/h1]
[i] These are simply opinions on minor things... [/i]

Dojo improvements. I think Tennogen should be introduced for the Dojo, more decorations should be added, AND massive group builds. I'm talking about decorations that require a load of resources. That way if you have a large and active clan, you'll have special things that show your true power, and riches!

On 'Finisher' animations for the Nikana backslash, a mark/bodysplit hould happen. What I mean is that you do a diagonal slash across the enemies back, yet no deep cut appears, or body splitting? I dunno, just a request!

Please add a flashlight we can toggle. Especially with the release of PoE, seeing in the dark is crucial. Either an option to turn on and off the flashlight manually or nightvision would be greatly appreciated. I don't know about anyone else but seeing in the dark hurts my eyes sometimes, oopsie!

[h1] Final Words [/h1]

Now please, note that this is all speculation and pure opinions! I love Warframe! If you have any questions, need help in game, a clan to join, or notice anything spelled wrong, or anything I should add.. please feel free to drop a comment in the space below!

230410,Warframe,"[h1] Not pay to win [/h1]
Before I start my review, I want to dispell this notion. Anyone who tells you this game is pay to win is wrong, or lying to you. Most of the good weapons are mastery rank locked and even if you buy things to bypass the grind, you still have to level those Warframes and weapons, you still have to play the game to grind and get mods for your weapons and Warframes to make them actually perform well in end-game content. You're blindsiding yourself if you're going to make the argument that this game is pay to win. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's get to the actual review.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
I had to start off by reviewing the graphical quality of this game, because it's [i] so beautiful. [/i] Everything is well polished and good-looking, the appearance of Warframe will not hesitate to immerse you into the environment. On top of that, graphically the game is extremely well optimized compared to other games, and can run on many older computers without an issue. There is no section of the game that is forgotten about in regards to visuals. Clearly, a lot of love has been put into this game and you can tell that immediately just by looking at how beautiful and immersive the game is.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Warframe's content and gameplay are some of the best for any free-to-play game out there. Everything in Warframe is available without paying if you are willing to grind for it. One of the best freemium models out there, seriously. You can earn Platinum, the premium currency, in-game without ever spending a cent on it. As for the Warframes themselves, each one is unique, and there are over 35 of them. 35! That's a lot of different characters to choose from. Each of them has 4 unique abilities that do different things, and you can typically mod a Warframe 3 different ways or more to focus on a specific part of their ability kit. That is a fantastic amount of customization and one of the things I love most about the game. I will say that the star chart content can get a bit repetitive at times, but if you stick it out, fill out your star chart, and get into high level content, it'll feel less repetitive in due time. At higher levels the combat gets much more complex. Try staying for at least an hour in a survival mission if you decide to play, and you'll see what I mean.

[h1] Cosmetics [/h1]
I had to talk about the cosmetics in Warframe because let's face it- fashion, looking good and uniqueness are important aspects of any videogame. Warframe has a ton of cosmetics, and they're all extremely beautiful and wonderful. Once you get through all the star chart content, you may find yourself grinding for Platinum to purchase a new set of clothes- or outright buying it with real money, I won't judge you for it. In fact, some of the best cosmetics in the game can only be purchased with real money- the TennoGen cosmetics are handsomely crafted with love by individual creators, and your money goes back to those creators, supporting them and allowing them to make more wonderful content for the game.

[h1] Grinding [/h1]
I'll flesh out my review by saying this. If you don't like grinding or MMO-type games, Warframe probably isn't for you. I would still give it a go even if you don't like those types of games, but you're probably not going to enjoy it if you aren't a patient person. Grinding is the name of the game in Warframe, and RNG affects many activities in the game. If you don't like the fact that you aren't guaranteed certain things and have to wait for warframes and weapons to finish building before you can use them, or that you have to farm resources to build them, then you probably won't enjoy the game. Still, if you invest your time into the grind, you can acquire nearly anything you want for no cost at all.

[h1] Updates [/h1]
One great thing about Warframe is that they are constantly updating the game and delivering new content to us. Year round, we get new Warframes, quests, and content, albeit they can be buggy at the start. We received Sanctuary Onslaught, a new gamemode, and The Sacrifice, a new quest, earlier this year, and we're getting Fortuna, an open-world area on Venus later this year. That's a lot of content for one year! While it's not always the best and most optimized content, I see more love poured into Warframe content than that of any other game at the current time. The devs maintain a strong relationship with the community and actively ask questions to the players about what they want to see and what they want changed, and do frequent livestreams for fun and for discussing where they are in terms of development with the game. Their strong community commitment is one of the great things that many people love about Warframe- DE's transparency and willingness to maintain a strong bond with us is something that not many other game companies can brag about.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
So, if you read my entire thing and some of my points sparked your interest, I would definitely reccommend giving the game a go. I have loved every second I've played of Warframe and I can honestly say it's one of the only games whose future updates I'm currently excited for. There are no downsides to trying the game out- after all, it's free to play and if you don't like the grind then you can stop at any time and uninstall the game. There's no paywalls or money barriers to any of the content in the game. It takes time to grind for resources and build things, but if you can develop patience, that grinding pays off, and the game will only get deeper and more complex as a result.","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

My time with Warframe spanned about 7 or 8 years. I am unfortunately at the point where I can't quite get into it anymore, which is sad but the memories I have from Warframe are super happy, to say the least.

Making the choice to try Warframe is one of the best decisions I've ever made. I made life-long friends while playing this game. 

Thanks to DE for everything they've done, I always felt supported as a player here. Absolutely legendary game, so much fun to be had.

If you somehow have not tried this game yet, please give it a go.

230410,Warframe,"PROS
+ Movement is something else! It may begin to do a number on your pinky finger but once you get a hang of the moment controls, this is possibly the best platforming I've seen in a third-person shooter. High octane, to the point where sometimes I feel I'm getting motion sickness.
+ You can farm Prime parts to sell for Platinum, the ""premium"" currency, which means that, with some patience, you can actually get by in this game without spending a single penny of real-world money.
+ Most items have a ton of customization options ASIDE from the ability to recolor which you get from the very start without having a spend anything. Warframes? Recolorable! Weapons? Recolorable! Your own SPACESHIP?! YES! Recolor away! Pets, sadly, are a biiiiit harder to recolor, I think.
+ Very, VERY well-optimized. I play this game butter-smooth on my ages-old PC and wouldn't be surprised if it worked on my aging laptop.

CONS
- Very, very grindy. If you just craft a Warframe, it literally takes days (72 hours) before your frame is finished being made.
- You can... actually kinda follow the development as you progress through the game. Production value shoots up as you progress, showing that later content.Earth through Uranus feels very... ""samey"", where you're just progressing from node to node, junction to junction, and it will test your patience. Uranus/Neptune and above, though? You begin to actually get PROPER quests. With cinematics and everything. However, the game takes too long getting here... I feel that's why they plopped Cetus and Fortuna where they are now, to give new players a break from the node-to-node slog and overall content drought.
- Terrible customer support.
- There is very little info on how to progress past Uranus. So heed my words, when you hear odd sounds in Uranus sealab words... GET YOUR SCANNER OUT AND SCAN THE NOODLE MONSTERS!

230410,Warframe,"This game is evil.

At first, you will be astonished by the super cool graphics and character/weapon designs. You will say to yourself ""How can this be free?"" And for the first 20 or so hours, everything will seem fine. But then, all of a sudden, you will match up with someone who has a way cooler frame than you, and you will look in awe at them, and every cell in your body will tell you ""You need to become that guy"". But then after doing some research online, you will realise that his frame is no longer obtainable, so you have to trade with some dude, who has dedicated atleast 1000+ hours to this dark ritual of a game. So, gullible as you are, you will start to slowly farm rare items, to gain enough premium currency to be able to afford this ""Frost Prime"". Then, after 20-25 hours of grinding, you will start to question your own exsistence, as you have only garned about a third of the platinum you need to buy that goddamn warframe. And then, in your hour of darkness, the game will hit you with a 50% discount on the premium currency. And in this hour of darkness, where all your mental defenses have been stripped away from the countless hours of relic farming, you will succumb to the dark lords. But not only will you buy enough platinum to afford the warframe of your dreams, you will buy one of the most expensive bundles, As the dark lords, known only in the common tounge as Digital Extremes, had intended. Because who wants to save 5 bucks, when you can save 50?

You will powerfull for a time. You will feel as though nothing can stop you. Untill you run out of platinum, and the cycle begins anew. And thus in countinues for eternity.

230410,Warframe,"Warframe is a hard game to put into words for anyone who hasn't played it. For as many good things there are about it, there are bad things that make the game somewhat tedious. Despite this, I have a hard time not recommending the game. Almost nothing in out of the reach of Free-to-play players, which is something that a lot of other games can't say for themselves.

Lets start with the good: 

Premium Currency & Trading: This might feel ""weird"" to be put in the good category, but it has a lot to do with the above comment. The premium currency is a tradable currency in-game; this means that you, as a player, can grind items and then sell them for the premium currency to other players. On top of this, Warframe is [i]incredibly[/i] lenient with how much it gives out discounts for its premium currency. I'm not at all ashamed to admit that I've gotten a fair share of 50% off coupons in-game and immediately used it to get $100 of the currency for $50. This combined with the fact that a lot of players are willing to trade tit-for-tat means that trading in this game is fairly robust. Heck, I've even had some interactions where people would throw something in extra for free.

Grinding: Grinding in this game feels extremely rewarding, and once you learn how, when, and where to do it becomes exceedingly fun to do. Most grinds to craft things will only take you a few hours at most, and the fact that you get to choose items from any relic during relic missions means that most of the time you come out of missions feeling like you accomplished something.

Community: This is a bit of a weirder one. Although the community is incredibly nice and willing to help, the main incentives to do so are related to grinding. As such, a lot of times it feels a lot more fun to just go into missions with a group of friends rather than do things publicly because its easier to plan out.

Variety: The game has a STUPID amount of variety in the amount of playstyles that you can choose, further augmented by things called ""Mods"" that can increase various attributes. This game is incredibly flexible and freeform in terms of how you can choose to play, and its a part that I greatly enjoy.

Alright, so that was most of the good things, so now I'll hit you with the bad:

Time Gating: Although grinding is fairly quick in most cases, crafting in this game takes a set amount of time, ranging from 1 minute all the way to a few days for Warframes. This causes you to be incredibly bored early in the game, because you want to try other things but just can't because you need to wait on things to complete before getting to the meat and bones of the variety I talked about above. You can rush the crafting with the premium currency if you so choose, however.

Mastery Gating: With the above comes Mastery gating. Basically, Mastery is your characters level, so to speak. To increase Mastery, you need to level your equipment, whether its warframes, weapons, or even pets. This combined with time gating means that the pace of the game starts off INCREDIBLY slow, because not only does getting Mastery up take awhile, you can also only ""level up"" your mastery once per day. Mastery dictates what missions you can do, what weapons you can use, and what Warframes you have access to, so its a fairly high minus for me. On top of this, if you have any weapons or warframes that you really enjoy, it gets to a point where you're never able to play them because you need to level other things to progress your mastery.

Lack of Direction: Warframe is confusing. Incredibly confusing. The tutorial teaches you very little about the game and then  just throws you off a cliff and tells you to have fun exploring the game. There's no goals for you to immediatly work towards, nor does it explain how you get new Warframes, how open world areas like Cetus, Fortuna, and Deimos work, nor does it really try to explain how to get some of the best mods in the game. This is all left to the player to figure out on their own, and often times means you're spending an exceedingly large amount of time on the Warframe Wiki figuring things out (though, at least the wiki is exceedingly intricate and well made).

Content Lockout: A LOT of the content in the game is locked behind the Main Questline that it never tells you about. The specific quest that needs completed is ""The War Within"", which is locked behind a whole other series of quests and Mastery Level 5, which will take a casual player probably a little over a couple weeks to get to. 

Trading: Although I praised the trading above, there is two caveats to it that requires an addendum, which is that the only way to effectively market items in this game is via using Warframe Market, which is an online third party website. You [i]can[/i] go to a relay and market items there, but even though I've spent a few hours attempting to sell items that way it almost never gets any bites unless its Rivens. Speaking of which....

Rivens: Rivens are like capstone mods for weapons in this game. They're purposely random and incredibly OP. Although I have nothing against them existing, there's a few things that I absolutely despise about them. The first part is pricing. Riven pricing is STUPIDLY complex, and it takes A LOT of learning to understand how to do it yourself. Because of this, there is Riven Appraisal Discords, Websites, and public chats for specifically this one thing. Rivens are also the devs way of influencing the meta through the disposition system; basically, the worse a weapon is, the higher the maximum stats on the Riven are allowed to be. This means that if you like a popular weapon, that the chances are that A: Rivens for that weapons are proportionately increased because of the supply/demand, and B: That the cost of God-Tier Rivens for that weapon is well above anyones pay grade. A good Riven depending on the Weapon can range anywhere from 50 of the premium currency (about $5 USD) to around 2000 ($100 USD) or even more. And even on top of [i]that,[/i] Rivens are also Mastery locked, ranging from Mastery 8 all the way up to 16. To give you an idea of how annoying Mastery is to level, with the amount of time as of writing this post, I'm currently only Mastery 12. Yikes. Admittedly, I could be quite a bit higher, but I like to enjoy the games I play and so liked to stick to a few specific Warframes and Weapons.


Overall, I still recommend Warframe, with a couple caveats: You have to be willing to grind, and you have to be patient. If you can do both of these things, the game becomes very fun and has something to offer for almost everyone. Also, you should probably find a friend to taxi you around to make your early game bearable.","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

230410,Warframe,"upd8: please look at the first two comments for more things I reviewed! comments contain spoilers!

this game tends to be one of two things for most people: either you love it & sink countless hours (and maybe dollars) into it, or you pick it up for a couple hours & put it back down.

this doesn't need saying, but I fall into the former category.

Warframe is a masterfully done game that offers its players a lot of choices not just for what they want to do, but also how they want to do it. you can spend your days designing rooms and outfits. you can sneak through puzzles trying not to get caught, or slash through wave after wave of enemies where your only objective is don't die. you can play as a swordsman, or a magnet, or a golem, or a dj, or something else out of the 30+ warframes they have available (each with their own unique kit of abilities).

pve has never felt this satisfying and engaging. the game has a good balance of quick ""get in get out"" missions, as well as endless missions with rotating rewards (this way you get incentive to stay, but also you don't feel bad for leaving). the sound design team deserves a medal, because this game is the only fps I've played that makes me feel satisfied through sound, not just rewards.

speaking of design, the world is incredibly interesting, & so are all the factions living in it. each has its own unique visual style & moral code, we're not seeing reskinned enemies going ""I wanna destroy the tenno cause reasons!"" or reskinned npcs going ""help me obi-wan kenobi, you're my only hope!"" over and over again. but that doesn't mean they're disconnected; we're constantly seeing people from different factions talking to each other & mentioning each other in passing. the connectedness of the people living in this world is a level of realism I'm not accustomed to in games that aren't 100% story driven, & it makes me appreciate the level of detail the devs use for this game.

that's not to say Warframe doesn't have a story. it's not always easy to find, & at times very frustrating to work through, but it's there and it's interesting and strange. (fwiw, a LOT of the story is told/enhanced through environmental storytelling. you're going to want to hunt for kurias, cephalon fragments, & synthesis targets. or consult the wiki!) the most I can say without spoiling things: you're caught in the middle of factions trying to fight each other, & they either want you with them or they want you dead.

Warframe is optimized to hell and back, to the point where I suspect it could run (poorly) on an apple watch. this optimization HAS gone down in recent months (they recently said that they're no longer supporting 32 bit machines and OS's before Windows 7), but that's still a lot of ground they cover. I was able to play Warframe with little to no issues on a laptop with a terrible graphics card (seriously it couldn't handle Skyrim with the lowest settings). this is an incredible achievement, especially when you consider the details and particle effects the game contains.

also you can get dogs, cats, & pet robots. petting your animals is a game mechanic that gives them buffs. you can fly around in space. you have dance emotes. you can get capes & jet packs & bobbleheads & action figures. you're a robot ninja in space! and all of this is free!

now I've spent a lot of this waxing poetic about how great Warframe is, but this game isn't without its faults. you should know what you're getting into if/when you get this game.

if you're strictly free-to-play, this game is a huge grind. gaining platinum (the paid currency that allows you to get cosmetics, progress boosters, weapon/warframe slots, and weapons/warframes if you don't feel like building them) is best done by getting things called prime parts, which are random drops from relics. you can trade these prime parts to other players for platinum (there are other things you can trade, but prime parts are basically the only things that'll get you any platinum). I wouldn't go so far as to say that rewards in this game resemble a loot box system (the devs have removed systems in the game that act as slot machines), but that doesn't mean it's without frustrations. basically, if you don't want to give Digital Extremes your money for platinum: you have to grind a lot of missions to get prime parts, which you can trade for platinum, which then makes grinding less frustrating. life's rough if you don't have money to spare.

it's also frustrating when you want to get That One Thing you need, but it's the rarest thing on a drop table. again, I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate the devs going out of their way to eliminate loot box/slot machine systems from this game! but often you're stuck with either 1) deciding if you want to take a shortcut by spending platinum, or 2) not having any shortcuts to take so you just keep grinding and grinding. (one time I asked someone if they played Warframe, & they said ""if I wanted to grind I'd go to a club."")

the story doesn't get engaging until Natah. Natah is a quest which you can't access until you can do missions on Uranus, which is also the planet where enemies suddenly get a LOT harder. this point is basically where the game is like ""we're not holding your hand anymore, you need to start upgrading your weapons/warframes."" (funny enough, upgrading your stuff ALSO involves unskippable grinding, but this time it's less rewarding!) Natah has been out since 2015, and by now it's what brings new players into the game (along with the quests that come after it). trouble is, new players are going to want to rush to get to these quests. and by rushing, without taking the time to upgrade their stuff by painstakingly grinding it to rank 30 over and over again, they're going to suffer and get frustrated. this game needs to do more story-wise to not just capture new players' attentions, but to also keep them. (seriously, when I played The Second Dream for the first time, I had to take a long break from Warframe. I was rank 6-7, I was constantly overwhelmed, & I was too busy trying to stay alive to actually pay attention to the story. it sucked.)

DE enables this by making Natah available to people who are as low as rank 3. that's not to say I have a problem with newbies playing the main story! my problem is with DE making it available, but also making the level scaling completely inaccessable. if you're going to make this quest available to people as low as rank 3, you need to make it so that they can actually succeed at it. otherwise what's the point?

not all the quests in your codex are repeatable. so far only the ones that are directly tied to the main storyline can be repeated, & even then it feels really random. I can replay the quest that introduces me to the infested faction way at the beginning of the game... but I can't replay Natah? the quest that basically starts the whole mess of events that we're going through? come on!

now this IS a free to play game, more often than not. so maybe these things won't bother you. that's totally fine, it's just something you should keep in mind if you ever feel like spending money on this game. (which isn't something I'm against, ftr; Digital Extremes is one of the few dev teams out there which I can safely say respects their players and makes sure their game is fun and not just a way to make money.)

ultimately, I recommend trying it, especially if you can get some other friends to join you. you're gonna have a good time! and if you ever get stuck, there's a lot of people who can show you the ropes!","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

230410,Warframe,"[h1]Update (24/4/14):[/h1] It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had. 

The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind.

Multiple new game modes exist, including ""Invasion"", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission.

The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat.

The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy.

In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new ""EVE Online""-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard.

<hr>

[h1]Original Review (25/11/13)[/h1]

A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole.

Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. 

Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. 

Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character.

So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a ""community effort"" in which everyone can participate.

The only ""issue"" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games ""premium"" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. 

The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its ""free to play"" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds.

Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

230410,Warframe,"Don't know how the hell i managed to rack up 3000 hours... I keep coming back when there are new updates, and have not uninstalled this game ever.

Some advice for new players:
1. DON'T overexert yourselves by grinding. E.g. if you've only been playing for a month or so, you shouldn't be grinding endo for rank 10 mods, nor kuva for RNG riven rolls. Gear progression isn't everything, and there is plenty of game content to be explored. I sometimes run level100 missions using excalibur and mk-1 starting equipment for the kicks, and its works fine because of my knowledge on mod combinations and how to deal with enemies. If you are a completionist, bad news... [spoiler]prepare for the worst ;)[/spoiler]
2. What to spend platinum on: Prioritize using plat on increasing warframe / weapon slots. If you have extra, spend them on orokin reactors and catalysts for your favourite frames and weapons.
3. Trading exists, and can save you many hours of grinding. You can sell things you think are junk (duplicate relics, prime parts, mods and whatnot), but are worth much more for others, and buy what you need within minutes. You might need some time learning how to, but there are free tools like the warframe market website to help with trading.
4. ""Press 4 to win"" used to be a thing. Meaning, current metas will be nerfed to oblivion, and so will the next many. You do not have to follow min/max builds. Instead, try new weapons and frames to learn them, while making do with your current mods. That's what the mastery system is imo, learning which weapons and frames are better suited for different situations. If you leveling your weapons by afking in grineer defense missions, you're essentially throwing that piece of knowledge away.
5. How to get plat? : Sell your soul by grinding and/or trading. [spoiler]might shorten your lifespan by a few years.[/spoiler] OR buy using real $ OR wait for 75% plat discount login reward and buy using $, which only appeared for me twice since i started playing.","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

230410,Warframe,"A lot of Warframe reviews bank on the point that it's free, and so what's the harm with trying? The answer to that is, potentially a lot. Dispense with the idea that Warframe is free - that aspect is entirely irrelevant, free or not a bad game is still bad and certainly not worth a damn.

I recommend Warframe solely because it is a [i]good[/i] game.

Daunting, yes, Warframe is huge - as it well should be after almost six continuous years of post-release development, but that quantity upholds a consistent level of quality rivalling any other well received, well reviewed title. This game certainly demands time investment, and that aspect can put off new players that are expecting to progress at a rapid pace. You can reach a decent point in the game after some investment, but it will take thousands of hours to truly complete everything it has to offer.

As an online, instance-based, multiplayer, sci-fi action game Warframe belongs to a fairly niche market - it's most prominent rival being Destiny, and yet these two are so utterly perpendicular in their goals and aspects. Warframe is truly unique, an experience I've never encountered anywhere else, and truthfully not tailored to everyone's particular tastes.

It's big, we've touched upon that, but exactly what is it offering? Quests, progression, customisation, combat, design, music, graphics? How do these all play out in practice? Are they all great?

Short answer, no. It's hard to make a perfect game; impossible in fact, but Warframe certainly pushes some boundaries. Questing has been improving greatly over the years, and the content in the last couple has provided amazing lore and gameplay mechanics with some exceptional writing - and they seem only to be improving.

Progression and customisation tie into one overarching aspect. There's no denying that it starts off slow. Warframe is a grindy game, it makes up a large portion of the time needed to complete it, but it pays off. In a couple weeks you'll have a few frames and a bunch of weapons, in a couple of months you'll have accrued quite the varied arsenal, and within a year you'll likely have almost everything, if not all of it. Warframe doesn't tie you down or make things too hard, it just demands you put in the effort to reap the reward.

The combat of Warframe is simple, and yet incredibly complex. There could be a review on this in and of itself, so I'll make it brief - there is huge variety, and this is no mere point and click to win game (unless you're Saryn).

The design of Warframe is ever undergoing changes, to the current UI overhaul in progress, to the constant graphical improvements, to the general improvements and overhauls of map tiles and geographical spaces. The latest of which, the massive open world of Fortuna, has turned out to be and incredible display of amazing and well detailed level design.

Now, it is not without its downsides. Bugs are frequent, though ultimately the vast majority are very minor and inconsequential. It is rare to face a bug that truly causes major problems. Graphical optimisation isn't great, especially with the open world maps. 

I think there must be mention of how the Market can seem unfair to new players, as it implies weapons must be bought with Platinum, but this is not the case - everything can be crafted.

Now, I will touch on the free to play aspect lastly - I've covered that this is a game and is worth your time, but I dissuade the notion one might have that it is dangerous simply because it IS free to play. Warframe Bears perhaps the most forgiving free to play scheme ever - and that is because you can obtain everything without ever paying a penny. Platinum, the premium currency, can be obtained by simply trading in-game items to players - one can accrue thousands upon thousands without ever putting money into this, and that is what is recommended.

Don't shy away because you think you'll be bottle necked into buying your way to progress, it is never the case.

Bottom line - Warframe is a great game, free or not. You should give it a go - and make friends, it's the best way to play.","Very Positive87% of the 563,283 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

230410,Warframe,"The best 500 hours I've ever spent. Would highly reccomend it. 

DE has done a fantastic job at taking a mediocre game and transforming it into a content giant with a great community and a satisfying game loop of farming resources and building weapons and new frames. I have met many good friends and made lots of memories in Warframe. And its FREE! Thank you DE for what you have done.

Now after I have gushed, I will be real.

This game is not for everyone. If grindy games are not for you, I would reccomend you at least try Warframe, but if you get bored and leave I'd understand.

I think everyone should at least try this amazing game and experience its dedicated development team and community managers. I give Warframe a near perfect as far as games go. I would say an 8 out of 10 solely for the point that it is still semi-niche as a looter grindy game and that not everything is intuitive and has a decent learning curve.

Believe me though,

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Been here since day 1, and I am someone who came from the PS4 version of the game. This has been quite the journey from its horrendous launch to where we are today. Ever since launch I have enjoyed the game, though I do acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable how this game launched, and no video game should launch how Cyberpunk 2077 did. I'd say that this game has been ""playable"" since its 1.3 updates, but it wasn't in a state where I could fully recommended this game to others due to it still being in a worst state than early day Skyrim or the likes. Now here we are, the 1.5 relaunch update has brought us the ""next gen"" update to the game. Whatever you want to actually call this update, it brings the soft overhaul to the game in terms of stability and actual feature and mechanics rebalance to make the game far better in its design, and thus making it feel better to play, along with its far improved stability. The game is now at a state where I could fully recommend it.

The game is still far from being perfect, as certain play styles far outclass other play styles in terms of combat, especially melee combat, as its still pretty stiff and a bit of a button masher at times. Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really. 

There is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.

I really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"I remember hearing about Cyberpunk 2077 around when it was announced. I was interested because I could tell that it would be a tough game to run - performance wise, and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Then when it came out... It was everywhere, and everyone said it sucked. It was a broken mess of a game that wasn't even finished, so I vowed to myself that I would never buy such a hunk of garbage. 

2 years later... 
I'm bored, it's a Saturday. I'm on Netflix wondering what to watch; I had watched A Silent Voice & Breaking Bad a few days earlier, they were both great in their own ways. Then, on the main screen of Netflix I see: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. I think to myself, oh it's going to just be an advertisement by one of my favorite animation studios (Studio Trigger) that got paid to make this. I was wrong, the story swept me in like a storm and I was 200% engaged in all 10 episodes. 

1 day later...
I can't stop thinking about that show, the characters, and even more that was in it. I look on YouTube to people playing some Cyberpunk 2077. ""It looks decent and actually pretty fun now,"" I said to myself. I saw on YouTube that you could get Rebecca's shotgun, David's jacket, etc. in Cyberpunk 2077 and I thought that was dope. I want this game now.

2 days later...
I see everywhere how the player count has increased to 50,000 concurrent players on Steam; just crazy, and the game was on sale at the time, right after patch/update 1.6, so at 10:15 P.M. I bought the game and sold some Counter Strike cases to pay for tax. I let it download and got on the game after I was done with everything I had to do the next day. 

Present day... 
This game is insane, I love everything about it, the details put into the game, and the constant care that CD Projekt Red has given it after the game's launch up to today & onward. They fixed their game, and made a true piece of art. I've played a lot of story-driven games in my day, but none come close to the absolute experience that this game has given me: emotionally, mentally, etc. I love this game and trust me when I say that the game is fixed now & it is my favorite game of 2022 so far. (even though it came out in 2020, patch 1.5 - 1.6 has made it a new game with all of the features and bug fixes that they've added) Also, they got over 105,000 concurrent players just a day and a half later!

Some thoughts:
This game has too much to do other than the main story and (at the time of writing this...) I've sunk almost 40 hours into it already after only 7 days. It is an open-world experience to level the fun and quality of games like: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto: V, and much more. This game is amazing and I 100% recommend buying it. 

P.S.
Also watch the anime, even if you don't like anime that much, but you like this game... It's so great and the story in both the game and the show are breathtaking. 11/10.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"[h1]DOWNLOAD THE NVIDIA GAME READY DRIVERS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD[/h1]
I crashed like twice but didn't have a problem after I got the new game ready drivers. I'm literally making this review as a reminder. Had a blast so far but jesus guys, update your nvidia drivers.

ULTRA EDIT:
[h1]A Flawed but Fun Experience[/h1]

I might as well actually review this game in its current state considering the attention this got, while I have not finished it I feel I have experienced enough of the core mechanics to formulate an accurate opinion at least on the gameplay. 

It is a Witcher 3 reskin with a cyberpunk setting, considering that Witcher 3 was amazing (and I still have yet to get through it entirely) it does translate. Narratively this game excels, the dialogue is well written and acted and the characters are hard to not fall in love with. Walking around the world is exhilarating although unengaging, it is lacking interactivity. That being said the gameplay itself is a lot of fun. The guns pack a huge punch, very satisfying to use. The melee with katanas specifically is fun but broken, I did a body and reflex melee build and was able to behead TONS of foes before they even had time to react. The game is unfortunately plagued with bugs, less severe bugs especially after the recent hotfix but there are a myriad of small immersion raping bugs that pop up here and there Bethesda style. 

Ultimately I invest in player agency/good writing and fun gameplay at the end of the day, the graphics are important but less so. The decision-making of Witcher is here and that's really what I like the most HOWEVER this game was clearly not ready and considering recent events with the dev I will be hard pressed to trust them again. This is an incredibly bad launch. 

All of that being said, if you're the type that is a fan of Deus Ex, Dishonored, or Fallout: New Vegas you will love this game warts and all just for the godlike quest design those and this game offer. Plenty of skill check dialogue to be found. Suffice to say that I have had a good amount of ""That actually worked?!?"" moments so far which is a really hard feeling to nail down with games like this, you usually only get that out of CRPGs like Age of Decadence or Divinity, etc. At the same time I do not judge anyone that refunds this game or waits for a more stable version to come out because CD PROJEKT RED really dropped the ball and should not have released the game in this state. 

In conclusion, this game is mostly what I expected it to be and it is a shame that people expected this game to be the second coming of Jesus. I was banking on the decision making and quest design and this game delivers on those fronts. Everything else though, it does fail here and there but, in my opinion, not enough to make the game genuinely bad. If I had to give it a score out of ten it would be a solid 8/10. Hopefully CD PROJEKT RED can iron out all of these problems in a timely manner and elevate its standing.

Also driving anything is just plain awful, it depends on what you're driving but in my opinion it should just be the same for whatever you're driving but I'm just talking out of my ass at this point.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Patch 1.5 made the game what it should have been when it released. I've done three playthroughs, one when it came out, one after a patch a few months ago, and one now.

Patch 1.5 has been the least buggy that I've ever played the game. There's more content, and more features.

You should never forget that CDPR sold us a buggy, broken game. That features are still incredibly shallow and nothing of what we were initially promised. 

But that aside, Cyberpunk 2077 is still a story, and a world, worth experiencing. I'd get it on sale(it seems to be on sale for a pretty deep discount very often) and not pay full price, but it is still worth getting.

Characters worth meeting, a game worth playing, and a story worth experiencing.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"So I am over 60 years old and fairly new to gaming in general. Jumping from World of Warships (fairly new at that also) to this gives you an idea. Before this it had been many years since playing ANY games. So, I am floored by this game. To me its amazing. Now I set the combat at an easy level and I bumble around in here and am in no hurry. I explore around sometimes doing nothing but looking around. I have gone through a fair amount of the story line - again - its all amazing to me. In short I love it. I now am branching to more games, as I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time. I love the characters of this game, the visuals of it, and have no complaints. Occasionally I run across a very minor glitch of getting stuck or something, but this does not bother me. I do not expect perfection. But I want to emphasize this is very rare. Well done to the developers of this game.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"This game is an interesting one to review, given the conversation around it. As someone who played it two years after release, here are my thoughts on what the game is like in its current state, without any hype or rage attached to it. In short: I was pleasantly surprised. Like, a lot.

I picked this game up for cheap with low expectations. I expected something flawed but fun in a mindless way like Far Cry but I couldn't have been any more wrong. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game made with genuine love and care, with impressive attention to detail. The game was much more immersive and RPG-like than I thought it'd be, and the characters and story were top-notch. It reminded me a lot of Deus Ex and Fallout: New Vegas.

I think this game deserves special praise for being a AAA open world with zero padding. That is, you can ignore all of the side content and railroad through the main quest and finish the game in 10 hours if you really want to. The side quests are also extremely good though, and I was drawn to doing them solely because I found the characters and world fascinating. I think Night City deserves praise as an open world that feels hand-crafted and intrinsically interesting; nothing in it felt like mindless copied-and-pasted content to me.

Of course, your mileage may vary. This game is not GTA or The Elder Scrolls, and I think a lot of the disappointment that people have with this game even now comes from this fact. The driving isn't great, the pedestrian AI is basic, and you can't go into every single building. But I think that's fine. The game is a story-focused RPG and Night City is just there as the pretty backdrop in between missions. The real meat of this game is the narrative and characters.

For years I'd been hearing about how CDPR didn't ""deliver on their promises"" but after playing through the whole thing, I can't really say I feel that way. I had a blast and my only true gripe with the game is that it's unfortunately still riddled with bugs. You won't encounter anything game-breaking, but it is worth mentioning, so keep that in mind. Regardless of that though, I was still pleasantly surprised, and this is probably my favorite game I played this year. Long live Night City.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"I know what you're thinking. Like me, you probably see this on a sale, and think it's gone down in price, it was a hot topic a while ago, and maybe you should take advantage of the opportunity that you see before you and pick it up while you have the chance. It's been out for a while, and they've probably cleared out most of the bugs by now, and it's *probably* a pretty good game at this point. 

It is. Kind of. You'll probably be able to make it through the main story, and a few of the most important side quests relatively bug free. The story is great. I think it's partially worth it on story alone. But because of that, you'll be longing for more. You'll keep seeing it in your steam library a month or two later, and feel guilty that you haven't picked it back up again. But you'll know that as soon as you do, you will continually be disappointed.

It feels unfinished outside of the main story. There's content there, but it gets repetitive really quickly. There are tons of opportunities to buy new vehicles, and do more side gigs. But half of the time spent playing the game outside of the main story arc is spent searching through articles and forum posts about how to get an event to trigger that you missed, or to hack your way around an issue here or there. Mission events that are totally out of your control like waiting for a phone call just don't happen. And the worst part is, yes, you can get it to work. You can *technically* play everything that exists in the game in its current state. But eventually the workarounds will become too cumbersome. You'll let it sit on your recently played list for a while, until the next sale, when you can replace it with something better.

I'm just here to tell you that when this time inevitably comes, it's okay to let it go. You had a great run, but there's no shame in uninstalling. Just be sure to remember all of the good times that you had together.","Very Positive82% of the 631,524 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

[i]I am writing this review on November 22nd, 2021 after the 1.31 patch[/i]

This game didn't have a good start, did it? But for the biggest part, it's all fixed now. 
There are still some bugs, but in most cases they are just visual.
To be honest they are quite ridiculously funny. Imagine driving alongside a character and then you witness the character start spinning to 360 degrees its limbs around like it was possessed by some demon.
In a way CP2077 became family for me, you know? You somewhat hate some of your relatives but you still love them in another way, right? Well that's CP2077 for me.
[i]What do we know? CP2077 is just too ahead of it's time, in the future when we will have implants real life, the entire world will be buggy and glitchy. This game is just immersive![/i]


It took me some few good hours to learn to love the game, and i would say, i am very happy i didn't give up on it.

[b]For the sake of not wasting much of your time with this review i will start with the bad[/b]

As i said above, as far as bugs go, it's pretty stable and i didn't really encounter anything that was major.
Obviously, people are different so this is purely my opinion, but i don't like how the car driving feels in this game, it feels too.. stiff and unnatural, it might be just me because i am used to old-school car driving, let's say GTA 3/NFS (anything before NFS 5 - Porsche). 
Driving a bike on the other hand is amazing, it's what i use most of the times.

- Another thing that is somewhat annoying, the waypointing system is somewhat bad, the routes you get aren't the most efficient ones, and often your objective isn't appearing on the 'floor' it really is, so you end up searching for something and then realize it might be in some hidden basement or something.
- The UI seems to be a bit cluttered and confusing and it takes a bit to get used to, or maybe i am just getting old, but i feel like there's no point in over-complicating things.
- The overall mechanics or however you want to call them feel somewhat mediocre, but it's fine by me, the game compensates with other stuff.
- You cannot edit your facial/body features/tattoos. Once you press that goddamn button. That's how you'll be stuck for life. 

One more thing, and this probably was my biggest 'oof' about the game was that the assault rifles are pretty awful.
Pistols? Good! Revolvers? Great! Sniper Rifles and Melee Weapons? Amazing!, but the assault rifles are just bad and inefficient. Even shotguns are decent. 

[b]But what about the good parts?[/b]

While this section might have less of these bulletpoints, they're the pillar of this game, the ultimate moneyshot.

The world is so big you will feel like frog in the Ural mountains, you will feel so small.It's quite an interesting feeling that i could never get from any game before, for me this thing made the game so much more immersive.
It's a beautiful game with purely astonishing views, amazing world details and such, but the size of it all, too. 
So many streets, alleys, not to mention if you go climbing like a goat on all the buildings.  
In my opinion, if you're into walking simulators, this alone could be worth your eddies (i.e. money).

The story is more than decent, it avoids some of the most boring cliches, although, it's not anything mindblowing.
Friendships and relationships come and go in odd ways, depending on how you make your decisions, i think it's pretty rare to actually feel like your decisions really affect people in games. To feel like you're actually influence someone real.
Often when i had to make decisions i was encountering dillemas such as 'Hm, c'mon, this dude is a decent fella, i shouldn't be a dick to him', and well, i usually don't overthink that kind of stuff in a game, lol.

The game is a modder's paradise if you're into that, the internet is full of tutorials and content, they aren't very finicky to install, however, updates usually tend to mess with them.

Did i mention side gigs? There's plenty of them, but also random events happening around as you walk, such as groups of gang members commiting dumb stuff. Obviously you can go past them, but would you? After this game will suck you in, you won't be able to stop sinking hours in it.
While we're on this subject, my advice would be to not rush into the story (I kinda did and i am not very happy about it), and enjoy some of these side stuff first, besides leveling up and getting cool stuff which will aid you in the main missions later, it's also the best way to get to know the game.

There's so many references and easter eggs, some subtle, some not so subtle, especially if you're from Eastern Europe.

You can play the game any way you want. You can go the boring route, non-lethal and stealthy, or you can go in guns blazing, and not leave one single cell in an enemy's body alive. Of course, a combination between all of these options is also a possibility, but i like to keep it simple.
I do wish it was more fun to play in stealth. While i usually am not the stealthy kind of gamer, i can and do appreciate a game with good stealth. CP2077 doesn't have a good nor bad stealth, it's just.. average, i guess?
(With this, i mean purely by how it feels for me to play it in stealth. You do get to be very creative in stealth, you have interesting ways to mess with the enemies and distract them, but the 'satisfaction' just isn't there for me)

Ultimately, it's a game that will suck you in, you will have fun for hours, the world is purely amazing, you'll feel like 'Woah' all the time. 

[b]Closing notes and random useless blabbering[/b]

I initially bought this game on pre-order, i was angry about the delays, before i got the chance to play it at the release, my PC died. Now after 1 year i finally get to play it (I know it's better that i didn't play it at launch, but it's about the principle).
I am happy with my purchase, and for the price i paid (one night out in the city [spoiler]I might have an alcohol problem though[/spoiler]), i had and still have a lot of fun, even if i already saw 2 endings, i am not letting my grip of it, i don't even remember when i was so caught in a game that i played it without a break until the sun was rising.
Probably i will go for full completion. 60h in this game passed so fast, and there's still plenty of juice in this baby.

As far as the developers go... I know they got a lot of poo thrown at them, but they're people and they make mistakes, and they weren't lazy. I would say things went wrong because of the team leading/resource management, but that's another subject and quite irrelevant. 
Point is.. their hearts are in the right place, and they fixed a majority of issues, and they still are working on the game.
Maybe i am being too soft about the situation, but it is what it is, i can't say i am not disappointed because it's not how i expected the game to be after how it was marketed pre-release, but i also like to believe i have some common sense and ability to make the best out of situations.

Edit:
After putting around 150h in this game, i must say, there were few more bugs i encountered, but nothing major, except, i once fell through the map and the game reloaded from the last checkpoint.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"*Spoiler free*

At the time of writing this review, i've done a 100% corpo playthrough on very hard as well as a melee run on normal sprinting thru to obtain the secret ending.

I experienced minimal graphical bugs while playing. I did not experience any bugs that disrupted my game experience any more than having to reload my game and one instance i will mention below.

Pros:

True evolution of the bread crumb story system. Those familiar with the concept of save scumming will be happy to know that an extra 20-30 hours or multiple unique playthroughs can be squeezed out just by simply trying all of the text options or trying a different combat approach. Different combat and pacifist approaches can lead to entire new quest chains or missed opportunities. Without going into too much detail, multiple friends and I have had majorly different outcomes playing the same class in the same style/build as well as found tertiary outcomes in subsequent playthroughs. Can't stress how good this aspect is enough.

Side content for days. While the main story itself is only 15-20 hours, the side content is easily double if not triple that. Between cyberpsychos/gigs/police/side kick story quests/flavor text quests it can actually be quite overwhelming when you begin the game. For the full experience I highly recommend completing all of the sidekick story quests as they give the opportunity to experience the most endings as well as inject the most girth into the primary story. Easily the highlight of the game. This is obvious when comparing my two playthroughs, in the 100% one I had a complete feeling of understanding. the directions things were going were carried by these side quests, all of the motivations and history are there. In my rushed playthrough, it simply felt like a series of conversations with johnny silverhand and taking turns swapping bodies. completely different experiences. I just felt like I was rushing around doing errands for johnny by pushing only the main story.

Night City. It's the best city video games have blessed us with to date. Yes, despite the ""crowd AI'' not being amazing. Yes, despite there not being ""1k+ routines."" Yes, I played RDR2 and GTAV and yada yada yada. Night City is alive and you can hear it breathing. This is amplified 10x when you acquire the double jump or rocket jump legs. The verticality they promised was delivered in spades. EVERYTHING is climbable. Give it a shot. Look around.

Endings. 6 of them bitches. SIX. 1 is hilarious (in a morbid way). 1 was the appropriate ending(IMO). 1 was out of a shitty AAA blockbuster movie. 1 is what gamers want. 1 is trippy. 1 is sad.

Make a save at the point of no return and give em all a shot. They're worth it.

Cons:

Loot. If you played Witcher 3, it's the same song and dance. Massive amounts of useless scaled loot where everywhere you look you see slight 1% dps upgrades to already existing items. Add onto that you have a weight/stash system and it just becomes a chore by the end game. If you are a packrat like me, invest into the body perk for 60 extra carrying capacity for peace of mind. The exception to this con are the ""iconic weapons'' that are unlocked after completing certain criteria. Unique and useful, I found ""skippy"" to be the best weapon in the entire game. Look out for him and the other icons :)

Lifepaths. Thankfully on my first playthrough I chose corpo. I feel like I had ample chat options that really fell into line with the core story path and made me feel initially that lifepaths weren't as bad as people made them out to be. After experiencing nomad and corpo both to completion I can say that this section really does feel unfinished. There needs to be more content before coming into night city as a nomad and building up the relationship with jackie in the prologue. Again, rushed. Sad. One of my most anticipated features.

AI. This is as of the day 1 version of the game. The combat AI is.....bad. It is only saved by the fact that you can use guns and snipe people from the shadows from a distance. After having played a full melee and ranged playthrough, melee is in a rough spot. Don't take this to mean that melee is more difficult, it simply means that the AI is so bad that they clump up and spin in circles or glitch through walls to 1 shot you with a shotgun and you will end up getting gangbanged every time. Cop AI is....missing. If you commit a crime and get 4 stars just let them kill you or drive away far enough, they will simply give up. There are no correction routines for driving AI. Simply park your car on the road to create an infinite traffic jam.No crash reactions. No crash animations. You can hit a wall at 200 mph and be fine. They make no attempts to course correct or avoid collision, same with the crowd AI. If you double jump in public people will just...huddle near you..scared for their life? Again, AI feels missing.

Limited romance options. For all the controversy and hype this topic got it ended up so god damn bland. I know its a weird thing to complain about but I can walk around and see vulgarity at every corner and you're telling me theres no brain dance station to plug into?  there's 1 brothel in all of night city? only 2 joytoys? Again I understand how minor this is. Just confusing. Most of the primary romance options in this game only ""swing"" one way, based on the ""gender"" you chose at the beginning of the game. So if you went in with ideas of who you wanted to fuck, you may be very dissapointed (if you care at all.)

Braindance sequences in the primary story. Thought they were too specific with requiring you to wait for chat dialogue to finish. rewind/fast forward is too slow and not snappy to your inputs. you can end up just looking around aimlessly looking for 1 piece to scan at a specific timestamp. Not very interesting overall and I believe they could have been better served as a cutscene. Overall boring.
I had one graphical bug that came at a very unfortunate moment during the prologue. A pistol went thru a key members head during a pivotal scene and really ruined the mood. This was the only instance of immersion breaking i experienced from bugs other than typical day 1 shenanigans.

No Mini-games. Not even gwent? cmon.

Conclusion:

Without going into story specific details, this is one of the most enjoyable RPGs i've played in my life. The amount of variables you have to play with in the beautiful world of night city is actually crazy. When I read reviewers saying that they hated johnny silverhand because he was an asshole or that they didnt really understand the story and that it all felt rushed, I feel bad. Or I read on reddit that the game was too buggy to enjoy and there were too many dropped/cut features to be a ""good game"", I feel bad. We played different games. I got an 80-100 hour open world RPG set in a cyberpunk universe with characters that had personality, a story that had me wondering about the possibilities so much that I immediately started a second playthrough. A city that was handcrafted top to bottom with views so nice I was constantly snapshotting and posting them on discord. A soundtrack that had me wanting to sit in cars to finish tracks. I got a game that I am disappointed having finished.

Waitin to slurp up that DLC.


Overall Rating:

My Gut says 6 months from now or whenever the first DLC drops this game will be a 9.2-9.5. In  its current state I would give it an 8.7-8.9 ish. 10s dont exist.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Everyone complained about the bugs and glitches but the real problems are that the game's systems are terribly outdated. People were promised a next-gen experience. I've played games from a decade ago that have better open worlds then this. 

- Police appear out of nowhere.
- Police are amazingly easy to escape. You can walk a block away and lose them.
- Civilian NPC's appear and disappear when you're not looking.
- The A.I. is alot my artificial then intelligent. The only reaction they ever have is to duck or completely disappear in thin air. 
- The A.I. is basically on rails; they will not drive or walk around anything you put in front of them, they'll just stop and sit there for eternity.
- The world doesn't actually feel alive (no random encounters). NPC enemies spawn in the exact same place every single time without fail.
- Bars and food are exactly the same vendor with a different coat of paint. No matter where you go you can't sit down and eat something, or sit and enjoy a virtual drink (unless it's a talking-scene tied to a quest).
- You can't interact with shop keepers beyond buying something or receiving maybe two lines of chit-chat. You can't rob them. You can't kill them. You can't get quests from them. They won't even react if you lob a grenade at them.
- The ""car chases"" are on rails and there's only 3-4 prescripted car chases in the game.
- Only 2% of ""choices"" your character makes in dialogue has any effect on the story. The rest are just alternate dialogue to give the appearance of choice and replayability. 
- Character starting paths (Street kid, Nomad, Corpo) have little to no affect beyond the first 20 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changes.
- Player characters have no reflection unless you use the specific mirror located in your apartment. 
- You can't alter the look of your character after the initial character creation. Not even a haircut.
- Can't customize your apartment in any way, shape, or form.
- There's almost no reason to ever go back to your apartment after being there the first time.
- Vehicles can't be customized; no new paints, liveries, or body-pieces.
- There are 4 mini-games total: Hacking, shooting-range, boxing, and car racing. There are only two shooting-range quests, only 6 boxing matches, and only 4 races. That's it as far as mini-games go.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"Listen up Choom,

I don't want to cause static, but did those gonk corpos push the release of the game before it was ready? Yeah, probably. Did they want our scratch? Yeah, definitely. Did they flatline the game? Almost. If it wasn't for the love and dedication of the developers of CD PROJEKT RED (and yeah, they might be corpos), then the vidiot would definitely be zeroed.

There were a lot of kickers who had issues upon release that stirred up a lot of heat. And yeah, there were some issues, but when you can just hide behind a handle and spam away on the net without a care in the world, the complaints stacked up and didn't give the vidiot its due justice. When you want to create the best, there is some gonks out there who will tear you down.

Sure, there were a few netrunners too who threatened the corpos, but little good that did them. Didn't slow down the developers. They kept pouring time and energy into the game. Fixin' it up and making it flash.

The developers broke their corpo leash and kept giving to us. Listening to the us chooms instead of those NetNerds who squat their mom's basements. That is why I nominated Cyberpunk 2077 for the Labor of Love in the 2022 Steam Awards. The developers care. A lot. And they continue to prove it by releasing new content, fixes, and polishin' the vidiot like a diamond.

Bottom line choom; when you need that escape from deep reality, you can get your fix with Cyberpunk 2077. 

Is it worth the eddies? You betcha it is.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.

There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. 

More tips:
-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. 
-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. 
-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. 
-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. 
-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. 
-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.
-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"[b]24/02/2019 - My review is entirely obsolete due to them removing the starter edition.  They've also changed the prices of the operators, making them more cheaper so hooray![/b]

[h1][b]This is for the people who brought the starter edition... [spoiler]like me.[/spoiler][/b][/h1]

If you brought the starter edition, your best option would be to pick 10 operators since base game operators cost 12,500 renown each.  So 5 operators each for attacking and defending and the 10 that I'm about to list are possibly your best bet to having the best experience in Rainbow Six Siege.

[h1][u]For the attacking team[/u][/h1] 
[list]
[*][b]Sledge[/b] - If you are absolutely new to the game and you don't know where to start, Sledge is one of the best options to choose from. He isn't a hard operator to play with (Considering his name, you should know why...) and the team doesn't rely too heavily on his gadget.  
[*][b]Thermite[/b] - One of the best operators in the game because of how good his rifle is with low recoil and high damage.  His gadget is also one of the most useful in the game especially for creating a [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/oB-9j98APlM?t=1m8s]BIG FUCKING HOLE[/url][/spoiler] on reinforced walls.  Though, to create that hole, you have to make sure you stay alive, the team relies heavily on him to get into the objective but if it's jammed or electrified...
[*][b]Thatcher[/b] -  Thatcher is your main man.  One of the biggest problems you'll face as a Thermite are Mute's and Bandit's gadgets which jam or electrify reinforced walls.  With Thatcher, all you have to do is throw your EMP grenades and no more [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/NPucxmxW5eM]FOOKIN' LASER SIGHTS.[/url][/spoiler]
[*][b]Ash[/b] - She's one of the fastest operators in the game and literally has no hitbox.  Her gadget is breaching things from afar, pretty much a breaching grenade laucher which sticks into any surface.  Just remember that you'll be called a sweaty try hard from time to time...
[*][b]Twitch[/b] - Now this may be a controversial pick since her drone is about to get nerf'd but her rifle is what keeps her on this list.  Her ability isn't that special, basically a drone that can't jump but can shock people and destroy their gadgets.  However, her F2, a variant of the Famas, shoots around 980 RPM and it's possibly one of the most deadliest assault rifles in the game.[/list]

[h1][u]And now, for the defending team[/u][/h1]

[*][url=https://youtu.be/F-6ZkbVpTcU][b]Rook[/b][/url] - He's one of the easiest operators to play and helps the team just by dropping a pack of armor.  That's all you have to do and you get to survive one extra bullet and will mostly be put in the DBNO stage instead of death.  The only thing you have to remember is to make sure you drop armor in the beginning of the round which a lot of people forget...
[*][b]Bandit[/b] - Bandit's gadget is pretty simple to use as long as you use it on reinforced walls since his gadget is the only one that can destroy Thermite and Hibana's charges on contact.  Also, his MP7 is known as a god tier gun, being incredibly easy to use.  [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/hkLUOuE_-5I]Did I also mention he had to deal [b]DRUGS?[/b][/url][/spoiler]
[*][b]Jager[/b] - Aka the ultra sweaty try hard main.   To be honest though, there is a good reason why people main this guy and that's because of how good he is.  His gagdet may not be that useful at times, having the ability to destroy any type of throwable but I like to call it wishful thinking.  Another thing to help him is that he's currently the only defender with an assault rifle so he gets to do more damage than most defenders which only carry SMGs.  
[*][b]Smoke[/b] - He's simple but somewhat hard to use.  See an enemy trying to get in?  Block him out with gas.  That's why he's called Smoke.  He excels during the last few seconds of a round when enemies are desperately rushing in.  [spoiler][b][url=https://youtu.be/8MHk0WwrzgY]WHAT'S IN THE CANISTER?[/url][/b][/spoiler]
[*][b]Mute[/b] - He almost works in the same way as Bandit but his gadget has a radius meaning he can block off a Thermite's breaching charges on two walls.  He also has the ability to place his jammers anywhere where as Bandit can only place his on shields, barbed wire, and reinforced walls.  He is one of the harder operators to play if you don't use him correctly so I'd recommend learning him soon.  [/list]

[h1][u]Honorable Mentions[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Hibana[/b] - She's an attacker who serves as an alternative to Thermite.  Her gadget is a mix between Ash and Thermite, being able to shoot out 6 pellets and burn through reinforced walls.  She's a flexible operator and her ability can be amazing at times.  She's a DLC character so she will cost 25,000 renown.  [/list]

[h1]So do I recommend the game?[/h1]

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Oh, where to begin?
Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike.
So...

What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on.
Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.

When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.

Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years. 

The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.

When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. 
So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?

First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating.
This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.

There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones.
Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled.
The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.

Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. 
Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.

I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has.
Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows. 

Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.

I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:

The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else. 

To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal. 

Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.

If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.

That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.

I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.

Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.

It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.

The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.

This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.

So that was a shitload of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.","Very Positive86% of the 1,043,127 user reviews for this game are positive.",starter edition mentioned temporary no_longer exists approval stand 30 sale price mean payng operator front hour inform clarify matter preface saying last multiplayer titanfall causing affected interested loss player abandoned server starter edition smart implementation ubisoft fresh blood onto server cost entry previously high clear no_difference starter player regular player besides take unlock operator class starter player server else map unlockable operator available else explain starter briefly explain rather generously dole map operator included patch operator paid ubibucks desired make season pas practically useless launch offered minor privilege early map operator access six privilege mean base segmented no_map operator acquire purchasing season pas dlc starter edition randomly assigns attacker operator defender along ubibucks purchase 2 additional operator choosing 4 disposal earns renown fake currency purchase operator weapon skin cosmetic starter player require 12 000 renown purchase operator regular player 2 000 ubisoft call grinding reach 12 000 multiplayer intrinsically fun grinding reach reward fun progression unlocks big player day lack thing progress towards cited reason stopped titanfall thing unlock glad operator 9 10 hour mainlined buying starter edition earned renown purchase sale 7 500 thousand left grinding offset daily challenge offer extra renown operator sale rotation week operator awhile truly learn due nature thing balanced operator simply playstyle opposed signifigant advantage opponent close mastering 4 starting operator earned renown unlock bought couple clarifying wanted glance looked evolution c waited year harshness indie nature insurgency far hard justify 60 purchase c 15 regularly go sale ubisoft leveled field starter edition finally accessible address issue price multiplayer argument issue par year ut 2k4 quake 3 arena especially map continued refinement provided freely patch campaign addition high budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter commonly attached modern shooter excellent balancing clash style failing teach meat teaching exactly single 10 situation feature different operator showcase different skill gadget importantly pacing nature jumping siege multiplayer option co overpowered terrorist hunt lone wolf five wish multiplayer playable bot add future already deadly bot single possibility definitely trained multiplayer shooter especially experienced else market play siege slow spent prone sprint sparingly lean left button essential leaning corner die extremely fast 1 3 connecting bullet kill enemy habit reloading fire abandoned reload speed relatively slow bullet left clip kill 1 2 leaving vulnerable reloading slow pace time cause white knuckle tension matched thrilling rappel side building toss grenade window couple kill notice shrapnel left hole wooden wall score sneaky kill loss tense cause slamming fist tension make victory wild rush cheer loud siege action shooter chess s_emphasizedimple learn understand lifetime truly master high 10 expert high skill ceiling operator deploying blocking deployment angle map burned memory dynamic option not_be prior multiplayer love lightning fast giant robot happen port port excellent offering option pc player expect scale low high rig 2 unique aa solution exclusive temporal ghosting issue address sub pixel aliasing unique solution half resolution applies msaa frame lost pixel addressing jaggies built twitch streaming feature natively support xbox 360 1 controller dualshock 4 offering option deadzones sensitivity controller surprisingly viable basically understand pc gaming no_hobbled ps4 port deal uplay annoying guess client launch top notice it_emphasized crash multiple gb ram install adware computer family aid expecting based heard simply open launch need closed close minor annoyance worst shitload word sound gushing exceeded high expectation 15 entry possible wanted spread word fence explain wait hour

Ich spiele schon seit längerer Zeit dieses Spiel und kann nun eine bessere Review schreiben, als zuvor.

Ich würde dieses Spiel jedem weiter empfehlen der auf Team Ego Shooter steht , da es in diesem Spiel sehr das Teamplay gefragt ist...

Die Runden dauern nicht als zu lange und wenn man keine Lust auf Ranked hat kann man gechillt Casual spielen.

Ubisoft versucht wirklich das Spiel am Leben zu halten und setzen dies auch gut in die Tat um

Das Spiel reizt einfach es gibt immer neue Spieler man möchte jede Season beweißen was man drauf hat 

von mir ein dickes + für Rainbow Six Siege



and btw : THE FUTRE belong to R6S !

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"[h1][Description][/h1]
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.
 
[h1][Pros][/h1]
+ Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets.
+ No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release.
+ Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far
+ Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior.
+ Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher.
+ A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency.
+ You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players.
+ Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits.
+ Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together.
+ Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones.
+ Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.

[h1][Cons][/h1]
- Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future)
- Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity.
- Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode.
- Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.
 
[h1][Conclusion][/h1]
While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!

I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.

Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018

===================================================

Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.

People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them. 

CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)

Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).

=====================================

Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.

Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.

Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.

Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.

Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.

Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions. 

Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!

============================

I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!

Update on January 3rd:

Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:

We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016. 

We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.

Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/) 

Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.

Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.

Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.

Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.

That's it for the January 2018!

============================

I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.

You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.

Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.

The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.

Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level.
Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned.
Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).


It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"8/10 Rainbow six siege is a damn fine shooter 

BUT that doesn't mean its perfect so im gonna explain whats good & whats not 

-whats good? 

Most of the time shooting in this game seems very fun and balanced unless its a relatively new operator that was just added (more on that topic soon) 

the game rewards map familiarity, some maps can have destructible floors, walls and ceilings which makes it highly rewarding to go into custom games and learn them on your own.....speaking of which 

custom games! this is such a blessing to have if you really want to take your skills to the next level, also it may help you study any new dlc maps so you can at least know what you're about to get yourself into this season 

Free dlc!!!! finally a decent shooter that doesn't seem like all the devs want is money. yes there is cosmetics in game but nothing like ""pay to win"" but most members of the siege community may disagree with me due in part with the events that happen usually half way through the season (there are 4 season through the year, so you get 8 new ops per year and usually a new map and possibly a new rework on older maps to make them ""better"") each event is different than the last one minute you are carebears shooting each other the next you are rootin tootin shootin cowboys (at least from what the data miners have found) but they have loot boxes that you must buy at least 50 dollars of if you want All the cosmetic for the event in question 

this game heavily requires communication and strategy. Every single operator on the rainbow six team differs from the others, one places bear traps that downs enemies, another has a infra-red sniper scope that can pierce through thick smoke and highlights enemies making it much easier to get distance kills but with that there is weaknesses. the bear traps can be shot to be destroyed and are fairly easy to spot due to how massive they are. the sniper glaz is a powerhouse but when you take a slow sniper against smgs that can shoot faster than you can make a bowl of popcorn, you need to make sure you keep a distance and use recoil against them but also make every shot count one miss could mean it all. 

there is an operator for everyone.
you like being slow and able to take some damage? we have that. you can play as fuze who releases a cluster bomb of grenades in a small area that can pinch off the enemy team if placed right. or as doc who heals your team with stimulant shots. 

you like being faster than god itself? play ash shes a fast operator that rewards the run and gun style plus her ""gadget"" is a grenade launcher that allows you to blow away any soft walls that lay in your wake. or as bandit whos able to place car batteries on barbed wire making them electrocute anything that may cross as well as add electricity to any reinforced walls. 

or how about a nice mix? you have twitch who can take her drone around and remove enemy's gadgets, cameras and can even inflict damage on the enemy team. or you may play as frost (the bear trap operator). 

there is pve as well but its very lacking but it does exist 

the devs are also very quick to fix MAJOR bugs in game.

but my favorite thing about this game is the content creators, they all are very fun loving guys and gals and they help support this amazing community. 

-whats bad? 

there is moments when ranked play can just feel like udder crap, toxicity is very common in this game most time its just bland dry sarcasm or humor that can be taken the wrong way. 

new operators are kinda always broke when they first release but are usually fixed not too long later but other times its too long 

this game has a high learning curve 

headshots are instakills! sometimes it will feel unfair because you will turn a corner and get domed seemingly out of nowhere. so get that aim up dude. 

this game has frequent updates to fix a bug or issue but sometimes that just creates more bugs

236390,War Thunder,"I didn't want to leave a negative review, but Gaijin's blatant contempt for their own players has forced my hand.

War Thunder is a game like no other, with a comprehensive damage system, combined arms, and variety of beautifully modeled tanks, aircraft and ships. 

Unfortunately, this ""uniqueness"" has left Gaijin with little real competition over the years. What started off as a ""free to play"" title has over time become less and less free. Gaijin keeps adding nations and vehicles, while at the same time increasing repair costs and lowering RP/SL gain. A premium account isn't enough to comfortably progress anymore, now you also have to buy premium vehicles in every nation.

For the new players reading this, Gaijin has recently admitted that they balance free vehicles around a negative SL income for average players. That means they WANT you to lose money by playing, so you'll be forced to buy a top tier premium vehicle.

This isn't just greedy, it also destroys the matchmaker and the balance of the game. Since you only profit using premium vehicles they often end up being spammed. In battlerating 8.7, more than half the players on each team are in premium tanks. This results in rampant ""one death leaving"". These players only spawn their premium tank and leave when it's destroyed, leaving their team in a bad position. Sometimes the premium is their only tank for the tier, othertimes it's because ""free"" tanks aren't worth the high cost to repair.

Gaijin and their purposefully frustrating economy is ultimately to blame for this. There's so many other issues and scandals I could bring up, like how you can't repair or extinguish flames on your new tank before unlocking ""parts"" and ""FPE"". Gaijin wants you to pay gold to skip the grind for these essential tools.

In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. That might seem hypocritical considering my hours spent in this game, but believe me. It's new players who suffer the most. Gaijin doesn't care about me, you, or the playerbase. Don't make the same mistake as me. Find another game that values your input, and respects your time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit, July 26: 

Much has happened since May and the publishing of this review.

Most importantly, on 13th of June, Gaijin published a roadmap of planned economy changes. 

Most recent roadmap update as of this edit: https://warthunder.com/en/news/8374-roadmap-following-the-roadmap-battle-pass-available-in-simulator-battles-en

This was an unprecedented event, as we have never seen this much transparency from the Devs before.

Despite tempered expecations and a healthy dose of skepticism on the part of myself and many others, the roadmap is actually progressing according to schedule.

One of the key criticisms in my review, that of SL (Silver Lions) has been (largely) adressed, earnings were increased across the board, and repair costs adjusted.

All ground vehicles now have a basic version of Parts and FPE available from the start without needing to unlock the Parts and FPE modifications: basic parts can repair components to partial functionality, while basic FPE is single-use.

Aircraft with countermeasures now start with a basic flare loadout, while mixed / full countermeasure loadouts require unlocking the flare modification.

You no longer have to pay repair cost when teamkilled (finally), and newly purchased premium vehicles now include 15 free backups (extra spawns). 

Backups are a consumable however, and as such it doesn't fully alleviate the ""one death leaving"" issue, as players will quickly spend their 15 backups and continue this behavior after. Gaijin needs to consider making the backup permament.

I don't mean to diminish these changes, they were sorely needed, but there's still a long way to go.

As of today, no changes have been made to RP (Research Point) gain, which is the main cause for slow progression, especially in Ground Forces Mode.

The matchmaking system desperately needs a major overhaul, and battle ratings need to be decompressed. While matchmaking changes are mentioned in the roadmap, it remains to be seen how Gaijin chooses to handle this issue.

All in all, while the changes are positive so far and show a lot of promise going forward, my review will stay unchanged until the roadmap is concluded, and the full effects can be seen.

Lastly I want to thank you all so much for your attention and gracious awards! Thanks to you I have amassed just over 2.5 Million Steam Points! That's mind-boggling, I could've never anticipated this much engagement writing my little review back in May. I apologize for the late update, and let's hope for more good news.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

236390,War Thunder,"[h1] As someone with almost 1600 hours on this ""game"", don't waste your time on this game with a ridiculous grind. [/h1]


[h1] Basic explanation of the in game economy [/h1]
This ""game"", like many other free to play titles features an in game economy which includes a non premium ""Silver Lions"" and a premium (bought with real life money) ""Golden Eagles"" currency. These currencies are used to purchase in game vehicles and various other items, with the latter ""Golden Eagles"" currency used to by premium content which lets you speed up the grinding of new vehicles.

[b] While this all looks fine on paper, Gaijin, the creator of this ""game"", have been abusing economy for years now to milk as much money from its playerbase as possible. This is done by making the grind extremely difficult (especially at the stages with more modern vehicles) for players that have not spent any money on the ""game"". This difficulty then puts pressure on the free-to-play player base to spend money. [/b]

[h1] And its only been getting worse. [/h1]

Very recently, Gaijin has released a patch that changed the economy and balancing of the game. These changes have made it even more difficult by forcing players to grind more vehicles (a good portion of which are often not fun to use) to reach the ones they are interested in playing. Another cruel change is the increase of repair costs, which is an amount of ""Silver Lions"" you need to pay in order to repair your vehicles and use them again after dying in them. This increase in cost means players have to earn more ""Silver Lions"" from their battles on average in order to profit, making the grind even less sustainable for free-to-play players.

[h1] In fact, a staff member on the official WarThunder forum even stated that the grind was only designed to be profitable with premium vehicles/content. [/h1]


[h1] TLDR; The devs have, and will continue to ruin the game by being greedy and making as much money as possible off of the player base, do NOT play this garbage, it is NOT worth the time investment.

236390,War Thunder,"First, My playing hours are like x2 because I also played a lot of houres outside steam.
I am a rank 100 and play all the factions.  I also have been a very good customer of gaijin as I have bought a lot in their store over the years. And since I have invested so much time and money in it, I would like to give a positive review. But unfortunately I decided not to do that....  And also have decided to uninstall this game. At a given moment you are just done and all the trust is gone.

It is a beautiful game but Devs are just the big problem. They prefer to make new content instead of fixing old problems.
After so many years I have lost all confidence in them. They almost never listen to criticism from their fans and always think they know better. They forget that the fans want to improve the game with their criticism, but are often treated as Gaijin's enemy.

There are so many problems that it is too long for a review but here is a list with the most important:

1. BR compression. Each vehicle has a battlerating like (1.0 1.3 1.7 2.0 ect). A battlerating is an indication of how good a vehicle is and what it can encounter. The maximum battlerating in a match can be +1 higher to -1 lower than your own vehicle. Which means that you can sit between the highest BR and the lowest BR (uptier and downtier).
Now the vehicles are too close together in terms of BR, so compression. Which means that some vehicles dominate heavily and some do not have a chance at all when they come  against each other in a match. Gaijin does not want to solve this problem because they want everyone to find a match quickly. (this is my biggest problem with this game)

2. Gaijin censorship, Gaijin does not like criticism. Post on their form that are critical and viewed by enough players just disappear. Gaijin denies, for example, that it was possible to cheat in their game. When a youtuber proved that it was possible. Gaijin wanted to copyright strike against this person or put the Realistich game mode to Arcade. As a kind of punishment for the player or something. I have no idea why.... Gaijin behaved rather childish.

3. Reporting a bug. During the years I reported all the bug that I found to gaijin. I have send replays and information. From 1000kg bombs that do no damage, tanks shot that disappeared in the air, to planes that were shot in 1/2 and keeps flying smoothly. I have seen everything over the years. Fortunately, there are never many bugs.... so that is good.
But I have never received any answers from Gaijin. The only thing that is done is that your report gets closed, completely ignored or can no longer be found (disappears). It looks more like Gaijin sees you as a burden instead of help.


There are many other problems in this game such as your tank shots that are absorbed into the Optics of the opponents tanks and do no damage or pay to win tanks like the is-6. 

But i have to stop to keep the review a little short, I close it here. 
Warthunder ""can""  become a much better game than it is now. There are too few players online to earn money so gaijin wants to pull as much money as they can from the remaining players as possible instead of recognizing problems and solving them.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

236390,War Thunder,"Okay listen.

I've got 2,222 hours in this game while I'm writing this. I get that it's confusing that I'm making a negative review.

Tl;dr: This is a good game, but one of the worst, most scummy products I've ever seen. One that preys on people with addictive personalities in a wide spectrum of ways.

All I really need to do is explain the monetization tbh:

-Silver Lions: Silver lions are the non-premium currency for War Thunder. They are achieved passively just by played, and playing well gives a nice bonus. Winning matches massively multiplies silver lion gains (ie, if you kill 1 person in a match you lose in the planes mode you'll get a small amount of silver lions, but even just one kill in a match you win is worth a fair amount, and to a degree this gets better the better you play). But here's the... well... ""but"". Silver lions are precisely designed so that when you first start playing the game, no matter what (ie, whether you are completely free to play, just have a premium vehicle, or have premium vehicles and a premium account) you will be getting enough silver lions to more than cover the silver lion costs of the vehicles you will have access too. Low tier vehicles cost basically nothing to repair, as do almost all premiums (and premium accounts and vehicles both massively boost silver lion income while using them). You might be seeing the problem already, but if not stick with me here. As you progress through the game, if you're free to play you will at first quickly unlock cheap vehicles before reaching more expensive ones, then things will be slower and slower to unlock and more expensive. To be clear, all of this so far isn't a big deal. The issue comes when you reach about 7.0 (battle rating, which is basically just a ""level"" for matchmaking balance) for ground forces or about 8.0 for air forces, in my experience. At this point vehicles are sluggish to unlock and extremely expensive. Buying them, training a crew slot to play them, and every modification all costs SL, but also repairing and rearming the aircraft after the battle. At the lower tiers you might not even notice this. By about 6.0 you'll almost certainly notice this but unless you play very poorly it won't be a major issue. You might have to take it easy right after buying a newly unlocked vehicle, but other than that you're fine. But beyond that, certain vehicles (seemingly arbitrarily, though there's always a long winded explanation that boils down to ""balance"") cost bafflingly, ridiculously, hilariously high amounts of silver lions. If you have about 2-3 million silver lions at lower tiers, you're golden. You can lose some of it if you have some rough matches, but you'll be fine. At the higher tiers, you could burn through that in a day just by being unlucky. Half the time you unlock a new jet or main battle tank it's so expensive you either can't buy it, or can but then can't play it because if you die before getting a kill you lose massive amounts. 

So the question is... why? Why is there vehicles in the game that you are punished for playing? Why is the game designed in such a way that you can progress by grinding for hundreds of hours only to be rewarded by being literally unable to play if you have some rough matches? Well, it sorta brings us to the next monetization, but basically, you can buy Silver lions for real money. If you run out you can pay for more. Now full transparency, this isn't technically pay-to-play. It's more like ""pay-to-easily-play-high-tier"". You're not locked out of playing the game, but if you really want to play high tier modern stuff and don't have silver lions, you're out of luck unless you have amazing matches. Certain vehicles, like the B-29/Tu-4 long range bomber have such a high repair cost, and such a low survival rate that they are essentially useless. Gaijin balances almost exclusively through SL costs. It's awful.

So, next up is Golden Eagles. This is the premium currency. This is nothing new, every F2P game has them pretty much. It's not something I would review a game as negative for normally but Golden Eagles are a small piece of the puzzle. They can be used to buy the majority of the premium vehicles in the game, as well as silver lions, premium account time, decals, decorations, ect. Premium vehicles are often unbalanced on launch but get balanced overtime. I don't know if this is intentional or not but after the IS-6 dominated for over a year Gaijin has toned this down a lot. Still, some are better than others. They're objectively not pay to win, but they are clearly pay to progress. The biggest issue is that new players can pay about the price of a full AAA game for a high-tier vehicle without learning how to use it. The game is loosely designed in such a way so that as you progress you learn the skills you need to progress. It's not super linear but it naturally happens fairly well. But if you can just buy the highest tier stuff with no limitations then you skip the grind, yes, but you also skip the learning. This leads to a lot of very inexperienced players at high tier, who often teamkill, ram, block, capture-point steal, and otherwise ruin the game for what should be the most dedicated part of the playerbase. To be clear I'm not strictly against this but there's already so little incentive for team-play in this game that new players with high tier premiums are never actually gonna put in the time to learn how to play like experienced players do. Again, fine, but it's two clashing playstyles that shouldn't ever really meet. Jets and main battle tanks should, in theory, have the most depth and highest skill ceiling in the game but through a mix of map design, mechanics and this aforementioned premium issue, they actually have the least depth aside from the very lowest tiers, and devolve into head-on ramming and head on charges.

Premium accounts. Not much to say here. Again, normal for F2P games, but on top of everything above, and everything below, it's a lot. They basically make it so you get more research and silver lions. You progress faster and run out of lions slower. It effects other players in no way, since even if you have a premium account, unless you buy a high tier premium, by the time you get to high tier you'll likely be fairly experienced.

Convertible Research. One of the scummiest. Basically you can pay Golden Eagles (real money) to speed up or skip the research of a vehicle. This one just purely prays on frustrated people not thinking clearly who are fed up with the grind. And this game is full to the brim with grind. It is literally endless grind. You will never achieve everything without paying huge sums of real money, but the game loves to tempt you with the fact it's technically possible (until they add the next thing, and they add new vehicles every update more or less). Never, ever ***EVER*** use convertible research unless you have some golden eagles laying around and a bit of research you don't feel like doing. Even then it makes more economic sense to just get premium (vehicles or account). This is a waste of money. Do not use your eagles on this. 

Gaijincoin and the War Thunder Market. Think of the CS:GO or Dota or TF2 marketplaces. It's just that. Turn your money into even faker money which you can't turn back into ""real"" money. There's skins and non-premium but exclusive vehicles on the marketplace. Almost all are event vehicles that required immense grind to get. A few of them are outright overpowered, like the KV-220, and thus go for hundreds and hundreds of dollars. A lot of the cheap skins on here are great though and a portion of the money goes to the artist so it's not the worst thing ever. You can get some of this stuff for free easily. Again, this isn't on its own that big of a deal, but keep in your mind that all of this is in *one* game.

There's also a battlepass (Like Dota, Overwatch, Smite ect.).

Basically: Every element of this game is designed to squeeze money out of you.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

236390,War Thunder,"[h1] The non-exhaustive list of scummy things Gaijin does purely for profit. [/h1]

Disclaimer: This is a list compiled by u/agysykedyke on Reddit. It aggregates and summarises the abhorrently antagonistic and hostile behaviour Gaijin has shown their community and players throughout the years. This is but a fraction of the malevolence characteristic of this company.

Addendum: My total hours played on Steam are not representative of how long I've spent in War Thunder. I've been playing this game since the beta and have played it on multiple platforms throughout the last ten years with much of it being played through Gaijin's own launcher. After having been disgusted and physically repulsed by Gaijin's treatment of their community over the last two years, I've decided that enough was enough. I have watched this game deteriorate and it is no longer the game that I once enjoyed and hoped would become a maverick of its genre. It exists only as a tragedy of what could have been.

[quote=agysykedyke] [i] In light of the new awful economy changes, I have compiled a list of all the scummy things Gaijin does which worsen the experience for all players, in the name of profit only. I really hope they change some of these things for the better. [/i]

[olist]
[*]Intentionally releasing new vehicles in an overpowered state in order to make people grind as quickly as they can to abuse them before the nerfs.

[*]Intentionally releasing overpowered premium vehicles and not nerfing them, in order to make people purchase them.

[*]The price of said premiums being equal to triple-A games. I don't know how it's excusable for some premiums to be $70 when they already sell premium accounts for $10 a month.

[*]Intentionally making SL modifiers low and repair costs high, so that the average player cannot break even in SL after a game. This encourages them to purchase a premium account or a premium vehicle. This also encourages players to leave after one death to minimize losses.

[*]Implementing research efficiency and tiers to make players buy more than one premium per nation in order to grind. Keep in mind each premium can cost up to $70.

[*]Forcing players to buy a vehicle previous to the one they want to buy, regardless if they ever want to use it. A lot of vehicles should be in a folder but are not, because Gaijin wants you to spend more SL.

[*]Forcing players to buy X vehicles from the previous tier before they can buy vehicles in the next tier. This increases the grind and forces you to buy vehicles that you might never have any intention of playing.

[*]Still making the SL and RP grind painfully slow even if you are using Premium vehicles and a Premium account, especially at the top tiers. Mind you you are paying $10/month + the price of 2-3 premiums per nation you want to grind and it's still very slow.

[*]Intentionally making stock vehicle performance extremely insufferable by locking away essential needs such as Spare Parts, FPE, NVD, usable ammo, and countermeasures. This is to make players purchase these modifications with GE.

[*]Introducing crew qualifications, which are arguably a pay-to-win feature. Aced crews provide significant advantages over basic. The SL cost for expert crews and the grind for Ace crews are not viable for the average player, people just purchase Ace crews.

[*]Putting players in debt over their own mistake after the January 2022 incident. They could have just let those players keep their 7 days of premium as a New Year's gift and take the good publicity but they doubled down. This was so bad that some players were going to take legal action because they felt as if they got scammed, and Gaijin was forced to remove the debt because of the insane backlash.

[*]Selling pay-to-win bush cosmetics, which otherwise are extremely hard to grind for, are unavailable for half the year, and you only get one random bush.

[*]Implementing an RP soft cap, which punishes skillful players because otherwise they would grind too quickly and won't be compelled to spend money.

[*]Introducing strike drones, to make the game more frustrating and to make people lose SL. If you get 2 kills and then die with your drone it will be less SL earned than the repair costs of what you killed due to the modifiers, a net negative overall.

[*]Intentionally making one nation overpowered, then making a different nation overpowered in order to make players purchase premiums to grind the new overpowered nation.

[*]Intentionally keeping the BR's compressed in order to make the game more random and frustrating, to limit skillful players, and make players more likely to spend GE on mods, crews or premiums.

[*]Intentionally making minor nations have underpowered vehicles with very high repair costs and low modifiers, because they are played by mostly experienced players who would otherwise grind too quickly.

[*]Making Boosters expire for no reason other than to take advantage of FOMO

[*]Slashing the economy time after time but disguising it as a net positive. For example, making the players ""choose"", but nerfing the economy either way and putting the blame on the players.

[*]Introducing extremely grindy events with vehicles that never return, or are sometimes OP, capitalizing on FOMO.

[*]Introducing lootbox-style crates bought for GE, or ridiculous amounts of SL, with very low chances of getting the reward you want. This is effectively gambling at worst and very predatory at best.

236390,War Thunder,"Oh how I wish i could call an arty strike on Gaijin's head office.

Let me list the most frustrating aspects of this game:
A bit of a lengthy review but if you are really interested in this game then you should at least skim this review to get an idea of what you're signing up for. Also the first serious review I've done of a game but I have been playing this for 4 years now and it's about time I told (warned) people about it.

The devs:
Has never listened to it's community's suggestions or bug reports. The closest we ever got was when everyone, including the largest Youtuber Phlydaily was pushing to have parts and fire extinguishers to come for free with every vehicle, instead of making it a module to research (or spend money on). So if you get shot in the transmission, yup you cant move the rest of the match, or get shot in the barrel? Yup, you are completely useless unless you can make it to a cap point which sometimes there is only 1. Guess what... they said ""no"" and have since never acknowledged community suggestions since then due to the horrible PR fallout. They balance the game based off players stats in that particular vehicle. Leaving some vehicles completely broken or overpowered for months while data comes in for them to actually do something about it. Easily the most frustrating of these cases was the fact that the battle rating spread is so compressed from power creep that they couldn't figure out what level to put the Maus at to make it competitive and balanced so they just removed it from the game. LOL yeah they barred new players from being able to research it cause they were too lazy to fix their game. They also will gladly make up stats or armor values about tanks to fit their view of what they think it should be capable of. 

The grind:
dear god the insane grind, if you don't get premium AND a high tier premium vehicle ($80 for a year of premium time and $40-$60 a piece for the vehicles, some of which are also broken - STRV 103-0 - to name one) then it will literally take you 6-12 months to grind out a single nation. So if you are strapped on time to dedicate to gaming, then just pick a nation and stick to it or you won't see anything past tier 3-4 (early world war 2 armored vehicles). It will easily take you a year or more to grind out the top tier jets/tanks of any nation.

New vehicles:
Anytime they add a new vehicle or whole nation, which is all the major updates contribute to the game, they generally make it overpowered so people will spend money on getting the ""op vehicles."" The other portion of new vehicles have some extremely frustrating broken/missing feature that they don't address for months and in most cases years after it being well known to the community. 

The maps:
Only 6/38 have protected spawn points, leaving you open to being sniped (sometimes from the enemy spawn) 15 seconds after spawning. There are countless ""unintended"" spots that completely break the map allowing you to see the entire battlefield while also being immune to fire if you have a strong turret (they tried to fix this but failed.) Horrible design flaws continue with layouts that, in combination with game modes, make tanks designed for hull down and defensive game play completely worthless because you HAVE to push to the objective to cap and win. Oh that's right there is 1 single type of game mode: domination, where you have to push to the middle of the map and cap a point, sometimes there's 1 2 or 3. Yup that's all we get for variation in game play across all types (sim/realistic/arcade). Also since they added thermal sights and night vision devices, every 10th game you get is a night battle. Ya and it can take a week or two w/o premium time to grind out the modules that allow for this. Especially for night battles but also generally most people just leave the match  after 1 death. This is only a problem for the higher tiers though, made worse by top tier premiums making for many players to not have lineups to  have a proper ability to fight and finish a match. The worst offenses for Gaijin's inability to make viable maps is that they give you city maps that measure 1km from your spawn to enemy spawn in modern MBT's... As well as very poorly thought out maps that encourage players to go straight to the enemy spawn and spawn camp instead of trying to navigate/fight in their confusing layouts that make no sense from a gameplay perspective but ""are accurate to a real life location.""

Helicopters:
Two words- completely broken. Damage models allow for a helicopter to shrug off 120mm APFSDS rounds through the entire length of the heli unless you precisely hit the pilot, and a lot of the time immune to even direct hits from SAMs and ATGMs. Even hitting the engine and causing a fire won't cause it to crash; only gently begin losing altitude all the while spamming hydra rockets at you, which auto-kill you if you're in a light tank/anti-aircraft. They don't even have their own (functioning) game mode meaning you're forced to use them in ground battles to grind out the later heli's. Which by-the-way require an EXTREME amount of grinding to get to the top of the line, OR as the developers likely intended: just buy your way to. For example, I'm grinding the German line with the BO 105 CB-2: I have 50 kills and 32 battles in a PREMIUM heli with premium time and I'm not even a 5th of the way through the first heli to research. 40k/170k RP (research points) and then there's 3 more after that (requiring an additional 1.2 MILLION RP+4 million silver lions) when you finally get the most OP/actually good heli for Germany. which gets 8 fire and forget missiles that allow you to raze entire flanks/teams within a minute if left unchecked. Did I mention only about a third of battles in ground mode actually will net you enough spawn points to even take one out with AGMs and not just dumb fire rockets. This coupled with the aforementioned horrible map designs, leading to many many games being throwaways, make it nearly impossible without spending money to achieve the top tier heli's. 

Air realistic battles: 
have 1 single game mode variant and it hasn't changed at all since it's introduction to the game back in 2011. It's fun but it takes 1-5 minutes in loading queue to find a game then it takes anywhere from 3-6 more minutes to actually see combat. Also it doesn't really have any use for bombers of any kind, AKA they are irrelevant to winning the game except for literally 2 bombers in the whole game that can actually win the match if they're ignored - B-29 and TU-4. You can't respawn either in this mode so if you spent 7-10 minutes climbing to altitude trying to catch a bomber, only to have them shoot you in the engine then guess what: you have to fly back to your airfield and repair and if the match ends by the time you are capable again you receive nothing for your effort. At which point you just spent 20 minutes waiting for a game, then just flying around climbing/running/cursing.


It reminds me of good old Battlefield 2/3 when there was mass war with helis/planes and tanks all duking it out for victory. 

Game modes: 

Realistic mode, a majority of players -including myself- play this, there aren't enemy markers unless they are hit with any type of munition, which pings a red icon on the mini-map. No assist to aiming and allows for sneaky plays at the cost of also being chop liver for aircraft which are constantly a headache and only require 2-3 kills. AA is cheap to respawn in but some nations get excellent AA while others don't even have any for certain BR's (battle ratings). A massive problem with aircraft being so easily available is the all too common revenge bombing, usually involving the enemy just flying directly into the ground on top of you dropping their bombs a second before death - usually also having enough points again to spawn into a light/medium tank again.

I wish I could have my 2000 hours and countless dollars back.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

236390,War Thunder,"Gaijin either still don't get it, or more likely just don't care and will say anything. I've played this game a ton, and it gets less and less consumer friendly with every update. New features don't just not improve the game, they actually degrade your experience for the sake of a quick cash grab. The grind gets slower and slower. Bugs and bad features go unaddressed for years, while Gaijin add drones, pointless entrenching tools, and now redundant slowed bombs (there is already a timed fuse if you want). Despite tons of feedback expressing the communities hatred of stats based balance and rewards, the devs pretend not to hear. 

We all know the game needs to make money. But rather than make money by making the game good, Gaijin seems determined to make it painful instead. I would prefer a subscription based model over a F2P. But THIS particular F2P model is just terrible, and getting worse. I can't recommend, despite my many many hours in it. I've gradually stopped buying premiums, stopped paying for premium time, stopped getting the battle pass etc. because Gaijin seems to hate the players. Hope they learn from the recent uproar, but I doubt it.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

236390,War Thunder,"Allow me to preface this by saying I have been playing this game for years and have spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on this game. Whether on premium currency, buying vehicle packs from the online store or buying premium time. At the time of writing this review I have 240ish days left of Premium time left.

I started playing just before they released Ground Forces. The game started out very fun and engaging, but now 1500 hours later I see the game for what Gaijin have turned it into. They turned a fun game, albeit with a heavy dose of grinding, into one of the least fun games I have played in a long time.

Pros:

1. It looks great when maxed out graphically.
2. The variety of vehicles is amazing. (caveat about this later). There are manyt different nations to play as.
3. Netcode, while not the best I've seen, is very passable for a Free to Play title, with only minor hiccups throughout my time.
4. Bugs and glitches, they definitely exist but they did not hinder my gameplay to the point where I would complain about them.
5. Cross play with either Xbox or PS4, but not with both simultaneously.

Cons:

1. Economy, whether for Silver Lions (SL) to purchase things you've unlocked, or Research Points (RP) to actually unlock them, is a slog. It has been only getting worse as time goes by. It can take ages to unlock the ability to purchase a new vehicle(topping out at just shy of 400 thousand RP), let alone have the Silver to actually purchase the vehicle (upwards of 2 million) and then pay to put a crew in the vehicle (2-3 hundred thousand). Keeping in mind, without paying for premium account, you may only get 500-1500 RP and 10-20 thousand SL per match, which can take anywhere from 5-35 minutes.

2. Premium currency is very expensive, and some of the best and most unique vehicles can only be obtained by purchasing Gaijins premium currency, Golden Eagles(GE). There are alternate ways to getting it besides buying it, as I have heard that certain apps will allow you to accumulate GE over time, but I did not use them myself. There is a secondary currency that they use called Gaijin coins that are 1:1 with USD, which is used in the marketplace they created.

3. The Marketplace. I hate it. Vehicles sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars, it completely changed the way the game felt once it was introduced. It's just like CS:GO skins, only its not just skins. Imagine if you had to buy the AK-47 in CS:GO for $700 before you could use it.

4. The balancing is probably the worst offender in the reason for this review. Gaijin has shown over the years that they do not intend to balance the game, going so far as planning on removing vehicles because they would be to hard to think of a way to balance them. Standard M.O. for Gaijin is to release one or two shiny new vehicles that are overpowered for one to two out of the seven in game nations, wait for everyone to spend money getting to those vehicles and then once the novelty has worn off for players, do it again. It is never a level playing field for every nation. One country gets something that completely outclasses every other nation, every patch. I'm tired of it and its not fun.


I could absolutely write more about the game, but I really don't want to give it any more time. Can you have fun with this game? Yeah, sure, but you probably used to play with dirt when you were a kid and thought it was great too.

236390,War Thunder,"[i]Please read before making consideration:[/i]

I am friends with a former Senior Mod from the War Thunder forums. According to (that person), the mods actively check these reviews and downvote any of them that have any kind of criticism. Luckily for us, Steam prevents them from just deleting it like they do on their forums. I believe the top review here is negative, which is good despite my review being positive overall. People need to be aware of all the faults in this game, which are as numerous as all the things this game does right. 

If you decide to download this game just be aware of the unilateral censorship and active deletion and muting of anyone who offers up criticism (constructive or otherwise) on the forum. They do not tolerate it at all and you will have your post removed and will be given a warning point. The forums are helpful, but can be avoided entirely - which is what I recommend. It's not worth the trouble to deal with the mods if you do or say something they deem critical in any way.

All that said - the game itself is very fun. It's the best plane game on the market right now. Not that that says much, but it's something. The tank mechanics are very poor though, but if you don't mind some occasional RNG wackiness, they are a fun time-killer. 

Thanks for reading, happy tanking (and piloting).

Update: Took a few years off, giving it another shot.

236390,War Thunder,"Oh boy, War Thunder. After playing the game a little I wish I could give it a neutral review, but as of the current direction the game is taking I will leave it as a negative one.

The game itself is fun. It's free, so try for yourself. The main issues the game has begin showing once you reach the endgame grind. e.g. Tier V+. The grind has been getting worse and worse, especially without a premium account and vehicles. Not only in research, but also in purchase and running costs. 
Gaijin attempts to balance things by increasing repair costs, which does not really change the balance, but just makes it impossible to play certain vehicles, such as Bombers, for prolonged periods of time with any sort of profit. As a 100% free player, if the unlocking of vehicles doesn't bring you to a halt, then making enough money to actually play them will do the trick. 

It's quite a shame because under all the grinding and money sinks, War Thunder is a fun game that has taken a turn in the wrong direction. Not into a Pay 2 Win, but in a painfully slow grindfest which fails to reward players properly for their performance in matches.

The worst offender in recent years though, has been the Gaijin market. What started out as a neat little idea similiar to the Steam Marketplace, the gaijin market moved away from a community content driven store, where players could sell their vehicle camos and profit, to a more intrusive model, selling parts for construction events and trying to squeeze as much money out of it as possible. 

I only want the best for the game, hell, in my over 3000 hours I spent at least 200-300€ on the game and without regret. It is free so whoever is interested should definetly give it a go and check it out, but if you expect to play it entirely for free, you will be in for a long grind with little reward.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

236390,War Thunder,"I have played this game since I was first introduced to it by jingles. (Jan, 5 2013) When i first started playing i was in love. It was the only thing I ever did all day. The thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time. The game was great. Then the updates started to come... At first it was just harder to make money and xp. People hated it but I kind of liked it. Then the BR system came and balance left. Matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad. Then the russian bias got real. Im not one of those people that complain that I died to X russian plane/tank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying. (planes putting out fires, t-34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the side, ext) But even this wasnt what made me quit this game. It's the company. They are absolutly terrible. Constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs. They threaten to ruin RB if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters? And even steam isn't safe. They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative. I can forgive russian bias. I can forgive the terrible BR system. I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community. To Anton Yudintsev, you made a game that was amazing. I loved it so much and always will. But what you have become as a company will destroy you in the end. Listen to the community, let them help you make the game better. If you do that, this game has a chance to rise back up into greatness.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

236390,War Thunder,"As a player who's been playing since the beginning of Raining Fire (released September 2020) I'm proud and disappointed at the same time of this game.

When I first started playing, my dreams weren't focused on the F-4E or MiG-21 variants. I stuck to the US tech tree, and the thought of just strafing ground targets in a SBD-3 as you fly low to the ground was neverending fun for me. I wasn't trying to go grind for top tier jets, I just wanted to have fun with what I had.

New Power came (November 2020) and I think that's where this game started to go downhill. New premium jets were being added alongside standard jets, and, as time went on, I started to change my mindset to grind for jets. That's where my problems begin.

I can applaud the developers for modeling every single aircraft, but i'm not happy because of the grind. Youtube channels rumored a F2P player to finish a tech tree within a year - if they were lucky.

Now, you may be wondering ""why did he give this game a thumbs up if i was going to talk bad about it?"" ""what went wrong?"" 

I gave it a thumbs up because it has the potential to be one of the best combat games out there. Thousands of vehicles, a nice community (no-one really complains about losing or anything or ranting about (X) jet from my experience) the developers are working hard in the midst of the pandemic, and more.

Now, here's the current problems with War Thunder.
1 - The grind is almost unbearable if you have a F2P (Free 2 Play) account

I've tried to grind the US tree with standard planes alone, but that was extremely hard to a point where I felt the need to buy premium vehicles/bonuses/time.


2 - The system is designed to pressure you into spending cash

Although this is classified as a ""con"", the true reason for Gaijin to do this could be because War Thunder is a free game. Because of this, they have to make packs/vehicles/premium currency a thing so that way they can maintain the servers and keep the game alive. Without cash, they can't manage the servers. Without servers, they can't manage the game because the servers can't be used. Without managing the game, War Thunder will slowly die.


3 - Vehicles in Rank IV or V and onward tend to have extremely high repair costs, crew trains, research requirements, and high purchase costs

If you managed to grind a rank V vehicle, you still have to play games in order to get enough currency (Silver Lions) for the vehicle purchase. If you have enough, you still have to deal with a Crew Train (doesn't cost as much as purchase) though poor management of currency can lead you to have extremely low amounts of Silver Lions.


4 - The game needs to decompress

If you never played the game before and don't know what I mean by this, tanks and aircraft have this system called ""Battle Rating"". They are divided into said battle ratings which fit them best. Currently, the game has stopped at Battle Rating 10.7 for tanks and aircraft (ships at 6.0/6.3). 

However, the problems start when the developers add more modern aircraft, and, if they don't decompress soon, players may have to deal with F-15s (if they ever get added), F-16s, Su-25s, etc as a F-100 who was unlucky enough to get put in a Battle Rating 10.7 game. F-100s were made in the '50s. 
They could face aircraft made decades after them 
(all the vehicles mentioned in this portion of the review were made in the 70's except for the F-100)


5 - The team needs to advertise their game better

If you don't know what I mean, almost all of the ads shown featuring War Thunder always have a top-tier tank, plane, or helicopter (top-tier in the community means modern-day vehicles or similar). 
So imagine someone seeing these ads, saying ""oh what a cool M1 Abrams! i can't wait to download and play with it!"" and then downloading the game and realizing that instead of a M1 Abrams, they get a M3 Stuart, a World War 2 era vehicle. 
They then see a M1 in the US tech tree, but come to the realization that they will have to go through hours of struggling, grinding, getting enough currency for the vehicle, only to finally get a M1 Abrams that they will have to use at one of the most dreaded battle ratings of the game.


If the game developers fixed some of the issues here, that would improve the quality of their game by a lot. War Thunder has the true potential of being one of the best combat games out there, but the developers don't seem to be trying to fix the current issues, which, if fixed, could have the game be a lot better and live up to it's old status of being one of the best combat games.

Would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what goes on within. 
If you want to stick to 'low tier',  where it's mostly fun (no grind, no high repair costs, etc) you can, and if you want to play this game for the sole purpose of having fun with early World War Two tanks, planes, or ships, this game would be great for you.

That's all I have to say for now about this game.

Update (5/21/2021):
With Update 2.7 (Red Skies) introduced via trailers and videos from content creators (it's not out just yet), I have taken a look at the dev server streams and saw that they have fixed quite a few things. Thus, I may do a revised review of the game, though not until the game updates to Update 2.7, because we can't judge books by their cover.","Mostly Positive75% of the 459,730 user reviews for this game are positive.This product has experienced one or more periods of off-topic review activity.

236390,War Thunder,"Hi Guys, my name is Drake and as of writing this review i have played Warthunder for 3269.9 hours. i have reached the top tier in 3 countries. yes after 3000 hours. all i have is 3 countries. that is WITH premium time and vehicles speeding progression up.

At its core warthunder is a good game, decently well made. but what truly lets Warthunder down is its developers

Gaijin is the definition of lie cheat and steal, they do not listen to the players unless they do something so stupid that the whole playerbase revolts, like when they tried to add p2w repairs and boosts for your vehicles. they removed the maus with a nonsense excuse that it was ""too hard to balance"" when really they just wanted to make it and event vehicle to make money off people that want it. they seed old vehicles that you can no longer get to players in lootboxes that you buy with real money from their rip off Great Value TF2/CSGO marketplace where those vehicles litterally sell for THOUSANDS of real life dollars

they can't be bothered to maintain their game at all, there are still bugs in this game from when it launched like 8 year ago, they make players write a fucking essay on the bug for them to MAYBE pay attention to it because none of them even play the game, so they would not know.

i have NEVER seen worse spawnkilling in a game. ever, ever ever ever. people target the spawn first because its legal with no punishment. no ""keep out"" zone, 10 seconds of spawn protection for tanks.

the prices for premium vehicles are way too much, 60 dollars for a top tier premium (yes they sell top tier premiums) is a little much man, not to mention thaat if you want to progress in any semblance to a reasonable time you MUST HAVE Premium time.

don't let them lure you in with that shiny Abrams or that nice Apache or that sick F-4 Phantom II because unless you are willing to spend a 1000 hours of your life or open your wallet then you won't get them, infact you wont even get close, about a little under 1 percent of players that start warthunder will reach those vehicles, because you need millions of total rp (research points) to get them, and when you get 2000 rp a game... well you see where this is going.

honestly the only reason i have played this game so long is because all my friends play it and its all my potato laptop can run

no review has ever been close to describing all the problems with warthunder and this one won't either. don't even bother as long as gaijin runs the show

You learn a good new move and have a lot of success with it, so you you use it a lot... then your ghost starts using it a lot too, so you're forced to learn to defend against it... and that teaches you it's not as good as it seemed, and more importantly - *when* it's good and when it's not.

Got bodied by another player online? Download their ghost and you can have as many practice matches against it as you like it to learn how to handle their moves, without having to set up a study session in practice mode (which is also greatly improved, btw.)

1778820,TEKKEN 8,"Arguably the best Tekken game to ever release.
I felt like with Tekken 7 a lot of the aesthetic and identity was lost. 
Tekken 4, 5, 6 and TT2 had amazing identity, graphics and style that made Tekken what it was.
8 brings back its style, identity and flow that we've all been missing in T7.

The roster consists of 32 characters, each with their own unique fighting style, moves, and combos. It holds a rich story mode, a variety of online and offline modes, and stunning graphics and sound.

Story mode picks up where Tekken 7 left off, with the final showdown between Kazuya Mishima and his father Heihachi Mishima. We explore the origins of the Mishima family feud, the secrets of the Devil Gene and its orgins as well as the fate of Jin Kazama, who is missing after the events of Tekken 7. The story is presented in a cinematic style, with fully voiced cutscenes and dynamic battles. 

Gameplay is fast-paced, fluid, and responsive, with a balance of offense and defense. There are new mechanics, such as the Heat mechanic, which allows the player to unleash powerful attacks as well as recovering health, chip damage and Power Crush, which allows the player to absorb some damage and continue their attack. The game also has a variety of stages, each with their own environmental hazards and transitions.

Online mode is robust and smooth, with a ranking system, a replay, and a spectator mode. We also have cross-play between different platforms, allowing players to challenge each other regardless of their device. Sounds are impressive and immersive, with realistic character models, detailed animations, and expressive facial expressions. There are diverse and dynamic soundtrack, featuring rock, techno, and orchestral music.  The voice cast is of talented actors, who deliver their lines with emotion and personality.


To sum this overall great package:
Positives:
+ Amazing gameplay
+ Phenomenal Design and graphics
+ Stages, characters and moves are perfect
+ Tekken Ball
+ Online Lounge and online modes in general are smooth except Day 1 Release
+ We can use all Tekken soundtracks in the game from T1 all the way to T7 and 8
+ The Story is awesome. Really well done.
+ Easy to get into. Arcade Quest and the tutorial really help out bringing the best in you. It's easy to practice, easy to learn and very hard to master.
+ The Ghosts AI is actually capable and useful. What a great design choice and implementation.

On the negative side:
- Not enough customisation options. T6 is still the GOAT in that regard
- No Tekken Force
- The sound of punches isn't as satisfying as T7 but it's good enough still

Tekken 8 is a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike, as it offers a satisfying and thrilling fighting game experience. The game has a lot of content and replay value, as well as a deep and engaging story. The game is a masterpiece of the genre, and a fitting conclusion to the saga of the Mishima family.","Very Positive90% of the 10,387 user reviews for this game are positive.",arguably best tekken release tekken 7 aesthetic identity lost tekken 4 5 6 tt2 amazing identity graphic style tekken 8 brings style identity flow missing t7 roster consists 32 character unique fighting style move combo hold rich mode variety online offline mode stunning graphic sound mode pick tekken 7 left final showdown kazuya mishima father heihachi mishima explore origin mishima family feud secret devil gene orgins fate jin kazama missing event tekken 7 presented cinematic style fully voiced cutscenes dynamic battle fast paced fluid responsive balance of_emphasizedfense defense mechanic heat mechanic allows unleash powerful attack recovering health chip damage power crush allows absorb damage continue attack variety stage environmental hazard transition online mode robust smooth ranking replay spectator mode cross different platform allowing player challenge regardless device sound impressive immersive realistic model detailed animation expressive facial expression diverse dynamic soundtrack featuring rock techno orchestral music voice cast talented actor deliver line emotion personality sum great package positive amazing phenomenal design graphic stage character move perfect tekken ball online lounge online mode general smooth except 1 release tekken soundtrack t1 t7 8 awesome easy arcade tutorial help bringing best easy practice easy learn hard master ghost ai capable useful great design choice implementation negative side not_enough customisation option t6 goat regard no_tekken force sound punch satisfying t7 good tekken 8 fan series newcomer alike offer satisfying thrilling fighting replay value deep engaging masterpiece genre fitting conclusion saga mishima family

1778820,TEKKEN 8,"[h1]Preface[/h1]
By no means am I Tekken master nor am I a fighting game maniac. But as a gamer who is familiar with almost every genre, I try to play every fighting game I can get my hands on. It's safe to say that I at least know the basics of fighting game mechanics and what it takes to ""get better."" In the recent years, with the help of my best friend from high school, I've had a chance to learn the ins and outs of games like SF6, Dragon Ball Fighterz, MK, and even some anime fighting games. As a result, the more I invested, the more I learned. The more I learned, the more I enjoyed the games. I grew up with the OG Playstation and Tekken 3. Now, 20+ years later, what a great time it is to be alive: to witness the eighth installment of the Tekken series.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
In the fighting game genre, I think we can all agree that if the game is fun, the game is already great to a certain extent. Back in the day, that's all that mattered. Now, we've got other categories to consider like amount of content, cosmetics, replayability, updates, etc. But let's face it: when it comes to Tekken, no one can deny that it's the legend among legends when it comes to the bare bones. They solidified the game and introduced the new heat drive(?) system. They went the same route as Street Fighter 6 in that they brought the ""special style"" for newcomers - akin to Modern controls in SF6 - to just press buttons and enjoy the game for what it is. Of course, we all know that this will only get you so far; and to really delve deep into Tekken, one needs to get the kids' gloves off and play like the Tekken legends of old (lol) to learn combos w/ manual inputs and understand what you're actually doing. Regardless, there are many ways to enjoy the game by whatever means necessary. The game perfected the Tekken recipe and it is indeed the best Tekken to play in 2024.

[b]Content[/b]
Two things that were noticeable: companies know that a lot of players are not as hardcore and excited to play online/ranked so it feels like they implemented a strong Ghost system for players to enjoy in the long-term, especially those who deem themselves ""less competitive"" like myself. When it comes to replayability, I think this is a good way to enjoy the game further past the story/arcade modes without stressing out about playing online. Second, the special style allows players to ""see"" what certain characters can do without lifting a finger, really. Well, maybe using your thumb to chain simple combos but it definitely makes the character bust out the flashy stuff on the fly.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[b]Story[/b]
Tekken's story is beyond disappointing, and this has been the case since T4. It's your average hero beats villain, angel vs demon routine that every Tekken has brought so far. No real character development, no real stakes. Just a Jin/Kazuya fest as usual. I have this lowkey feeling that the writers have this hard-on for making the Japanese characters look cool and have the characters that represent the rest of the world be their side pieces, but this might be just minor politics at play and wouldn't really bother me.... IF THE WRITING WASN'T SO SUBPAR. $20 says AI technology can do better for Tekken 9. Then again, every anime series post-2010 has had similar subpar storylines all over the place so.. I guess they just lack creativity and prefer to take the ""safe"" way when it comes to stories (just like Ubisoft).

[b]Customization[/b]

[UPDATE] Feb 15, 2024
Upon further analysis, the customization in Tekken 8 is the best in the FGC. Beats the likes of MK1 and SF6 out of the water. Still would like to see more accessories, as we had in the T6 days, but from what we've seen people around the world come up with these past few weeks since launch, the potential of creating various characters from different franchises is astounding.

[strike]This one's a bit disappointing.[/strike] Do they plan to release more accessories and outfits in the future? If so, are they gonna be paid DLC...? Case in point, the customization options that are available at launch are underwhelming to say the least. I don't know why I was expecting to feel more excited to see the likes of T6 and TTT revived. But I might have gotten my hopes up a bit too high. At least we can make LEON from RE4? Cyberpunk for Jin? A bootleg Kenshi from MK for Victor? GOKU FOR LARS?

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Final Verdict: S[/b]
Arguably the best Tekken game of all time, for veterans and newcomers alike. The biggest compliment I would like to throw is that in a game industry where we're used to companies releasing unfinished games to rake in the $$$, Harada and his team really took their time and sweat blood and tears to bring Tekken 8 to a near-perfect state before unleashing it upon the world. Also really looking forward to how Knee dominates the tournament scene once again.

1778820,TEKKEN 8,"[h1] Welcome to the King of Iron First Tournament 8! [/h1]
TEKKEN has existed in my peripheral vision for most of the time I’ve been playing video games. My Mum was quite strict back in the day, so my 12-rated copy of Tekken Tag 1 for the PS2 could only be played in secrecy, and as a result of its frenetic combat, wacky character roster, considerable mode variety and banging soundtrack, this is something me and my brother did many times. To see how the series has evolved since then is a truly glorious sight to behold. TEKKEN 8’s vision of a ‘next-gen’ fighting experience is polished to a brilliant shine, offering a level of satisfaction, variety and value that few games in the genre have ever delivered, laying an incredible foundation for the next era of the world’s most popular 3D fighting series.

TEKKEN’s combat fundamentals are largely unchanged; matches are typically played in a best-of-5 format, with each round lasting 60 seconds, but few rounds ever reaching that limit, as every combo, grab and heavy hit can take away most of your health before the 15-second mark is reached. The beauty of this brisk pace comes from all fighters having over 100 moves to execute, each with unique properties and existing as part of distinct stances, thereby giving you abundant options to become an unpredictable opponent in every brief encounter. 

TEKKEN 8 greatly turns up the aggression with the Heat system, which can be used to deliver a devastating burst attack, though it also provides access to exclusive moves and a long-range dash, all of which can completely change the tides of battle. Heat combines well with the new recoverable health gauge, where certain heat-enabling moves can restore a significant chunk of your health at a moment’s notice. If all else fails, Rage Arts return from Tekken 7, allowing you to shut down your opponent if they put themselves in a punishable state at the last moment.

This really only scratches the surface of TEKKEN’s complex fighting mechanics, and learning all of its elements will take many hours of practice. I am therefore beyond ecstatic to report that the training tools offered by TEKKEN 8 are second to none. This begins with Arcade Quest, a mini-campaign ultimately acting as an extended tutorial that slowly introduces you to its mechanics and core character moves, using the goal of becoming the World Tour champion as a motivating backdrop. 

If you want to take your play further, the practice mode is packed to the brim with useful features, including punishment training, programming the AI dummy to perform specific moves, a record feature which can help you learn tricky combos, and so much more. Beyond this, the game automatically creates ghost data from online opponents and allows you to fight them at your leisure, essentially giving you a limitless number of uniquely behaving characters to learn from. If you have ever felt anxious about taking fighting games online, TEKKEN 8’s training options will give you the experience and confidence to feel truly ready to hold your own against other players.

[h1] Take A Stab At It [/h1]
In terms of the fighters, TEKKEN 8 has a healthy base roster of 32 characters. Old favourites like Kazuya, Xiaoyu, Kuma and King are back, all greatly benefitting from the improved visuals and audio design, making every hit feel and look more satisfying than ever before. Three newcomers fill out the roster, and while this is unusually low, their playstyles feel unique and have all become personal favourites of mine. Azucena’s tricksy mixed-martial arts style is the baseline for plenty of powerful moves and hilarious animations. Victor has many lightning-fast combos dominated by knife attacks, and his devastating Katana moves exude serious Raiden energy which is only ever a good thing. 

Reina functions as the spiritual successor to Heihachi, and ended up being my main as she allows for some incredibly aggressive play, with options to bait opponents out of a defensive stance and greatly punish them, alongside a few iconic electrics to boot. Crucially, while I’m by no means an expert on TEKKEN’s meta, no character stood out to me as completely unviable or overpowered; each loss could only be attributed to poor decision-making. And while the default skins are excellent, there’s an extensive character customization tool offering dozens of unique cosmetics for every fighter, all obtainable in-game for no extra cost.

Where TEKKEN 8 slightly disappoints is within its relatively small arena roster. Granted, there’s a lot of visual variety here, and many have multiple floors which may be dynamically accessed via specific moves. However, I wish there were a few more environments to cycle through. Though frankly, there’s no bad arenas here, and I never once groaned at the appearance of a particular stage. One great feature to add a bit of variety comes via the Jukebox mode, allowing you to customize the music for each stage using songs from every game in the series. It’s hard to feel disappointed at TEKKEN 8’s humble song selection when there are literally hundreds of songs to fight to. 

[h1] The Complete Package [/h1]
Regarding single-player offerings, there’s an excellent cinematic story mode depicting the events surrounding the final confrontation of Jin and Kazuya. While brief, there are plenty of jaw-dropping setpieces and a few surprises to ensure that its runtime is all killer. Character episodes exist for the entire roster, each rewarding you with mostly humorous CGI cutscenes. TEKKEN Ball makes its grand return, with its wild ball physics offering a hilarious change of pace from the many intense battles you’ll be experiencing. Finally, there are numerous built-in ghosts which reward unique cosmetics.

For online, you’ve got your standard ranked modes, quick play, private matches, and the TEKKEN Fight Lounge, which essentially ties together all of these options into a social environment, offering a convenient space to either banter or detox between fights. Netcode was pretty excellent in my experience, though your mileage is likely to vary. I have a 150mbps Wi-Fi connection, and 90% of my matches were as smooth as they were when playing offline. However, those 10% of fights where my opponent’s connection became unreliable resulted in near unplayable levels of input delay, so I would highly recommend that your internet is up to the task before hopping online.

And in terms of performance, the game ran at a near-perfect 60fps on maxed settings 99% of the time, loading times were super-fast, and I only experienced a handful of crashes. As a recent 120fps convert, it should be noted that there is a hard 60fps cap, but if this is the trade-off needed to enable cross-play, I’d take that choice every time.

[h1] Verdict [/h1]
When deciding upon the final score, I kept asking myself two questions. 1 – “Does Tekken 8 push the genre forward?"" and 2 – “Are its issues large enough to hurt the overall package?”. The more I kept playing, the more I believed the answers to these questions to be a resounding Yes and No respectively. If TEKKEN 8 only delivered improvements to combat, this brilliant roster of characters, and its slew of varied customization options, it would still rank as an excellent fighting game. However, it’s the genre-leading training options that push TEKKEN 8 into best-of-all-time territory for me. I can just as easily recommend it to someone completely new to the genre as I could to series veterans, and this is undoubtedly its finest achievement. I can see myself playing for many years, and look forward to seeing how they can expand beyond this already stellar offering. Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll be getting back to getting good.

It truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.

1966720,Lethal Company,"I don't know what comparison to draw to explain the games mechanics. It's a survival horror but it doesn't fall into a monster hunt category like Phas. 
This game does allow for players to make their own fun as well, it does not have to be hardcore at all if you don't want it to be. Its very socially comparable maybe to Among Us although I was not a fan of that game. 

This game is about collecting scrap. The objective is to meet an ever climbing quota in 3 days which makes it run based, after failure to meet quota you restart. There is a shop you can spend money at for cosmetics or useful items. Because you need to hold everything in this game it means you really gotta plan with your team what you're going to take with you (If you're going for long runs) otherwise you'll find yourself short and you might find yourself being introduced to the companies disciplinary measures for lazy workers. 

Each monster has audio queues to recognise and methods of detection that you will have to play around. Giants have very keen sight but pick up on movement and don't hear well.
Dogs can't see at all but they're fast and chase after sound. 
I'll leave it at that for now but there are methods to dispatch/avoid the various creatures and most don't feel alike to deal with. This also makes monster combos something to really keep in mind when setting up your teams load out. 

There are 3 tiers of maps based off difficulty/reward. The final tier require that you pay(Not real money) to get in but these maps are required for making it into later quotas for long runs. These are also the maps you'll run into monster combos, a real challenge when your making your way past the 1500-2000 quota range. Before that difficulty takes a bit of time to climb, don't be surprised to see 1 go running in solo and making quota alone for the first 6 or so days. 


I've played Phas and a bunch of its clones (Some better honestly than phas itself) but I still like this game way better than all of them. 
If you found waiting around in Phasmophobia for the information to basically come to you was boring then I think you'll enjoy this game much more. You have limited time in a day so your actually fighting the clock to be more efficient until you can't keep up. 
I personally don't want to sit around waiting in a survival horror until I can progress because then I'm relying on the spook factor to entertain me while I would otherwise be bored with nothing to do. The spook factor has very much died for me in horror games.
This games design promotes finding faster and more active ways around problems. Is a giant camping your ship? Send someone out to bait it, and once they're far use the teleporter to return them to the ship while you use the opening to get out.
You can just sit and wait for an opening but the time that's ticking away is your punishment for not coming up with an active solution. This is an important aspect to the difficulty which drives me to want to play the game in the first place. Its not just about surviving the encounter long enough to get paid with some process of elimination running in the background. It's about improving the efficiency of your game plan and doing better every run. A single player can make a huge difference on the team, and having a knowledgeable team is like a multiplier on an individual players skill. 

Half the excitement for me comes from the dice roll upon joining a lobby with new players. It could be a funny lobby, a try hard lobby, people experimenting with the game there is so much variety in how this game 'can' play out.

An extra note for players hosting Boss only lobbies. Its early access, the rank doesn't work. It resets and displays wrong. If you're kicking anyone who isn't a boss from your titan run lobbies you're probably kicking some of the more experienced players. Its better to ask what they know about the game than to judge based off the tag.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 274,684 user reviews for this game are positive.",comparison draw explain game mechanic survival horror fall monster hunt category phas allow player fun not_have hardcore socially comparable maybe not_a fan collecting scrap objective meet climbing quota 3 day make based failure meet quota restart shop spend cosmetic useful item hold mean ta plan long run otherwise short introduced company disciplinary measure lazy worker monster audio queue recognise method detection giant keen sight pick movement hear dog fast chase sound leave method dispatch avoid various creature alike deal make monster combo mind team load 3 tier map based difficulty reward final tier require pay not_real map required quota long run map monster combo real challenge past 1500 2000 quota range difficulty take bit climb surprised 1 running solo quota alone 6 day phas bunch clone honestly phas found waiting phasmophobia information basically boring enjoy limited fighting clock efficient personally sit waiting survival horror progress relying spook factor entertain otherwise bored spook factor died horror game game design promotes finding faster active way problem giant camping ship send someone bait far teleporter return ship opening sit wait opening ticking punishment not_coming active solution important aspect difficulty drive not_just surviving encounter long paid process elimination running background improving efficiency plan single huge difference knowledgeable multiplier individual player skill half excitement come dice roll joining lobby player funny lobby hard lobby experimenting variety extra note player hosting bos lobby early access rank reset display wrong kicking bos titan lobby probably kicking experienced player ask judge based tag

1966720,Lethal Company,"This game is AMAZING. It's both horrifying and hilarious - the screams of terror coming from my teammates becoming muffled as a snare flea smothers them is just golden. The proximity voice chat is perfect. I'm hoping they add more moons to make it easier to meet higher quotas (the highest we reached was 2267 or something like that, and it was disappointing to just start over). Here's what you need to know to join the company:

- Never take your eyes off a coilhead. 
- Always check the ceiling.
- If there's an open vent, you aren't alone anymore!
- Just because that hallway was safe when you came through it, doesn't mean it will be safe coming back.
- Try to bring back your dead colleagues' bodies. It saves you getting a steep penalty AND the corpses are worth 5 credits!
- Never give the good equipment to the teammate who consistently fails the gap jumps.
- When you're selling at the Company Building... spam the bell. Trust me. Nothing bad will happen. Yep, just keep spamming it. 
- When you see the Flowerman, run fast and pray. Don't believe the Bestiary. Flowerman follows no rules or logic. Look at him, don't look at him, it makes no difference. He just decides, ""Yes. This one I'll murder. And this one, I'll let go... for now."" When the Flowerman says it's your time, you're GONE. 
- If something is moving and it's not wearing an orange jumpsuit, it has the capacity (and motivation) to kill you.

Hope that helps, and don't forget to meet that quota!

I had nothing but the radio in my hand and the voice emanating from it guiding me through the twisting turning maze that was this facility. I was navigating a conveyor belt when I looked down into a hallway entrance where I heard footsteps. I immediately decided then and there that I had maybe outstayed my welcome. I started running in the direction of the exit with the tiny bit of scrap I had managed to find on my journey when I paused at a bridge to radio in to my friend back at the space shuttle. Immediately in doing so a mannequin with its head only attached to it body via a spring charges to me from behind, only stopping once I start looking at it.
I eventually muster the courage to walk past it and jump across the bridge when another monster appears behind me. I leg it back to the exit door but I'm not fast enough.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"TLDR: DO NOT BUY BASE SIMS 4!! Buy it HEAVILY DISCOUNTED bundled with one of the major expansions (Seasons or Pets), and MOD THE SHIT OUT OF IT!!


Base Sims 4 is nearly unplayable due to the lack of content, repetitive and easily manipulative emotions system, and an overall feeling of restriction. Which is damaging in a game series that is designed around player freedom. There are also so many irritating qualities to it that make it seem like it wasn't fine tweaked enough. Why is every single Sim such a social butterfly that I cannot get them to stop talking to each other for five seconds? Why do they take so long to eat? Why are the lots so small and so empty? Why is nearly nothing from Sims 3, and heck, even Sims 2 brought over?? (Horses, Cars, pools, restaurants, grocery stores, fun recreational activities, ect.)

With that being said, there is some classic Sim Fun to be had with this game, if you are able to get it for a heavily discounted price and get it bundled with one of the major expansions (I would recommend either Pets or Seasons). I would also highly recommend downloading a plethora of Mods, because they fix a vast majority of the systems in base Sims 4 that make it more enjoyable. If Mods are not your thing, then I would think twice about purchasing this game. **This is one of the easiest games to Mod fyi**

Mod Recommendations (Like seriously, don't even play base Sims 4 before downloading these Mods)

Sims 4 Mod Manager by Raxdiam (Not necessary, but a very convenient and easy way to keep track of your mods. Very user friendly, will do 100% of the work for you)

Meaningful Stories by roBurky (A mod pack that effectively revamps the mood and emotions systems of Sims 4. This makes the systems feel waaay more fleshed out and realistic, and significantly less manipulatable)

Better Romance by simler90 (Adds more rules and checks into how Sims romance one another. In base Sims 4, you are basically always guaranteed to succeed in romance. There is quite literally no way to fail. This Mod expands heavily upon it, making it so that the traits Sims have will impact whether or not they will accept any advances.)

Wonderful Whims by TURBODRIVER (Goes great with Better Romance with no compatibility issues that I'm aware of. Adds in an Attractiveness system, first Impressions, Personality Archetypes, and even a Menstrual Cycle and Birth Control system. With this, you are more equipped to design your Sims overall sexuality and sexual lives. Hugely rewarding, and designed perfectly that it will seem like it is a natural part of the game.)

There is also a shit load of CC (Custom Content) out there like clothes, hair, buildings, Sims, ect. ""Mod The Sims"" is the best place to find all of this. Don't spend money on any of the Stuff Packs, because most of that stuff included in them you'll find for free made by someone online. Usually looks nicer too.","Very Positive87% of the 127,522 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_buy base sims 4 heavily discounted bundled major expansion season pet shit base sims 4 nearly unplayable due lack repetitive easily manipulative emotion feeling restriction damaging series designed freedom irritating quality fine tweaked single sim social butterfly cannot_get talking five second long eat lot small empty nearly sims 3 heck sims 2 brought horse car pool restaurant grocery store fun recreational activity ect classic sim fun able heavily discounted price bundled major expansion recommend pet season highly recommend downloading plethora mod fix vast majority system base sims 4 enjoyable mod not_your twice purchasing easiest game fyi recommendation seriously base sims 4 downloading mod sims 4 manager raxdiam not_necessary convenient easy track mod user friendly 100 meaningful story roburky pack effectively revamps mood emotion system sims 4 make system waaay fleshed realistic significantly manipulatable romance simler90 add rule check sims romance base sims 4 basically guaranteed succeed romance literally no_way fail expands heavily trait sims impact not_they accept advance wonderful whim turbodriver go great romance no_compatibility issue aware add attractiveness impression personality archetype menstrual cycle birth control equipped design sims sexuality sexual life hugely rewarding designed perfectly natural shit load cc custom clothes hair building sims ect sims best spend stuff pack stuff included someone online usually look nicer

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"Before this review, I feel like it's important to say that I have more than 23.7 hours in this game. A LOT more. I've got that much alone on PS4, and 500+ hours on my original origin account, which I can sadly no longer access to check the exact number. I got this game 9 years ago, full price retail, and have played it on and off since the age of 9. I've played this game to death over the years, and that's why it hurts me to leave a negative review. You can still have fun with it, and I will explain that, but it's flaws are just too plentiful for me to leave a positive review.

It would be easy to say that this game used to be great, but that... would be a blatant lie. The game was barren when it released. Key features from past games were missing, like toddlers and POOLS. How were we supposed to kill our sims now? Give them a long and happy life until a natural death? Hardly! Along with that, the map screens didn't even have colour; they were pure white, sterile places. Maybe it was supposed to be stylistic, but... I can't help but think about how much cheaper it must have been.

Slowly, over the years, we started to get more DLC packs of various tiers. It didn't start out too egregious, I wouldn't say. Sure, Luxury Party Stuff was lacklustre, but we had things like Outdoor Retreat to keep us going! Though, it was hard not to note how quickly EA had jumped to make DLC whilst the core game was missing such basic features. That isn't even to say how the community at large took the closed-world and lack of colour and pattern customisation. I'll tell you how they took it; badly. They took it badly.

With all this DLC, there was a problem.

IT. DIDN'T. STOP.

Now, it's normal for a Sims game to have a large amount of DLC. But this? It became staggering. As of this review, all of the DLC for this game will run you over $800.

OVER. EIGHT. HUNDRED. DOLLARS.

I'll let that sink in.

Have you ever wondered how this game is free? That's how. It's not like this DLC is truly optional. Some of it is, sure! But would you like your life simulator to have weather? A normal amount of clothes? More than THREE PLACES TO LIVE, ONE OF THEM BEING AN EMPTY FIELD? Then you'd best pony up! It's hard to fully express how empty this game feels without DLC. And EA knows it feels that empty, and that they can keep milking us for every last cent.

At this point, you may have noticed something, or you may have not. And that's the fact that I said I've been playing this game for nine years. And that means the game has been out for nine years now. Since 2014. This game is almost a decade old. This is an issue. A big issue. When this game first released, it prided itself on it's intelligent autonomous sims. They can multitask; like watching television AND eating at the same time! Wowzers! But with this much time having passed, you'd be hard pressed to find somebody confident to call these sims anything above 'serviceable, I guess'. Your sims will wash their plates in the bathroom! Your sims will grab water if you leave them alone for two seconds and drink until they experience bladder failure! Your sims will start a fight with their spouse, seemingly just for kicks! Your sims will stop moving until you reset them with a cheat code! Your sims will be left with an undeletable action in their queue until you, again, use a cheat code! You get the picture. This game is a mess, with problems that could be wiped clean in a theoretical Sims 5. So why don't they?

Because EA have created a live-service single-player game, and they'd be stupid to give it up.

This live-service model, piling DLC upon DLC onto the game? It's managed to cause even more issues than the game had to begin with. Each new download comes with new bugs unique in nature. Oops, there go your textures! Oops, your sims are now all autonomously screaming at each other! Oops, your Sims are BUILDING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR OWN CHILDREN! These are the kinds of things you'll have to get used to, and this only gets worse each time they add DLC. There are problems in this game that have become support beams by this point; fix those bugs, and everything will fall apart. So they just... don't! The Sims 4 is fundamentally broken, and they won't throw the game out and start fresh, because the horse they're beating still isn't dead. Just bleeding and shambling.

This greed helped lead to the point we've reached today. Even with the uproar against My First Pet Stuff (A DLC for a DLC), it seemed enough people were content to buy such a tiny stuff pack because we got a whole new category for things just like it.

Kits. Dear lord, kits. These things aren't popular with the community, and it's clear to see why. Such meagre amounts of items might seem doable at $5 a pop, but they're adding up, and quick. Filled with lacklustre designs that only work well as a base for custom content, they're the peak of EA's lazy contributions to this game.

I mentioned custom content, so I suppose that's a horse out the stable now. Yeah, custom content is amazing. And that's because EA has no hand in it. Well, I should give them a little credit; the native mod support is an honestly nice touch! There's your first positive, EA.

Custom content is a general term for items created by the community. Clothes, furniture, accessories, you name it! With multiple dedicated sites to download it, and fan made tools that make creation easy, it's great! And by easy, I mean easy. I was making Pokemon shirts for my games at age 12. Just takes a little research. All these items come in two main styles; one more realistic (Alpha) and one to match the game's items (Maxis Match). Build up a good folder filled with gigabytes of fashion and get to work living your life in Create-A-Sim; don't forgot to buy a new SD card to fit it all in. You'll need it.

It's not just custom content that the community makes. There's also good old fashioned script mods. These have all sorts of functions; they can fix some in-game issues, add entirely new game mechanics, give you features that you always wanted (controllable pets comes to mind), and more. (More including the... infamous Wicked Whims and Extreme Violence mods. Ah, timeless classics). All these mods help breathe new life into the game and show how passionate this community can be, no matter how downtrodden by the source material.

These mods help to show how this game is actually fun at it's core. You might have read all this ragging and be baffled by my heel-turn, but it's true. Why else would I have put in all those hours? That core gameplay loop of letting your sims lead their lives is damn fun, and I can't help but enjoy it; even with everything EA is doing.

I think that others could enjoy it too if they started playing today. There is something here, at the heart of it. It's just coated in a decade of bloat and greed.

(This segment is a replacement for an old one that caused me issues, that I'm removing to keep this review safe. I think you can tell by the comments below and the tone of this review what that was, and you can take that as you wish.)

Anyway, EA can do one, and you should give Sims 4 a chance, if you like.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"This is my favorite game that I can't recommend. I love this game, as my playtime will tell, and I will continue to pour more hours into this game. I'm not giving a negative review because of the game's ""fun factor."" It's very destressing, it's chill, its difficulty is all in the hands of the players. The modding scene is great, and the creative possibilities are infinite. On paper, the Sims 4 seems like the dream game. A perfect game that even people who have literally never touched a game before in their life can pick up and play. In reality, EA has erected a massive series of walls that you have to scale to reach that state, and this is the crux of the review. The ultimate problem is, and is the whole reason I'm giving this a negative review, is recommending people to buy this game because of the aforementioned walls. To say that they have become untenable is an understatement. They are nigh insurmountable at this point.

The first wall, and this is the point where most people stop at, is the pricing. It being free-to-play as of October 18th does not save this from being HORRIDLY expensive through DLC cost. The base Sims 4 with no expansions or packs, makes the game EXTREMELY limited in scope as to what you can do. Want to be a spellcaster? Want to attend university? Have cats or dogs?  Have changing seasons in the weather? Form clubs? Get famous? Have a job? That's ALL locked behind DLC that is either the same price as the base game, or, get this, DOUBLE the price of the base game. All those things I listed? Those are SEPARATE DLCs! If you were to not get them on sale, it would run you a couple HUNDRED already! And this just getting started. On the store page, as I'm typing this right now, it lists 56 different DLC, and to buy them all in one fell swoop costs just short of a THOUSAND  dollars. Nobody in their right mind should make that investment, and I can't be of the mind to tell someone to spend that much on a single game.

Now, to play Devil's Advocate for a moment, this is only as bad if you buy it when it isn't on sale, which the game goes on quite frequently. Deep sales, in fact! Up to 75% a lot of things, which bring down the price for everything by a couple hundred dollars. In fact, with the Summer Sale that's coming up as of the time of writing this review, this game will most likely get significant price slashes. However, to counter that point, the asking price is still SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. The prices become more manageable, but it is still a SIGNIFICANT investment. More of an investment than, frankly, I think this game deserves. And considering how Sims 3 with everything still costs such an outrageous amount, it would seem that those prices aren't going anywhere for the time being. 

If a high asking price was all that kept people away, I suppose you could argue the point that not recommending a game you like because of pricing is silly. That if you put hundreds of hours in like I have, the price is ""worth it."" Perhaps that argument would have grounds and I would entertain it, if not for the fact that the game in of itself just fundamentally DOES NOT WORK with everything combined. These are the other walls, and this can become overwhelming for the inexperienced. Even if you buy everything and you jump in, the Sims 4 is a strange program that seemingly randomly decides to brick itself every so often, without you even really being the cause of it. There are so many bugs and glitches that have no fixes for it, merely ways to temporarily relieve of you of it, much like ibuprofen for a headache. And they aren't the silly, funny glitches  seen in Skyrim. 

For example, randomly, the game will begin to run under 30 frames after exiting build mode, and you solve it by merely pausing the game and unpausing it. Not a terrible bug but it's pretty much the epitome of the problems I have with this game: everything is just player made solutions rather than an official bug fix. It will happen again, and instead of just fixing it, EA just tells you what you can do to help yourself with it. You'll be doing this often, spending hours looking up some obscure error, through no fault of your own, because either Sims 4 randomly decides to brick your Resources.cfg after update and makes it impossible for you to play with CC of any kinds, or your anti virus somehow marks this entire game as potential ransomware, or the Sims 4 randomly just corrupt your save file and you're trying to figure out how to fix that. And that's just on the meta side of everything.

File headaches aside, the game itself just acts wonky as well, adding its own walls to scale. A cursory glance at the reviews for the DLCs illustrate the absolute nightmares that spawn with these additions, but I'll share some of the errors I've had on my end. I've had multiple instances where I tell a Sim to fulfill their hygiene need and their immediate first instinct is to...run out and clean a solar panel? In place of just taking a shower in one of the MULTIPLE showers that exist in that house? I tell them to fulfill their energy need, thinking they'll go to bed, and they'll either randomly decide to back float in the pool, or drink an incredibly irresponsible amount of coffee, like a third shift worker going off of only three hours of sleep.  Fixed all of this by manually telling them what to do. I've also had moments where I couldn't wash laundry because the game bugged out my washer and dryer, where the prompts for washing never came up. Only the prompts for putting the dirty laundry in and taking the dirty laundry out. Fixed by selling the set and then buying another. I've also had my weather permanently glitch itself into never changing at all. Where it snows all through winter and all through spring, causing me to have to buy a weather changing device in game and use it. Sims will randomly drop whatever they are doing to do some unrelated task, such as stop cooking to randomly mold some hunk of clay sitting in some corner of the room. Sometimes, my Sims will also stand still with the ""chat with (sim)"" action in the queue, but then never actually chat with that person,, for whatever reason, causing them to bug ouit and need them to be reset. The list goes on and on, and I think you've gotten the point already.

Again, these are fixed by just manually selecting actions, using console commands, and removing the bugged items in question. I know what you're thinking. Why are you complaining about bugs that have an in game solution? The issue is, again, that this is just player solutions for problems that aren't being fixed. You're paying hundreds of dollars for this game and the DLC. You'd expect a level of polish to behind this, but there isn't. Players shouldn't have to actively fight against a game they bought, only to find a bunch of band-aid, player made solutions a because the FEATURES IN GAME THEY PAID HUNDREDS FOR DOESN'T WORK AND EA DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO FIX THEM. 

It's all the same hackneyed excuse of ""there being so much in this game"" and sounding like they are some small game dev studio. All of this frustration after the ludicrous pay wall is just simply unforgivable, and to recommend people this game knowing the hours worth of troubleshooting and fixing I've had to do is like to encourage self destructive tendencies. I made the investment, I bought the steam edition to make a review. I sunk a lot both in time and money, and have got to a point where I can say I enjoy this game, perhaps through Sunken Cost reasoning and Stockholm Syndrome. But it required me having to scale multiple walls and slaying multiple beasts to get there, and that's just simply not a journey for everyone. I cannot look at someone and genuinely tell them to make the same investments I have, nor do I think EA should benefit from having people do so.

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"I bought this game during a Steam Sale back in December 2020 for $40.   The best $40 I ever spent.  I took my time with the game, and didn't finish it until November 2021.  I did every side mission and explored nearly every inch of the game.  I'm 44, and usually only have the time or energy to play on weekends.  I played for about 4 hours or so most Saturday mornings.  As a casual gamer I can definitely say the game is open to all playing styles and skill levels.  The story line was as good as a really good book.  The ending did a great job closing out all the story lines too.  The attention to detail by the developers was incredible.  You never know what you're going to deal with as you turn each corner, and every time what comes up is interesting and fun.  Often times I would just go off and explore the game's open world outside of any story lines.  I have an EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC ULTRA video card.  The ray tracing they added in mid 2021 was a marked improvement in the graphics, and the graphics were already awesome before the upgrade.  I couldn't recommend this game enough.

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"I've played a lot of games for a long time this one is most impressive! 
And being a 57 year old man that grew up in the days of Cowboys and Indian Movies & Shows I tell you if we had this to play as well those times would never had died and be just as popular today. 
I thought I knew a lot about our great country and the animal and bird life as well as plant life here but this game has taught me even more as well as even more apreciation for what we have and the beauty that needs to be explored. 
This is the first Red Dead game I have played and I just started playing it a few days ago and can hardly stop each day and can't wait to get back to it is the best compliment I can offer above and beyond what I have already mentioned! 
You don't know what your missing until you try it! 
Everything is truly alive from the people in the towns to the animals and wild life and the horses you learn to take care of and bond with and all go on with their lives with or without you. The stories you hear and become a part of or just soak up and listen to are well written and entertaining as well as the music in the background or being played by people around you! 
So much to experience and explore it's unbelieveable!

Take the time to watch the world around you see the Eagles and Hawks swoop down and grab a rabbit running or a fish out of the water or see the vultures and crows and ravens come and feed off a kill. See the fish jump for bugs or the Cyotties or a fox chase down and kill an animal. 

And see the human ugliness as well of the times the start of the KKK after the Civil War the burning of cross's 
and slave quarters and poor areas outside of towns for Blacks of the times outside of the plantations of the South. 

The attention to detail is off the scale the sounds and the visual beauty as well as the ugliness too! 

Choose the Man you want to be even as an Outlaw a heart of gold or a man of Evil. Either way take it all in or you have missed what has been created here a master piece.

EDIT: 
They say you can finish this game in 80 hours of play I have over 300 hours now and say I am not done yet too much you can easily miss if you rush through it from NPC random conversations and hidden things to find and do. Just remember one thing these times were brutal and hard! This is an  honest depiction story of the times so expect your heart strings to be pulled this is not a story book ending from Disney. Cowboy's rode hard, died young and fast and rarely does greed, revenge and murder go unpunished or is easily forgotten! With the invention of the telegraph and now the phone and news travel by train our great country seemed so much smaller and a lot harder to hide from the law.","Very Positive91% of the 493,010 user reviews for this game are positive.",game long impressive 57 old man grew day cowboy indian movie show tell time never_had died popular today thought knew great country animal bird life plant life taught apreciation beauty need explored red dead started day ago hardly wait best compliment offer already mentioned missing truly alive town animal wild life horse learn care bond life story hear soak listen written entertaining music background explore unbelieveable watch world eagle hawk swoop grab rabbit running fish water vulture crow raven feed kill fish bug cyotties fox chase kill an_emphasizedimal human ugliness time kkk civil war burning cross slave quarter poor area outside town black time outside plantation south attention detail scale sound visual beauty ugliness choose man outlaw heart gold man evil missed created master piece finish 80 hour 300 hour not_done easily miss rush non random conversation hidden thing remember time brutal hard honest depiction time expect heart string pulled not_a book ending disney cowboy rode hard died young fast rarely greed revenge murder unpunished easily forgotten invention telegraph phone news travel train great country smaller harder hide law
1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"I was having a beer in Valentine Saloon and some loud mouth drunk guy at a table was yelling about how many Indians he's killed and how everyone should thank him, what a stand up guy. I walked over and greeted him and he said ""Who the hell you talking to?"" then stood up and punched my hat right off of my head.
We punched the hell out of each other and were both covered in blood. My health was nearly gone but then he ragdolled and faceplanted the table and a message popped up on screen saying something like ""You can no longer use the barber"".

Turns out i just beat the crap out of the local barber.
The sheriff came, i surrendered and spent the night in a cell. I had to pay $4.

I went back to the saloon for another beer and a random guy walks up and talks about the fight i had the night before and how crazy it was.
This is just one of many small immersive things which have happened so far outside of the main story.

At first I found it (the story, gunplay, movement, animations) really slow and the missions quite same-ish, the game grows on you as it progresses, by the end of the main chapters, you are fully attached to the games characters.

It is not the best game I've played but it is a solid 9/10, the following on with the Epilogue is amazing and the credits that follow are also great too. 

Replayablity is there with being able to explore the open world, random encounters, hunting and side missions etc

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"This review is for the single player, spent 150 hours to reach 91% completion and would need maybe 50 or 100 more hours to 100% it. I didn't try the online yet, i'll add the review for that after i try it.

I wont review the story to avoid spoilers, but it's a long game with some excellent missions, as usual when it come to Rockstar games and the humor is spot on, characters are great and the story as a whole is a great prequel to the excellent Red Dead Redemption.

The game is not easy if you want to master everything, nothing hard if you want to jump from one mission to another, but it'll take you a bit of time to get familiar with all the activities that you can do, especially the hunting which is essential if you want to craft the best items in the game.

For the visuals, even while not at the ultra settings, this game is insanely beautiful, i never felt a world full with life as much as in RDR2, Rockstar went into each detail to create the last days of the Wild West and it's a huge payoff for the players, you really feel like you riding with a gang in the early 1900s. And with photo mode, whatever you are doing and wherever you are on the map, be sure that you'll end up with a nice photo. I'll add to that the dynamic weather and different environment that wont change just the looks but also the fauna and flora of the region.

Shooting is pretty satisfying with the dead eye mechanic and the slow motion 
Even the crafting is diverse, from food to ammo to tonics, also loved the weapon modifications, to make each weapon customized to a different look.

Map is pretty big for a game that uses a horse as the primary travelling method, you can fast travel easily using camp, train or stagecoach, but i dont advise that, you'll miss a lot of nice things like that, a lot of random events. Plus there is way too many things to collect that will take hours and hours to find them all, add to that around 100 challenges and you have over 200 hours of gameplay without even touching the online part of the game and even with all that time i'm sure that you'll miss a few of easter eggs or interesting places in this game.

It's an amazing game and to me one of the best games ever made, so it's highly recommended for anyone who have the patience to learn what this game have to offer. 

Thank you Rockstar for all the amazing moments i had playing this game!

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"Rockstar Games is known for setting benchmarks when it comes to their open world titles. Red Dead Redemption 2 is their best work to date, without a doubt. Unquestionably beautiful, vast and detailed. It breathes life. From the tiniest toad to the scary Grizzly bear, everything feels alive and convincing. It's an environment so well crafted that it makes you wonder whether it isn't a real world within your own computer. Non-playable characters have their own lives, with a routine that they follow religiously just like we do. Some do hard work, some drink all day, some mourn their loss(es). It's hard to believe it's just a video game. I remember when Skyrim had something similar and people couldn't believe how insanely realistic it was. Imagine that, but twice as convincing. That's RDR 2 for you. They feel so alive that you feel bad for killing them with your plethora of period-accurate weaponry. 
Evidently, a game is not solely made of environment and their inherent goodies. That's where the story mode comes in. And, as many of you may know by now, either from YouTube or any of the media portals you routinely visit for the daily dose of gaming news, it's a masterpiece. Storytelling is not an easy craft, but they have visibly dominated it after decades and decades of duly delivered benchmarks of how an open world game should be. They make it seem easy, almost as if anyone could do it. Memorable characters, insane character development just like we like it and then fantastic endings based on your own decisions. As linear as it may be, forcing you to do things their way rather than setting your imagination free and letting you decide how to approach a mission, it still allows you to take certain decisions that will shape the moral values of your character, therefore leading it to a specific outcome. Games don't often get the whole moral debate right, understandably so, because they are empty characters with a pre-recorded set of phrases and reactions that can't resonate with you. But Arthur Morgan is different. It's a rather captivating individual, that feels real. Real enough that you will often find yourself questioning whether to kill or spare someone, or if you should or not help that person in need. And inevitably feel the pain of uncertainty of the future - or the lack thereof - that lies ahead. 
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a western beyond all westerns. An adventure you can dive in yourself, and watch your character grow through all the hardships of the outlaw life. A novel-like main character that is a criminal, killer, cruel and savage but also a human being like all of us. And humanity wins, in the end. Arthur learns what it is to be human, and there is no better teacher than life itself. 
Would I recommend Red Dead Redemption 2? It would be a crime not to. As flawed as it may be in certain aspects like the slightly truncated gameplay, the typical Rockstar linearity and the underwhelming online mode, the story is something out of this world. It truly outstands. Goes above and beyond the average video game storytelling. It's something you've got to experience to understand. A must-play for every gamer out there.

This game is IN-SANE.
The attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.

The beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in. 
In fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time. 
Taking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours. 
Riding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times. 
I got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.

2161700,Persona 3 Reload,"The original Persona 3 was very much a diamond in the rough. An excellent story and a really fun game bogged down by the limitations of a system far too limited to show the intended beauty of the environments, a sparsity of content and a couple really bizarre design choices here and there.

This fixes everything, which is really on par for ATLUS remakes. There is a lot more character interaction that you might be used to from P4/5, with proper social links (if not arcana-based) for the entire crew and then some. The main story had some extra stuff added to fill in some gaps, and being able to interact with Strega is a huge deal as well.

Tartarus is still... [i]there[/i], and it's still the same randomly-generated predictable mess that it was before. But now it looks gorgeous, and the different blocks actually feel different from each other. A few additions to its formula such as the extremely challenging optional boss fights and the extra rewards help spice it up just enough to feel at least on par with P4's dungeons, which is a big improvement.

Both the combat and the social systems are at the deepest they've ever been in this series. The ability for some social links to unlock others, or the ability to reverse social links, has been completely removed from P4 onwards -- but this game brings those back, which is excellent. The addition of Theurgy gives each character a distinct role that they're encouraged to play, but it's in no way forced on you so you can still play your way.

It also goes without saying that the new talented voice cast does a phenomenal job of helping the game's story move along. If you're one of the people who play in English, then you're no longer stuck with the robotic and emotionless voice of the original game.

My only remaining complaint is the somewhat slow pacing at the start of the game, it takes forever to fully introduce its systems and to allow you to interact with its main cast properly. However, it's a shorter timespan than in the original, and there's a lot to do in the meantime.

I'd like to address a few additional concerns that I see some people bring up: [list]
[*] This does not have FES content. This one is... simply not true. All of the extras FES added to the main game are here. What is currently not included is Episode Aegis/The Answer, which is allegedly coming as DLC eventually. The Answer was [i]always[/i] a DLC (well, an append disc) in Japan, so this isn't too surprising.
[*] The soundtrack/artbook are locked behind custom executables. This is true, and was probably done by ATLUS so that they could also release them on consoles (as they don't have support for proper file management). If you want the actual files, they are trivially extracted from this Steam version, so it's still worth a purchase (if you care to have these things).
[*] No Kotone/FeMC. This is true. However, her presence is largely made redundant by introduction of social interactions for the male crew members, which was the main selling point for her other than just her being a girl. Her storyline also introduced a few flaws into the story of P3, breaking some of its themes and making a lot of the characters come off as much worse than intended, so that's not a playthrough I'd recommend to a new player. If you care about her simply because a female character is easier for you to identify with, I'm sorry, there's not much there can be done other than waiting for someone to mod her in or playing Portable. However, if you care about her because of the story improvements in her route, you'll find a lot of the same things done in Reload, and done better.

2161700,Persona 3 Reload,"Persona 3 is a very special game to me. Back in 2008, I randomly was looking for things to play during the summer break and decided to play Persona 3 FES which also introduced me to the overall Shin Megami Tensei franchise. As a teen who usually played puzzle, FPS and platformers during that time, the game was unique to me as it delves into complex themes such as death, identity, and the meaning of life which was something a high schooler would never usually give a second thought. It also paved way for me to look at and start reading visual novels which is one of my favorite consumable medias.

I know this isn't a review of the game specifically but this game is one of the few games that shaped me as a person today and I am glad to experience it again with QoL improvements, better graphics and improved gameplay because let's be honest, Persona 3, P3 FES and P3 Portable isn't a fun game to play anymore with everything that Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal had to offer gameplay wise. This version of the game at least makes the overall dungeon crawling aspect of the game bearable. 

There's a few things I don't like about how Sega bundled the Soundtrack and Digital Artbook as a Program and not their usual respectable file types but this game is an absolute gem.","Overwhelmingly Positive97% of the 7,943 user reviews for this game are positive.",persona 3 special 2008 randomly thing summer break decided persona 3 fe introduced shin megami tensei franchise teen usually puzzle shooter platformers unique delf complex theme death identity meaning life high schooler never_usually thought paved look reading visual novel favorite consumable medias specifically game shaped today glad qol improvement graphic improved honest persona 3 p3 fe p3 portable fun anymore persona 4 golden persona 5 royal offer wise version make dungeon crawling aspect bearable thing sega bundled soundtrack digital artbook program not_their usual respectable file type absolute gem

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"For years I was an every year, 1000s of hours, release day buyer for Madden. Madden 18 was so bad that I vowed to take a break for years to let them sort some shit out. Surely waiting 6 years would make M24 feel like an actual upgrade right? Nope, same old shit. For reference I am a franchise only player so IDGAF about MUT or anything else, my review is ""offline"" (it's actually forced online) franchise centric, considering this is supposed to be the official simulation experience of the NFL.

-Players feel sluggish, and just making them do what you want them to do is a struggle. Making these players do things they could do in real life is the whole point of a football game, but it still feels like running in quicksand. 

-Aggressive catch was useless in M18 and before, it's still useless. Same goes for possession WRs. Madden somewhere along the line decided that it should simply be impossible to complete a pass in traffic unless you're in MUT using Moss. An elite 95+ spec and CIT receiver 1 on 1 with a corner 6 inches shorter in real life is an auto throw and very likely a huge completion. In madden, it is either just dropped inexplicably, picked, or popped up in the air. There just isn't really an animation for catching a pass over a defender. It's utterly bizarre that this has gone unaddressed for a half a decade+. A very common type of receiver and play is simply not viable even 10% of the time in madden. I play with the Colts mostly, and Michael Pittman Jr. isn't Tyreek Hill, but he should be able to separate and make tough catches. But in madden there's simply no value in receivers who win via anything but speed and he isn't any fun to use. Make it make sense.

-these are NFL players, but sometimes it feels like I can't get them to do something I would be able to as a regular person because controls are so sluggish and unpolished. It isn't fun to control these guys, which is a pretty major part of a sports game.

-trench play still doesn't feel realistic. I have Quenton Nelson on my team but he doesn't feel powerful or smart at all.

-it's still very noticeable that the AI has very different rules for itself vs you, which is a terrible piece of game design. The beauty of the NFL is how coldly equal it is for everyone, and you don't get that from madden. Balls my players can reach they'll inexplicably short arm, while the CPU makes plays you know your players never would. 

-The commentators are still the worst in sports games. Delayed and nonsensical reactions. Massive moments don't feel like it, whereas they'll treat a missed preseason FG like it lost the super bowl. Madden should have multiple teams of commentators to keep it fresh, and have much more grandiose of a scope of lines recorded to pull from. If they were innovative I'd say they should start to look into use of AI to help make realistic real time reactions to stuff, I think the possibilities there are so exciting, but we all know EA doesn't innovate.

-still animation based gameplay

Now the thing I am even more qualified to comment on is the inner workings of franchise and team building. OOTP is the gold standard for this and I'll reference it a bunch because of that, but every sports franchise blows madden out of the water here. And again, disappointingly little progress has been made here, sometimes it is worse. 

-AI still feels less alive than any other sports video game. No game is perfect at immersion, but madden is truly bottom tier still. No adjustments are ever made by the CPU. Baffling team building logic. OOTP transports me to a new world, madden makes it painfully clear at all stops that it is a soulless video game made by a company that wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. 

-Bugs everywhere, and the menu is sooo slow. I'm running a 3070/5800x build and the gameplay runs fine fps wise, but the menus still are like pulling teeth. I have heard people with worse computers not even being able to open the game.

-Compounding slow menus, the UI is somehow worse than when I quit madden half a decade back. 

-Scouting, also somehow worse. You literally have to fire your whole scouting department and rehire a new one every preseason to scout effectively. If madden doesn't care to make scouting realistic or fun (this iteration of scouting is neither) then why make it part of the game at all? OOTP doesn't have a scouting mechanic- you hire a scout, with money that you could have used elsewhere, and then you simply have to put trust into that scout that their evaluations are better than other teams' scouts. If you skimped on paying for a great scout you'll have consequences, but paying for the best scout means less money for players, developments, etc. It is different, but 100X more immersive and realistic than madden. I love scouting if done right, but if you don't care to do it right, you end up with a process that just feels painful as it does in M24 and would be better off without it entirely.

-I heard some say madden's created draft classes are improved, but I don't really see it. It's still a shell of what it could be, and still isn't realistic at all. I don't see varied enough skillsets, I still see far too many bad athletes, I see unrealistic skillsets, the terrible scouting system. I did enjoy that scouting grades aren't so specific anymore-""day 3"" as a designation rather than ""round 5"" leaves it open to that player going anywhere from round 3 to undrafted, so if you like a guy you gotta take him. More realistic than before at least.

-not franchise specific per se, but one of my biggest sticking points that I honestly cannot believe has still not been addressed- positional designations. Mind mindbogglingly, draft prospects are *still* shoehorned into being ""LG"" or ""ROLB"" or ""FS,"" when in real life guys are seen much more generally as an OT prospect, an off ball LB prospect, a pass rusher, etc. It makes absolutely no sense, all it does is needlessly complicate things. How has this still not been made more realistic? Get rid of the left vs right BS, that is not how any draft analyst actually looks at prospects, and all it does it add multiple extra menus to scouting that are needless. Especially when madden lets you edit any offensive lineman to any other position with no penalty- another thing they should address.

-Not only do they still bizarrely specify things like left vs right guard, they use positional names out of 2001. LE/RE/DT/OLB/MLB for every team and scheme still? No edge rusher designation? Absolutely embarrassing for everyone involved with this game that this has not been updated in 20 years. Players on defense should be listed as such- interior defenders, pass rushers, off ball linebackers, safeties, corners, with variations within- tweener iDL-edge players, LB/S hybrids, etc. This has been how it works for a long time now IRL, and updating it would simplify it so much! Instead, we *still* have 4-3 teams signing pass rushers with 40 coverage to play off ball, or 3-4 teams with 240 pound 3techs. It hurts my brain how little effort and knowledge it would take for madden to make this change, and what a difference it would make in the quality of their product, and they still haven't. Shameful. 


I could go on, but what's the point? Whoever is making decisions for this franchise decided long ago that integrity or pride was much less important than the bottom line, so they'll keep putting out $70 roster updates designed to take money from small children via MUT. If the NFL understood the importance of a good official video game for a sport, they'd have some standards for EA, but it doesn't look like that will ever happen. TL;DR- buggy, boring, soulless, don't buy. I'll get my hours in, if only to get my money's worth and see if I can get a workable experience to last me another half decade before I give this company money again. But if you're any less than a football starved maniac who hasn't bought madden in 6 years, don't bother, really.","Mixed43% of the 5,008 user reviews for this game are positive.",year 1000 hour release buyer madden_emphasized 18 bad vowed break year sort shit surely waiting 6 year m24 actual upgrade nope old shit reference franchise idgaf mut else offline forced online franchise centric considering supposed official simulation nfl player sluggish struggle player thing real life football feel running quicksand aggressive catch useless m18 s_emphasizedtill useless go possession wrs madden along line decided simply impossible complete pas traffic unless mut moss elite 95 spec cit receiver 1 1 corner 6 inch shorter real life auto throw huge completion madden dropped inexplicably picked popped air an_emphasizedimation catching pas defender utterly bizarre unaddressed half decade common type receiver simply not_viable 10 madden colt mostly michael pittman jr t_emphasizedyreek hill able separate tough catch madden s_emphasizedimply no_value receiver win via speed fun sense nfl player feel able regular control sluggish unpolished fun control guy pretty major sport trench realistic quenton nelson powerful smart s_emphasizedtill noticeable ai different rule v terrible piece design beauty nfl coldly equal madden ball player reach inexplicably short arm cpu make play player never_would commentator worst sport game delayed nonsensical reaction massive moment whereas treat missed preseason fg lost super bowl madden multiple team commentator fresh grandiose scope line recorded pull innovative look ai help realistic real reaction stuff possibility exciting ea innovate animation based qualified comment inner working franchise building ootp gold standard reference bunch sport franchise blow madden water disappointingly progress worse ai feel alive sport video no_game perfect immersion madden truly bottom tier no_adjustments cpu baffling building logic ootp transport world madden make painfully clear stop soulless video company piss fire bug everywhere menu sooo slow running 3070 5800x build run fine shooter wise menu pulling teeth heard worse computer not_even able open compounding slow menu ui somehow worse quit madden half decade scouting somehow worse literally fire scouting department rehire preseason scout effectively madden care scouting realistic fun iteration scouting neither_then ootp scouting mechanic hire scout elsewhere simply trust scout evaluation team scout skimped paying great scout consequence paying best scout mean player development different 100x immersive realistic madden love scouting care process feel painful m24 be_emphasizedtter entirely heard madden created draft class improved it_emphasized s_emphasizedtill shell realistic varied skillsets far bad athlete unrealistic skillsets terrible scouting enjoy scouting grade specific anymore 3 designation rather round 5 leaf open anywhere round 3 undrafted guy ta realistic not_franchise specific per se biggest sticking point honestly cannot_believe not_been addressed positional designation mind_emphasizedbogglingly draft prospect shoehorned lg rolb f real life guy generally ot prospect ball lb prospect pas rusher make no_sense needlessly complicate thing not_been realistic rid left v b not_how draft analyst look prospect add multiple extra menu scouting needle especially madden let offensive lineman position no_penalty address not_only bizarrely specify thing left v guard positional name 2001 le dt olb mlb scheme no_edge rusher designation embarrassing involved not_been updated 20 year player defense listed interior defender pas rusher ball linebacker safety corner variation tweener idl edge player lb hybrid work long irl updating simplify 4 3 team signing pas rusher 40 coverage ball 3 4 team 240 pound 3techs hurt brain effort knowledge madden difference quality product shameful whoever decision franchise decided long ago integrity pride important bottom line putting 70 roster update designed small child via mut nfl understood importance good official video sport standard ea look happen tl dr buggy boring soulless hour worth workable last half decade company football starved maniac bought madden 6 year bother

        ""Free Safety"",
        ""Strong safety"",
        ""D tackle"",
        ""Corner"",

        ""Right End"",

    char choice;
    do {
        // Generate a random index to select a position name
        int randomIndex = std::rand() % positions.size();

        // Print the randomly selected position name
        std::cout << ""Random football position: "" << positions[randomIndex] << std::endl;

    } while (choice == 'y' || choice == 'Y');

This will literally give you a random player EQUALLY instead of a Tight end every fucking round. Tell your devs to be better. Also, stop building the game in C++.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"this game is absolutely broken! John Madden's family should consider suing EA for smearing the Madden name.
John Madden represented a love of sports, teaching sports, entertainment and a love of the game in general. Madden 24 doesn't offer any of that.
The NFL should consider giving the license to someone who loves the sport, rather than someone whose only interest is to get the kids money out of their pockets as quickly as possible.

The UI is very obviously the same and just as cumbersome, except now it takes 5 seconds for anything to happen after you select something. Great. It genuinely baffles me how the game can get buggier and worse every year with the marketing being 'we fixed everything wrong with the game and added things that were in FORKING MADDEN 05 for your nostalgia'. Like somehow adding things that never should have been removed in an incomplete capacity warrants a $70 pricetag. I genuinely feel scammed out of my money.

Yes, it's still fun to play simulation football and to play as your favorite players. Yes, some of the new physics stuff and celebrations are cool. But at the end of the day, I did not heed others' warnings about the fundamental faults of the game.

At its core, Madden is BROKEN. Players will get stuck on opponents and not know what to do, just run in place and screw up routes. There is a huge interception problem where defenders will come out of nowhere to pick you off, even if you made the correct read. A lot of the times, offensive and defensive AI are just absolute braindead idiots that do not react to plays like an actual human would. All of these problems are IMMERSION BREAKING.

This is quite possibly the worst Madden game EVER produced. I haven't bought one in a few years so I figured I was due. BIG MISTAKE. Do not believe the lies about improved anything or added features. The features added are either useless, broken or both. They're also just re-added features from old Madden games that are poorly re-implemented. 

-1 out of 5 running plays will have a holding penalty so it's basically pointless. I had to turn off holding completely to be able to run the ball.
-Controller will drop input at random either in menus or during plays. Happens more often in menus resulting in random scrolling.
-Route running gets broken during press coverage and receivers just run around random directions or right out of bounds. They also just stop running routes at random. Slant route? You meant stop running at the hash mark right? Picked.
-Random frame rate drops for no reason at all.
-Constant mini-freezing in menus when trying to call plays.
-Probably removed more features from franchise mode than they added, and the implementation on those added are awful copy and pastes from past games. 
-""Manage team"" is a whole menu just to rebuild your entire stadium, to the same 6 templates they had 10 years ago, or relocate. No upgrades, no renovations. Absolutely nothing new at all, just half way re-added features from old games.
-Absolutely ridiculous glitchy ball carriers breaking 10 tackles, spinning out of a massive pile up and running 80 yards for a TD. Don't worry though, most long runs get called back for holding even if it's 50 yards behind the play.
-The training camp drills are broken. They're either glithched to the point of being pointless (Pass rush tunnel drill. The linemen will follow you down the tunnel and get in the way) Or just about learning to exploit buggy AI (WR Red Zone Drill. The only way to get the top score is to run whip routes over and over again). The ""drills"" are pointless and have no application on how to play Madden or football.
-Commentary is the worst I've ever heard. Pointless rambling that has nothing to do with what is happening. Or things like ""That Ravens defense was really great last week in their win against Baltimore."" Zero quality control as usual.

My first instinct was to refund immediately and I should have listened. I'm going to play a few seasons of franchise mode and go back to College Football Revamped because NCAA 14 is a better game than any Madden in the last decade.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Well EA, you've done it. You have made (by far) the worst Madden Franchise game I've seen as a player since Madden 2005. The amount of stupid things that happen throughout your gaming experience is enough to give a 23 year old a heart attack. I primarily play Franchise mode with friends in my time on this game and the amount of problems are truly insane that I must break them down by literal aspects of the game. 

For starters, if it wasn't obvious I play as the Miami Dolphins for my franchise primarily on All-Madden and the defense is literally broken naturally that you must alter damn near every aspect of it to play it properly, unless you want Bradley Chubb and Jaelen Phillips dropping into coverage... Now, lets continue with the defensive issues. You cannot tackle. It's literally impossible. The running backs break every fucking tackle - whether its aggressive, conservative or hit stick, they're bouncing off dudes like crazy and the receivers are only slightly easier to tackle. CPU pass blocking is unparalleled in strength, they get so much time in the pocket its crazy, 85 overall speed rusher Jaelen Philips has a whopping 3 sacks through 10 games and 80 overall power rusher Bradley Chubb has just 4 on the other side of the line. The pass coverage reaction is abysmal which is disappointing as I had seen many clips that showed it being improved for this years version of the game, however my DB's who are literally Jalen Ramsay, Jevon Holland and Xavien Howard, get smoked every fucking play and don't play the ball at all; then if you make the coaching adjustments to play the ball you can write off every possible tackle after catch you even had a chance of as they will soar right by them without hesitation. Now, lets by chance say you get an interception... the CPU doesn't worry because the ancient tight end Mercedes Lewis will run down Jalen Ramsay in a straight away going the other direction. No fucking way that ever happens. 

Now lets discuss the offense, going inversely to the issues on defense. My players never break a tackle, only time it happens is if I get the spam A break tackle prompt and i hit it, but even then it only shows up when I am smack in the center of 5 defenders so whats the use. My pass blocking is horrendous, like last year I notice moments where my tackle doesn't even touch the defender rushing. I'm running for my life and get unbelievable negative plays as a result and even with adjustments being made such as keeping a tight end in or a half back to pick up some stray blocks it just doesn't matter. Then this fucking momentum meter has some severely stupid enhancements - and let me be clear, I do like the momentum meter. However - in what situation does momentum make it so I don't even know my receivers??? That is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Another issue I run into is in my season with the Denver Broncos I can't throw a go route to save my life. Dude will be wide open with 5 yards separation from the receiver and that sucker gets under thrown every time - its amazing. I have been Tyreek Hill with the ball in my hands on a straight away and a man chased me down running at an angle up the field, again, never going to happen. 

Even special teams is broken. I had 3 games in the rain and windy, the wind is not accurate. Playing in clear conditions my kicker can hit from 62 going full power, playing with 13 mph winds going in favor of me the ball came up way short from 59 out. Playing in rain with the wind going 16 mph up and to the right, aimed the kick ever so slightly to the left to adjust for it and the ball went hard left like i was aiming in to section G on my left hand side. 

Fix the fucking game. Make the game fair. Make harder difficulties be harder because they play smarter not make them broken and literally impossible to tackle. Make it so they have fucking clock management for fuck sake, for yet another year the CPU will run out of time going into half time on the 25 yard line in clear field goal range when they started their drive with 3 full time-outs. Game has promise but has sever game breaking issues in key spots that make it no fun.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"The last iteration of Madden football I've played was Madden 12 back when it was still a decent game.  I've been playing Madden football since Madden 94 so I'm pretty old.  I've watched the Angry Joe reviews and read a lot of the negative reviews for the last few years of Copy and Paste Football.  STILL... I decided after weighing the pros and cons (and after a strong pint of Sierra Nevada Imperial Stout) that maybe, just maybe, it has gotten better and maybe things have changed and the people being salty about it are just spoiled.  So I bought it.

After taking forever to download, I loaded the game which allowed me to pick my team (Raiders) and adjust the QB throwing accuracy mechanisms.  Cool right?  Well, after I completed that pass from Jimmy G to Davante... it freezes.  It just froze.  OK, no problem, I'll just run task manager, shut it off and restart right?  Open the game again, attempt a practice mode, game freezes while on the load screen.  I try again, restart game, pick practice mode, loading screen, game freezes again.  WTF?!?

Other than my CPU being a bit old which hasn't affected my gaming experience with games like Red Dead Redemption 2, NBA 2k23, Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3 etc..., I have all of the recommended specs on my computer.  Nvidia Geforce 1660, 32GB of RAM, well over 50GB of HD space, all the software requirements with DirectX and this game just freezes every time I try to play some NFL football.  

Fine, I'll lower the graphics requirements on the settings menu so I do that and IT STILL FREEZES!!! I updated my drivers on Geforce Experience, same freezing.  After an hour or so of this, I've had enough.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Ordinarily i wouldn't have anything to say about this game, but after reading a bunch of existing reviews and deciding to just say screw it and buying it, i feel i must share my perspective, in case anyone else out there is in a similar situation as i was.
I noticed fairly early on that like 80-90% of the negative reviews are from people who have bought every single iteration of the game for the last decade-plus. the last one i played was Madden 2000 for the Playstation 1 back when i was 6 years old. I have absolutely no frame of reference for all the little (again, to ME they're little) details with which most of them have complaints.
My friend and I were looking for non-shooter games we could play cross-platform PC to PS5, and since we've been watching more college and NFL games together and i've been teaching him the little i know about it, he said he'd like to try a football game. As luck would have it, this game gives us exactly what we were looking for - cross-platform football.
Is it a perfectly refined and polished game? no. sadly, very few games today are. some of the menus are a little laggy and unresponsive, and there are occasional moments where you have to ask yourself ""just what the hell happened on that play?"" but overall, i've been having a great deal of fun jumping back into the Madden franchise with this game.
If you're like me and haven't played a Madden game in a long time and are just looking to get back into some football, don't let the negative reviews put you off. It's a fully-functioning game, i haven't run into anything i could describe as ""broken"" yet. again, not perfect, but if you can nab this game at any kind of a discount i do believe it's worth it.","Mixed43% of the 5,008 user reviews for this game are positive.",ordinarily reading bunch existing review deciding screw buying share perspective case else similar situation noticed fairly early 80 90 negative review bought single iteration last decade plus last madden 2000 playstation 1 6 year old no_frame reference detail complaint friend non shooter game cross platform pc ps5 watching college nfl game teaching football luck give exactly we_emphasizedre cross platform football perfectly refined polished no_sadly game today menu laggy unresponsive occasional moment ask hell happened great deal fun jumping madden franchise madden long football negative review fully functioning describe broken not_perfect nab kind discount believe worth

At the start of most plays there is awkward slowdown... and when I saw slowdown I mean that ish drops to a slide show... EA might be trying to tell people to go do this or this to fix it.....

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"Here is my take from a 39 year old who grew up loving the jets on N64 with Curtis Martin and the Z button being the Juke move that broke players ankles like crazy and then played most Maddens until 2016 then stopped mainly because  they put in designing your own plays and having your own playbooks then stopped that.

Some things you must know.  
1.) i rarely play it online
2.) Ultimate team is not something i get into because it just feels like those PTW ""free"" games on a mobile ap that means whoever has the biggest wallet wins.  
3.) i enjoy playing franchise mode
4.) i play on simulation
5.) I dont use the sticks for much of the hitting or ball placements except in rare occasions as its just to much to relearn all the time 

Its a solid football game.    Its far from perfect and there can be a lot of things that could be improved, but its got the players in the NFL, its got stats, whether you agree with them or not is subjective, tit plays well.  I run the game on my laptop and i use my Refurbished deck, which the only reason i even got it was the sale price and the additional 20% refurbished version was a steal for this madden game.  I do have to run it in streaming mode but once i run it in streaming mode the deck controls work perfectly and its fantastic.  Now if they made it work fully just on the Deck Alone... i feel like they might hit another market out there.   

I say all this so you understand, i run the game on my LAPTOP gaming computer with 16 gigs of ram a 3050 and a I5 CPU, that streams the game to my Deck and i just turn the deck to 10 fps and watts to use it as a controller only and get 6-8 hours of battery off of it and watch the game on my laptop or use an HDMI cord to plus the laptop into the TV and play it that way.   

I don't experience input lag, in fact this is the first madden in such a long time i can remember enjoying the running game A LOT in.  Blockers picking up blocks is a huge thing.  Having a shitty blocker in front of you with bad awareness or run block stats is really noticeable.   (Makes me really wish they would put more love in to the full backs so that they would be as effective as they are in game but small gripe)   The running in the game is just crisp.  the days of tacklers just brushing against you to tackle you while engaged must have stopped a while ago.  The holes open and close in zone running schemes in ways that feel like you can pick the hole and run through.  

The passing can seem pretty interesting as i have seen line backers vary their depth against the same play, albeit very rarely but  i have seen it, and the speed of receivers and route running ability is still pretty damn paramount.  I quite enjoy taking the game, and just playing it.  Its not a game i want to buy at 70$ USD, honestly id buy it at launch if they made the single player game 30 or 40$ USD at launch and sold the multiplayer separately.  Madden to me is best played in the house with people around so that if you want to talk shit or be bitter you have to do it face to face.  Want to try to run out the clock?  take the verbal barbs of being called all kinds of names for ""not playing the game"".  

This game is not transcendent or some kind of perfect football game by any means but for fans of teams... especially those teams that are not playing great in a  season it certainly quenches the thirst for sure.  I wont bu the game at full price  maybe ever again, but all these reviews that say its terrible?  Just don't buy it for a few years and keep playing the same one, eventually the game will feel good again.  Its not an every year purchase unless you want to chase that ultimate team money sink...

1085660,Destiny 2,"With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:

This overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.

The gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.

The game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (""Darkness Zones"" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). 

With that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (""Last Wish"" from Forsaken, ""Garden of Salvation"" from Shadowkeep, ""The Deep Stone Crypt"" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). 

Of the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)

Don't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.

Some stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.

For anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (""What are random rolls? Which do I keep?"") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. 

The fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (""Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?"") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.

If you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the ""learning the ropes"" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]

Eyes up, guardian.

Footnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:
-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.
-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.
-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. 
-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.

-----------------
TL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.

    [/tr]
[/table]

[h2]Pros[/h2]
[b]1.Gunplay Par Excellence:[/b]
The gunplay is a symphony of power and precision, delivering impactful, satisfying shots. The handling feels robust, and there's an unmatched thrill in sniping an opposing guardian. While there's room for some balance improvements, the core gunplay is undeniably excellent.

[b]2.Dungeon and Raid Mastery:[/b]
The dungeons and raids seamlessly blend puzzles, combat, parkour, and epic boss battles. To conquer a raid, communication is key, particularly when your team comprises friends. However, with random team members, prepare for potential chaos.

[b]3.Exquisite Exotic Perks:[/b]
Destiny 2 shines through its exotic perks, offering a wide spectrum of abilities that can revolutionize your playstyle. From health restoration on melee kills to reflecting projectiles while sliding, these exotics enhance replayability and experimentation

[h2]Cons[/h2]
[b]1. DLC Dependency:[/b]
Although the base game is free, accessing endgame content and unique gear necessitates investing in DLCs. Playing Destiny 2 without these feels like munching on plain fries without salt – possible but significantly less satisfying.

[b]2.Lone Guardian's Lament:[/b]
For those without friends in the Destiny 2 universe, navigating endgame content can be an arduous task, often marred by random teammates who may not be on the same page. Playing Destiny alone can become monotonous, and the solo experience is, for some, mentally taxing.

[b]3. PvP Pandemonium:[/b]
The broader Destiny community may seem welcoming, but the illusion of friendliness crumbles in the crucible of ranked PvP. The prevalence of entitled, non-communicative players who vent frustration after underperforming can sour the PvP experience.

[b]4. Content Vanishing Act:[/b]
Destiny 2's practice of ""vaulting content"" – removing previously paid-for content with the promise of potential reintegration – is deeply frustrating. It's a surefire way to alienate players, as entire planets vanish, extensive storylines disappear, and certain gear becomes unobtainable.

[b]5. Matchmaking Mayhem:[/b]
Destiny 2's matchmaking can be bewildering, leading to situations where you and your friend face opponents with thousands of hours of experience, while your teammate barely contributes. Serious gameplay requires pre-made teams.

[h2] Bugs & issues[/h2]
Ghost melee attacks and unreliable revives are a source of understandable frustration. In critical moments, these issues can lead to unexpected defeats, causing irritation, anger, and even disappointment.

[h2] Technical[/h2]
With an i5 10400f, 2070 Super, 32GB RAM, and a 280Hz 1080p monitor, you can comfortably run Destiny 2 at mid-to-max settings, maintaining an average of 180fps in PvP. While occasional drops to around 140fps may occur, stability issues are rare. A decent PC setup should provide smooth performance.

[h2]Verdict: Good, but not great[/h2]
Destiny 2 offers a thrilling and enjoyable PvP experience, complemented by unique armor and weapons, as well as outstanding dungeons and raids. Yet, the game's drawbacks are too prominent to overlook, warranting a 7/10 rating. It's good but not without significant flaws.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.
I've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.
It's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.
I bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.
Forsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.
The game may be ""Free to play"" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.
Yes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:
Raids, high quality but the same ones every time
Strikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones
Dungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety
Seasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story
Crucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps
Gambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool
Seasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season
None of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.
And it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that ""by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps"" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.
And getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:
Overwhelming
Confusing
No sense of clear direction
All the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc
Why was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)
Any many more comments that made them not want to play the game.

I know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Until the senior leadership team (SLT) and Pete Parsons resigns, I see no point in continuing to play this game.

SLT are solely responsible for the current state of Destiny that has been slowly simmering up until this point. Few Examples here:

- A downright terrible and offensive Lightfall expansion (that cost $50 at launch BTW)
- Lack of consistent ritual content, it took HOW MANY YEARS AND EMPTY PROMISES to get more Crucible maps? 
- The past two or so years have had issues with power creeping and loot feels less and less meaningful each season. Why bother chasing new stuff? its too late to address this now.
- Seasonal content structure is stale and boring. People are tired of playing boring seasonal activities that irrelevant and throw away after a season. This has been a recurring thing since Season TWO.
- Nobody at Bungie can decide if the non endgame content should be hard or easy. Constant whiplash of buffs and nerfs, its impossible to keep up. 
- Predatory monetization and over abundance of micro transactions. $50 expansions with $50 deluxe editions. $20 armor sets. Like when is enough?
- Inconsistent quality of story telling and plot delivering. How can this be some sort of epic conclusion when the past 9 years have seen one good campaign (The Witch Queen) and everything was mediocre to good at best? Hell, before Beyond Light, a large chunk of the story telling was in lore books hidden away. No matter how The Final shape ends up, good or bad, will it feel fulfilling? Hell no!
- The lack of the new player experience. This has been a problem since they vaulted a bunch of content in Beyond Light. Its been over 3 years since that happened HOW is there STILL no adequate new player experience? People have been asking for this and we still have yet to see anything meaningful.


I could keep going but this is off the top of my head. I'm so tired of the ""we hear you"" and promises that never get fulfilled. SLT could have led their team of very talented developers to fix and address the game's core pain points. But they are too busy ignoring their own team's feedback and player feedback. Instead, they are figuring out what the best way to further monetize and exploit players for more money is. 

I will no longer support Destiny or Bungie until their SLT is gone. They think they know what is best for the game but they have zero idea what is needed for a healthy state of the game and refuse to change. And when their vision fails, they layoff the people who implemented their vision instead of taking responsibility. How is that fair? Destiny is one of the best examples of a ""what if"". So much missed potential due to a few individuals who seek profit and money over anything else. Look at what happened at 343i, they cleaned up shop and Halo Infinite is slowly and surely getting into a better spot. Thats what happens when you put the person who led the fix of the disastrous Master Chief Collection as studio head.

I love this game. I hate saying this as if its some sort of +1 over other people to make my opinion worth more than others, but up through Season of the Deep, I was playing every single season / content drop since the Destiny 1 beta (except season of the worthy). But I am SO tired of the constant whiplash of good times and bad times, so its time to stop for good. It shouldn't have to be this way. I have met some great people playing this game and it sucks I cannot continue to play Destiny with them. Some of my favorite gaming moments and memories are from this game. But in its current state, stay away from this game, especially new players, there are way better ones out there that respect your time.","Very Positive80% of the 583,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",senior leadership slt pete parson resigns no_point continuing slt solely responsible state destiny slowly simmering example downright terrible offensive lightfall expansion cost 50 launch btw lack consistent ritual took year empty promise crucible map past year issue power creeping loot feel meaningful season bother chasing stuff late address seasonal structure stale boring tired boring seasonal activity irrelevant throw season recurring season bungie decide non endgame hard easy constant whiplash buff nerfs impossible predatory monetization abundance micro transaction 50 expansion 50 deluxe edition 20 armor set inconsistent quality telling plot delivering sort epic conclusion past 9 year good campaign witch queen mediocre good best hell light large chunk telling lore book hidden no_matter final shape end good bad fulfilling hell no_the lack problem vaulted bunch light 3 year happened no_adequate asking meaningful top head tired hear promise never_get fulfilled slt led talented developer fix address core pain point busy ignoring feedback feedback figuring best monetize exploit player no_longer support destiny bungie slt best zero idea needed healthy state refuse vision fails layoff implemented vision taking responsibility fair destiny best example missed potential due individual seek profit else look happened 343i cleaned shop halo infinite slowly surely spot thats happens led fix disastrous master chief collection studio head love hate saying sort 1 opinion worth others season deep single season drop destiny 1 beta except season worthy tired constant whiplash good time bad time good met great suck cannot_continue destiny favorite gaming moment memory state stay especially player one respect

1085660,Destiny 2,"2017: Bought Destiny 2 & Season Pass for like $100. Did pretty much everything there was to do in the base game, Curse of Osiris and Warmind. Was sorely disappointed about the lack of content and amount of things to do. I had a good time with it, but I ultimately wrote the game off as a loss and walked away. Laughed at the thought of a year 2 season pass after getting burned so hard the first time.

2018: Pretty much forgot Destiny 2 existed.

2019: Continued forgetting Destiny 2 existed until October 1st. Decided to give New Light a try because screw it why not. I'm completely overwhelmed with how much the game has grown and the sheer amount of things to do. The game did a full 180 from what it was last time I played it. Within a couple days of New Light I went ahead and bought Forsaken and Shadowkeep because I felt like Bungie finally earned my money. Looking forward to reaching the light cap again, min/maxing stats and going for perfect weapon rolls.

I'm so glad Bungie chose Steam over Epic. If Destiny 2 had gone to Epic instead this review wouldn't exist and Bungie wouldn't have my money.

1085660,Destiny 2,"They fired Michael Salvatori who worked with Marty O'Donnell way back when to create the iconic Halo music and has been Destiny's music lead since D1, they fired Michael Sechrist who composed tracks like Deep Stone Lullaby and Queen's Oracle, they fired the community managers, they fired the social media team, they fired some of the production team, they fired some of the art team, they fired some of the recruitment team, they fired some of the legal team and they fired some of the QA team.

They did this at this specific time in the month deliberately as employee benefits last only until the end of the month. A lot of employees had unvested shares because of the Sony acquisition as part of staying with the company, but now those shares go back to Bungie.

The employees found that they had been fired on the day they had to leave. Some team managers were not told who on their team had been fired. Some employees were seen crying at their desks by other employees who were also fired who have spoken up about it anonymously. Employees were not allowed to say goodbye or exchange contact details.

The ""Light and Darkness"" saga comes to an end. A sci-fi, fictional story about standing up to the darkness, to evil, and fighting for the light, for what is good. It's ironic that in the real world Bungie are the darkness getting rid of those who have been part of the company's identity for years - decades even, and who have been instrumental in shaping a lot of our favourite memories we have of Destiny. But it's over now.

We blamed Microsoft for Bungie's problems, then we blamed Activision for Bungie's problems and before we can blame Sony for Bungie's problems it's revealed that it's Bungie who are responsible for Bungie's problems and great hard-working talented people have to pay the price for bad management.

This is Bungie's Final Shape.

1085660,Destiny 2,"[h1]Not free to play...[/h1]
So you want to try Destiny 2? I could easily recommend trying the game out to see if it is your cup of tea; just know the free to play is a lie. Nintendo said it best, this game is truly a ""Free to Start"" game, as soon in you will be hit with pay walls for content. This game runs on 3 player and 6 player activities, keep this in mind if you are playing with friends. Now what do you get with Free to play:

7 ""Open World"" spaces
3 PvE modes
1 Competitive PvE 
3 PvP modes*
2 PvP event
2 Raids
1 Dungeon

[h1]About Bungie[/h1]
When you play a F2P, it is all about the community and the developer, not so much about the game. Bungie has proven themselves to be a worthy developer for this franchise and future ones. They care about their community enough to provide a majority of feedback changes; however they are tone deaf to certain groups in the community. Their focus has definitely shifted from PvP quite a bit since Destiny 1, most of the paid content now is PvE. To be honest a majority plays the PvE so this makes since on the business side. They are completely against gatekeeping, and want all community members to enjoy all aspects of the game. Due to how their development structure is, it can feel like updates aren't arriving in a timely manner to address feedback, which is why the community has so much ire with Bungie.
[h1]The Community[/h1]
Majority of the playerbase for this game are die hard fans of Bungie, and we know what they are capable of, and thus hold them to high standards. Because of this you'll find a majority of the community has a love/hate relationship with the game. Most players are accepting of new players, especially myself I love to show people through their first time with new content and a good majority are. However like any community there is a good portion of the population who are toxic, which has shrunk significantly with the changes Bungie has made. Gatekeeping is one of the biggest topics discussed about the community, and I can say everything you heard is true. 
[h1]The 2%[/h1]
This community has a problem with Gatekeeping content over harsh requirements and generally are xenophobic, primarily at the end-game. The 2% of the community is completely unwilling to teach or have anyone new play the game as they already formed their niches. However this behavior, has been declining massively, I play with the 2% almost regularly and can say this has declined significantly enough that new players should not see this behavior anymore; unless you are unlucky.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Bungie has a large focus on making the game-feel be the best it can be. They love to recycle content, it is kind of their thing, but they like to do it in creative ways to make it feel fresh. If it ain't broke. Most will be turned off by that, but realistically you play a Bungie game for that solid gameplay, and if they added new content that is a nice bonus. They usually take a long time to perfect this game feel, which really hampers their development time considerably. If you been looking for FPSs that ""feel"" great to play, than you came to the right place. However the physics engine is extremely dated, and is due for a massive upgrade; which Bungie is aware of physics issues. 
[h1]My recommendations[/h1]
If you get into this game and decide to purchase any expansion content, I made reviews for each one with the lens of a new player in mind. But if you want my top recommendations, I would say Lightfall or Witch Queen are great start for players, each one however has it's own focus that I'd recommend reading my reviews on. Lightfall for the gameplay, Witch Queen for the Story. 

[h1]Strikes[/h1]
Strikes are pretty mind numbing, which Bungie has realized this and have mixed in seasonal content into the playlist. However it is still possibly one of their most mind numbing experiences, closely tied to patrols
[h1]GM/Nightfalls[/h1]
Do you enjoy dying in 1 hit? Dealing with bullet spongy enemies? Than this mode is just strikes, but beefed up to ridiculous levels. GMs are gatekept heavily by both Bungie, and the community; they are the hardest activity to get into. 
[h1]Patrols/Open World[/h1]
The open world spaces can range heavily, from highly detailed with secrets, to barren wastelands with no content in them. Generally newer content has focused on keeping these areas interesting with more secrets to discover.
[h1]Crucible[/h1]
PvP has improved, however a majority of PvP in this game is making builds that ruin the fun for everyone else, with 1 hit mechanics and other annoying things. However if you are the one dishing it out, it can feel like a power trip. PvP functions similarly to arena shooters with a loadout system, no weapons appear on the map, but they try to emulate that with Heavy ammo spawns.
[h1]Gambit[/h1]
Bungie's red-headed step child game type, a competitive PvE mode. 2 Teams race to kill a boss before the other one does. The mode can be fun, but matchmaking really ruins this gametype if you cannot get good matches.
[h1]Trials[/h1]
This mode is the one you hear streamers talk about the most, the pinnacle PvP activity. This mode is generally full of sweaty try hards who gatekeep the lighthouse from anyone who dares to try to go flawless.
[h1]Iron Banner[/h1]
A timed PvP event, which honestly is when the most creative builds come out for PvP. Iron Banner is definitely an experience that I think every player should try once since it is a time when most players don't try to run ""meta"" loadouts. 
[h1]Dungeons[/h1]
Dungeons are like diet raids, they are full of puzzles that are pretty simple to comprehend and are limited to 3 players. They can give you a taste of what end-game content is like.
[h1]Raids[/h1]
The pinnacle of end-game, not as hard as other games that have ""Raid-like"" events. Each raid plays differently, I usually compare raids to playing a custom game in Halo 3, as it has the same kind of feel as one. Bungie keeps their raids relatively simple to comprehend, however they are challenging, and I recommend any new player try to do one at least once; with a team that wants to teach.

[h1]The verdict[/h1]
Since this game is ""F2P"" I can easily recommend that you try it out and see if you like it first, what do you have to lose? I can recommend Destiny 2 to anyone who is looking for a FPS game to pass time or are tired of playing shooters that just don't feel right. As Bungie continues to curate content to remove the gatekeeping from the game, I hope to see that 2% go up even higher as new talent try this game, and decide they are up for the challenge.","Very Positive80% of the 583,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_free destiny 2 easily recommend trying cup tea lie nintendo best truly soon pay wall run 3 6 activity mind friend 7 open world space 3 pve mode 1 competitive pve 3 pvp mode 2 pvp event 2 raid 1 dungeon rotator change daily bungie f2p community developer not_so bungie proven worthy developer franchise future one care community provide majority feedback change tone deaf certain group community focus definitely shifted pvp bit destiny 1 paid pve honest majority play pve make business side completely gatekeeping community member enjoy aspect due development structure update arriving timely manner address feedback community ire bungie community majority playerbase die hard fan bungie capable hold high standard majority community love hate relationship player accepting player especially love good majority community good portion population toxic shrunk significantly change bungie gatekeeping biggest topic discussed community heard true 2 community problem gatekeeping harsh requirement generally xenophobic primarily 2 community completely unwilling teach already formed niche behavior declining massively 2 regularly declined significantly player not_see behavior anymore unless unlucky bungie large focus best love recycle kind creative way fresh broke turned realistically bungie solid nice bonus usually long perfect hamper development considerably fps great physic engine extremely dated due massive upgrade bungie aware physic issue recommendation decide purchase expansion review lens mind top recommendation lightfall witch queen great player focus recommend reading review lightfall witch queen strike strike pretty mind numbing bungie realized mixed seasonal playlist possibly mind numbing experience closely tied patrol gm nightfall enjoy dying 1 dealing bullet spongy enemy mode strike beefed ridiculous level gm gatekept heavily bungie community hardest activity patrol open world open world space range heavily highly detailed secret barren wasteland no_content generally newer focused keeping area interesting secret discover crucible pvp improved majority pvp build ruin fun else 1 mechanic annoying thing dishing power trip pvp function similarly arena shooter loadout no_weapons appear map emulate heavy ammo spawn gambit bungie red headed child type competitive pve mode 2 team race kill bos mode fun matchmaking ruin gametype cannot_get good match trial mode hear streamer talk pinnacle pvp activity mode generally sweaty hards gatekeep lighthouse dare flawless iron banner timed pvp event honestly creative build pvp iron banner definitely player t_emphasizedry meta loadouts dungeon dungeon diet raid puzzle pretty simple comprehend limited 3 player taste raid pinnacle not_as hard game raid event raid play differently usually compare raid custom halo 3 kind bungie keep raid relatively simple comprehend challenging recommend want teach verdict f2p easily recommend lose recommend destiny 2 shooter pas tired shooter bungie continues curate remove gatekeeping hope 2 higher talent decide challenge

1085660,Destiny 2,"The end of an era. I've wrote two reviews for this game, because of how much I enjoyed it.
One during Witch Queen's release, one during Lightfall's release.

Whilst I never recommended the game, it was purely due to the monetisation of the game, and how challenging it was for a new player to get into the game.
I have always praised the gameplay within these reviews, because to me, Destiny 2 is a very enjoyable experience, mechanically speaking.

But now I cannot recommend this game at all, due to the upper management of Bungie killing the dev team and their passion for this game.

Upper management will refuse to listen to what the devs want to implement, whilst forcing more monetisation in. They will refuse to let the devs tone back microtransactions, or focus on what the community wants, because they want to chase a bottom line.

Recently, 100 Bungie employees, 8% of the total company, were laid off because Lightfall didn't meet inflated revenue projections.

Upper management is killing this game, slowly but surely. And until that changes, I cannot recommend this game.

1085660,Destiny 2,"I love this game and have been playing since launch (I also played D1), but this review isn't for or from me.

I have heard Destiny 2 described as: ""Destiny 2 is great for people who already play Destiny 2"".

I have had 3 people I know try to get into D2, with none of them having experience with D1 or Original D2, Curse of Osiris/Warmind.
They have all had the same experience, get in and play past the tutorial and then get very overwhelmed. Be somehow overwhelmed with all the activities but underwhelmed with the loot they receive. Finally finding a gun they like and having to immediately unequip it for something else as a new player high power level guns drop as every drop, but they’re all blue so they all feel like a wet noodle during any content that matters. A big gripe a lot of them had was the loot in general. The amount of times I got ""Oh man that's a cool gun, how do I get that"" or ""Oh damn your character looks SIYUCK! How can I get that armour"" and I have had to say things like ""Oh you can't anymore it was from a past season"" or ""Oh it was a past season weapon that you could focus but now it's a random world drop so you just have to hope you get lucky enough for it to drop randomly, and then be lucky enough for it to be a decent roll. rng on rng on rng baby!"" FOMO sucks and just shouldn’t be a thing.

“Why does everything cost so much” – A dude I know. I think he meant this both DLC $$$ wise (We’ll ignore that) but also in game at the time, legendary shards and upgrade materials are a ball-ache to get if you are a casual player. With everything costing more of them and now weapon crafting being changed to have them as a cost, it’s so hard to keep up as a new light.

They have also recently made the game harder (or in their words “more rewarding”) to play. Which is fine, I love to be challenged in games. But the not-so-much loot we were already getting stayed the same. So it took longer to get the same amount of loot. But wait then we got less loot. So now we are taking longer and fighting harder enemies to get less shitty loot than we were getting before, the vast majority of which we auto-dismantle anyway. The time investment to gear reward ratio feels so bad as things are right now.

I get that bugs happen in games, but it feels like a kick in the balls as a player when bugs that effect the player in a negative way are left to simmer (without communication) for multiple seasons while bugs that benefit the player (lookin at you rahool’s dismantling shop of mystery) have action/parts disabled within a few days. Just seems to show where the priorities are.

This is one of those games where the community is incredible, the lore is spicy (although lightfall campaign?? Not sure about that one chief.) but the game just seems to be the best there is in it’s field so it is stagnating. It happens with other games/game genres, there is no competition, so they aren’t forced to improve (Don’t get me wrong strand kinda slapped). I know there have been countless “Destiny Killers” but they all end up sucking and feeling dry, at least with Destiny we can feel dry in the comfort of the game we have been playing for 5 years, more if you include D1.

EDIT:

I am making an addition to this review and keeping it as negative, heck I would make it more negative if I could. Bungie has announced that the price of the season passes going forward is going up from 1000 silver to 1200 silver, call that what you will, inflation, greed, whatever. For me that part is what it is.. It’s only 200 silver.. right… right? The thing that gets me is that Bungie is doing the scummy mobile game microtransaction schtick of not having a silver bundle that gives you that amount. So, you need 1200 Silver right? Okay cool well for $14.95AUD you can get a bundle that gives you (as it’s worded in the store) “1000 +100 BONUS”. So you are 100 silver short of being able to buy the pass? So that means you have to purchase either the next bundle up (2000 + 300 BONUS Silver for $29.95AUD). Or you have to purchase the 1100 silver bundle and one of the bundle below that one (500 Silver for $7.55AUD) Totalling your silver purchases to 1600 Silver for $22.50AUD.

This also brings me to the topic that Destiny 2 is the only game I have played that has a battle pass that doesn’t give you some of the “themed premium currency” back in the pass. COD gives you COD points back, Siege gives you credits back, Fortnite does it. You are able to purchase one battlepass, complete it and save your credits for the next one. Not in Desty 2, spend more money next season you hobo’s!

So you are spending money on the big DLC’s (Lightfall), the season passes (which now cost more), the dungeons (that are now separate, so I hope you purchased the dungeon pass or the deluxe edition). You could have purchased the Lightfall: Big Honky Big Boi Deluxe Edition that comes with the “years worth of content”, but if you are one of the many people who isn’t confident in the technical state of the game, can’t play basic strikes without it being an error code simulator, or just don’t feel confident shelling out that much money for 3 seasons of what is mystery content at this point. (Mystery content that is 100% going to be filler stuff until the next big story expansion). I don't blame you for not buying the Deluxe edition, or for not upgrading to it. I'm honestly lost rambling at this point so don't even know where to go from here.. I guess I'll reupdate this review the next time there's a development, hopefully one day I'll be able to make it a positive review.

EDIT 2:

Just a quick update to note that the latest season has been released today (May 24, 2023), resulting in a the usual big season store refresh. However, it's worth noting that this time around, there is no armour available for purchase with bright dust (the earnable in-game currency) as there usually is. Instead, this time items are only available for silver. But wait, there's more! They have introduced three new eververse bundles containing exotic weapon ornaments that come bundled with silver-exclusive shaders who knows if/when these shaders will be available without opening your wallet. There used to be such an emphasis on the fact you could do it both ways, you could earn cool looking gear/shaders in game or you could buy others with silver. The community would tell you it wasn't a big deal and you didn't have to buy it if you didn't want to, which was fair. Jump to now where.... wait..  where'd all the armour that's obtainable in-game go?

I would like to bring up the somewhat random point that SPARE RATIONS IS BACK! So your old sunset gun is now back with more rolls that you have to grind for again. Really not sure where I stand on the whole reusing weapon models thing, on one hand I get it but on the other hand it seems lazy? This season we have normal spare rations and also spooky taken ghost spare rations, also seems like a nostalgia plug, imagine all the youtube titles ""WOW SPARE RATIONS IS BACK!"" ""SPARE RATIONS PVP KING AGAIN"" etc, etc. It is immensely frustrating that they have endless creativity for Sparrows, Ghosts, Ships, and exotic ornaments, but the actual gear is mostly reissues and reskins??

The reusing gun models argument aside they really have an issue with having weapons in promotional artwork/mission launch screens that just don't exist in game?? I'm also confused because they cancelled sunsetting and are now bringing back sunset weapons with different rolls? So was it really a space issue? I get they're shuffling seasonal stuff out but at this point it just seems like a cop-out

I'm not sure if they are just trying to milk the IP for all it's worth because the final shape is coming up or because they need to show papa Sony how much money they're making. It appears that even though it was easy to blame Activision there is an increasing emphasis on monetization regardless of Bungie splitting from Activision in 2019.","Very Positive80% of the 583,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",love launch d1 heard destiny 2 described destiny 2 great already destiny 2 3 d2 d1 or_emphasizediginal d2 curse osiris warmind past tutorial overwhelmed somehow overwhelmed activity underwhelmed loot receive finally finding gun immediately unequip else high power gun drop drop blue wet noodle matter big gripe loot general time oh man cool gun oh damn look siyuck armour thing oh anymore past season oh past season weapon focus random world drop hope lucky drop randomly lucky decent roll rng rng rng fomo suck cost dude meant dlc wise ignore legendary shard upgrade material ball ache casual costing weapon crafting changed cost s_emphasizedo hard light recently harder word rewarding fine love challenged game not_so loot we_emphasizedre already stayed took longer loot wait loot taking longer fighting harder enemy shitty loot we_emphasizedre vast majority auto dismantle anyway investment gear reward ratio feel bad thing bug happen game feel kick ball bug effect negative left simmer communication multiple season bug benefit lookin rahool dismantling shop mystery action part disabled day priority game community incredible lore spicy lightfall campaign not_sure chief best field stagnating happens game genre no_competition forced improve wrong strand kinda slapped countless destiny killer sucking feeling dry destiny dry comfort 5 year include d1 addition keeping negative heck negative bungie announced price season pass forward 1000 silver 1200 silver call inflation greed whatever 200 silver right_emphasized get bungie scummy mobile microtransaction schtick not_having silver bundle give 1200 silver okay cool 14 95aud bundle give worded store 1000 100 bonus 100 silver short able pas mean purchase next bundle 2000 300 bonus silver 29 95aud purchase 1100 silver bundle bundle 500 silver 7 55aud totalling silver purchase 1600 silver 22 50aud brings topic destiny 2 battle pas the_emphasizedmed premium currency pas cod give cod point siege give credit fortnite able purchase battlepass complete save credit next not_in desty 2 spend next season hobo s_emphasizedo spending big dlc lightfall season pass cost dungeon separate hope purchased dungeon pas deluxe edition purchased lightfall big honky big boi deluxe edition come year worth confident technical state basic strike error code simulator confident shelling 3 season mystery mystery 100 filler stuff next big expansion blame not_buying deluxe edition not_upgrading honestly lost rambling guess reupdate next development hopefully able positive 2 quick note latest season released today 24 2023 resulting usual big season store refresh worth noting no_armour available purchase bright dust earnable currency usually item available silver wait introduced three eververse bundle containing exotic weapon ornament bundled silver exclusive shaders know shaders available opening wallet emphasis way earn cool gear shaders others silver community tell big deal fair wait armour obtainable bring somewhat random spare ration old sunset gun roll grind not_sure stand reusing weapon model on_emphasizede hand hand lazy season normal spare ration spooky taken ghost spare ration nostalgia plug imagine youtube title wow spare ration spare ration pvp king etc_emphasized immensely frustrating endless creativity sparrow ghost ship exotic ornament actual gear mostly reissue reskins reusing gun model argument aside issue weapon promotional artwork mission launch screen exist confused cancelled sunsetting bringing sunset weapon different roll space issue shuffling seasonal stuff cop not_sure trying milk ip worth final shape coming papa sony appears easy blame activision increasing emphasis monetization regardless bungie splitting activision 2019

1085660,Destiny 2,"What was a good game has now turned into a dlc purchase simulator. This is NOT a free game and should not be advertised as such. Everything that was free before got removed from the game. No more base campaign, no nothing. Just to force you to buy the other campaigns. 

But wait there's more. 

You buy the expansion thinking you're ready to go. And it used to be like that. Not now. You now have to buy Dungeons that come out during that expansion. Yep. You have to pay to access content that should otherwise be already in the expansion. And then add season passes on top. 

So you pay full price for an expansion. What you get is a campaign. And a new zone. But then, the rest of the content coming throughout the expansion lifetime costs extra. New dungeons? Extra. All the other story bits? Season pass. Absolutely pathetic and horrible monetization.

Furthermore, they've removed most of the old conted from the beggining. The intro campaign? Deleted. Some of the first planets we had? Deleted. And many more.

If you want to know if you should try the game? There's no point. Without throwing your wallet at it you won't see much. As everything is paywalled. 

Don't support bungie. Don't give them any more money. They don't deserve it anymore. The product they've worked on over the last few years is an embarrassment and and proper example of full on greed.

1085660,Destiny 2,"Been thinking about how to make this review in the most objective way possible as i've spent way more time than the average player (5.4k+ hours on steam, plus probably around 2.5k+ between PS4 and XBOX) here. I'd love to recommend this game but it is simply not possible.

From an in-hands perspective, this is a magnificent game with probably the most polished and satisfying gunplay and abilities in the entire market. Nothing comes close and that's a fact.
The work that the teams in charge of combat, audio, music, art and visual design have done here is one of the best in the business.

Now, despite that, the game has gigantic issues that are hard to overlook once you spend a meaningful period of time with it:

[b] 1.-Addiction development [/b]

Bungie has designed the gameplay loop and its systems to develop an addictive behavior on the playerbase. It is heavily incentivized to play the game on a daily basis, or at least on a weekly basis, as it uses FOMO (Fear of missing out) to convince you about staying. 

""If you don't play this activity on this period of time, well...tough luck, this reward will come back when we decide it will come back"". This leads the player to plan their life around the time frame Bungie deems convinent to provide said rewards. You can't openly say ""well, today I'm gonna grind this activity to get this weapon/material"" if that activity or reward isn't part of the weekly rotation.

You are not the owner of your time.

If you don't care about having a competitive edge on PvP or a must-have gun or piece of armor for PvE if you use LFG methods, this point will become irrelevant as you can play the activities that you enjoy at your pace instead of feeling forced to do so.

[b] 2-""You're gonna be here...forever"" [/b]

Most of the seasonal content, if not all, is set to be delivered to the playerbase on a weekly basis until it wraps up. The issue here is that Bungie wants you to log in weekly for around 5-8 weeks if you want to keep up with what's going on but the content is so scarce that, in reality, the story could be finished in a day and the activities could be completely mastered in a week if the playerbase had the option so they could freely go play something else.

The live-service model has its good and bad things as it ensures the game will be frequently updated with new stuff every 3-4 months but it can also feel like the game has no end. For instance, The Final Shape would feel way more important if the game wrapped up there, but it's been confirmed there will be more stories and content after it but won't move on to a new game, like a Destiny 3 or something like that. Everything will keep happening on Destiny 2.

[b] 3-Schrödinger's reward system: Loot is plentiful but it also isn't. Some of it can be deemed as must-have...but it also doesn't matter [/b]

Crafting, in theory, was a great concept as it was meant to be a way to alleviate issues with RNG simply denying people of the loot they were chasing after countless grinding sessions.

Now, the problem with its implementation was the addition of [b] enhanced perks [/b] back on Witch Queen's release. This created a butterfly effect that has:
[list]
[*]Made the loot chase completely die since once you get the pattern/blueprint of a gun, every future roll of it will be immediately discarded as there is no chance of improving it.
[*]Made activities like Raids only need to be completed a handful of times to get the specific loot you want and then you can completely stop doing them, which is unfortunate as it is the best content the game provides but, at the same time, RNG exotics like Vex Mythoclast or Touch of Malice make said content frustrating as you get only a handful of tries to get them per weekly reset.
[*]Made actual endgame guns from Master Raids, Master Dungeons and Grandmaster Nightfall unable to compete with the crafted guns with enhanced perks, becoming completely irrelevant and devoiding these activities of any meaningful possible rewards, Artifice Armor is not worth the time unless you REALLY want to minmax.
[*]World loot is now worthless with no chance of having some hidden gems pop off like how the Cartesian Coordinate fusion rifle or the Truthteller grenade launcher did.
[*]General Play like Strikes or Crucible grant close to nothing other than a handful of glimmer. Their loot will mostly come from focusing engrams at the Tower.
[/list]

With that being said, the loot doesn't matter because...

[b] 4-The game has never been easier, and it will continue down that path [/b]

The latest subclass reworks and exotic armor tuning has trivialized most of the game. Bungie's response to this has been making endgame bosses with overshields, immunity phases and health gates, meaning most encounters will be unnecessarily extended even if the player/fireteam knows what they're doing. 

In the past, extending an encounter meant the player/fireteam screwed up at some point but now it is expected.

[b] 5-The core game has been neglected beyond belief [/b]

Vanguard Ops, Crucible and Gambit have received the least amount of general changes since the seasonal model was implemented back on Shadowkeep. Proof of this is the removal of several strikes and maps from both Crucible and Gambit, the addition of only 3 maps to Crucible after almost 4 years, the addition of Seasonal Battlegrounds to Vanguard Ops that are balanced around seasonal bonuses that no longer exist and complete, utter lack of attention to Gambit in any shape or form.

The weird part of this is that these 3 are the main population retainers and Bungie expects you to be there ad nauseam yet they're ignored.

The current Game Director has promised to change this, and if that happens, it would be massive for the playerbase.

[b] 6-Bungie aggressively wants your money [/b]

The amount of loot a season has normally is more prone to be in Eververse instead of the endgame. This said loot is also massively more appealing and also thrives on FOMO. The worst part of this is that prices are really high, as there will always be people willing to pay whatever it is necessary to ""look cool"". Since these people exist, Eververse is non-negotiable and no consumer-friendly changes will be made on it. Ever.

[b] 7-The game is held together by papier-mâché, macaroni and vibes [/b]

The technical side of the game has seen some of the most egregiously awful server downtimes and game-breaking bugs I have seen in the past 2 years. Tech issues happen everywhere, but when this is coupled with how the game is designed, if you miss out on a desired reward because of these issues, it leads to massive playerbase disappointment (see: The Craftening and Server Instability preventing people from getting the Igneous Hammer hand cannon in Trials of Osiris between Sep 15th through Sep 26th, 2023)

252490,Rust,"So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.

Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.

Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.

I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.

Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.

Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.

252490,Rust,"Once upon a time in Rust, in less cringy format, recollected to the best of my memory.

Together with the help of a random friend, I made a small, simple base and proceeded to work on gathering resources for I'd say about 20 hours, upgrading said base along the way as it was my intent to turn it into a farm.

I was getting harrassed by a small group of people every now and then but they didn't seem really interested in raiding, just camping or taking whatever kits they could get from our exchanges.

After a small conversation in outpost, I realized something very important about landmines, something that seemed very unused at the time.

Out of spite from the exchanges that got nowhere, I decided to put all my efforts into crafting possibly over a hundred landmines, surrounding the area around the base with them. There were many bushes and grass around the area, making it easy to hide those mines.

After that, I started armoring the base, changing specific stone walls to metal walls, and more important (and some fake) walls with high qual.

A couple of hours later when working on furnaces I started hearing the sound of certain landmines popping, often chain detonating as one detonated the other. A couple more exchanges later and some kits I took and another group of people got entangled into the mess, a larger clan, which also ended up getting killed by the landmines, several times. The explosions and constant fights however, seemingly attracted more and more people, nakeds, smaller groups, duos and people trying to cash in by getting kills and kits from others.

I had upgraded what I could, with whatever resources I had left. Occasionally using what kits I could salvage to do a little bit more shooting, but most of the time as a solo you're not getting anywhere when there's such a large amount of players expecting you. Wipe was almost at hand, so I didn't really mind.

The honeycombed walls didn't last long, and it certainly wasn't longer until they got through to where they wanted. But even then, people still kept dying to more landmines. I had honestly lost count of how many I had placed around, of how many resources were used. But boy did I have a smile on my face, knowing that as soon as they got into the TC, there was really nothing I had in terms of resources other than a couple stacks of high qual and metal scrap. And I'm more than sure that the amount of gear lost to the landmines, as they [b]destroy items[/b] in one's inventory if they die to one, was not worth what was found there.

TL;DR I used every single resource gathered over a wipe to make a large amount of people most likely lose an enormous quantity of their work and resources for almost nothing.

11/10 would do it again.

252490,Rust,"After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote ""Sorry guys :D"" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be ""shoot-on-sight?"" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. 

All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.","Very Positive87% of the 845,275 user reviews for this game are positive.",half bad spawn scarce resource short lived venture inhabited area map ran friendly met rust initially spotted pretty far paid no_real notice rock equipped eventually close clearly realization neither_of hostile pulled torch mutual sign peace highest possible non aggression exist rust dropped old hatchet finished crafting metal gave food sign good faith nearly 30 minute searching scavenging pooled resource craft minimally decent gear knew wanted progress mine boulder remaining material 9mm handgun bullet reminded case needed decided earlier unwanted experience bullet face hardest not_to slaughtering newly spawned across minute camp encountered hunting bow running hatchet quickly took handgun inventory pointed direction attempting scare far continued road towards stone surrounded tree opted stand guard handgun friend mined we_emphasizedre moving next boulder heard gunfire turned assault rifle gunning friend land shot already begun shooting moment remembered crafted sleeping bag camp objective trip we_emphasizedre taking typed chat thanking friend help asking killed intruding along line simply wrote sorry guy single problem game shoot sight obviously taken surprise equipped justifiable approaching poorly equipped player considering we_emphasizedre middle wood pretty gear easily told cooperate putting weapon leaving course come see player trying gather supply stable decides approach unecessary ammo hatchet handgun four bullet add insult add apology no_choice shoot unexpecting half naked unprepared player potential good community shine wish realize killing player chance single player wasted otherwise great

252490,Rust,"Do you ever feel useless, like you don't matter? Do you feel like anything you accomplish is pointless and leads to nothing? Well congratulations you found the perfect game for yourself. Spawn on the beaches of Normandy and get gunned down instantly. Maybe spawn in a desert and get bashed in the head by a hamburger rock. Perhaps spawn in the North Pole and get eaten by a fatass polar bear. When you eventually pick a nice spot to start building your paranoid schizophrenic honeycomb house made out of the finest wood, make your way to the open roads so you can destroy some barrels and get some silly little scrap and some low grade fuel. Maybe even pick up the green card at the gas station as well. That's the only time you are progressing in this game, any other time you are either killed and called racist slurs or have your entire house leveled by mystical little rocket fairies that take your things. This game has made me and my whole friend group spend countless hours to mauled in the very end to the point of blind rage. I have pooped blood because of the  sheer speed of the stool coming out of my buttcheeks because I am so infuriated. The graphics are great if you want your PC to explode in your face causing third degree burns. The animations are also nice if you are into games that makes your character look like they have lost control of basic motor skills.

If you like desperately trying to avoid getting ghosted by groups of geared player-killers while clawing your way into position as top dog, there's a server for that. If you like building a great base and only fighting other players in specific areas, there's a server for that. If you like fighting off zombies while never having to deal with getting raided or offlined, there's a server for that. The graphics are intense and visceral, yet also beautiful, while the crafting and building are pretty intuitive once you get used to the system. For your first run I would suggest a specifically newb friendly server until you get used to things, otherwise it will just be lots of dying and rage quitting and you will miss an excellent survival shooter.","Very Positive87% of the 845,275 user reviews for this game are positive.",key enjoying rust simple desperately trying avoid ghosted group geared killer clawing position top dog building great base fighting player specific area fighting zombie never_having deal raided offlined graphic intense visceral beautiful crafting building pretty intuitive suggest specifically newb friendly thing otherwise lot dying rage quitting miss excellent survival shooter

252490,Rust,"Everyone starts out naked in the world. 
You own nothing. 
You don't know what the world around you is like since it's all created from randomness
You struggle to survive and gain a foothold
People work hard to get resources for themselves  
People specialize in the skills they are good at  
People trade with one another  
People form tribes and make alliances
Groups experience social friction and form rivalries  
Those who trust too easily experience betrayal  
The strong take from the weak and become stronger

311210,Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"*LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*

     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. 
Please google ""Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022"". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. 

TL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.

Now for my review:
     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the ""popular"" maps. The ""less popular"" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.
     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.","Very Positive87% of the 118,545 user reviews for this game are positive.",look safety security risk buying online risky hacker able ip address mess weapon health personal information install rat pc computer super common s_emphasizedtill legitimate look spending happen random player streamer offline mode whenever stream otherwise hacker mess whatever trying banned please google black ops 3 pc security risk 2022 shame treyarch coming fix serious problem real activision letting tl dr cautious potential security issue highly recommend like call duty zombies_emphasized general want call duty zombie franchise best call duty zombie definitely challenge multiplayer match nowadays zombie match hard long popular map popular map difficult s_emphasizedtill possible especially search go multiplayer search specific time match not_entirely time wont leave guess different zone school best happen zombie series term storyline progression endless task item surprise map coming different truly wonderful fun offered experienced especially custom zombie tool community map literally endless map level tool not_only remake zombie chronicle visually stunning remake mob dead call dead town buried die rise 2023 2024 highly recommend like call duty zombies_emphasized general want call duty zombie franchise

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"Well, where to start?
First: Warzone, started to get bad when they changed the game map, leaving it worse than it was at the beginning of it, but it still had fun gameplay and few bugs, in addition to being optimized in a much more decent way than the original. current.
Second: The previous game started with skin trends, which was cool, because in the first game, the skins were well done and fun, for the most part, the weapons chosen for the skins were weapons that were actually usable and didn't have as many Pro Team packages.
Third: The weapons in the game really had correct damage, compared to this one, in the first warzone, you created the class with that weapon and it killed, today you create the class, one hour it kills, another time, it seems that it only shoots beans , it doesn't even kill a chicken, the weapon categories are unbalanced, the players' vests have become infinite, unless you get one of the crappy weapons that are practically insta kill, but not usable in practical terms for the game.
Fourth: the previous game had problems with cheaters, yes it did, however, there you saw the anti-cheat system working, in this one, in addition to the game being infested with cheaters, if you report it, you can end up being banned for ""false report"" , that is, the developer itself does this so that no one else reports the suspects, so as not to have the trouble to keep checking, at least that's what it looks like.
Fifth: Many, like me, spent a lot of money on skins, etc, on the other game, and what does the developer do? Throw everything in the trash, if you want something, buy it again in the current game, so far so good, it's the market, they have to make money, etc, so make decent skins, same complaint as in the second topic...
Sixth: Are we playing COD, or are we playing Fortnite, or something like that? Call of Duty is a franchise that I've been playing since 2003, having paused only in the futuristic era of the game, because in my opinion, it was horrible, and coming back in 2017 when they released COD WWII, which was bad too, but better than the futurists, now in this COD, even characters with superpowers have it, if those weapons that kill you and turn you into pieces, into lightning, explode you etc, now you have to deal with flying characters and the like, I'm sorry to say, but this game that in theory it was supposed to be for people over 18, this is becoming a game for people under 12, it just needs to cartoonize the scenario and you can now call it Call of Fortnite.
Finally, the game has serious optimization problems, it has many cheaters, many grotesque bugs, it is not fun like the previous one, the store has practically nothing decent, the devs in each update, which in theory was to improve the game, do the opposite and they shit on everything that ""worked"", the map is not bad, but it is not good enough like the first warzone, and the worst the DEVs do not decide which game mode to leave, each week or even in the same week , the game has a different mode and for those who play in a duo, they usually just get screwed. Play at your own risk, I don't recommend.","Mostly Negative32% of the 30,364 user reviews for this game are positive.",warzone started bad changed map leaving worse beginning fun bug addition optimized decent original previous started skin trend cool skin fun weapon chosen skin weapon usable pro package third weapon correct damage compared warzone created class weapon killed today create class kill shoot bean kill chicken weapon category unbalanced player vest infinite unless crappy weapon practically insta kill not_usable practical term fourth previous problem cheater yes saw anti cheat working addition infested cheater report banned false report developer no_one else report suspect not_to trouble checking look fifth spent skin developer throw trash far good market decent skin complaint topic sixth cod fortnite call duty franchise 2003 paused futuristic era opinion horrible coming 2017 released cod wwii bad futurist cod character superpower weapon kill turn piece lightning explode deal flying character sorry theory supposed 18 12 need cartoonize scenario call call fortnite finally serious optimization problem cheater grotesque bug not_fun previous store practically decent theory improve opposite shit worked map not_bad not_good warzone worst not_decide mode leave week week different mode duo usually screwed risk recommend

1962663,Call of Duty®: Warzone™,"Posting this here, since Activision is re-branding to shake off the bad PR.

SBMM is creating some severe issues, leading people to think there is Skill Based Damage, but it doesn't stop there. The game is completely inconsistent on a technical level. Depending on the time of the day, your shots will do a different amount of damage to AI and players, there's plenty of proof if you look around online OR simply play the game and experience the frustrations of these co-op employee ran servers.  Every patch to fix bugs that I never had, I then would get in the bug that the patch apparently ""fixed."" Meanwhile serious bugs and hacking exists, that the team closes their eyes to and they push you $20 skins.

If you want to yuck it up and shoot some people, play the free version and add it to your rotation of games. I strongly suggest that you do not pay for this game.  If you make even a reasonable wage at 20 dollars an hour, you're still pissing away 3 hours of your 40 hour paycheck, just to be disappointed and have another over-marketed failure replace this.  Not to mention, any skins or battle passes are not worth the money, due to the high level of issues, bugs, crashes, and lack of transparency with the company, etc. 

They promised their community that they were going to break the annual cycle and let this run for two years.  Some folks bought the game due to the promise - Turns out, that's a lie and the next game will be out shortly.  It was all just a ploy to get you to purchase a game that they will intentionally trash, just to hype up another dumpster fire to bring in more money next year.  

Activision does not listen to their community, nor do they care. We are ""retention numbers"", a paycheck and good for their stock listing, that's it.  I have played COD since before many of you were alive.  I have uninstalled MW2 and will not play any further COD releases in the future. I was optimistic with their new approach to a COD game, but once again, I was let down by a company that panders to whatever makes them money.

This company is in it only for your money, not to create a quality game.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Although it has been almost a month since I quit this game, I'm going to write this review in the hope that new players will have a basic understanding of what they are about to get themselves into. Not saying that you shouldn't TRY the game (it's free so why wouldn't you), but I hope that by the time you reach the point in the game where you feel like you need to swipe your credit card or start feeling the need to keep playing the game even at the cost of neglecting your real life responsibilities, you'll be able to make an educated decision on whether you want to keep p(l)aying or break yourself out of the vicious cycle that is Lost Ark's gameplay loop.

TL;DR Lost Ark is a well-polished game with amazing action combat, fun classes, and stunning visuals. However these pros are only meant to draw players in whereby they will fall prey to the dev team's intentionally predatory pay-to-win mechanics, slog through hours of doing the same repetitive tasks on six or more characters every day, get verbally abused or gatekept by a toxic elitist community, or get randomly banned from the game for no reason. This game is not intended for your average Joe who holds a 9-5 day job and only has 2 hours on average to play games every weekday; it is targeted to either single rich people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to throw truckloads of cash at the game, or single poor people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to play this game for 16 hours every day.

Korean MMOs are notorious for their top tier gameplay, stunning visuals and graphics, punishing amounts of grinding, and pay-to-win mechanics designed on the philosophy that rich people should always dominate poor people in every aspect of life. Lost Ark unfortunately is no exception to this doctrine. As a new player, upon starting the game you will immediately be wowed by the game's fantastic graphics, polished zones, and fun action combat. But don't be fooled; you are the fish that the devs want to catch and the pretty graphics and amazing gameplay is the bait that they use to hook you in. The story of this game is mediocre and is mainly just generic medieval fantasy garbage that you've likely seen in many previous MMOs or other RPG games. The bad guys of the world are even just generically named as ""demons"". After reading through a few lines of story dialogue you will very soon become lost and confused with regards to where the story is going and eventually you'll just end up skipping the majority of the quest dialogue.

The early game from level 1-50 mostly consists of you following the main story quest while doing countless numbers of generic ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" side quests. In between there are dungeons that you will both run through as part of the main story or optionally as part of a side quest. These dungeons are well designed, but unfortunately you won't be able to team up with anyone to run them because the early game is completely devoid of real human players. Your only companions at this point are the hundreds of bot trains that run around each zone with impunity.

Reaching level 50 as a new player will likely take anywhere between 8-40 hours of gameplay, depending on whether you're speedrunning through each zone or taking the time to stop and smell the roses. Once you hit level 50 you'll enter what the game refers to as ""Tier 1"" of progression. There are currently three tiers of progression: 1, 2, and 3 (the current highest tier). This is where you will establish your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark, which will consist of doing your daily two Chaos dungeon runs, daily two Guardian runs, daily three Una's tasks (which are again either ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" quests), and weekly three Una's tasks (which are again mostly just ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" except scaled up).

The progression from Tier 1 to Tier 3 has been streamlined since the game release but is still quite a chore to slog through, especially since at this point in the game you are unlikely to have encountered a single human player. Guardian runs are nearly impossible to solo as a new player and will basically be unplayable as there are no human players to run them with. Chaos dungeons are just braindead solo instances where you mash as many buttons as you can to kill as many mobs as possible while picking up loot. You will log in to do your dailies but once your dailies are done, your vertical progression for the day is capped and there is nothing you can do except wait for the next day for your dailies to reset.

For the next 50-100 hours you will slog your way from T1 to T2 and T2 to T3 by doing the same repetitive daily routine of chaos dungeons, fetch quests, and kill quests. The whole time you won't meet a single real human player until you reach T3. But T3 is also where the real grind starts. You thought what you were doing up until this point was repetitive and boring? Nope, you're in for the grind of your life. This is also the point at which the predatory pay-to-win mechanics of this game start to show. Upgrading your gear is RNG-based, and as you go higher not only does the chance of succeeding drop significantly lower, but the cost of each upgrade attempt skyrockets to the point that farming your dailies on a single character will not be enough to make any sort of meaningful progress in a reasonable timeframe. You will have two choices at this point: 1) create alt characters and push them to T3 so you can farm more dailies on each character (daily rewards are per character, not per account) to get more materials to upgrade your main character; OR 2) pull out your credit card. Most players will do a combination of both, resulting in them not only spending an unhealthy number of hours playing the game every day but also an ungodly amount of money on the game just to overcome the artificial barriers put up by the devs preventing you from participating in the best content that Lost Ark has to offer, which is the Legion Raids.

By the time you progress far enough in the game to meet the minimum requirements to run your first legion raid, you'll find that nobody wants to take you because the majority of players in this game are already far ahead of you and don't have the patience to teach you the raids, which are actually quite challenging and require you to fail a few times so you can practice. After all, the players that still play the game at this point are hardcore gamers who have 20+ alt characters that they need to farm dailies on every day, so every minute that they spend teaching you and not farming their alts is a minute where they are not making gold. The barriers to playing the most fun content in this game are so high that it is impossible for anyone to surmount them unless they play with a large dedicated group of friends or are willing to empty their entire bank account.

If you still have not quit the game by now you will most likely be forced to when AGS (the publisher of Lost Ark) permanently bans you for violating their code of conduct. The ban will happen randomly and without warning, your appeal will be automatically denied, and no explanation for the ban will be given. This is because Lost Ark has the worst infestation of bots and RMTers that possibly has ever existed in an MMO up to this point, and AGS is so incompetent that their efforts to lessen the problem have only ended up making things worse. Legitimate and innocent players get banned on a daily basis while blatant RMTers who have been around since the game's launch stream themselves buying out the entire Lost Ark economy in broad daylight and still go unpunished. All of your time, effort, and money invested in the game gone in an instant with no chance to get it back.

By all means, try this game out but don't let it hook you in. It's worth a few hours of your time but nothing more.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",quit write hope player basic understanding not_saying t_emphasizedry hope reach swipe credit card feeling cost neglecting real life responsibility able educated decision p l aying break vicious cycle lost ark loop tl dr lost ark polished amazing action combat fun class stunning visuals pro meant draw player whereby fall prey intentionally predatory pay win mechanic slog hour repetitive task six character verbally abused gatekept toxic elitist community randomly banned no_reason not_intended average joe hold 9 5 2 hour average game weekday targeted single rich no_other responsibility dependent afford throw truckloads cash single poor no_other responsibility dependent afford 16 hour korean mmos notorious top tier stunning visuals graphic punishing amount grinding pay win mechanic designed philosophy rich dominate poor aspect life lost ark unfortunately no_exception doctrine starting immediately wowed fantastic graphic polished zone fun action combat fooled fish catch pretty graphic amazing bait hook mediocre mainly generic medieval fantasy garbage previous mmos role game_emphasizeds bad guy world generically named demon reading line dialogue soon lost confused regard eventually skipping majority dialogue early 1 50 mostly consists following countless number generic kill x fetch x side quest dungeon optionally side dungeon designed unfortunately able early completely devoid real human player companion hundred bot train zone impunity reaching 50 anywhere 8 40 hour depending speedrunning zone taking smell rose 50 enter refers tier 1 progression currently three tier progression 1 2 3 highest tier establish daily routine rest lost ark consist daily chaos dungeon run daily guardian run daily three una task kill x fetch x quest weekly three una task mostly kill x fetch x except scaled progression tier 1 tier 3 streamlined release chore slog especially unlikely encountered single human guardian run nearly impossible solo basically unplayable no_human player chaos dungeon braindead solo instance mash button kill mob possible picking loot log daily daily vertical progression capped except wait next daily reset next 50 100 hour slog t1 t2 t2 t3 repetitive daily routine chaos dungeon fetch quest kill quest meet single real human reach t3 t3 real grind start thought repetitive boring nope grind life predatory pay win mechanic upgrading gear rng based higher not_only chance succeeding drop significantly lower cost upgrade attempt skyrocket farming daily single not_be sort meaningful progress reasonable timeframe choice 1 create alt character push t3 farm daily daily reward per not_per material upgrade 2 pull credit card player combination resulting not_only spending unhealthy number hour ungodly overcome artificial barrier preventing participating best lost ark offer legion raid progress far meet minimum requirement legion raid want majority player already far ahead patience teach raid challenging require fail time practice player hardcore gamers 20 alt character farm daily minute spend teaching not_farming alt minute not_making gold barrier fun high impossible surmount unless large dedicated group friend willing empty entire bank not_quit forced ag publisher lost ark permanently ban violating code conduct ban happen randomly warning appeal automatically denied no_explanation ban given lost ark worst infestation bot rmters possibly existed massively multiplayer online ag incompetent effort lessen problem ended thing worse legitimate innocent player banned daily basis blatant rmters launch stream buying entire lost ark economy broad daylight unpunished effort invested instant no_chance mean hook worth hour

1599340,Lost Ark,"As someone who has played the RU version for 1000hrs+ and have leveled two characters legit and boosted 8 of them (to 50) my two cents about the topic:

+ The game is a fun journey from start to the endgame. The leveling process gets a bit dull, but on your first character it's manageable.

+ The start of the endgame is quite fun. When you first hit 50 there's a lot 'island quest' storylines to complete, reputation quests to unlock, new guardian fights/new dungeons/new raids to experience, some 'sea events' and other 'timed events' to check out. Progression feels pretty good and smooth (until you gear gets around +9, the +10-+15 upgrades are significantly 'harder' to succeed => More fails => More costs => Way slower progress).

+ The equalized arena PvP is fun although very CC-heavy and takes a little learning curve to get into. However the rewards are quite poor beyond the 'weekly' ones, so unless you are really into PvP you probably won't spend a lot of time playing it. The ranked PvP is only TRUE SOLO QUEUE, so no premades (which is pretty fun for solo players!).

What does this actually have to do with potential P2W and 'forced alts'?

+ Kinda tricked you with the topic. The game is a fun journey even before you need to think about spending.

To the actual topic:

+ Once you hit your first progression wall (starting from +9 / +10 upgrading) you'll start to see yourself being handicapped by various resources. It might be materials (drops from limited daily dungeons/daily quests etc.), it might be shillings (daily dungeon/daily quests/'limited' cube dungeon), or it might be gold (weekly dungeons/weekly raids/weekly quests). To get through this wall you'll either need to just take it slow (log-in and do your daily/weekly things) or go faster (start making alts that allow you to farm more of the aforementioned) or go super fast (start top-upping with $/€'s and turn that into gold to get the resources needed for the upgrade gamble).

+ 'Taking it slow' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character

+ 'Going faster' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character + 1-2 hours or so per WEEK per alt character

+ 'Going super fast' is only limited by your bank account <- beware though getting to 'max gear' as soon as possible removes many gaming goals you might have when 'taking it slow' or 'going faster'

Now there are other monetizations that boost your progression in various ways but these are laid out in other posts and are not that significant. Basically with 50$ you'll get all the permanent things you'll ever 'need' and then you have the option of running the recurring 'crystalline aura (sub)' for extra benefits. The only thing I'd raise as a 'must-have' is the pet which is around 5-10$ and it's ACCOUNT WIDE, so you'll only need one of them. The reason for the pet is auto-looting, which is a major convinience for your daily dungeon running (the pet picks up the constant loot pinata from the daily dungeons instead of having to run around furiously smackin the loot button). Pets are also given out through events so you are likely to get one for free sooner or later.

TLDR; The game is a fun journey from 1-50 regardless of whether you spend a single dime or not. When you get to the mid-late game (of the current patch) you'll either take it slow (1 character), go faster (alts) or you go super fast (spending $/€'s).

1599340,Lost Ark,"I know what you're thinking, ""Dude, you played the game for almost 2000 hours, how can you not recommend the game?!"" Well, that's the funny thing about this game. You don't really realize what you're getting into until you reach the true endgame. I'll try to be brief and precise about the important issues. 

First off, the game is fundamentally pretty damn fun. The combat is fun and the visuals range from pretty good to gorgeous. There are plenty of systems that are kind of annoying and there's certainly lots of rng and things to grind at in the game, sometimes frustratingly so. But where I really hit a wall and felt my will to continue completely fade away was the endgame upgrade system. This is where most people realize just how pay-to-win the game is.

I reached ilvl 1475 on my main with relative ease, all things considered. I was happy about that considering the extremely low success rates. But once you get into raiding and acquire some relic gear, this game becomes very punishing.. but not the good kind of punishing, the kind of punishing where you can almost hear the sound of laughter coming from somewhere. But, it isn't coming from your friends, or other players, no, it's coming from the devs. They're laughing at you. ""Look at this loser"" you hear them say, ""he failed his 60% chance to upgrade his relic quality, and when he got it the second time, it only went up by 2%. HAHAHAHA, what an idiot"".

Now I could clarify, but it would take forever. Just know that this is just one of many upgrade systems in the game, and it's very expensive and very depressing. Plus the game wants you to do this for several pieces of gear across all your characters. Having multiple alts is also encouraged to help aid your main with materials and gold. Unless you completely whale this game and spend thousands of real dollars each month, you will struggle without alts. This makes the game quite repetitive after a while too. 

The last thing I want to talk about is one of the many currencies in the game called Pheons. This straight up made me quit the game entirely. If they removed it, I might consider coming back. I remember saying to myself ""Instead of subjecting myself to this, how about I just don't, quit, and live a happier life?"" So I did.. at least for a while, i'll explain at the end. I don't think the devs realize how much this currency is destroying their player retention...

Basically, Pheons are a currency that you need to purchase most things and ALL important things on the player market/auction house. They are VERY expensive to purchase outright in the store, and the devs give out insultingly low amounts on rare occasions. You need a lot of them, You will always need them as the game gets updated. Dealing with this currency made me feel like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing just hard enough to keep me alive.

In conclusion, I didn't like how this game made me feel anymore. Pheons and just thinking about cutting an ability stone make me want to alt-f4. Overall, this game started to feel like I was dredging through an alleyway full of heroine addicts trying to sell me some smack and hang out with them. Fuck that. Admittedly, I still fire it up from time to time to enjoy some combat, but I could never take this game seriously the way it is.

Oh, and the game's bot problem is severe and will probably never be fixed.

*edit: Just wanted to add some more context to this. At review time, I hadn't played for 3-4 months. I played a little bit more recently to check in on things, try out the new classes, and check out new skins. The economy appears to be getting worse though. Gold and prices on the auction house have more than doubled, Pheon's are still in play, items are becoming more scarce, bots are still everywhere, and island instances are completely dead. I want to play this game, but It's not worth it. As new games and MMO's come out this year, I imagine more people will leave and move on.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I’m going to write this review in the hope that new players gets a basic understanding what they’re gonna get into. At the time of writing, I stopped playing the game almost 2 weeks ago. Today I logged in to take a snapshot of my character screen (like a souvenir) then I uninstalled. This is going to be a thumb-down from someone who have spent 2,000 hours in this game... yeah, I’m going to be *that* kind of person for once.

Lost Ark is a game that gives you a lot of thing to do but you’re not going to particularly enjoy it. If I have to give an honest opinion about how much I enjoyed Lost Ark in the 2k hours I’ve played, I’d say maybe 20% was fun while 80% was a waste of time. The game WANTS you to waste that time so that you get to the good part.

Reminder: I’m writing this for NEW PLAYERS. So, existing players who gonna read this and comment (I won’t disable comment, criticize within reason) just keep in mind that your/our experience from launch and the experience of someone new today is going to be a stark contrast.

The story is just your average MMORPG shtick. Very likely you’re going to stop paying attention at the poor English localization half hour in the game and you’ll start mashing your G key (thus the meme you might have seen already). You’re going to press G for the next 12 hours or so if you’re fast and you don’t get too sidetracked. Else you’re looking about 15 hours of G-spamming.

The story is not compelling, you get an occasional cool cutscenes which pretty much tells you everything you need to know then you are sent on your way to do the tedious of story question: Go to X, speak with this NPC, spend 1 minute to go to Y, Speak to this NPC, go back to X and speak with that NPC again, rinse and repeat ad-nauseam.

You do the above for 12 – 15 hours before you hit “Tier 1 gear” at which point you start shifting in what’s gonna be your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark career.

The progression from T1 to mid-T3 is going to be brutal for you. It’s a dead zone, YOUR dead zone. There’s only bots wherever you’re going and the content you can do barely has players to help you with. This is literally going to be a phase where you’re going to spend roughly the next 100 hours (realistically it’s going to be closer to 200 hours) to get in a decent spot in T3. “Decent spot” is an always moving target as the game gets new content and the playerbase keeps moving forward. How tedious it’s going to get there all comes down to how merciful (or in touch with the playerbase) the dev is feeling is feeling at that time.

As you settle in your daily routine, you’re gonna realize how much RNG is involved in various aspect of the game and how much of it purely waste your time in a way you’re not going to enjoy. Imagine an important item locked behind a collectible that have a low chance to drop three times every week. You might get it on your first try, you might end up getting it on your 20th week (it’s a thing: ask anyone about the “Moake” hell and how group of friends gets their item drop while others are still left behind after 3 months still killing the same boss).

Gold is going to be your most valuable currency but the one you farm is going to have trash value. Why? Bots. Oh that Schoolgirl skin you see people walking around in? You can get it in the cash shop for $40 OR you can spend 45,000 gold to purchase it in the auction house. What? You’re only making 3,000k gold week? Well, tough luck! Save for 15 weeks and hope that inflation, caused by the disgusting amount of bot, is not going to make the price rocket to 60k by the time you get your 45k. Oh, you can’t even save that gold because you actually need it to hone your weapon, armor, to purchase mats, to buy dungeon/raid chest, etc, etc. Guess you’re out of luck!

Bots are rampant. About 4 months ago, I thought bots were at the worse point (looking at the price of RMT) but oh boy how wrong I was. RMT price is currently half of the price of what I thought was the worse point 4 months ago. What does that mean? The current of the game in terms of botting/RMT is TWICE as worse as the time that I thought it was worse. Inflation is at an all time high.

If you still manage to push through all these barriers and somehow manage to get your character high enough for the end-game raid content then congrats! Also; tough luck. No one gonna take you in their raid. The game is such a huge time sink that there’s very few who are willing to spend the time to fail with you in a raid because you WILL fail and you HAVE to fail to learn but the likeliness of having 7 other people who are either happy to teach you or fail with you is so low that you’re going to be spending quite sometime in the party finder just to go nowhere.

This game was fun back when it launched. Having a huge group of actual people running beside you in-world was such a breath of fresh air. It was fun, everyone was learning, everyone was talking. The current new player experience is a dead zone that I don’t wish upon anyone. The end-game is brutal once you reach it not because of the content difficulty but mostly due to how you’re going to get filtered out. Everything in between is a huge waste of time aimed at squeezing play hours from the players.

""Lost Ark respect your time."": So we were told, turns out it doesn't.

""Lost Ark is alt friendly."": When the game foundation is built upon having multiple characters, this statement is far from the truth. There's so much things to do to make this game alt friendly but dev outright refuse. One of the biggest offender is materials such as Shards which are character bound. If this was an alt friendly game, Shards would never be bound. Neither Guardian/Destruction/Leapstones would have been bound.

Lost Ark doesn't respect your time and is possibly one of the worse case of botting I have ever seen in an online game.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",write hope player get basic understanding gon na writing stopped 2 week ago today logged snapshot screen souvenir uninstalled thumb someone spent 2 000 hour yeah kind lost ark give not_going particularly enjoy honest opinion enjoyed lost ark 2k hour maybe 20 fun 80 waste want waste good reminder writing player existing player gon na read comment disable comment criticize mind launch someone today stark contrast average mmorpg shtick paying attention poor english localization half mashing g key meme already press g next 12 hour fast sidetracked else 15 hour g spamming not_compelling occasional cool cutscenes pretty tell sent tedious question x speak non spend 1 minute speak non x speak non rinse repeat ad nauseam 12 15 hour tier 1 gear shifting gon na daily routine rest lost ark career progression t1 mid t3 brutal dead zone dead zone bot wherever barely player help literally phase spend roughly next 100 hour realistically closer 200 hour decent spot t3 decent spot moving target get playerbase keep moving forward tedious come merciful touch playerbase feeling feeling settle daily routine gon na realize rng involved various aspect purely waste not_going enjoy imagine important locked collectible low chance drop three time week 20th week ask moake hell group friend get drop others left 3 month killing bos gold valuable currency farm trash value bot oh schoolgirl skin walking cash shop 40 spend 45 000 gold purchase auction house 3 000k gold week tough luck save 15 week hope inflation caused disgusting bot not_going price rocket 60k 45k oh save gold hone weapon armor purchase mat dungeon raid chest etc_emphasized guess luck bot rampant 4 month ago thought bot worse price rmt oh boy wrong rmt price currently half price thought worse 4 month ago term botting rmt twice worse thought worse inflation high manage push barrier somehow manage high raid congrats tough luck no_one gon na raid huge sink willing spend fail raid fail fail learn likeliness 7 happy teach fail low spending party finder nowhere fun launched huge group actual running beside world breath fresh air fun learning talking dead zone wish brutal reach not_because difficulty mostly due filtered huge waste aimed squeezing hour player lost ark respect we_emphasizedre told turn lost ark alt friendly foundation built multiple character statement far truth s_emphasizedo thing alt friendly outright refuse biggest offender material shard bound alt friendly shard never_be bound neither_guardian destruction leapstones bound lost ark respect possibly worse case botting online

1599340,Lost Ark,"Lobby/Gatekeeping Simulator. 

Rushing content to catch up to Korea was such a great idea. Look at the player base from when the game was released to now. Support drought, gatekeeping, the toxic environment, the works. If you plan on starting this game now, don't. Endgame has become a circle jerk of the 1%, competing for MVP status and who has the shinier weapon. Unless you're friends with one of these guys, do not expect to get accepted anywhere. 

This is coming from a solo player (no static or interaction with guilds) that's spent a fair chunk of time and ended up with above-average gear. I'm not entirely ""juiced"" but I can guarantee I'll get into lobbies faster than 90% of players. However, even with the gear that I have, I can still get gate-kept. Only because I haven't spent thousands of dollars to over-gear beyond the requirements for raids, so that they become a mindless damage-dumping fight to skip mechanics. 

Raiding used to be a fun experience at first but it's become a repulsive environment just to get raids done ""fast"" and move onto the next alt. I'm not feeling burnout, I'm just not as motivated as I used to be when I started.

Server merges will not fix anything. Side content has become a joke. This game will literally have to become your part-time job. It will only get worse if Amazon/SGS doesn't do anything about it. Unfortunately this review will just get buried among the other reviews, maybe even along with the game eventually. Life expectancy for Lost Ark; no longer than a year. 

Turn around and don't look back.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I have read stories about people getting false bans, but never thought it would happen to me until it did. Got perma-banned for ""cheating"", tried to dispute it, they wouldn't tell me the reason and sent an automated email response instead. I have never cheated (I don't even know how?!) or bought gold or anything. I've just been playing everyday, enjoying with my family and my boyfriend. I even recently decided to support the game and put in real money to buy skins.

The fact that they took my money and then banned me a couple days later for no reason is enough to turn me off from this game. If anything, THEY are the ones committing fraud, not me... It makes me really sad because I only got to enjoy having my character wear a cute pink swimsuit for a couple of days. :(

Also this game is not friendly to new players (hell, I've heard even new players are getting banned for no reason). I have a lot of hours, but I didn't play the first couple of weeks when it was released and I still feel behind. Imagine just starting the game now. The beginner areas are all full of bots and some co-op quests that new players need to do are all devoid of any players. (Gesbroy is the worst),

Thanks AGS for robbing me of my money and my happiness. It sucks that they're the publishers because the game itself is really great. The graphics are nice, I generally enjoyed the story line, and was enjoying the horizontal gameplay (mokoko hunting is the most satisfying thing). It's just sad that this is happening to innocent players.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I quit lost ark because this game doesn’t respect your time, and neither does the community. The early and mid game was quite enjoyable, otherwise I wouldn’t have gotten to the insufferable endgame. To keep up to date with the latest content, you have to do dailies on a wide roster of characters. These consume so much of your time, become soul draining and repetitive after enough times. All of that work to hone for a CHANCE of getting your item level to qualify for the newest content. Then there’s gatekeeping where it’s essentially a job interview. Your hard work of grinding dailies every single day to qualify for the raids aren’t enough, because now you have the meet the expectations of other players who expect you to have the perfect gear, have the boss memorized to the core, and make zero mistakes. So you have to do even MORE grinding in order to get the right equipment and engravings, somehow become experienced in the raid but no one will accept you because you’re not experienced, and become a robot that perfectly executes every single mechanic. This game and its community is ruthless to casual and new players, as only the hardcore players are welcomed. The only play style in lost ark is hardcore, playing casually is literally impossible. I already have enough work to do in my life, I don’t need any more. If you want to play a game that is fun, can be casual, and respects your time, don’t play lost ark.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Two months ago all of my characters disappeared. I contacted AGS support and they said my characters are somehow not linked to any steam account and they need to escalate the ticket to the devs. After two weeks they closed the ticket saying to do a steam account recovery (which made no sense because my steam account is fine). Then after talking to three people I was able to get the ticket reopened. It has been another month and a half and still no reply from the devs other than they are ""looking in to it rest assured"". Today I asked for a refund for money spent in the game since I cannot access anything I paid for. They said ""You cannot be able to get a refund for this as we do not grant refunds with these decisions as well they come from the developers"".

If you have any issues with this game don't expect them to get resolved since the support from Smilegate is beyond a joke. The only people you can talk to are AGS intermediaries reading off a sheet of responses.

Update 6/7/2022: They closed the ticket again without any resolution or even a notification that they closed it. I had to get it reopened for a second time after reaching out to AGS for an update on the ticket.

The customer support however, is trash. I recently logged into the game and was blindsided by a message saying I had been perma banned for ""cheating"". This is an obvious mistake as I do not cheat in any games. I ""appealed"" because this is clearly a mistake and I would just like to log in and play so I can resume the grind.
I received a response almost immediately with what is clearly an auto response and the news that my account would remain perma'd,
""We reserve the right to determine what constitutes unfair play and to take corrective action we deem appropriate.

As a result, your Lost Ark account remains permanently banned.

We can’t share any further information about our decision, and we won’t reply to further emails about this issue.""

1599340,Lost Ark,"Lost Ark Community Managers put out a July Player Survey and I started writing about why I'm not playing the game hardly since the June Patch for some poor soul at Amazon to probably never read, and figured I'd also put that at the bottom while I'm at it.

As for new people wanting to try this game: 

New players will never have the early game experience I had to push me to play as much as I did. You will skip past T1-2 and half the raids/dungeons the game has to offer that I got to learn on par with a group. Once you skip to T3 and current content you will be gatekept by the ones who want to get the raids done as quickly as possible and move on to their next character for the week.

Learning parties are far and few between, so you can try to sneak into an experienced run. But if you started now or recently, you will have to swipe to reach the newest endgame content quickly, and you'll still be missing the rng obtained card sets you need and stick out like a sore thumb because of your roster level that experienced lobbies check. There ARE lobbies that will take you anyways but expect to spend some time getting denied first. The PvP scene is pretty much nonexistent and the open world bits are unbalanced, so look elsewhere if that's what you're wanting out of this game. 

""But you have over 2k hours"" a lot of that was spent playing the game in a different state than what it currently is, with new raids and content every other month, and building new characters to that new content was relatively cheap and not as time consuming. We are almost caught up to Korea and that pacing of content release is going to slow way down while honing costs and time spent for less gain will continue to go up. 

The combat is very fun and visually the game looks great. Fleshing out your character's build and seeing it come together is very satisfying, but tripods, engravings, and skill points are one and done pretty early on.
Ultimately, your character's growth will become governed solely by honing your item level and nothing else, which doesn't give that same satisfaction as it's exponentially more time consuming and expensive for less and less gain.


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Spending about 250k gold to push my main from 1565 to 1580 after months of doing the same dailies was honestly just too disheartening. The people I play with either run 18 raids a week for gold and have a main 6 roster almost or all 1580+ OR they don't play enough and aren't able to run the new 1580 content on their main. They likely won't be there in time for Akkan either.
I work Mon-Fri, and for months, I dedicated more than half of each day off, including Friday after work to run rested chaos and rested guardians on my roster, and try to squeeze in raids during the week or after grinding dailies during the weekend. 
And to do that just to barely scrape by to reach 1580 knowing I will only be able to continue playing new content if I continue to grind even more was a realization that finally hit after spending months of materials and gold on that honing session. I enjoy the game's raids when I can, but not 6 characters a week. 
For a long while, I ran 10+ characters of chaos and guardians, and established a strong main 6 roster. Then I started to cut back and only run main 6 chaos and guardians that generated the new materials, then with new content only my 4 characters at 1540+ I would run rested daily content on. 
Despite that, I wouldn't have even had enough gold to push ONLY my main to 1580 if not for playing the fish market and holding onto that gold for months. That itself required brainless hours buying Redflesh fish and Pearls because of the Auction House changes to combat bots. That well is now dry, and I don't have it in me to build it back up, either by doing the same chaos and guardian spam every Fri-Sun or sitting there slowly buying up a small ocean of fish watching something on the side.

I will and I won't miss this game. The experience at launch and for a while after was some of the best this game had to offer. Me and all my friends learning new mechanics through tier 1 and 2 dungeons and raids, watching each other hone up, and doing content together. Who can make it to T3 first and start selling those great honor leapstones for 800 gold a pop? The 1340-1370 dead zone was the first time the brakes hit the train, some of us made new alts, some took the time to play something else after no lifing the game since release. Argos comes out and we all prog gate 1 together but then numbers started dropping from our group because of the grind. The rest of us continue on, running Argos 1-3 for weeks till Valtan. Slowly through Vykas, Clown, and Brel NM, some started playing less and for others this game became a second (or first for the students/unemployed) job. 

I grew my roster during this, through more characters to run chaos, occasional swiping, and changing from gunslinger to reaper main I had several strong characters that could run the newest content or at least the first few gates of it. The honing past 1540 is where I finally started to feel the pain of honing draining my resources. My reaper was 1520 on Brel NM release, some other alts were 1500 or working up to it. Same for Brel HM release. My reaper was 1560 and fewer alts were 1540 ready for at least gates 1-2. And yet, I never cleared or even got to attempt gates 5-6 HM because for those who this game became a second job attempted it (and they've still yet to even clear it) without me and the ones I really wanted to try it with. So the ones left behind just stopped playing pretty much because they don't wanna pug it, and understandably so. I usually ran Brel HM 1-2 on 4 characters and 3-4 on 2 of those 4. Now Kayangel is here and my only character I used up the last of my resources to reach 1580. The rest of my roster will never reach that, and realizing so I don't wanna put in the time to even try.

I appeal again and am told the matter is closed and no further responses from AGS CS are warranted. I look at the forums and find that people are being banned because they purchased skins on the in-game auction house from people that later refunded their founders packs.

1599340,Lost Ark,"This is a love letter to Lost Ark, a game that crept up out of nowhere and took control of my life in 2022. This game leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to me now, but there was a time where it was sweet and lovely. I wish my feelings for the game had remained strong, but that's not the world we live in, not the world I live in.

The bots are demolishing the economy, the content is unnecessarily grindy, Amazon cares little about communicating with their playerbase, and Smilegate has put every region except Korea on the back-burner. I want to keep playing this game. I want to go back to the days where I was the guild master trying my absolute hardest to support my many guild mates, who I had been together with since Tier 1, when times were simpler. I want the feeling of burnout to stop, but I am sure it never will, even if its been half a year since I played the game religiously.

Amazon will never admit that bots will never be removed and that the problem will only get worse. They'll never acknowledge that the alt grind is too much for the average player. They won't explain the reasons why they run things the way they do. This isn't the game that I signed up for. 

What do I mean by this game not being the game that I signed up for? In Korea, Lost Ark leveled the MMO scene and demolished the competition. There was a mass exodus of players from every major MMO to Lost Ark. Players were tired of games where the developers didn't communicate with its players, had horrendous grindfests, and had severe content droughts. Lost Ark turned into the very thing that MMO lovers had wanted to run away from, and it seems like there's no hope in the future as well. How did this happen? I just want to know personally because it hurts not knowing what went wrong. Legendary director Gold River leaving may have played a part in it. Or the unsolvable bot problem. Maybe Amazon deserves all of the blame? I don't know. All I know is that this is not the game that I downloaded on February 11, 2022, and I don't think it ever will be. I want to call for some sort of action, some changes, but I already gave up on that a long time ago, nothing is going to change and I accept that.

I accept that the game has problems that will never be resolved. It hurts, but I accept it. I love Lost Ark because of what it meant to me. Ultimately, I will love it no matter what path it goes down. I left the game not with a bang, but a whimper, and that's just how it's going to be.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",love letter lost ark crept nowhere took control life 2022 leaf bitter taste mouth sweet lovely wish feeling remained strong not_the world live not_the world live bot demolishing economy unnecessarily grindy amazon care communicating playerbase smilegate region except korea burner day guild master trying absolute hardest support guild mate tier 1 time simpler feeling burnout never_will half religiously amazon never_admit bot never_be removed problem worse never_acknowledge alt grind average explain reason thing t_emphasizedhe signed not_being signed korea lost ark leveled massively multiplayer online scene demolished competition mass exodus player major massively multiplayer online lost ark player tired game developer communicate player horrendous grindfests severe drought lost ark turned massively multiplayer online lover wanted no_hope future happen personally hurt not_knowing wrong legendary director gold river leaving unsolvable bot problem maybe amazon deserves blame not_the downloaded february 11 2022 t_emphasizedhink call sort action change already gave long ago accept accept problem never_be resolved hurt accept love lost ark meant ultimately love no_matter path go left not_with bang whimper

1599340,Lost Ark,"[b]If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you![/b]   Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead.  Excited yet?  You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job!  Wait, there's more!   If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content.  That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of!   Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside...  This is a pay to win game.  That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can.  They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that.   However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands.   I'm serious, it's beyond insanity. 

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you:  it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content.  You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will  express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up.   It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.  

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players.   All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression.   Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character.  Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too.   The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold.   What is gold good for?   The Auction House.  Upgrade items and gear.  Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals.   That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.   

What the heck are Pheons?   They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters.  The gear you wear is what determines your item level.  After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials.  Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in.   So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.

How do you get Pheons?   You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals.   How do you get blue crystals?   By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons.   Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.   

Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server.   These bots have one goal - farm gold.   Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue.   It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag.   Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.   

You see the problem yet?   Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value.  [i]Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK[/i], that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups.   Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies.  There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum.  Maybe as many as 60?  I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid.  Almost all of them are unnecessary. 

There are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous ""I'd rather watch paint dry"" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you'll try to participate in, and so much more.

1599340,Lost Ark,"If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you! Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead. Excited yet? You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job! Wait, there's more! If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content. That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of! Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside... This is a pay to win game. That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can. They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that. However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands. I'm serious, it's beyond insanity.

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you: it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content. You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up. It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players. All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression. Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character. Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too. The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold. What is gold good for? The Auction House. Upgrade items and gear. Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals. That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.

What the heck are Pheons? They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters. The gear you wear is what determines your item level.

1599340,Lost Ark,"After almost 2300 hours I would say I have a pretty good idea of the in's and out's of this game.

I would not recommend this game to anyone for any reason.
Most of your gains in the game are rng. I had a 19.22% to upgrade and I failed nearly 180 times before I gave up. I also failed on a 2% chance 80 times in a row. After all those fails and no upgrades it was time to call it.

I could make a super long review going into in detail why this game is so terrible but most people just want a short answer.

Simply put, the game doesn't respect your time. It sees you as a slave expecting you to spend thousands of hours for no return.

If you want a in depth review I will make one if this review reachs 100 likes.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",2300 hour pretty good idea not_recommend gain rng 19 22 upgrade failed nearly 180 time gave failed 2 chance 80 time row fails no_upgrades call super long detail terrible short answer simply respect see slave expecting spend thousand hour no_return depth reach 100 like
1599340,Lost Ark,"I loved this game. The first part was a grind. Getting a character to lvl 50 felt like it took an eternity. But once I was able to join my friends on end game content, it was a blast. It all went to hell when I decided to start collecting mokoko seeds. One day I decided to sit at a breakable wall on Mount Zagoras and attack it to get the 3 hidden/ blocked collectibles. After about an hour and with the help of a random player, we got the seeds and then I got permanently banned for cheating. I went back and forth with Amazon Games customer service bots and they sent a final ""We can't share any further information about our decision, and we won't reply to further emails about the issue"". 

367 hours down the drain because I did exactly what the game developers designed when they made a wall/barrier that requires a ton of hits to break down. It is sad, but clearly they don't care how much time is invested in their product. Maybe if I wasn't F2P I would have had a different outcome.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",loved grind lvl 50 took eternity able join friend blast hell decided collecting mokoko seed decided sit breakable wall mount zagoras attack 3 hidden blocked collectible help random seed permanently banned cheating forth amazon game customer service bot sent final share information decision reply email issue 367 hour drain exactly developer designed wall barrier requires ton hit break sad clearly care invested product maybe f2p different outcome
1599340,Lost Ark,"Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn't want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.

The dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.

People who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won't replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don't use the boxes.

PvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules ""No healing potions, no ultimates"" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it's my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can't do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I'll leave it as ""I'm new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being"".

Addressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don't feel it's a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That's pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don't have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it's not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.

Classes. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won't be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren't available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I'm not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn't' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.

So to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",0 expectation sunk 20 hour alpha burn no_idea launching took gunlance class 40 fantastic excited launch dungeon interesting far mini cutscenes character slowly climb ladder walk across skinny beam decent found spam clicking 20 action able respec talent nice allowing different ability different modifier progressed saying easy weapon box high weapon replace anytime soon obvious completing dungeon hard mode drop lower weapon gate 10 good otherwise progression slow spongy enemy result authentic whatever box pvp side met group player dueling consistently alpha 30 gunlance dueled artillerist 28 player participating 15 rule no_healing potion no_ultimates z v ability generate perhaps lack knowledge ranged class ability stagger lock artillerist flame thrower caught anywhere massive cone flinch damage no_diminishing return saw warlord dodge unique hop hated giving small dodge rarely took danger ability super armor leave ranged class kick as addressing pay 2 win concern pay 2 win model traditionally upcoming top guild recruiting player platinum founder pack rushing 50 spending premium currency load character rolling map pure speculation understand pay upgrade gear pretty frustrating knowledge guild war not_my priority streamer state country 100 stuff paying real perpetually allowing bonus spending dime good imo class class balance strange 5 class released launch available country access 14 power house class available scouter demolisher lance master arcanist desired based general chat feel gating player dump pay gear class release not_a fan game ready slowly introducing cash grab 14 class plenty gender lock major issue outside not_wanting look waifu wrap someone 0 expectation 0 knowledge enjoyed market serious massively multiplayer online format gamble
1599340,Lost Ark,"For the new players that see the trailers for this game and think ""wow, this looks kind of fun!"", do not let the weird tags on the store page fool you.

Lost Ark is an 8-player exclusively title that costs $60 to play. 

""But"", you type on your keyboard, ""the game is free, why would I spend $60? Also, can't I play alone?""

No. Here is what will happen if you decide to not spend $60 on this game and do not have 7 friends to play with. You will get 50 hours into a game with the worst campaign, story, and characters you have ever seen with no meaningful content then quit thinking ""why do people even play this, this game sucks!"". Here's the rub: if you have not paid $60 for the South Vern powerpass and experienced the content that unlocks, you have literally not played the game. Lost Ark is not a game at this point of its life before the spot the South Vern pass drops you off at . It saves you 100 hours of the worst filler content you have ever seen. Trust me, there's no point touching this game at all without buying that pass, you will just have wasted all of your time.

But ok, let's see you put in that 100 hours legit since you're a masochist. You're raid ready now! Except you don't have 7 friends, so you're actually not raid ready ever. You see, the Lost Ark community is utter dogshit. You have never had the mispleasure of interacting with the most burned out, toxic, gatekeepy, sweaty fucks in your life before. If they aren't satisfied that you haven't put in thousands of hours in meaningless side content, thousands of dollars in money for more virtual numbers on your character, or god forbid both, you don't get to play with them. For the average player, this means you don't get to play endgame content at all.

So fuck them. Play with your friends. You don't wanna be a part of the Lost Ark community. You just want to be a person that *plays* Lost Ark. And you'll be much happier for doing so. Just run content when you and your friends are ready for it, and don't ever do anything in this game that you don't think is fun.

If you don't have $60 bucks and 7 friends (which I get it, it's hard to convince seven other people to commit $60 and part of their time every week for a multiplayer game), then play a different game honestly. Lost Ark is an excellent game but it's quite literally unplayable alone and for free.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",player trailer wow look kind fun not_let weird tag store page fool lost ark 8 exclusively title cost 60 type keyboard spend 60 alone no_here happen decide not_spend 60 not_have 7 friend 50 hour worst campaign character no_meaningful quit this_emphasized suck rub not_paid 60 south vern powerpass experienced unlocks literally not_played lost ark not_a life spot south vern pas drop save 100 hour worst filler trust no_point touching buying pas wasted ok s_emphasizedee 100 hour legit masochist raid ready except 7 friend not_raid ready lost ark community utter dogshit never_had mispleasure interacting burned toxic gatekeepy sweaty fuck life satisfied thousand hour meaningless side thousand dollar virtual number god forbid average mean endgame fuck friend wan na lost ark community play lost ark happier friend ready t_emphasizedhink fun 60 buck 7 friend it_emphasized hard convince seven commit 60 week multiplayer different honestly lost ark excellent literally unplayable alone
1599340,Lost Ark,"After hours of my life on this game... I've come to the sad conclusion that it can't be enjoyed.
The only thing I enjoy in this game is raiding with my friends if not for them I would have quit long ago.. I was going to put a list of pros and cons like most reviews but I am finding it hard to come up with pros aside from playing with friends but not everyone has friends that can play around the same times they can.. so I will just post the cons.

1. [Gate keeping] Players gate keep for everything in this game.. Items / your I level / your roster level / your class / your title / your pet / your card set / The crazy part is I don't blame them 1 bit because the game encourages it.. I mean think about it if you can get your raids done faster why would you not? it is not like you get anything for spending time with new players in fact you lose all the way around.. your time to play / your items / sanity.. even playing with friends can be hard because if someone has a hiccup you all die in raids and raiding is a must.. that brings me to number 2 below

2. [The Community] is very predatory you will be kicked from raids for messing up sometimes even once is enough and it don't matter if you are a new player or not..now what I mean by predatory is the high level players often sell buses to low level players or players that don't want to take the time to learn and them same high level players make alts that they use to sabotage other players raids so they can sell them buses to stay ahead in the game.. this has no sign of going away because 1 players mistakes costs everyone in raids and late game gear is locked behind them same raids.

3. [Honing] You have to hone your gear in this game to unlock content and the cost is insane.. just as an example I had an alt cost me over 250.000 gold just to gain 15 I levels.. 1475 to 1490.. you need 1490 to gain access to a raid called brelshaza.. and I didn't even count the gold I spent on getting the gear I needed to raid 60.000 which you need or you will be subjected to gate keeping.. this is over a months worth of gold raiding as a F2P player with 5 alts doing all of your raids weekly.. dealing with hard raids and a toxic community that won't let you learn unless you have friends to play with.. If I am being honest the raids are not even that hard but the community being toxic / rage quitting / sabotaging / makes them hard.. some light to raiding is they are nerfing how hard some of the raids are however they are also taking some of the gold you make out of them raids making it harder to hone up to the levels you need to get into higher level raids.

4. [Dead content] The game is filled with side quests in the form of islands you go to some of which have important things such as skill potions you need for your characters... I think it is an awesome idea to give players more to do in game.. however most of them islands need a group of players and can't be done solo.. so in the end the players that started when the game was released got to enjoy some of them islands until the player base got what they needed and the content died leaving new players or players that didn't focus on that content left out.

5. [Raiding] I like raids with my friends however some of my friends are not that good at raiding and don't have much time to sit and learn for hours so what ends up happening is we take time out to teach each other the raids this costs us entry into the higher level raids we need to progress and the items we have to use during learning time...overall setting us back weeks in progress cause raids can only be done weekly making it hard to enjoy teaching your friends or new players new raids and adding to the gate keeping that is already crazy in this game.. it is hard to keep raiding as a friends group cause honing can be lucky or unlucky setting you back or ahead not to mention time difference work / school schedule then the entry system I mentioned above... this leaves your friends or new players at the mercy of a toxic predatory community making raiding not enjoyable and gate keeping players progress stopping them from obtaining the gold/gear they need to progress in the game.

6. [Trading] Trading is locked behind a system that uses coins called pheons like a tax pheons are also used to buy your meta gear off the market however the cost is high making you not want to trade with players so you have the pheons to buy the meta gear you need to raid so you are not getting gate kept... not to mention you also can't send your alt characters gear that would be good for them cause it will still cost you pheons and pheons cost real money... pheons was a system put in place to stop bots from farming gear and trading it so that a market could exist however it stops players from helping friends or new players from obtaining the gear they need to progress driving market prices up and promoting gate keeping.

7. [Bussing] Bus/carry players.. I don't think Bussing overall is a bad thing sometimes players don't have the time to do raids on all 6 characters or they are being gate kept by the community however Bussing becomes bad when players take advantage of newer players by charging them crazy amounts of gold to pass a raid stopping them from having gold to hone and progress also stopping them from making gold by learning the raids creating a grey area where they have to pay to play or quit because depending on how long they have been bussing they will be so far behind that no one will want to help them learn or catch up leaving them gate kept.

8. [Time spent] Overall all sometimes it feels like the community traps players into playing so you don't fall behind... by gate keeping players with low roster levels or lack of titles from raids they need to progress making it so time off of the game hurts... not to mention it takes weeks/months to get the gold you need to build a meta character.. the game itself encourages you to make alt characters so you can level up your roster faster and so you will have more raids to do for gold but again this takes a lot of time to get done.. you have to take into account the fact it will cost gold to build every alt character you make before you can even use them to make gold cutting into even more of your time..not to mention each of them characters will be gate kept at some point making it take more time to get the gear they need from raids.. if you plan on playing every alt you make for profit the game will feel like a job and take up crazy amounts of your time... if you don't you will be gate kept for not having a high enough roster level and your progress will slow.

I can't recommend it to any new players knowing what I know after 1640 hours into playing...1. Raids need to be nerfed so players can't sabotage new players in hopes of selling buses... also so new players stand a chance at learning not just being kicked from party's and to cut down on the time it takes to raid when you have 6 characters to raid on. / 2. Honing cost is still way to high for a game that is losing ways to make gold Rapport/Raids / 3. Pheons have to go they don't stop bots they drive up the market and encourage gate keeping / 4. side content like the islands should be solo friendly for players that don't play much or don't have 7 friends on standby for when they do have time to play it especially since that content is important for progress / 5. Overall time it takes to get daily's done needs to be reduced as it is essential for roster level and character growth it takes way to much time to even think about side content when you have to do daily's on 6 characters / 6.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Don't get me wrong, Lost Ark is a pretty good game overall for an MMO. The bad part is that the game design is to gatekeep players so hard at the endgame. For me, when I quit and if I come back, no one will want to play with me because you will fail the mechanics on new raid bosses or you're not geared enough and anger everyone since no one wants to waste their time failing over and over. Also, this game is a grindfest/P2W, and when you reach the endgame, it becomes quite boring to do the same crap over and over.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",wrong lost ark pretty good massively multiplayer online bad design gatekeep player hard endgame quit no_one fail mechanic raid boss not_geared anger no_one want waste failing grindfest p2w reach endgame boring crap
1599340,Lost Ark,"I have been playing since launch and have since put 2.5k+ hours into this game. I have held out as long as I could in hopes that this game would get better because it has a lot of positive aspects – cool classes, great combat, and a wide variety of vertical and horizontal content.

However, the game’s community is by FAR one of the worst I have experienced. To mirror some of the other reviews – people are incredibly toxic and gate-keeping is the worst I’ve seen in any MMORPG. Don’t have enough item level, engravings, or a specific title? You’re not getting into a party. If somehow you do make it into a group, be prepared to get chewed out if you make a mistake because many raids have a raid-wipe mechanic where all eight players need to be on the same page. Your average player has very little patience for wipes and will force a group quit after a few failures instead of communicating or trying to teach players how to do a raid mechanic properly. With that said, I have met a small number of helpful players in the 8.5 months playing the game but they are definitely in the minority.

Other issues I’ve seen with the game that haven’t been addressed are the rampant bots and inflation. I can’t speak for all regions but on NA West, the server I play is on like 75% bots and it’s honestly disgusting to see how many of them are running around the capital cities. AGS/Smilegate claim they are doing everything they can to combat the bots but it’s obviously not working – you see items on the auction house being sold for millions of gold constantly which is obviously real money transactions happening. The price of items and blue crystals (premium currency you can buy with real money or gold, needed to buy gear and cash shop items) is skyrocketing to a point that is just laughable. The price for 100 blue crystals exceeds that of Korean servers now because of how insanely out of control the botting problem is on NA servers. A single earring can cost 300k+ gold which is absurd when an 8-man raid only gives 3-5k on a weekly lockout. Class engraving books have tripled in price the past few months – it will now take upwards of 400k gold to get 20 legendary class engraving books, depending on what your build is. As a new player, it will be extremely difficult to catch up without at least swiping your credit card a little bit. 

The last issue I have is how prevalent RNG is in this game and maybe a non-issue for those that are accustomed to this type of game. I currently have every adventurer tome at 100% except Brelshaza for South Vern and almost every collectible at 100%, key word almost. The RNG aspect is so heavily ingrained into every aspect of the game that you could get royally screwed on certain drops for months/years if you are unlucky. For example, at time of writing this, I am still missing the Lush Reed island soul and Forpe Island sea bounty to name a couple, despite having run them every time available since launch in February 2022. Gear progression is all RNG based as well – the success rate for honing your gear to the next level drops to such a small amount (1-3%) that you could spend weeks of materials/gold just to increase one piece. 

To a lot of players I’m sure these gripes are OK and no big deal but for me personally, this is incredibly demoralizing gameplay and feels like I am wasting so much time just to fail. I’m surprised I’ve invested as much time as I have and uninstalling the game honestly feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. If you are looking to be rewarded for investing your time, look elsewhere. This is NOT a casual friendly game.

At first the community is insane toxic if somebody dont get a mechanic all will flame him to the death. 
Second the game has an insane learning curve in my opinion (that leads back to the first problem in my opinion, the toxcisity, because everybody gets frustrated) 
And the last problem why i cant play this game anymore and furthermore cant recommend it to anybody is, that nobody has patience to play a game more than 15 minutes. I miss the good old days when you had to try a raid over again and again to finish it and everybody had the patience to do it.

1599340,Lost Ark,"If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you! Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead. Excited yet? You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job! Wait, there's more! If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content. That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of! Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside... This is a pay to win game. That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can. They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that. However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands. I'm serious, it's beyond insanity.

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you: it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content. You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up. It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players. All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression. Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character. Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too. The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold. What is gold good for? The Auction House. Upgrade items and gear. Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals. That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.

What the heck are Pheons? They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters. The gear you wear is what determines your item level. After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials. Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in. So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.

How do you get Pheons? You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals. How do you get blue crystals? By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons. Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.

Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server. These bots have one goal - farm gold. Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue. It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag. Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.

You see the problem yet? Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value. Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK, that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups. Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies. There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum. Maybe as many as 60? I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid. Almost all of them are unnecessary.

There are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous ""I'd rather watch paint dry"" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you'll try to participate in, and so much more.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Let me preface this by saying this review's purpose isn’t so that I get unbanned, at this point I don’t plan to ever return and play any AGS games. This is the first time I’ve been banned on any online game and this is the point that really irks me. This is here to provide some awareness for anyone who may be interested in this game and hope that others who’ve been unfairly banned will speak out so at the very least others may be aware and AGS may actually start becoming better or competent. 

Background:
•	Over 800 hours on the account.
•	My characters and some relevant equipment are as follows (AFAIK, Gem levels may be all over the place, 1 or 2 level 7, most were 4 or 5, few 6), I don’t bus at all and I’ve only ridden on a couple busses mostly for new 1370s. Bought the Gold Pre-release founders pack on release:
•	1462.5 Paladin – 1x level 7 Gem, assorted other gems usually all under 5 as I just forged most of my gems for 2 x level 7 Gems before the ban; all legendary accessories 3/3/3/1/1
•	1430 Glaivier – level 4-6 Gems, relic accessories 4x3, 1x1
•	1415 Deathblade – level 4-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1
•	1415 Sorceress – level 4-5 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2
•	1415 Bard – level 3-4 Gems (new Powerpassed character), legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2
•	1402.5 Gunslinger – level 3-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1 or 2

Suspected Triggers for Ban:
•	I’ve been selling as much stuff as possible to try to get enough for Legendary Grudge Engraving. Recently, I merged all my Paladin Gems and got 2x level 7 Gems but both were damage Gems so I moved those to my DB to reforge and bought 1 level 7 CD gem for around 15k Gold I believe (NAE Market Price). The DB rerolled the 2x level 7 Gems and sold them for 16k list, 18k BO which both sold on the market. Also sold T3 Destruction Stones and Honing Stones.
•	Bought a Swimsuit skin with RC and sold some of the pieces on the Market for Market price (pretty heavy fluctuation during the final weeks of the sale)
•	Bought new skins for my Bard and Sorceress and replaced some of the older skins by selling on the market for market price.

Ban and Appeal Process:
I found out I was banned on Sunday at around 9 PM EST. Obviously, I could not tell what triggered my ban so I sent in an appeal request at Sunday at 9:16 PM.
I received a reply at 9:28 PM saying that my ban was permanent and the disciplinary action was merited but they did not state why I was banned apart from Cheating which still does not tell me anything. 

I sent a reply back stating I still do not know what I was accused of and I can’t provide evidence against something I do not know, noted that my characters were the ilevels above and their gems/accessories being not high value. I also noted that most of my characters had rested bonus so I probably wasn’t botting and asking for escalation and got this as automated reply saying I’ll hear back from them within 6 hours.

After that I did not hear anything back. I re-sent in an appeal on Monday and it was becoming clear that they do not read these at all and just send the same prepared responses without any review. This went on constantly so at this point I’m pretty confident that they don’t ever read these and just block you. I read on their forums that sometimes the German one may actually result in an actual person reviewing the case but same response in German. I have sent in other appeals but all had the exact same response.

Seeing as AGS refuses to even tell me why I got banned or even bother to read my appeals, the only thing that this really tells me is that the claim that Moderators read appeals is a bald-faced lie and any CM who says otherwise is perpetuating this lie.
Based on what I did on my account, I suspect someone who RMTs bought my gem or skins and I got flagged as a Gold Seller as based on what I could see, RMT is not necessarily a permanent ban. This was added in my later appeals but same response. My Steam account is an account with over 200 games and is my only used Steam account, to be a used as a Gold seller would be highly illogical. Also, I purchased a pre-release package so its an old account.

Now why am I making this review? After reading the forums and Reddit about these posts, there’s usually some people mentioning that their friends also got banned unfairly but just gave up. Seeing as some of these posts are starting to crop up more, I would implore them to make some noise about it so that AGS may finally have to act. At the very least, it can provide a warning to anyone on the fence that this may happen to them and they should be wary. 

tl;dr - highest ilvl 1462.5, couple lvl 7 gems, sold 2 lvl 7 gems and some skins on the market and got banned. Appeals get a response in 5-10 minutes upholding the ban without saying why I got banned.

Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK, that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups. Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies. There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum. Maybe as many as 60? I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid. Almost all of them are unnecessary.

There are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous ""I'd rather watch paint dry"" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you'll try to participate in, and so much more.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Well im nearly at 2k hours without spending a single dime so let me sum it all up as an F2P.

i'll divide this to 4 sections, Pros, Cons, Neutral , Conclusion.

if you dont wanna read it all just go to Conclusion.



[h1] PROS: [/h1]

World : Lost ark has a vast and beautiful world. has around 8-9 continents (more in future) and dozen small islands, to which you can travel using the boat given to you further down the story. some are event islands, some are time based and some are PvP.

Classes : 20+ classes (a new class every i think 2 months) each having different play styles. each class has +18 different skills to choose from. and different tripods that will change a skill behaves. Good animation and audio for all of them.

Combat: Has a great combat system. at first you might be overwhelmed with everything but soon you'll understand the mechanics. 

Events: constantly gives players event rewards and boosts from events.

Reaching End game And Alt characters: after going through the story and reaching level 50, the game gives you 2 powerpass tickets used to instantly level 2 more alt characters to level 50 and more powerpass tickets further down the story plus 1 power pass and a express mission to level up your characters with every new released class so you can reach others with the new class or any other class of your choice. 

Raids: the main content of Lost Ark's end game. it is fun but challenging. 

PvP system: no matter how much you have paid in this game you are always equal to your opponent so there is only skill involved in in PvP. there are different types as well such as 1v1 Duel ,TDM , DM , siege battle , guild wars and so on.

Music: the music for some the raid are so good makes you forget what you are doing. the overall music of the open world is good too.

Update: Frequent Updates such as new content, balance patches and etc...





[h1] Cons: [/h1]

Story: its kinda boring tbh. some parts are awesome tho like the siege battle at start of the story so its not all bad but most will just skip it. ( Edit : the only story that hyped me up was the Elgacia's story. the only awesome story that i did not skip. not even the dialog) 

End game: after 5-6 hours of story you'll get to level 50, the start of end game which unlocks chaos dungeons, guardian raids, Legion Raids and so on.

Dead content: some of those said islands you'll come across need multiple people to complete but since most have done it already you wont find many people.

Leveling up: contents you unlock at level 50 give you material used for leveling up your gear. fortunately if you dont feel like doing it everyday you'll get Rest bonus which gives 66% more mats next time you do it so you wont lose that much.
your gear leveling is RNG. so are other parts of the end game leveling. specially at the higher level it takes a long time just to level one gear so be prepared.

Raid mechanics: each raid has its own mechanics which will impact how you play and it is important to understand them since some mechanics if done wrong will wipe the party. 

Gate keeping: a major problem in lost ark is gate keeping. for those who dont know it means not letting someone in the party because they are low level or have bad gear. it is understandable since people dont wanna wipe because of 1 person who didnt know the mechs but thats what prog parties are for. you can always join a prog party if needed.

Community: just like IRL there are kind people who are willing to help you and there are those who scream at you for a simple mistake. from personal experience if you make a mistake there is always that one dude who screams but the rest of the party usually defend you or try to help you ( given that you arent just trolling).

Class Balancing: Some classes are stronger than one another. its unfair that a sorcerer does 200M with one skill while my full skill rotation with Reaper does 160M.

Choosing a Name: a Nightmare.

P2W: you can swipe that card and get months of progress BUT nothing is locked behind it. a F2P with grind can get everything a P2W can. Paying is just a boost and nothing more.





[h1] Neutral: (some are based on my experience) [/h1] 

Grind: i put this here because I have never grinded that much. i usually do choas and guardians raids 2 times and rarely 3 times a week if i have rest bonus. so when some people say Lost ark is a job, i dont really get it and i have played almost everyhting available in the end game. (i say almost cuz i was busy with school and stuff so i didnt play for 4 months and still managed to catch up to other players) 

Groups and static: if you have friends you'll enjoy this game even more but that doesnt mean you wont enjoy it playing solo. so play with others if possible. find yourself a static group or guild. 

Learning the Mechanics: characters and Raid mechs are hard at first but there are awesome guides on youtube from people like (atk. Lustboy, memorizer92 , Zealsambitions) that will sum up everything so you'll understand them completely.

Developers: They completely ruined this game at the start but as of half a year ago a new development team has been fixing everything such as fatigue from doing dailies, better rewards, easier leveling system, balancing and so on.
If they continue this path Lost Ark will become better and better as time goes by.

New players Friendly? : the new team is looking out for new players. they have made it far easier for them to catch up with others so they wont feel left out. and continue doing so

Bots: this is a free to play game after all so expect bots. AGS is constantly battling bots and unlike before, you wont be seeing waves of 50-100 players all moving on the same path following a script to progress and earn gold so the botters can sell those online. ( do keep in mind they are still in the game but reduced in numbers)



 
[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

There are other things left unmentioned but lets end it here

1599340,Lost Ark,"The game itself is magnificent. Surely, it may have some mobile like feel and it does have some of the sins of F2P model, but if you play the game, you can instantly feel that it's a product of love by the development team. Fights are mechanically challenging, graphics are stunning, contents are more than enough to keep you occupied and coming back for more.

So why the negative review? Simple. The game is published and serviced by one of the worst companies I've experienced through out my over 2 decades of gaming. Amazon Games Studio.

They have done injustice to the game since pre-launch. Butchered the original version in the name of ""Westernization"". To watch the original director actually complain about what they've done, changing names of characters and applying censorship changes, on an OFFICIAL interview was simply depressing.

Game launches, guess what happens. Server overload and instability every single day. Maintenance, patching, more problems, more down time, rinse and repeat.

Economy already went to complete ruin because despite the numerous warnings against how rampant the game will be with RMT and botters without proper measures in place to deal with it preemptively. Out of 1M concurrent you see, literally 50% are suspected to be bots because according to steam accomplishment, less than 15% of players even reach the end of leveling tutorial, and how inflated the market is is simply ridiculous. When community kept warning AGS about how this will happen, they said ""they will be monitoring closely"". What a joke.

So they finally ""do something"", mass ban wave. They pay news outlets to publish articles that they're banning 1 million bot accounts and they should be praised for working hard to keep the game clean.

State of the game remains the same. Guess what though, thousands of players get caught up in false positive bans but they have no infrastructure to support the appeal process. Hell, they literally closed down call center couple weeks ago after Lost Ark's explosive launch. People get stuck in endless loop of sending ticket and receiving macro response without even getting an answer on why they got banned.

You have people getting perma banned for refunding founders pack PRIOR TO GAME LAUNCH, in many cases, to upgrade to a more expensive packs.
You have people who getting perma banned for trying to break down barrier that takes 15 minutes to break while listening to music.
You have people who getting perma banned for buying skins in Auction House because seller of the skin refunded.
You have people who getting perma banned for receiving mail attachments.

What a complete and utter shitshow. What exacerbated the situation is that initially, Community Managers tried to gather information on the community forum to help the cases get reviewed.
The next day, different CM closes down the topic.
Next day, these topics start getting deleted.

Level of unprofessionalism is simply incredible and the game really deserve better. 
In no other industry would this type of behavior and incompetence be tolerated.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Henlo friends, I have about 400$ in this game, but I am f2p. It was mostly skins, but 200$ was spent getting one of 112 LOS30 cards.

I have 6200 hours in this game as a f2p pleb, and here is my review of why even after all of the positive changes we've had in the last 6 months, I cannot recommend it.

To begin, why do I have 6k+ hours? The boss fights. Legion raid fights are so, so fun, especially with friends (I rarely PUG, I typically do 90% of my content with a mix of the same people.) That...is about it. That's the only good part about Lost Ark.

Now, for the bad. The systems for progression.

To build a char, you need to hone it to the level of content you wish to participate in. I have 5 1600+ characters, 1614 artist being highest. It has taken me 8-12 characters worth of funneling and daily grinding for the last 24 months to achieve this as a f2p. Yes, there is a pity system, but you have to put a ridiculous amount of time/effort in just to hit thresholds, and I'm not even where I want to be. My goal was at least 1 1620, and I could have hit that if I ignored my alts but to hell with that, I chose the 'fun' route.

But that's not all! You need gear. What does gear entail? Lotteries. Multiple, lotteries. To start, you need an engraving stone. TL;DR there are 30 'nodes' on 3 lines, 10 each. 2 are positive, 1 are negative. You have at most a 75% chance to 'fill' a node, filling one is -10% for the next, failing is +10%. You are REQUIRED to get a 7/7/x (pray x is lower than 5), 9/5/x, or similar. My cheapest attempts at acquiring one took around 20k. My most expensive, on a single character, was 490k gold. (You can earn around 100k a week in-game if you do EVERYTHING on at least 6 1580+ characters, which only takes like a year+ of grinding so good luck.)

After your stone, you need accessories, the easy part. You farm some gold, save, then buy what you need from the market. If you're smart about it, you can get a 5x3+1 build (acceptable level) for under 150k with market tax (pheons, awful system.)

Now you can play your character! Unfortunately, you will be gatekept unless the quality on your gear is also pretty solid. Quality is a weighted lottery where the first 0-70% is about a 90% roll, and the remaining 30% you actually want/need to be in is about 10%. There is no pitying. Your chances cost raid tokens and raw gold. One of my characters purple quality weapons took 60k, another (my main dps) took 580k. This is just your weapon, and whereas quality tapping armor pieces is cheaper, there are 5 of them. Getting 70 quality is about a 3-4% roll, and anything above 70 starts going down even more (90% is less than 1% chance.) No, you do not 'need' this, but you aren't going to get into any groups to do content to get gold to try more unless you do.

Ok, NOW you can play the game! If...your bracelet is also 'ok.' This was a system introduced with Brelshaza, 13 months ago. You can grab a cheap one off the market, roll it until you get both your secondary stats and some extra health or something, and call it a day, but people gatekeep off of these, two. Bracelets are an additional accessory that costs pheons to buy, or you can pray your content gives you a few to tap a day. They can have 1-2 fixed slots (you typically look for your fixed secondary like swiftness, or crit, w/e) and 1-3 'open' slots. Bracelets can be rolled 4 times, that is it. 4. No more than 4, just, 4. Each time you roll your random open effects, you can choose to lock one if you get something spicy, but you only get 4 chances total. There are about 5 good options to roll for on a list of like 80, and no I'm not kidding. On top of that each option has green, blue purple and yellow quality. Congrats when you finally win but it's all blues, yes it's still good but it looks like garbage so weee. It has been 13 months, I have 5+ 1600s (and 2 more that are over 1580) and I only 2 bracelets that are considered 'ok' after throwing about 500k into buying some as well desperately trying to get one that was acceptable.

And now, for the coup de grace. We just recently got Voldis introduced here, and along with it, the elixir system. Week 2 of this content release, players began gatekeeping off of having a set bonus with elixirs. I can't tl;dr this so here we go.

There are purple and yellow quality elixirs. Purple can be a max of 4/4 (two level 4 effects) and yellows can be 5/5. Only your 5 armor pieces can have elixirs, so with purples you can have a max of 40 levels, and with yellows 50. A set bonus requires 35 total levels for the first part of your set, and 40 for the second. You can obtain purples at 1600, and yellows at 1620. Seems simple enough, right?

To 'cut' an elixir, you take your little vial of happiness and hope to the shiny mirror, and then you have 5 steps to choose 1 of 3 options from a pool of like 40. Like 10 of these are specific set bonuses, 10 are specific piece bonuses, and the remainder are general stat bonuses. They range from useless garbage like additional damage while you're by yourself, to raw attack/primary stats. In my experience, I have rolled my required set bonuses on my characters about 5% of the time. Then, you begin building it. Each elixir begins at 5 effects and will end with the 2 you will apply to your gear. Purples have 12 steps, yellows have 15. Each step gives 1 point to one of the 5 effects (only 2 of which you're going for) at random. You need to get 9 points in 1 effect to have a level 4 for purple (2 effects need 9 each to have a 4/4) and 10 points in 2 effects for yellows in a 5/5.

Each step also allows you to pick 1 of 3 random options from a pool of 40+ actions. These range from -2+2 to a random of the 5 effects, or they have you select one, shuffle all points, reducing points from 1 effect and adding them to another but both effects selected are random, huge effects like -4-+5 but then that option of 3 steps is just gone for the remainder of the cut, literally every elixir is different. Every step is a random one of like a million options, the effects they affect and the way they affect them is random, and...well you see where this is going. After 4 weeks of 5+ characters, I don't have a single viable set piece yet, and you need 2 to start.

But wait, there's more. If you spend about a years worth of setting alarms for timed events you probably won't get to complete because nobody does them anymore, then people may finally not assume you're a bot, or a whale, and you'll have lots of shiny adventure/game content completion! (Mostly a collectibles system but 90 times more annoying, and there are like 20 of them, I gave up on them over a year ago) Doing about 90% of this content to its max will give each of your characters like 2% more dmg/health and stuff. Congrats.

Oh, and cards. Don't have Light of Salvation 30? Not only are you missing 15% damage, you're still being gatekept. Took 18 months to finish my LoS30 and I finished pretty quickly (I did an extra 2-3 hours a week of 'abyss loops' which is just old dungeons you 1 shot for a like 2% chance at a card, praying its a card you need and not the 400th copy of one) compared to other guildies, some of which have finished in the last few weeks (almost 2 years of play time.) Also there's 3 other semi-necessary sets.

I have 6k+ hours in this game. I want to love it, because the combat is soooo, sooo so so fun, but the other 95% of the game is pure despair, and if I wasn't playing 12 hours a day I wouldn't even be able to experience it the way I do. Also I love my friends.

I still can't even do all of the content in the game, lol. Am I crying over the 900 lottery systems cuz I have bad luck? No. My luck has been above average, easily, and it's still actual trash. Even people with good luck are starting to hate it. Lost Ark CAN be great, but right now, I absolutely, 400% cannot recommend this game, because it's a full time job+ that treats you worse than garbage.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",henlo friend 400 f2p mostly skin 200 spent 112 los30 card 6200 hour f2p pleb positive change last 6 month cannot_recommend 6k hour bos fight legion raid fight so_emphasized fun especially friend rarely pug typically 90 mix good lost ark bad system progression build char hone wish participate 5 1600 character 1614 artist highest taken 8 12 character worth funneling daily grinding last 24 month achieve f2p yes pity ridiculous effort threshold not_even goal 1_emphasized620 i_emphasizedgnored alt hell chose fun route not_all gear gear entail lottery multiple lottery engraving stone tl dr 30 node 3 line 10 2 positive 1 negative 75 chance fill node filling 10 next failing 10 required 7_emphasized x pray x lower 5 9 5 x similar cheapest attempt acquiring took 20k expensive single 490k gold earn 100k week 6 1580 character take grinding good luck stone accessory easy farm gold save market smart 5x3 1 build acceptable 150k market tax pheons awful unfortunately gatekept unless quality gear pretty solid quality weighted lottery 0 70 90 roll remaining 30 10 no_pitying chance cost raid token raw gold character purple quality weapon took 60k dp took 580k weapon whereas quality tapping armor piece cheaper 5 70 quality 3 4 roll 70 start 90 1 chance no_you not_need group gold unless ok bracelet ok introduced brelshaza 13 month ago grab cheap market roll secondary stats extra health call gatekeep bracelet additional accessory cost pheons pray give tap 1 2 fixed slot typically look fixed secondary swiftness crit w e 1 3 open slot bracelet rolled 4 time 4 no_more 4 4 roll random open effect choose lock spicy 4 chance total 5 good option roll 80 no_i not_kidding top option green blue purple yellow quality congrats finally win blue yes s_emphasizedtill good look garbage weee 13 month 5 1600s 2 1580 2 bracelet considered ok throwing 500k buying desperately trying acceptable coup de grace recently voldis introduced along elixir week 2 release player began gatekeeping set bonus elixir t_emphasizedl dr purple yellow quality elixir purple max 4_emphasized 4 effect yellow 5_emphasized 5 armor piece elixir purple max 40 level yellow 50 set bonus requires 35 total level set 40 obtain purple 1600 yellow 1620 simple cut elixir vial happiness hope shiny mirror 5 step choose 1 3 option pool 40 10 specific set bonus 10 specific piece bonus remainder general stat bonus range useless garbage additional damage raw attack primary stats rolled required set bonus character 5 building elixir begin 5 effect 2 apply gear purple 12 step yellow 15 give 1 5 effect 2 random 9 point 1 effect 4 purple 2 effect 9 4_emphasized 10 point 2 effect yellow 5_emphasized allows pick 1 3 random option pool 40 action range 2_emphasized random 5 effect select shuffle point reducing point 1 effect adding effect selected random huge effect 4 5 option 3 step remainder cut literally elixir different random million option effect affect affect random 4 week 5 character single viable set piece 2 wait spend year worth alarm timed event probably complete anymore finally not_assume bot whale lot shiny adventure completion mostly collectible 90 time annoying 20 gave ago 90 max character 2 dmg health stuff congrats oh card light salvation 30 not_only missing 15 damage gatekept took 18 month finish los30 finished pretty quickly extra 2 3 hour week abyss loop old dungeon 1 shot 2 chance card praying card not_the 400th copy compared guildies finished last week 2 year 3 semi necessary set 6k hour love combat soooo sooo so_emphasized fun 95 pure despair 12 hour able love friend lol cry 900 lottery system cuz bad luck no_my luck average easily s_emphasizedtill actual trash good luck starting hate lost ark great 400 cannot_recommend treat worse garbage
1599340,Lost Ark,"The core gameplay of Lost Ark is fantastic. The classes have unique power fantasies and are fun, and the legion raids are some of the most fun activities in any MMO I've played. Unfortunately, I can't recommend the game since it's bogged down by everything else.

First off, Lost Ark has a severe gate-keeping problem. The game heavily encourages players to create more characters through events like the powerpass and express pass, and each new character has a set of daily and weekly activities they can do, including three legion raids per week. A total of 6 characters can earn gold from those raids, and the gold and gear reward from those raids form the bulk of gold income for an account.

Three raids on six characters is a lot of time, and public groups for them often require proof of previous raid clear experience as a result. After all, nobody wants to waste time on wipes when they have other raids, dailies, and weeklies to do.  If you don't have that visible experience in a new raid (raid titles, gear, very high item level), you potentially face hours trying to get into a group to get that visible experience to make it easier to get into groups. New players coming into the game often can reach the item level and gearing required to complete a raid, but very few experienced players want to play with them. And the game does not provide any incentive for playing with new players. The only way to do the legion raids and get the gear from them as a new player is to buy a paid carry, often using gold from the raid itself. Apart from the gold loss, a negative side effect is that players who buy carries often don't get the mechanical experience of actually doing the raids, which only get more complex and challenging.

Meaningfully progressing to the point where gate-keeping is a minor issue requires a lot of time, especially as a new player and even for the first few legion raids. This time multiplies for every character you create. I have 6 characters and doing the daily and weekly activities on them often feels like a part-time job. While rested bonuses build up for dailies you haven't done, the rewards are far less than doing them every day (75-66%), which results in slower progression. The other aspect of dailies that make it feel like a job is they're far less interesting than the raids. The main culprit is chaos dungeons. Chaos dungeons are basic add-clear dungeons which are similar to rifts from Diablo, but the mobs are far less interesting and mechanically complicated. Simply put, they're a chore. They don't encourage the kind of build-crafting and mechanical skill that legion raids do that are the most fun parts of the game. Unfortunately, they're also the most valuable, giving the most amount of materials needed to progress a character. Unfortunately, Smilegate has already said and reiterated that the requirement of doing dailies on each character will not change.

The social systems of Lost Ark is among the worst I've experienced in an MMO. While guilds exist, the game does not incentivize playing with guildmates. There's no account-wide guild membership system; each character has to join an individual guild and each guild has a low character limit. Combined with the requirement that each character's name be unique, I'm often wondering who a character belongs to. The most developed guild feature in the game is a guild shop, which rewards currency for logging on every day and doing weekly quests, which add to the list of activities needed to do on each character. The most meaningful interactions for a guild are on Discord.

A lot of the systems I've criticized have an easy way to circumvent them: by paying real money. With the currency exchange, you can trade money for gold, which allows you to buy almost everything needed to gear up your character: materials for increasing item level, high-quality gear, item quality increases, card set damage bonuses, paid raid carries, and more. Lost Ark even has packages with these items for direct sale. This is the aspect of the game that feels the most ""pay-to-win"", and it unfortunately drives the severe bot problem Lost Ark has.

Lastly, AGS and Smilegate interactions with the community is lacking. Smilegate in particular does not acknowledge the western version of the game in any way. Despite Smilegate stating they aspire to be a global game developer, it's clear they're far from it. Often AGS community managers won't know if something in a patch or major update until a few days before its released. And the major issues which elicit a sluggish and inadequate response from Smilegate, as the developer, feel as if the western version isn't a priority despite its status as one of the highest-revenue games on Steam. The most they provided to the western audience during their last major yearly presentation, LoA On, was a lackluster English translation. The description of a free reward pack as being ""for the KR region only"" was the insult to injury. This is behavior that is far from other MMO developers like Square Enix, and is in contrast to Smilegate's Korean reputation as being transparent and engaging with their community.

I can't recommend this game to a new player. Unless someone new is willing to spend an exorbitant amount of time to gear up and find guilds and parties willing to take on new players, they won't have a good time. Many friends who have similar hour counts to mine have burned out. I'll also likely take an extended break soon, and potentially leave entirely. If new players are gate-kept and experienced players quit, it doesn't feel like a trend that is healthy for the game in the long run.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",core lost ark fantastic class unique power fantasy fun legion raid fun activity massively multiplayer online unfortunately recommend bogged else lost ark severe gate keeping problem heavily encourages player create character event powerpass express pas set daily weekly activity including three legion raid per week total 6 character earn gold raid gold gear reward raid form bulk gold income three raid six character public group require proof previous raid clear result want waste wipe raid daily weekly visible raid_emphasized title gear high potentially face hour trying group visible easier group player coming reach gearing required complete raid experienced player not_provide incentive player legion raid gear paid carry gold raid apart gold loss negative side effect player carry mechanical raid complex challenging meaningfully progressing gate keeping minor issue requires especially legion raid multiplies create 6 character daily weekly activity feel rested bonus build daily reward far 75 66 result slower progression aspect daily far interesting raid culprit chaos dungeon chaos dungeon basic add clear dungeon similar rift diablo mob far interesting mechanically complicated simply chore encourage kind build crafting mechanical skill legion raid fun part unfortunately valuable giving material needed progress unfortunately smilegate already reiterated requirement daily not_change social system lost ark worst experienced massively multiplayer online guild exist not_incentivize guildmates no_account wide guild membership join individual guild guild low limit combined requirement name unique wondering belongs developed guild guild shop reward currency logging weekly quest add activity needed meaningful interaction guild discord system criticized easy circumvent paying real currency exchange trade gold allows needed gear material increasing high quality gear quality increase card set damage bonus paid raid carry lost ark package item direct sale aspect feel pay win unfortunately drive severe bot problem lost ark lastly ag smilegate interaction community lacking smilegate particular not_acknowledge western version despite smilegate stating aspire global developer clear far ag community manager patch major day released major issue elicit sluggish inadequate response smilegate developer western version priority despite status highest revenue game provided western audience last major yearly presentation loa lackluster english translation description reward pack kr region insult injury behavior far massively multiplayer online developer square enix contrast smilegate korean reputation transparent engaging community recommend unless someone willing spend exorbitant gear guild party willing player good friend similar count mine burned extended break soon potentially leave entirely player gate experienced player quit trend healthy long
1599340,Lost Ark,"Sure, here is the English translation of your text:

""So, after nearly 3,475 hours of Lost Ark experiences, I am now summarizing my personal reflections.

At the release, I had no idea about the game. Through friends, I initially bought the Bronze version. Started the download, launched the game, roughly checked out all classes, and fell in love with the Sorc. After about 30 minutes of gameplay, I decided to buy the Platinum package because the game had captivated me, and I knew I would definitely stick with Lost Ark for a long time.

The grind in the game was felt early on, upgrading from T2 to T3 was quite challenging. When my first character arrived in Punika, the goal was to have my other two classes (Bard-Deathblade) there as well. From T3 onwards, the grind got worse and worse, but I had already gotten used to it, at least I had. The first weeks after Argos' release were a disaster for players without a static group, including for Valtan/Vykas/Clown and Brel. Always the same pattern, something new comes up, and you get gatekept by all the wannabe pro gamers in Lost Ark. Whether you have 5 full engravings or not, it's definitely not necessary in Valtan Hard to Clown. New players have almost no chance in the endgame, as they are quickly filtered out based on roster level and/or the corresponding title for the raid. The majority of the community is just trash and can be thrown away.

I played all raids from the beginning; raiding itself was the greatest fun factor for me. In the end, playing turned into work. From initially having 3 characters, it became 14.

Sorc: 1590
Bard: 1570
Bard2: 1555
Summoner: 1565
Glavier: 1565
Artist: 1540
And 8 more characters between 1460-1500, which eventually were only used as Lopang slaves.

I am not free to play, but it is possible as a free-to-play player to have a similar roster. Since a few in my guild are F2P, I can confirm that. Anyone claiming the game is pay-to-win has no idea.

Now to the downside of Lost Ark, in my 3475 hours, I had 3 burnouts and had to take breaks for several weeks multiple times. Lost Ark pushed me to do everything in record time. Eventually, I reached the point where I became too easily irritable if something took too long. Guardian Raids that lasted longer than 2:30 minutes were a disaster for me. Even the low raids Valtan-Vykas and Clown had to be done like on an assembly line; on average, I did 55-60 raids per week.

Today, however, I have decided to quit the game 100%. It became too much. I feel slight depression and signs of another burnout. So, I distributed the gems from all characters to my guild, deleted my equipment, and gave away my materials and everything else. So, I won't start the game again :D

And there was a small farewell party in my stronghold; I even shed some tears when I said goodbye, as I had spoken with many people for months, played with them, and met many really cool people.

Conclusion: The game is great if you don't overdo it, but you can easily feel pressured with upgrading and grinding. Over half of the community is toxic towards others. As a new player, you have almost no chance.

I hope you enjoyed my summary.

Status Update: As many have contacted me recently about my playtime, yes, I have started again. I mainly play casually now; I have been able to get my Sorc back to its original level faster than expected. Most of my playtime around the date of this review is AFK or just photoshoots or playing with friends. I tried to find something else but in vain; I tried Diablo 4, but this game just doesn't offer me the feeling like Lost Ark. That's why I decided to return, but this time with a healthy mindset :D""","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",english translation text nearly 3 475 hour lost ark experience summarizing personal reflection release no_idea friend i_emphasizednitially bought bronze version started download launched roughly checked class fell love sorc 30 minute decided platinum package captivated knew definitely stick lost ark long grind early upgrading t2 t3 challenging arrived punika goal class bard deathblade t3 onwards grind worse worse already gotten week argo release disaster player static group including valtan vykas clown brel pattern come gatekept wannabe pro gamers lost ark 5 engraving not_it definitely not_necessary valtan hard clown player no_chance endgame quickly filtered based roster corresponding title raid majority community trash thrown raid beginning raiding greatest fun factor turned initially 3 character became 14 sorc 1590 bard 1570 bard2 1555 summoner 1565 glavier 1565 artist 1540 8 character 1460 1500 eventually lopang slave not_free possible play_emphasizeder similar roster guild f2p confirm claiming pay win no_idea downside lost ark 3475 hour 3 burnouts break week multiple time lost ark pushed record eventually reached became easily irritable took long guardian raid lasted longer 2 30 minute disaster low raid valtan vykas clown assembly line average 55 60 raid per week today decided quit 100 became slight depression sign burnout distributed gem character guild deleted equipment gave material else small farewell party stronghold shed tear goodbye spoken month met cool conclusion great overdo easily pressured upgrading grinding half community toxic towards others no_chance hope enjoyed summary status contacted recently playtime yes started mainly casually able sorc original faster expected playtime afk photoshoots friend tried else vain tried diablo 4 offer feeling lost ark decided return healthy mindset
1599340,Lost Ark,"I've played enough to know what this game is and what it is not.  I will start with what it is.

LOST ARK IS: 
- Very pretty.  The graphics are appealing, even if not stunning. We have to remember that this game is not a new game. It has been out in other countries for years. At the time of it's true release though, it was top notch.

- Easy to play and navigate. It reminds me of a browser game in that it walks you through each quest and a very ""hand-holding"" kind of way. You get big map markers that tell you right where to go. You don't even need to read the dialogue of NPCs if you don't want to.

- Deeper than it seems.  Although it plays like a simple browser game. Lost Ark has plenty of systems to keep a player occupied. There are skill, crafting and even a type of reputation system that allows the player to get more advanced items and stats. There is a lot to sink your teeth into here. I could see spending more time playing with these systems than actually hacking and slashing in some circumstances,

- Mostly a true free-to-play game. A player can play all the way through Lost Ark without spending a dime. It may take longer and not be as individualized (you will be playing a cookie cutter version of each character), but it can be done. There are also ways to earn in-game currency if a person really wants to do some customization of their character's looks. There are some features that make the game a ""Pay to Progress"" game, but nothing locks you out of content so you can play it all if you have the patience.

LOST ARK IS NOT:

- Diablo. The hype train for Lost Ark seemed to be marketed toward fans of Diablo and it's hack n slash mega-loot game play, but this isn't a fair comparison. There are some superficial similarities, but fans of the Diablo franchise won't get their fix from this game. Lost Ark is much more like WoW than Diablo, but even that isn't a great comparison. 

-A game changer. As with most mega-hyped games, Lost Ark is not going to change the meta when it comes to ARPGs or RPGS. It's a fun game with some complexity, but it doesn't so much do anything new as it incorporates bits and pieces from other games and melds them together.  The wait was so very long for this game that it will take some time before honest reviews are common. There is a glamour spell on the game that will wear off in time to reveal a solid, fun, and less-innovative game than we thought.

Conclusion: It is a game that fans of the genre should try. There is nothing bad about it. The story is standard good vs evil kind of stuff. They stuff the game with pretty girls and macho boys, just as all such games seem to. It's a decent game that had zero hope of living up to the hype. 


 7.7 / 10 - Fun. Free. Worth playing.

 Note that I am not presenting a ""Pro vs Con"" list. I am not that kind of critic. Just because I don't like a feature does not make it bad.  Game Devs make decisions and I am not going to second guess them in a Free to Play game.","Mostly Positive71% of the 198,150 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_i lost ark pretty graphic appealing not_stunning remember not_a country year true release top notch easy navigate reminds browser walk hand holding kind big map marker tell read dialogue npc deeper play simple browser lost ark plenty system occupied skill crafting type reputation allows advanced item stats sink teeth spending system hacking slashing circumstance mostly true lost ark spending dime longer not_be individualized cookie cutter version way earn currency want customization look feature pay progress lock patience lost ark not_diablo hype train lost ark marketed fan diablo hack n slash mega loot fair comparison superficial similarity fan diablo franchise fix lost ark wow diablo great comparison changer mega hyped game lost ark not_going meta come arpgs rpgs fun complexity incorporates bit piece game meld wait long honest review common glamour spell wear reveal solid fun innovative thought conclusion fan genre bad standard good v evil kind stuff stuff pretty girl macho boy game decent zero hope living hype 7_emphasized 10 fun worth note not_presenting pro v con not_that kind critic not_make bad decision not_going guess

1599340,Lost Ark,"If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you! Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead. Excited yet? You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job! Wait, there's more! If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content. That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of! Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside... This is a pay to win game. That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can. They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that. However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands. I'm serious, it's beyond insanity.

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you: it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content. You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up. It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players. All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression. Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character. Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too. The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold. What is gold good for? The Auction House. Upgrade items and gear. Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals. That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.

What the heck are Pheons? They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters. The gear you wear is what determines your item level. After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials. Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in. So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.

How do you get Pheons? You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals. How do you get blue crystals? By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons. Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.

Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server. These bots have one goal - farm gold. Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue. It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag. Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.

You see the problem yet? Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value. Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK, that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups. Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies. There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum. Maybe as many as 60? I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid. Almost all of them are unnecessary.

There are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous ""I'd rather watch paint dry"" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you'll try to participate in, and so much more.

I experienced only 1 or 2 minor glitches my entire play-through, all of which being graphical, the game-play was flawless. I don't have insane PC specs either. 

After experiencing everything STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor has to offer, I can truly say it's a fantastic game. This game had made some fantastic improvements to it's story, mechanics, graphics, combat etc compared to it's predecessor STAR WAR JEDI: Fallen Order. I would go into to detail but honestly I think it's best you buy it and play it for yourself spoiler-free like I did. All my issues with the game itself are far to minor and nit-picky to mention.

Though I praise this game for how fun it is, Game Developers should NEVER be forced (or consider) to release an UNFINISHED GAME. I only had a good experience because I waited FIVE MONTHS AFTER RELEASE. These companies are getting way to comfortable releasing unfinished games to make a dead-line or a quick buck. Just delay it. I'd prefer a late game than an unfinished one. Take the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for example. That game was delayed AN ENTIRE YEAR OF IT'S INTENDED RELEASE and it turned out fantastic as a result. Because of this games terrible release it's basically stripped it of it's spot as a GOTY Nominee. I wouldn't expect it to win but damn the Resident Evil 4 !!REMAKE!! beat it to the nominee's. Not that RE4 Remake is a bad game (it's actually super fun) but damn it's gotta hurt losing to a game that was initially released in 2005.

[i]The overview is relevant for the Jedi Grand Master level of difficulty, patch 7 and a 5900X/RTX 4090 based PC build (the game was played in QHD).[/i]

If you mentally attempt to ignore the technical issues, since practically it’s impossible, then we’ve got a brilliant sequel to a solid original. The sequel, which improves upon each (or almost each) separate aspect of the original. Unfortunately, a great game and all that grand and valuable work on correction of all the issues and problems of the first game was ruthlessly buried under such a huge pile of technical shit, that even over 5 months since the release were not enough to dig through it.

This is one of the worst PC releases of 2023 in terms of technical performance. The release day version of the game was simply unplayable on my system, which made me decide against ruining my impressions so I put the game off. Performance issues and bugs were addressed only to a small degree 4 patches later, however the real buzzkill were the constant crashes that still occurred every 10 minutes of gameplay. As time went by, I understood that no patches would actually remedy the situation, so I decided to push through against all technical odds. All kinds of bugs and fps drops were still awaiting me on my path and they proved to be the kind of pain that was annoying, but barely tolerable. I ran into corrupted save files twice. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starwarsjedisurvivor/mods/221?tab=files&file_id=738]Here’s the solution, in case you fall victim to it.[/url]

It was hell of earth, indeed. Naturally, I am giving this game a negative review simply because the technical aspect will inevitably impact your perception of the game. In fact, I strongly recommend against pre-ordering the trequel in the future, which is certainly already in the pipeline. However, I will try my absolute hardest to detach myself from the problems and describe [b]the game[/b], as I saw it.

[list]
[*]The first thing that catches the eye is that the sequel is tightly connected to the original. Not only by the continued story, but also by the mechanics, which could be unlocked through the Skill Tree in Fallen Order, while in Survivor they are available right out of the gate by default. This certainly plays into the authenticity and spares the devs from coming up with some iffy reasons for resetting the main character’s abilities.

[*]In regard to Cal and other characters in general, I believe that the events that are occurring around them have become even more personal, and, as a result, more emotional. Most of the characters have gone through various types of experiences which have drastically changed them, and that makes them more satisfying to interact with. I can’t overstate the brilliance of the key actors’ work: the dialogues and cutscenes, especially the most important ones in terms of story, are filled with passion, efforts and heart of the whole cast.

[*]Overall, the story is still one of the SWJ’s strongest suits. It takes a bit longer to ramp up compared to the previous game. Most likely it has to do with the more massive and densely packed playable environment, which is able to extend the time gaps between the significant story events. With that said, the high stakes, the expansion of the canon and a plethora of exciting moments would leave only the outrageously snobby players indifferent, in my opinion.

[*]The exploration aspect of the game has also been improved. This time the game rewards curiosity noticeably more frequently and with items that have more value than another poncho color: now you can find permanent health or force boosts, and also combat or platforming challenges that net you rewards upon completion.

[*]On top of the worthy rewards for exploration, the world traversal has become far more enjoyable thanks to the full-fledged fast travel system via meditation sites.

[*]Even though there’s still more than plenty of cosmetics scattered around the map, it’s more compelling to go after them, as the customization system in Survivor has become more complete compared to the original: now you can replace not just the Cal’s poncho, but his entire look. You’ve got various sets of clothes and hair styles to choose from.

[*]The combat system in the sequel reveals itself in a new light. It is significantly deeper and better than it was previously thanks to Cal’s carried over abilities, the implementation of the new ones in the broader Skill Tree and new Stances and Perks systems. Besides, in certain story bits you can fight alongside your partners and interact with them. All of that allows to create a large number of fighting styles and approaches to combat. My only gripe with the combat is the inability to switch between all stances at once. You can select only 2 out of 5 stances at the same time and swap them exclusively at the meditation sites. This design choice negatively influences not only the flexibility of the gameplay, but also the immersion in general, causing ludonarrative dissonance.

[*]Platforming is still here and remains a large part of the gameplay by adding variety to fighting and storytelling parts. According to my impressions, platforming is still imperfect, however it’s clear that its mechanics have been given a lot of attention and polish. You no longer fail to grab some sort of surface for no apparent reason and with 100% correctly timed inputs as often as you used to. However, it has still happened to me a few times nonetheless. Meanwhile, the platforming sections have become even more difficult, lengthy and spectacular in terms of direction. The grandeur of some of them truly take your breath away.

[*]The design of the map has become substantially more illustrative, schematic and simply more convenient, which is great news since the world has become vastly more complex compared to the previous game.

[h1]Minor cons[/h1]

[list]
[*]While the poor readability of the level design has become much less of an issue, it still leaves a lot to be desired, in my opinion. Platforming parts suffer from this issue the most.

[*]There are no games without conventions, but why can you use fast travel on any meditation site except for the one in the Mantis?

[*]The last enemy who defeats Cal gets marked with golden glow. Personally, I think it’s not the best choice for highlighting your slayer since the glow is permanent and can only be removed by landing a hit onto that specific enemy. The thing is that while it’s active, it’s rather difficult to read unparryable attacks, because enemies are supposed to glow red during this type of attacks. In these situations your only bet is to react to the pattern of the attacks instead of the special indicators. I believe that these two design choices aren’t very compatible. At the very least, instead of making the whole model of your slayer glow golden, they could’ve added this golden glow to the outlines of the model, so that the red indicator of the unparryable attack remains visible.[/list] 
  
[h1]Verdict[/h1]

[b]Paradoxically, my thoughts on the game are largely complimentary. However, the technical problems ruin not only the value of the work that has been done in the game and level design, platforming and other departments, but also the artistic value of the sequel. How is everything SWJ:S has to offer (and it has a lot of good things to offer) supposed to be enjoyed if the gaming experience is comparable to a torture? Survivor is a wonderful game, but an awful piece of program code. It’s a shame that you can’t separate the two.[/b]

Like many, I heard the stories of performance issues on PC. I have a decent rig so I thought I would take a chance. And hey! Things worked out at first. A few microstutters but overall not bad. I loved the first game, and really wanted to enjoy this one.

However, after the most recent (June '23) patch, the game CONSTANTLY crashes. Over and over. Cutscene? Crash. Go down the wrong hall? Crash. Jump at the wrong time? Crash. THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE.

This game has so much potential but it has utterly frustrated the hell out of me with it's ability to not perform on my system.  I'm running a 7950x and a 4090 with 32 Gigs of Ram and this stutters all over the place.  I have ran it without ray tracing, on low settings, at 1080p and nothing makes this game run.  Everytime I get excited about a patch making this game run, it still runs like utter trash.  Do not purchase this game.  Play it on console.  The devs do not seem dedicated to making this run on any pc config.  I'm incredibly disappointed.

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Jedi Survivor is an amazing game and takes everything the first game did and does it even better, worlds are far more expansive and have much more enemy variety. Character customisation is also much better in this game, not just for cosmetics but for gameplay as well. Fallen Order has 3 skill tree pathways whereas Survivor starts you off with 7, with 2 more unlocking later in the game. I found myself struggling to choose between the different upgrades which was much better than the far more linear skill tree of Fallen Order.

While the game itself is great the technical issues are just so bad. At first I thought I was getting alright performance, like around 40+ frames at 1080p, but it just got so much worse, going anywhere between 10-30 frames at 720p medium settings. Plus the game bugs out on the visuals and goes all black and white and all weird, plus the Mogu is so annoying cause if you die to it, all your xp disappears.

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"I held off on writing this review before finishing the game. With that being said this is a game with a lot of potential and it's a shame how it was launched.

The story of this game is absolutely phenomenal, you'd think they should hire the writers of this story for Disney Star Wars. The acting as well, another thing to be shined upon in this game, absolutely phenomenal. The fighting has great mechanics and there is a variety of cosmetic changes that they put in which keeps the game constantly feeling fresh. The pace that the story goes is absolutely great, which I must continue to emphasize because the story is very meaningful and different from the previous one.

Here are a lot of notable problems with this game:

This game needs a lot of work. It is extremely poorly optimized and I have a high rig gaming pc meanwhile I was playing in 1440p custom settings a lot on Medium/High no AMD FSR on. 

This game should not be bought at full price especially in the state it was released. There are so many bugs in the cutscenes which make them hard to focus on, it's where the jackets are blowing in the wind when they're indoors, or the jackets are clipping through walls all stretched out.

The magna guards have such terrible rendering/optimization where their scarfs will take up almost all the screen when fighting them and almost crash the game with the tremendous strain and lag it puts on your PC.

A lot of aliasing problems where characters look rough and sharply edged in cutscenes as well. 

SOOOO many stutters.

Extreme frame drops, 160 fps to 30 fps in milliseconds sometimes.

Overall, the story is great and if this game gets patches and work done it will definitely be something I recommend, however, as of right now I don't think anybody should buy it unless they're diehard Star Wars fans like myself, or somebody that really minds spoilers. I believe the devs felt the pressure because it was supposed to be released in March but was delayed until late April, it definitely needed about another month to have it's final polish on this game and possibly to prevent what has been happening. With that being said, I'm stoked for the next Star Wars game released by Respawn.","Mixed66% of the 43,165 user reviews for this game are positive.",held writing finishing potential shame launched phenomenal hire writer disney star war acting shined phenomenal fighting great mechanic variety cosmetic change keep constantly feeling fresh pace go great continue emphasize meaningful different previous notable problem need extremely poorly optimized high rig gaming pc meanwhile 1440p custom setting medium high no_amd fsr not_be bought price especially state released bug cutscenes hard focus jacket blowing wind indoors jacket clipping wall stretched magna guard terrible rendering optimization scarf screen fighting crash tremendous strain lag put pc aliasing problem character look rough sharply edged cutscenes soooo stutter extreme frame drop 160 shooter 30 shooter millisecond great get patch definitely recommend t_emphasizedhink anybody unless diehard star war fan somebody mind spoiler believe pressure supposed released march delayed late april definitely needed final polish possibly prevent happening stoked next star war released respawn
1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"This is my first ever review but the performance is so terrible I'm compelled to complain. I should have listened to the reviews and held off on buying the game but it was Summer Sale and I didn't want to pay $70. Even the $50 I paid wasn't worth this mess. What kind of game runs at 20fps with a rtx 4090? What computer were the devs using or do they think 20fps is good? 

Why does the game crash so much many months after release? I can't even run from one save point to the next without a crash. This game doesn't have autosave so if you crash in a cutscene or after a long scripted fight sequence, too bad you need to start again. Sucks even more for you if you can't even make it back to that boss fight or town because your game kept crashing along the way. This is completely unacceptable.

Just do yourself a favor and avoid this game until it's out of mixed reviews.

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Decided to try it out and see how bad the performance really is. Well, it's weird to say the least. I'm on RTX 3070 (mobile) with Ryzen 7 5800H and 32GB of RAM. Legion 5 Pro laptop. On average I'm getting ~50-60 FPS. Now, the interesting part:

[list]
    [*]Changing graphics preset to Low only adds around 10 FPS in total. 
    [*]Changing the resolution from 1440p to 1080p shockingly has almost no effect.
    [*]Any volumetric effect on screen costs 30% of framerate.
    [*]Even the main menu hovers around 57 FPS (Just like in The Last of Us Part I).
[/list]

In short, there is obviously something fundamentally wrong. Especially considering it doesn't look much better than Fallen Order. The game had 5 patches at the moment of this review and it's baffling how it wasn't fixed yet. As far as I know, at launch it ran twice as bad and it took one patch to get it to the current performance level. Meaning that they made some stupid mistake that took a very short time to fix. Then, in the next patch, they messed up with the resolution scaling. Also, just [b]one line in the config file.[/b]

This is some dangerously serious level of incompetence. The last nail in the coffin is an ""apology"" statement they made. Which was hardly an apology. Instead of admitting they did something wrong, they blamed Windows 10, hardware and [b]users for making a bad decision in pairing their CPUs and GPUs.[/b]

That'll be $70, please.

[b]UPDATE:[/b]

So, Patch 6 was just released, and it seems like in a month they were able to fix only a few minor issues. Performance problems were completely ignored. They also haven't mentioned anything about the performance problems on their official Twitter or anywhere else, which kind of indicates that they are pleased with the money they made. I got my refund.

[b]UPDATE #2:[/b]

I've seen a lot of ""Get better hardware"" comments on the Discussions board and I just want to remind everyone that you shouldn't patch the problem by throwing money at your PC just because some multi-billion dollar company underpays and overworks their developers to the point they just don't care about optimization anymore. 
It's not a user's fault. First of all, there are quite a lot of games that are much more graphically impressive and have no performance issues. And second, do ""System Requirements"" exist only for the store page decoration?

[b]UPDATE #3:[/b]

To make the situation even more ridiculous, a modder by the nickname Snight01 released a mod that fixes the occlusion culling issues and Ray Tracing crashes. The issues that Respawn wasn't able to fix after 6 patches.

[b]UPDATE #4:[/b]

Decided to try it out again after Patch 7, since a lot of people said that it's fixed now. And while it is definitely better, stuttering is still very much present. AO had an improvement, DLSS looks much better than FSR and overall CPU performance is a bit better. I'd say, it's in a much better state now, but still, constant stuttering is annoying enough to ruin all the enjoyment. You can watch Digital Foundry video if you're interested. But I refunded again.

Great story, 
great characters, 
exactly the game fans want from the Star Wars universe. This sequel takes everything the first one did good, improves it, then adds to it. 

Unfortunately the ridiculous performance issues made me give it a thumbs down. It is absolutely a spit in the face to the consumer in this day and age when technology is literally at our fingertips for a game company as huge as EA to release any game with these kinds of performance issues. 

Most of the time for me it ran fine and I managed to complete it. But from time to time there were and still are a string of crashes that just happen randomly and there's nothing you can do, also some frame drops here and there. I disabled ray tracing because it's almost non existent in this game, even though there is the option in the Settings and the game looks better without it and runs a bit better. I'm running it on an RTX 4080 / AMD Ryzen 7 7800x3d machine and it still gave me trouble. Granted, nothing to completely stop me from playing but not the smoothest experience. 

I love this series, too bad it's in the wrong hands.

This should be a special game that I could easily recommend to anyone.
This should be a must finish for any star wars lover like me.
This should be a contender for game of the year.

but its not.

The technical performance of this video game on a system that is above average is frankly shocking. 

After the recent 'Patch 7' (5th September) dropped, I decided to really give it another go since the performance could improve using DLSS. The performance did not improve, it stayed exactly the same while looking visually worse because of DLSS.

I cannot recommend this game to anyone who has anything less than a RTX 4090 tier GPU and a 12th gen or higher CPU. My 3080 gets me maybe 40fps but dips much, much longer than that if it doesn't crash before then. I can run any other UE4 game with no problems and I know the developers really pushed this engine to a new level but at the cost of making the game unplayable.

I'm still waiting to play this game since the 28th of April but I'm finally going to uninstall it because I have absolutely zero faith that this game will ever run smoothly.

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"I know most of you are just here to see how the game perform so here's my thought

I have an RTX 3070 and i7-10700KF CPU. All my settings are on high with ray tracing turned off. I am playing with Patch 7 right now, and I have about 70 to 90 FPS in smaller areas. But once I go to an open area, my frame drops to 50. It also drops when there are smoke effects from the enemy smashing the ground. My game also crashed 2 times in the 5 hours I've played today. I don't really recommend it unless your PC is super good. Come back after you've finished Baldur's Gate 3.

Now for the actual game I actually kinda like it.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is really satisfying. It's an improvement over the last game. Parrying feels more responsive and more satisfying. Each lightsaber style actually has a purpose. Double-bladed has a wider attack area, dual dual-blade has faster attacks. I am having a blast fighting bosses.

Character:
For Cal, I think he is a much better character than he was in the last game. He acts more natural and is more lovable. In this game, he truly feels like a Jedi survivor. As a surviving Jedi, he sounds and acts more like a normal civilian since he has been living among the people for a few years. But he is also a good guy because of his Jedi background, which isn't how normal people would act. Normal people in the Galaxy would be more selfish and greedy, and this took them by surprise when they see Cal being such as good person. This makes Cal more believable as a Jedi who has been living among normal people.

Exploration:
The exploration is whatever. The world is a little empty in some areas, and you don't feel intrigued when you explore. You do it because the map tells you, you haven't explored this area yet, and you expect to find good loot. Personally, I like it when I am motivated by the environment itself instead of the game telling me to explore. I wish the game used interesting buildings, landscapes, or NPC dialogues to motivate me to explore the world.

Story:
So far, the story is interesting. I am looking forward to finding out what happens next. And the game asks Cal some interesting and realistic questions instead of just defeating the empire, go kill the villain type of corny story. Cal's friends are telling him that it is meaningless for him to fight until he dies, and maybe it's time for him to be more selfish and think about how he wants to live. This is such a good question to ask and have our main character think about. For that, I am surprised and happy this is the direction the story is heading.
 
Graphics:
It's pretty good

Overall, I would 100% recommend this game if you can actually play it. What a shame.....

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Final Edit: Patch 7 finally made the game playable for me with DLSS frame gen.
Emphasis on ""playable"" - stutters still occur regularly, 1% lows sit about 40% below average FPS, optimization is still poor across the board, but luckily DLSS 3+FG hides those issues enough to make playing an enjoyable experience. Now I can finally play the game! ...months after I bought it

Sparse patches, game still runs terribly on my setup (Win10, 4080, 13700k, 32gb DDR4). I'm sure it's a great game, I adored the first, but this is unplayable performance. YMMV.

Edit: Patch 6 was just released - performance is the same / worse for many players (me included)

Edit 2: Patch 6.5 did not claim any performance changes but I tested anyway. Performance still sucks, details below:

Ultra settings, RT off, ""Quality"" Fidelity FX
Average FPS fluctuates between 50-80
1% lows are 20-30fps lower, sometimes as low at 10-20fps

Ultra Settings RT on, Fidelity FX off
Average FPS ~ 40-50
1% lows often below 30, I've seen them below 10

The game does not perform better even on the lowest settings, it's still a stuttery mess. Some people don't experience this so you might get lucky, you might not. I've tried every fix I've seen, none work for me.

1774580,STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™,"Revision explanation: 
I decided to rate the game positively as I watch the end credits.
Despite all the technical shortcomings, constant crashes, framerate issues, etc. I have to give the writing staff and game designers huge kudos. The story is so rich, charged and at moments really funny, that I was absolutely immersed in the universe. I am at a loss for words explaining how beautiful this game looks too, leveraging all the power of Unreal Engine. The spirit of the Star Wars Saga really shines here. After the disaster that has been the Skywalker Saga, this is just so refreshing to experience. Not a single moment has been felt by me like it has been wasted. Grinding has been kept at a minimum, if you just want to enjoy a rich and beautiful story in a galaxy far, far away. (If you want to 100% it like I did, there is some grind, but still worth it...) A must for any Star Wars fan. That is why I implore the devs to make it technically more polished for the next installment, if one will ever surface. Thank you for a massive game, content-wise totally worth the asking price (especially on sale)

I have to say, great game, feels nice has so much more content than the last installment. It obviously runs great UNTIL the VRAM gets filled. I am almost 100% positive it is an oversight in ""garbage collection"" of the VRAM. I have ~130 fps on epic settings, until I see the VRAM being full on mangohud (Linux gamer here, hi), that is when the stutters happen, assets are obviously not being unloaded regularly and it is a major oversight. I know memory management and optimization is a hassle, but you will have to handle it eventually, or this is the last game I am purchasing from EA. It is not logical to me that there has to be 15 GB of VRAM used in an area where none of the previous assets, where the 15 GB got filled is visible to the player. Fix ya s**t !!!! Why I know it is an oversight on your part? Changing the visual settings to the lowest possible one does not change the VRAM utilized.","Mixed66% of the 43,165 user reviews for this game are positive.",revision explanation decided rate positively watch credit despite technical shortcoming constant crash framerate issue writing staff designer huge kudos rich charged moment funny immersed universe loss word explaining beautiful look leveraging power unreal engine spirit star war saga shine disaster skywalker saga refreshing not_a single moment wasted grinding minimum enjoy rich beautiful galaxy far_emphasized 100 grind worth star war fan i_emphasizedmplore technically polished next installment surface thank massive wise totally worth asking price especially sale great feel nice last installment obviously run great vram get filled 100 positive oversight garbage collection vram 130 shooter epic setting vram mangohud linux gamer hi stutter happen asset obviously not_being unloaded regularly major oversight memory management optimization hassle handle eventually last purchasing ea not_logical 15 gb vram previous asset 15 gb filled visible fix ya oversight changing visual setting lowest possible not_change vram utilized

- I received the 750,000 GTA$ moneydrop for watching the official livestream event (https://www.facebook.com/rockstargames/posts/10156559856180097).
- I was promoting my Nightclub and waiting for my supplies to fill up.
- I logged out to take a nap for a couple of hours.
- I woke up, tried to log in again, but the Social Club verification was taking too long, so I quit out of the game and restart.
- When I restart the game, I received the message that my account has been banned for 30 days.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"R* is currently taking legitimate money away from hundreds, possibly thousands of players.
Their cheat detection is flawed and honest players are paying the price for it.

If you're reading this and are skeptic about it, so was I, until it was my turn to pay up. 
I play in private sessions only, for the sole reason to avoid cheaters. It didn't help. You'll get your turn.

I do not recommend this game until R* gets their act together.

Edit: 
I'd like to add that buying the game for single player is absolutely worth it, but online is simply a mess. 

It's been 3 weeks now and R* refuses to acknowledge their error, so I stopped playing and caring. There's no point in playing online if R* can steal your legitimate money away at any time. And the irony is that legitimate players are getting hurt while cheaters are unaffected.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"This review will be removed if and when the issues I'm going to write about has been addressed by Rockstar Games,

Currently GTA:Online for PC has next to no serious attention from Rockstar Games on the topic of anti-cheat, anti-grief, anti-mod within GTA:Online. and as of today (day of writing) It has come under my attention that Rockstar has failed to properly protect the personal information, location details, IP addresses and other information of its users. Malicious player can obtain a lot of sensitive personal information by use of common mod-menus for GTA Online. Currently Rockstar Games has not acknowledged or addressed this matter via any of their social media platforms, direct email or via a PR spokesperson. 

Worst thing is that you can fall victim of this without even knowing it. all a malicious modder need to know is your Social Club ID or In-Game Nickname.

Rockstar has the means to combat this, but has failed to do so for many years. 

I will leave a youtube video about this topic here: https://youtu.be/UK1vLaHtgec and in the comment below this review from GTA V Speedrunner and rockstar fan 'DarkViperAU'. who has spoken with people who have access to these mod-menus/tools and brought it under attention to his following.

Personal accounts with this issue:
I myself have also fallen victim to this issue. This happend a couple weeks ago as per writing of this review. I was streaming GTA Online gameplay on twitch and via the stream a malicious person saw my socialclub name in the stream and started targeting me, joining my FRIENDS ONLY session whilest not being part of my friends list. masking his name by replacing it with racial profanity and harrasing me with gameplay exploits and other nasties. blowing me up, hunting me down in godmode and finally crashing my game. after that I switched my stream over to a single player game because I already have put one and two together. 

Thanks for reading. Any questions I will try to anwser. I love Rockstar Games and there games but this is bad beyond believes.

EDIT: Here is a link to a guide I have writen a while ago on how to get a 'public solo session' to avoid modders and griefers messing with you. this is the best way to protect yourself currently within GTAO if you enjoy the game like I do and wish to remain playing it.

[i]Questions I get often under this guide;[/i]
Q: Why do you keep playing a game you dislike?
A: I do not dislike GTAV or GTAO, I want it to better.

Q: Why do you keep playing a game you see as a security risk?
A: I know how to weapon myself against the risk and I still enjoy playing GTAO so I do not quit.

Q: Do you have more sources or proof besides the DarkViperAU youtube video?
A: Yes, I will update this guide when I get more content on this topic, preferably from different sources. Including:

Q: Who cares? Online gaming will always be like this.
A: I strongly disagree. while yes, a 100% cheater free online experience doesn't exist I know GTA Online could and should be better. Just look at what the FiveM Community has done, It runs on dedicated servers, has no widespread cheating issues and doesn't save any user data.

Q: What am I supposed to do with the information you have given me?
A: Whatever you want with it. I want to mainly inform you. the games networking is Peer2Peer and has next to no anti-cheat, creating a unfair and toxic online environment for normal players. with privacy risk, banning issues and so much more. I hope it help you to make an informed decision

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"To those who are thinking of buying this game for online and after seeing the overall reviews being listed as ""very positive"", if you see this, PLEASE read.

Do not buy this game if you plan to go to gta online, as it is nothing but a hacker-filled cesspool. Your IP and geolocation WILL be leaked by hackers, and Rockstar will not help you. Private game? Nope, Hackers will join you still. If you absolutely must play online, then I beg you, use a VPN, preferably a good one too, as that should keep your personal info safe.

If you only want offline singleplayer, then go ahead, but for the love of any Deity you worship or whatever, do NOT go to GTA online.

As for any Rockstar employee reading this... Fix your feckíng game's netcode, you absolute shítstains, or better yet, GET SOME DEDICATED SERVERS.

But, what really bothers me and alot of people is the unrealistic and downright criminal prices you expect people to pay for your Shark Cards. $100 real money for $8Million in-game cash.

When every new DLC costs $25Million-$40Million if you want all the vehicles, upgrades, unlocks..etc..etc WTF good is $8Million?? Your price structure on everything from Shark Cards to Merch is bizarre and unbalanced - if you wonder why people mod and manipulate your game, its because nobody enjoys being blatantly ripped off.

Irony here, when the 'ripping off' got to much for you guys, you threatened the very same people that mod your game to enhance it and who, at the same time, put food on your table and keep you with a job.

STOP ripping off your customers and instead of fighting, why not listen to the community - expand the single player experience with some kind of worthwhile DLC, like people have been begging for. Why not make servers that welcome modders and people that enjoy enhancing the game and getting even more value for money.

and..for gods sake..STOP charging criminal-esqe, exorbitant prices for your poor value Shark Cards... ugh.. just STOP, we are all embarrassed for you over the shameful greed you've shown...and continue to show~

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"3 years ago... my father bought me this game as a gift for my 17th birthday because I was huge fun of GTA and Rockstar Games.
He also bought game for himself.
I was so happy because I finally got opportunity to play something I wished for years. ( GTA ONLINE )
I played it so hard on ""GTA Online"" mode with my dad, where I spent around 300 hours of playtime in less than 2 months, maybe even a month.
In time I said above, my character was 107 level, had all guns fully upgraded, had some bussiness, nice cars... etc

Guess what ?

I got banned for 30 days, because they said that I cheat...!

I NEVER used any kind of cheats in any game I or my family paid with REAL MONEY, especially if it is a GIFT!

My father spent around 25 Euros for this game in a way to suprise me + 25 Euros to be able to play with me on GTA ONLINE MODE!

I was totally dissapointed, I wrote a ticket, and they responded me with their 'robot' message saying me that I used cheats and telling me that I have to wait for 30 days to be able to play again... but from ZERO!
BUT HEY! ... I managed to 'survive' without playing GTA V for ENTiRE a MONTH!

Then I finally started again, playing only Races in 'GTA Online' mode for couple of hours then quits.
Next day, when I turned again 'GTA Online' mode I got a nice BLACK SCREEN with BIG WHITE TEXT saying that my account is BANNED PERMANENTLY from GTA Online!

I WAS SHOCKED, again I wrote a ticked and explained the problem,  but they just used their useless 'robot' by saying me that this is their final decision...

So from that day, I SWORE TO MYSELF that I would NEVER buy any kind of ANYTHING from Rockstar Games ,and this will remain FOREVER.  

I know that you don't give a sh*t about me, which you already proved me with this useless 'robot' Rockstar Support,
but with this 'approach' you are losing many your fellow fans and customers.


NOW LETS TALK ABOUT A GAME ITSELF :

'Single Player' is simply fantastic and there is not anything more to say about it.

'GTA Online' mode was simply something best what GTA Series ever had until the end of 2016 year.

After 2016, Rockstar became hungry for money by adding so many things which regulary doesn't belong to GTA Series anymore... like flying bikes, WW3 tanks, futuristic guns and other sh*t.

This resulted in making this game DISAPPOINTEMENT, by losing all recognizable good sides of GTA Series ( where the cops and criminals was main thing in the game. )

By summarizing impressions... I MUST GIVE YOU A NEGATIVE REVIEW, because 2 reasons I said above. ( 1) Your approach to your fans and customers is dumb and useless, 2) You ruined this game with 'updates' from 2017 to this date. )

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"If you are looking for a great singleplayer experience, you can ignore this review. You're getting what you pay for there.

If on the other hand you're looking to play GTA Online I cannot recommend the game anymore. It's fun in theory but the way Rockstar handles stuff is just awful. Not only are they completely helpless with the cheater situation in the game but their attempts to stop them actually hit legit players as well. I've earned quite a good amount of in game cash during one of their double money weeks shortly before the last major DLC hit and Rockstar in an attempt to remove cheated/modded money removed 7 million (thats the equivalent of about 80 real life bucks) from my account. In-game money I had earned through their event. I've contacted the support multiple times only to receive responses that either claimed the money was cheated or threatened to ban me.

After about 5 support tickets I gave up. Rockstar Games is scamming their own customers, and that's why I can't recommend being a customer of Rockstar Games anymore. If you already have the game and still play GTA Online I'd recommend doing the following: Go online and search for a cheater willing to give you modded money, proceed to get as much modded money as possible and spend as much of it as you can. Never even think about playing the game legitimately to earn money and for god's sake don't buy shark cards.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Singleplayer is amazing. The story, characters, map. Even after playing over and over again it's still entertaining. I like it way more than the GTA 4's story.

[b]As for online[/b] - this is the reason why I don't recommend the game, because I think that most people nowadays buy the game mainly because of the online. Don't get me wrong; I used to love it, played over 400 hours of pure online, everything was awesome, I thought that this is the perfect multiplayer game, they are constantly updating it and there is a lot of stuff - which has become the problem. A year and a half ago, everything was more or less balanced, the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me: 

[i]""Hey buddy, want to enjoy the content? Well, you should get our brand new garage only for 2M.""[/i]

Then Gunrunning. Again, my overall feelings:

[i]""Look at this cool update! The players will be able to get their bunkers only for 1.5M. Also, don't forget to upgrade your equipment for another 1M. Did we forget to mention that getting additional people working for you will only cost you half a million? By the way, you will time from time get raided and lose everything, unless you buy another cameras for 400K! All the raids will magically disappear! Want to modify your weapons in your Workshop? Well, too bad, you need a trailer for that, but don't worry, it's only 1 to 2 and a half millions. Do you want to train your shooting? There you go, only for 700K! Do you prefer white over black? The paint costs 105K, so... Did we mention that you can take a nap there? The key for that room costs 265K. Do you want a Gun Locker which you will probably never use? That will be 175K. You want some caddies? 85K or 120K if you want to have them larger. Don't forget to check out the new cars! Get yourself a car that shoots a couple of missiles only for 4-5M!""[/i]

How I felt about Smuggler's Run:

[i]Hello there! This update will be about planes. Want a hangar? 1 to 5M. Which style would you prefer? The one for 100k or the one for 320k? Want different lights? No problem - the more expensive style you chose the more expensive lights you'll get! Isn't that cool? Want some nice 'art' on the floor? Sure, we'll paint it for you, costs only up to 200k, just like your apartment you bought last year to do heists! Furniture? You mean another wall? That's another 280k for you. Again, want the keys to access your bed? 235k-375k. You want to customize your 500k glider? One word - WORKSHOP! And guess what this number, 1,150,000 means... Correct! It's the price!""[/i]

The prices of the content added were skyrocketing, if you wanted to truly enjoy the game, you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack, which is by the way, another big problem with this game, or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long, I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards, so I stopped playing. Since then, I've been ignoring the game, not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes, when I notice that there's an update, I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update, you might think this:

[i]""Oh, finally another heist, things are getting back to the state when you could buy a house for 200k and get full content.""[/i]

The reality, however, looks like this: 

[i]""Hey, it's nice to see you back in the game, look at this brand new heist room only for 2 millions, the same idea, only way more expensive.""[/i]

And as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore, I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers.

So in early December 2016 I was grinding hard in GTAOnline during a slow week. I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-specific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month.

At first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final. 

I have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up. 

At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed. 

Let me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it.
 
[b]Overall:[/b]
So: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"**EDIT - Apparently I'm one of the [strike]hundreds[/strike] thousand or so people falsely banned. People were getting banned in the tutorial. Seriously?**

This could be a good game if Rockstar wasn't the most incompetent twats I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.

You read a ton of these negative reviews thinking that these people are just unlucky, that it can't happen to you. I've been playing the game nonstop for a past week, making money for a bunker and new cars and in the middle of a game, I just got falsely banned for a month for no reason at all and my character and progress INSTANTLY reset.

It's a shame because this is a blast to play with friends, but Rockstar just can't seem to manage shit with their own game. They don't try to improve the experience, pushing out a bunch of events that no one seems to care about, releasing new content that require days of grinding and instead forcing everyone to buy their absurd shark cards, which people still apparently get banned for.

Another thing which I found cute is that now their support page reminds you over and over no bans, no matter what, may be appealed and are AUTOMATICALLY closed. So even when they ban people fo no reason: tough luck. 

Not to mention, do you know what I'll find when I log on a month later, all of my hard work reset back to nothing? Modders and cheaters, the same that have been on the game ever since it first came to PC.

This game will forever be garbage because of Rockstar. This review will stay if mine and countless others bans are not overturned.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"600 hours. Great game. Came back on to have some fun with an old friend and to check out the new updates. We did some CEO missions and drove around, deciding not to bother the other players and do our own thing. I log off the game. Five minutes later i receive an email stating i have violated the EULA and my account, character, and inventory have all been reset. Years of work. Gone. I decided to give the game another chance after the same scenario had happened to my best friend before the reset was a thing, just to have it happen to me. Don't get me wrong, we had a blast driving around, grinding up enough money to finally buy the vehicles and homes we wanted, then proceed to try the new modes as they came out like the racing, CEO, adversary modes. I saw all these negative reviews on the page stating how people had been randomly banned, and when they brought this up on the forums, they were called ""liars"" and told ""Dont cheat again fgt"". I thought they were full of shit until it happened to me. I have no chance of getting all i've worked for back unless i buy their damn shark cards, and even then, whos to say they wont ban me again? I can say the uninstall button worked better than the anti-cheat, as ive seen countless modders roaming around unopposed, causing hell to other players. Im 90% sure that the majority of answers im going to get for this review are going to be the ""regulars"" who claim everyone hacks or cheats except them, and that i won't be missed. Thats fine. Just note Rockstar, if you by chance read my lovely review, you've lost another customer. I will never buy from you again.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'm a 70 yr old lady, and I've played for some time now and I love this game. I will never be hardcore or even a good player. But there are so many things to do in this game it is almost overwhelming. Quests are very good, the story-line is very good and last but not least, the graphics are fabulous. 
On the downside; it is expensive being a Plus member, especially on a retirement pay (shoe-string budget). I recommend a much cheaper monthly fee. There is ofc the DLC content you get with the Plus membership but the ideal is to have a cheaper option only for that magical bag space just for crafters. Well, it's just a thought.

Happy New Year 2020!
Just a review of 2019 gameplay (many hours as you can see).
And I'm still playing (since my birthday 7 Dec 2017). I have just scratched the surface...
If you are looking for an adventure out of this world (pun intended) Elder Scrolls Online is the very very best.
I do pay for Eso plus, I need that magic bag since I farm and horde like a squirrel and craft like a boss. I have soon maxed out my main crafter.
I am in a guild with absolutely fabulous and helpful people. I have started to have a bit of confidence doing trials and dungeons with this guild, they know I am old and slow and they are patient with me. Hopefully, I will be a better team player this year. I am working on it.
In the meantime, I quest, explore, collect whatever, do delves, public dungeons, world bosses, farm and craft. And I enjoy it all!
All the best to all gamers in 2020.

I have edited this review, the starting-date was wrong, I got the game on 6 Dec 2017, and started to play on my B-day, 7 Dec 2017. Otherwise, counting the hours of gameplay, I must have been glued to the screen, LOL. I do have a life outside Tamriel, I promise... 
To All gamers Stay Safe in these crazy times. / Onna_Bugeisha

UPDATE 2022; This coming 7 Dec I'll turn 73 yrs which means that I now played this game for 5 yrs and I still love it.

Thank You! To all wonderful people for your heart-warming comments and awards. I like the titel ""Gaming Grandma""  

I have a confession to make - I fell in love with Horizon Zero Dawn, and spent some time there, i.e. I did 6 re-runs of that game (lol), it's a fabulous game. 

Now I am back in ESO again with the new High Isle chapter and two new companions, there are just so many things to do in ESO you never run out of options. Things like crafting, just exploring and farming, decorating your homes and create gardens... even fishing is very relaxing when you need a rest from bandits and monsters. 

Have I mentioned I lured my husband from Guild Wars 2, to come and join me in ESO last year? Now we play together, so much fun. 
A very important advice to all couples out there... this game is captivating and time-consuming - so please, see to it that you both play together or you might end up wondering what in the world happened to your significant other, seriously. 

I hope to see you in game or mail me (I am @Wing-Zun - on PC, EU server), I am in three trading guilds (BTW an excellent way to get some gold). 
 Arenthian Trade Guild - Tamriel Marketeers - The Twelwe Knights. Very nice guilds.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I have been paying this game for years, building my opinions of the game. The easiest way to describe it would be Pros v.s. Cons. 

Pros:
Easy to learn, hard to master.

The Questing only gets better with each expansion.

You don't NEED to interact with anyone. Treat it like a single player game if you want and call it hard mode.

Fun dungeons that don't get boring with just a couple of runs.

Tons of ""End Game"" content to keep one busy far after they reach max gear level.

Super Fun PvP system with Cyrodil Tri-Banner War

If you want to specialize in something like crafting, it is diverse and fun enough to keep you entertained, then become extremely profitable in the future.

Cons:
To be a crafter in the most efficient way, you NEED to subscribe to ESO Plus (but as a little sneaky pro, ESO Plus gives all the DLC bundled with it plus ""crowns"" equaling the price paid for subscription""

VETERAN MAELSTROM ARENA IS UNFAIRLY DIFFICULT favoring Magika DPS players with very good sustainability and constant shield action. A bit of tough love that pushes away newer or less experienced players.

PvP, though really fun, has a very steep learning curve that leaves many unsure where to start, luckily PvP isn't the main focus of the game.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So where does this leave us? Is the game worth putting in time and money? Simple answer is, yeah. Despite a rough launch in 2014, ESO has improved and worked out MOST of it's flaws and kinks, making it the great and enjoyable sandbox MMO it is today. 

-If you are playing and feel you need some direction you can send me a message via mail in game @Cactusking158 and I will do my best to answer any questions that come my way.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"TLTR: ESO is the best MMO I've played so far.


The Good.
It has retained many of the best elements from the Elder Scrolls series.
-Fantastic sound-score.
-Fine graphics.
-A world that feels alive.
-Great exploration gameplay.

The leveling and combat system is far better than any Elder Scrolls game, by miles. For PvE combat is great, tho I haven't played for long enough to get into PvP yet. You can choose to grind up to cap in a single session, if that strikes your fancy. Or you could care less about leveling and still participate fully in all non-endgame PvE.

ESO does not waste my time with long travel times, I can get to anywhere I've already been in between 30 sec to a minute. For me this is a very important point. I detest games that fakes longviety my wasting my time.

ESO is not in any way pay-to-win, and it doesen't unnaturally inconvenience the player to make me pay extra. The only inconvenience in the game comes with spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants while questing at the same time. This was an inconvenience in the Bethesdas Elder Scrolls games aswell because of inventory. You can pay to unnaturally compensate for this inconvenience through an ingredient-bag.

ESO has pay for vanity.

The world is immensly open. I can go anywhere I want and be successful straight from the start. There are many questlines with their own story tying into the main story. I can choose freely what storyline to follow, or I can ignore the story entirely if I just want to grind my way to the endgame content or just want to explore. This also means the game is extremely accessible for anyone.

Crafting is plesant and feels meaningful so far. There are crafting-quests in addition to crafting for trade, if I want to pursue it as a career. There are few games where I enjoy crafting, but in this one it seems ok.

Stealth gameplay is fun, although not innovative by any means.

Playing together ad hoc is fun even without groupinng up. Just running together with random people for an area or a difficult fight is quite fun. Probably because combat is fast-paced, players are considered allies for the purpose of abilities, and game mechanics generally supports doing so. It works very well for any open area I've been to, and is faster than grouping up.

Some of the dialouge is good.

Some of the quests are ok.


The Bad.
With the game being extremely accessible, people looking for a challenge will have to do a bit of searching or research where to go and who to hook up with.

Because the enemies and treasure scales with level, ESO doesen't have the mother-haul aspect of treasure-hunting that some older Elder Scrolls titles had. For instance, in the original Morrowind I could sneak into an ancient abandoned fortress, find a coven of vampires there so powerful they could one-hit kill me, sneak past them, discover an endgame weapon, steal it and leave. It was a very unique feeling when just stumbling into it while exploring.

The community tools for ESO are the porest of any MMO I've played. I haven't found an accessible way of reaching ppl even for PUGs. There is no tutorial on how to effectively get a group going, and frankly zero incentive to do so anyway in any area I've been so far. Further, getting a guild seems to be a matter of blindly accepting guild-invites from ppl spamming general chat. For instance I've found no credible channel on how to get info on guilds that may be suitable for me, seek them out and ask for an invite. As a noob I find getting involved in the community in ESO a frustrating chore.

There is a tool for queing to participate in dungeons (instances) with PUGs. The tool is never explained however, you just have to find it yourself. Also the queing I've done takes 30-90 minutes. Some times of the day I'm unable to find PUGs for dungeons at all through this tool.

The community also doesen't seem very inviting towards new players in my experience. I've not seen anyone being very helpful towards each other yet. It's not that it's hostile, just not very friendly either. It may of course be because the Morrowind expansion was just released and all the established players are over there, for all I know.

I cannot fly, levitate or do Khajiit-level jumps in ESO.

Some of the story isn't good. They all pivot around the main story in a very overt way. Like in the old arcade games, where there is a scheming badguy and everything except the end-fight is about thwarting his minions. ""His"" minions are everywhere in ESO: Tamriel, and it's just to much of the same. This is very different from the other Elder Scrolls titles, where the monsters of the land seemed to make up a whole ecosystem on their own, with their own lives and events. It makes the stories that follow the quests boring after 25 hours, and deteriorating rapidly at 50 hours.

Most of the quests are very boring. Fetch me those items or kill me those enemies. For me this may well become a reason for abandoning ESO, they were the reason I never played WoW for more than 20 minutes. In ESO they aren't as bad as the ones I experienced in the other title. It's normally 3-5 targets instead of 20-30. At first it seemed that this type of quests would be few, but it proved to be very frequent. A real pity.

Many of the quests are really stupid. And I mean really really bone 'ead stupid. Like the world-class schemer who's locked himself inside a tomb and left the 3 keys outside the door at different but easy-to-find locations. Makes sense.. It's back to the old arcades, only back then the format required some abstractions. In ESO it's not an abstraction anymore, but a literally really dumb story-element. While there are some straight-forward story elements of the type ""some soldiers have been captured, go rescue them"", nonsense solutions are more common. Fully expect an NPC to suggest solving a problem by shooting her magic rainbow-ray at the moon while farting some magic sunshine. But first you must go find her some rare shrooms at one location, kill 4 zombies at another location, get 3 seashells, then kill an evil monster turtle-boss. Then she can find the spy who's been taken prisoner by the enemy and learn what he knows. And on to the next one.

After a quest is done I get a pat on the back, where the NPC tells me this was all my doing. I'm a hero. It's not that it's wrong, it's just that after a while all quest-givers start to seem like a benevolent school-teacher praising a 7-year old.


The Ugly.
Customer Support are flat-out ignoring support-tickets. 

There are 3-year old bugs that prevent installing or starting up the game for enough players that the forums have several threads each day regarding them. New players enter the forum frustrated, not being able to play. Some are able to get it working through forum advice, and others can't and refund the game as a result. The ugly part is that the developers don't communicate with the players and doesen't even acknowledge the problem. It's been 3 years now, so it seems they just don't find the bugs worth the cost of resolving vs the number of resulting refunds and bad reviews.


Final Words.
I don't know how long ESO will keep me engaged. I'm currently doing the story and exploration, but unless the story starts diversifying in the next area I fear I'll seek other content. Maybe that content can keep my attention, maybe not. Regardless, this is the best MMO I've played despite its shortcomings. The combat is quite good, and the absence of time-sinks count for alot. That said, I've yet to find an MMO that could hold my attention for more than a couple of months.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",tltr eso best massively multiplayer online far good retained best element elder scroll series fantastic sound score fine graphic world feel alive great exploration leveling combat far elder scroll mile pve combat great tho long pvp choose grind cap single session strike fancy care leveling participate fully non endgame pve eso not_waste long travel time anywhere already 30 sec minute important detest game fake longviety wasting eso not_in pay win doesen unnaturally inconvenience pay extra inconvenience come spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants questing inconvenience bethesdas elder scroll game aswell inventory pay unnaturally compensate inconvenience ingredient bag eso pay vanity world immensly open anywhere successful straight questlines tying choose freely storyline follow ignore entirely grind endgame explore mean extremely accessible crafting plesant feel meaningful far crafting quest addition crafting trade pursue career game enjoy crafting ok stealth fun not_innovative mean ad hoc fun groupinng running random difficult fight fun probably combat fast paced player considered ally purpose ability mechanic generally support work open faster grouping dialouge good quest ok bad extremely accessible challenge bit searching research hook enemy treasure scale eso doesen mother haul aspect treasure hunting older elder scroll title instance original morrowind sneak an_emphasizedcient abandoned fortress coven vampire powerful kill sneak past discover endgame weapon steal leave unique feeling stumbling exploring community tool eso porest massively multiplayer online found accessible reaching ppl pug no_tutorial effectively group frankly zero incentive anyway far guild matter blindly accepting guild invite ppl spamming general chat instance found no_credible channel info guild suitable seek ask invite noob involved community eso frustrating chore tool queing participate dungeon instance pug tool never_explained queing take 30 90 minute time unable pug dungeon tool community doesen inviting towards player not_seen helpful towards not_that hostile not_very friendly course be_emphasizedcause morrowind expansion released established player cannot_fly levitate khajiit jump eso good pivot overt old arcade game scheming badguy except fight thwarting minion minion everywhere eso tamriel different elder scroll title monster land ecosystem life event make story follow quest boring 25 hour deteriorating rapidly 50 hour quest boring fetch item kill enemy abandoning eso never_played wow 20 minute eso bad one experienced title normally 3 5 target 20 30 type quest proved frequent real pity quest stupid really_emphasized bone ead stupid world class schemer locked inside tomb left 3 key outside door different easy location make sense old arcade format required abstraction eso not_an abstraction anymore literally dumb element straight forward element type soldier captured rescue nonsense solution common fully expect non suggest solving problem shooting magic rainbow ray moon farting magic sunshine rare shrooms location kill 4 zombie location 3 seashell kill evil monster turtle bos spy taken prisoner enemy learn know next pat non tell hero not_that wrong giver benevolent school teacher praising 7 old ugly customer support flat ignoring support ticket 3 old bug prevent installing starting player forum thread regarding player enter forum frustrated not_being able able working forum advice others refund result ugly developer communicate player doesen acknowledge problem 3 year bug worth cost resolving v number resulting refund bad review final word long eso engaged currently exploration unless start diversifying next fear seek maybe attention maybe not_regardless best massively multiplayer online despite shortcoming combat good absence sink count alot massively multiplayer online hold attention couple month
306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"This is a review from a new player aimed at new players.

I played ESO back in 2014 during the beta and didn't like it. I was expecting Skyrim online and it didn't qualify so I lost interest very quick.

Fast forward to april 2018, after years spent on Dark Souls, Dragon's Dogma, Rocket League and others ... Me and my buddies are looking for a game to play together like in the good old days. We're all dads with families now and there's no way we can get back to grinding like we used to (no pun intended).

I remember ESO and wonder how it's doing. People are talking about the One Tamriel update. I start a thread on Reddit asking if it's casual friendly, and everyone assures me that it very much is. Might be worth a shot so me and my buddies decide to give it a try.

ESO still isn't Skyrim Online, and won't ever be. The logistics of a MMO don't really allow the atmospheric beauty and complexity of a game like Skyrim. It is however way deeper in lore and atmosphere than any MMO I ever played, and you can tell great care is taken into making the world of Tamriel feel alive and breathing as much as can be. Every NPCs are voiced and side quests are literally everywhere. Many of them feel generic after a while, but some are actually really clever and well written. The world is absolutely humongous and very varied, with there again great care paid to respecting the Elder Scrolls lore. Long time ES players will appreciate the numerous references to stories and characters they already know well.

Graphics are pretty great for a MMO as well. I run it maxed out and lighting effects are downright gorgeous in some places. Art direction is consistent and while some places feel a little rushed, others surprise you with high levels of details. Riding from city to city through woods and moors, across deserts and sea shores, you always feel immersed in the world as should be. They also keep improving as the latest chapter, Summerset, is more beautiful and detailed than ever before.

Gameplay is one of the things that surprised me the most as I wasn't expecting it to be so fast paced. Fighting takes skills and strategy and you do need to learn to get better to earn victory, as opposed to simply leveling and spamming skills like it's sometimes the case in similar games. Me and my buddies have progressed steadily and we find ourselves beating dungeons we never thought we could beat before, and not just because we leveled up but because we learned to work better as a team. It's a very satisfactory feeling that the game encourages.

Classes are varied and skill lines designed to make you enjoy a high level of freedom in gameplay. I run a Magicka Templar, and designed my character so I can switch from DPS to Tank or Healer or a mix of both when I play with my friends without much of a hassle. I'll never be as performing as someone who would 100% specialize in either of these roles, but I would say that for once hybrid builds are absolutely do-able in this game, which is very rarely true in MMOs.

One thing responsible for us enjoying the game so much is the famed One Tamriel update. It basically removed level walls from the world and introduced a scaling system on the world map. It basically means that from level 1 to 50, you will adjust to monsters on the world map and normal delves to a beatable level. It does remove true challenge from these areas, but also allows you to roam the world freely to explore as you wish, which is a worthy trade in my opinion as it allows new players to be free to discover this enormous world like they were on an actual adventure. There are also no limits for partying with friends, so you don't need to worry about overleveling when you play on your own. While it could take from the satisfying experience of leveling up in early levels, the very flexible skill system feels like enough of a reward to keep it interesting.

World Bosses, Dungeons and Trials aren't scaled, and that's where the challenge begins. Each dungeon has several levels of difficulty and we have been steadily progressing through them in our 2 months of playing. Boss battles require strategy and analyzing the mechanics and can be quite epic. Sometimes you just don't have the required level or gears, but sometimes you just have to keep trying to get better. We have beaten many bosses we thought we would never beat on our first couple tries.

Past level 50, you start getting Champion Points, to a maximum of 750. They allow you to keep enhancing your character slowly and end up making quite a difference in the long run. As you get stronger, you'll be able to complete more difficult dungeons, which grant better gears. This is really clever design, as the game never feels like a grind in the traditional MMO sense, but instead more of renewed challenges. So far it has kept it's freshness to us.

The lack of ""grindy"" feeling is really something I want to emphasize on, as it's what's been preventing me from playing MMOs for so long. In my 2 months of playing I never felt myself even having the desire of grinding for levels or gears. I had fun doing quests on my own and playing with my friends, and my character naturally improved by doing so. We are still a long, long way from reaching end game content, and are in no hurry. From my experience, this is quite a feat to accomplish this feeling in a genre that is most often grindy by definition.

On the negative side, I would say that the game can sometimes feel a little bland, but then again it's a MMO and Skyrim, Dark Souls, Witcher III and the likes have spoiled us in recent years. Quests can feel generic and repetitive but you also don't need to do 80% of them.

The monthly subscription is by no mean necessary but access to all DLCs and their dungeons is quite pricey (and free if you subscribe). The bottomless crafting bag you get with the subscription is also pretty mandatory if you want to craft efficiently, and then again it isn't a necessity as you can resell materials instead of holding on to them and ask players to craft for you.

Crown store is mostly cosmetics or a shortcut to things you can buy with ingame currencies like skill respecs and the likes.

All in all, the game we were looking for at the right time for us. I highly recommend it if you are also looking for a similar chill, friendly experience in the Elder Scrolls universe.

[b]60/100[/b]


[b]Game Pros[/b]
• Giant fully explorable beautifully designed world
• Night/Day Cycle (3 hours each)
• Weather
• 1st and 3rd person is easily accessible
• Designated PvP area
• Customer support is very helpful
• Various lines and skills for crafting 
• Ton of possible character builds
• Mass amount of quests. (You'll have a hard time running out of things to do)
• Frequent updates
• A lot dungeons ranging in difficulty for you and your friends (or random players) to complete.
• Microtransactions are mainly all cosmetics (Other than mounts and crafting styles) 

[b]Game Cons[/b]
• If you have poor internet, prepare for the longest download. (80Gb)
• You can only group up with players from the same faction. So if your friends join a different one, you're out of luck
• Minor bugs (Rooms can take a little to fully load, possible freezing/crashing)
• Pricing of mounts is a little high (It takes awhile for the normal player to earn even 10,000 Gold. While most horses are 42,000 gold. Other than that, there is one that is 10,000 Gold. Only other option is buying it through the micro-transaction store)
• Only guild stores and AI markets. There is no public tradepost (like you would find in Guild Wars)

[b]Controversial Features[/b]
• Leveling system can be EXTREMLY slow, and may take a lot of time and effort to level up

[b]Relateable Games[/b]
• Guild Wars 
• WoW 
• Skyrim 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Elder Scrolls Online is a very fun and potentially an addicting Massive multiplayer online game. 900+ quests, giant open world map with a ton of caves, and dungeons, to explore. Sure there is some cons here and there, but overall I would reccomend this game to any person who enjoys MMOs. In the first 2-3 days of having it, I hit 30+ hours of gameplay. If you got the money and time, i'd pick this one up for sure. And no, you can not do shouts, and there is no dragons. This isn't skyrim.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[h1] The Elder Scrolls Online - Tamriel Unlimited [/h1]

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Tamriel.  A continent at war. The Dominion, Pact and Covenant fight for supremacy in the Imperial province of Cyrodiil. Meanwhile, Molag Bal has stolen your fucking soul. 

[h1] Review -11/26/15 [/h1]
[b] Graphics [/b]

Tamriel Unlimited is pretty. It has a variety of different environments - from the sandy, sunbaked land of Elsweyr, to the frigid, unforgiving land that is Eastmarch. Whilst no, the graphics aren't particularly revolutionary, and definitely not the same quality as Skryim, this is to be expected. For an MMORPG, the Elder Scrolls Online is up there with one of the best looking. Occasionally the world looks a bit 'the same', but usually as you advance to other provinces, the environment and ambience is noticeably different. 

EDIT: After a discussion with someone who commented on this review (which you can read below) I'd like to add this: 
Skyrim was a very graphically capable game. The base game, on ultra, compared to ESO, on ultra, is more graphically detailed than ESO in my opinion. However, this may depend on different viewpoints and whatnot. The graphics design and feel each game wishes to portray is different, and this may lead to differences in opinion - which is to be expected.

8/10

[b] PvE [/b]

Player vs Environment is the part of this game that gets particularly monotonous. It's the easiest way to level up, as you gain a considerable amount of experience for each quest you complete, but  it does indeed become a chore. The characters are forgettable, the quests the same. Kill this, gather 'x' amount of this, talk to her/him. In my 145 hours of playtime, only a few quests have got me genuinely interested. You skip dialogue as it does not mean anything or add to the plot. It does, however, reveal some beautiful locations and there are a FEW interesting quests. For the most part, however, PvE in ESO:TU is pretty 'meh'.

4.5/10

[b] PvP [/b]

If you're not sure about buying ESO for the PvE aspect, definitely consider buying it for the PvP aspect. It is likely the most fun I've ever had in an MMORPG. Nothing quite compares to standing aside a host of 50+ players as trebuchets pound castle walls, the walls crumble, and hundreds of players clash on the field of battle. If you're an Elder Scrolls fan and have always fantasized about some sort of war in Tamriel - buy this game. You're allowed to enter Tamriel at Lvl 10 (3-4 hours of playtime?). Once you enter, your stats are boosted to Veteran Rank 1(?). This means a Level 10 can still be (relatively) effective fighting higher levels, so it's pretty balanced. The PvP itself takes place in the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which has been invaded by three seperate factions-

The Aldmeri Dominion (High Elf, Wood Elf, Khajit)
The Daggerfall Covenant (Breton, Orc, Redguard)
The Ebonheart Pact (Argonian, Nord, Dunmer)
(With Imperial package you can play as an Imperial in any alliance)

There are 15/16 castles around the province, 6 of which surround the Imperial City. There are also various outposts. Around the castles are resources, which, if captured, give benefits to the faction who owns them.
The PvP is what makes this game, and what convinced me to stay for 100+ hours.

9.5/10

[b] UI/Levelling [/b]

The UI is well-designed, not too obtrusive. Levelling up is also pretty simple - each time you level up, you get to choose which stat to invest in - stamina, health or magicka.You can then choose a skill which you can plonk in your hotbar and use. Nothing broken or overpowered, though it does take testing to find the most effective skill sets.

8.5/10

[b] Crafting [/b]

I'm not going to lie, I've not experimented in crafting at all, so this section is from friends' experiences.
It's good. Dying your items can make your armor very unique, the materials are varied and it does take up time. It's not simple. Which is good.

8/10

[b] Framerate [/b]

I play this game on a GTX 770 and i7 4770. In the midst of a battle, with dozens of spells and effects going on as well as 100+ players on screen performing their own actions, it did not drop below 50fps. Well optimized, large scale PvP is the only time I've ever dropped below 60fps.

9/10 

[b] Grouping [/b]

The group questing/dungeons in this game are good, again, but not particularly revolutionary or exciting. Standard group quests and dungeon, pretty simple. Not a huge variety right now, I think there are about 7/8 without the Orsinium/Imperial City DLC. I've had loads of fun playing dungeons with friends, but it does become a bit stagnant once you've repeated them several times.

7/10

[b] Conclusion [/b]

This game is good. The PvP is excellent, and while the PvE isn't particularly impressive, it still functions. Bugs have almost all been ironed out. Worth your money if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, and are willing to accept certain sacrifices made by Zenimax to make the game a better MMO.

[b] OVERALL: 8.5/10 [/b]

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"So, I hated this game at first...

 I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of ""FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO"" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. 

It is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.

So I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.

Now I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.

Add-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.

For those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.

If any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I've thought a lot about whether to give this game a bad review or not. I almost did, but it would be unfair to the game. The largest and most painful issue I have with this game is the in-game shop and the way that this game has been monetized. It is so terribly monetized, that I almost gave this game a negative review. ZOS claim to only sell cosmetics and conveniences, however both of these things clash with the core gameplay of ESO. 

There are a number of rewards which are only obtainable through purchasing crowns with money, and with extremely expensive costs too. The game is objectively worse off by the existence of these things. I can count on one hand the number of mounts you can collect in game, but the number of mounts you can buy or obtain through ZOS's loot boxes is closer to 100. This gives players less things to actually play for, less things to collect and fewer targets to set for themselves.

In addition, you can buy time-savers which grant you ability points (if you've collected them on other characters), experience scrolls, mount training and the research scrolls for professions. The issue I take with the existence of these items is indicative of the fact that ZOS are aware that these grinds are a slug. They are literally time-gated; you can learn one mount training skill every 24 hours, of which there are 180 skills to spend. That is half a year of spending points to max out your mount training. This grind must be done on each character. The research scrolls speed up the rate at which you research a trait in a weapon. When researching a trait, you must wait an increasing amount of actual time before unlocking it and researching another. My main character has gotten to the point that she must wait 20+ days to learn a new trait in some professions. Or I can throw my wallet at ZOS and get it done instantly. ZOS, I want to play your game, but you're making it so hard.

The largest houses you can buy typically sell for around 14,000 crowns (€85) and are unobtainable otherwise. On the other hand the housing system in the game is phenomenal. It suffers a lot though when considering how expensive furnishings actually are, especially when compared to how little gold you actually get for just playing the game. While players can obtain some furniture pieces through playing the game, these are extremely few and far between when considering just how many furniture pieces there actually are in the game. The nicer furniture pieces are often priced at 10,000 gold, up to 100,000 for the fanciest pieces. When you only get 300 gold for completing a quest, as a player, you must look to get money through other systems if you want to engage fully with housing and furnishing. ZOS, PLEASE increase the amount of gold you get from quests. This leads me to the auction house in game, and ESO plus. 

The best way to obtain money in this game, is by engaging in the auction house. I love the auction house system in the game, and the way it forces players to be a part of a guild(s). One thing to help you make gold is the use of the extra bank storage and (literally infinite) crafting bag you get when subscribing to ESO plus. If you plan to sell any crafting materials and you don't have the crafting bag, be prepared to have a full inventory every 10 minutes. It's like ZOS are aware that not playing with the crafting bag is a handicap, and so they move it to a pay-wall. There are other ways to make money in the game, such as farming for rare item drops for hours on end, hoping that one will eventually drop which you can sell for a lottery cash out

ZOS are masters at creating problems and selling you the solution. The in-game store and the monetization is in direct conflict with the soul of this game, and I never feel satisfied playing this game. I want to engage in the housing, but the rate at which I can actually buy furniture, if I just do quests is extraordinarily slow. The crowns I get with the ESO plus subscription make it a bit better, as they allow me to buy furniture and housing with crowns instead of gold, but I can't help but feel like this doesn't have to be a problem at all.

ZOS, fix your monetization. I paid for this game, let me play it without locking features behind time-gates and pay-walls. If you want this game to be subscription based, make it subscription based, put everything from the store into the game, and remove the store. You can't have it both ways. I want to love this game, but with the way this game is monetized, I can't. 

If you enjoy questing and story-telling, you will probably enjoy the game if you don't engage with any of the things above.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Below you will find a video of my first impressions with the game.

The game is very good. But here is the problem, most people come into it expecting Skyrim online. DO NOT DO THIS!

First let me get this out of the way, as this needs to be noted! 

If you look at the game as an MMO first and a TES game second you will not be disappointed. Others will look at the limitations compared to Skyrim or other TES single player games. Instead i look at the freedoms! I can loot just about every container i come across, i can go into pretty much every building i come across. Other mmo's don't do this. Other mmo's don't have things scattered across their dungeons to loot aside from corpses. Someone else might say ""well i can't pick up everything like i can in Skyrim"" No you can't, but what mmo let's you? In this you can at least interact with objects more than other games. 

The combat: You don't just stand in place watching cool downs! You have to react to your enemy, you have to block and dodge. You can't get away with auto attacking! They have improved the feel of combat, you don't feel like you are slicing thin air anymore. 

The community: It's amazing! Everyone i have spoken to has been extremely friendly, eager to group up, eager to role play and get into character. No one is arguing in the chat! No one is spamming to sell you gold.

The crafting: It's just as much fun as other TES games, collecting the reagents you need isn't a chore because the world is fun to explore and gather in! There are plenty of recipes to find and experiment with.

The world: The game looks great, it's not mind blowing great, but it does look good, especially for an MMO. This isn't going to look like a graphic mod for Skyrim so forget that! But it's no slouch either. The lighting is very well done but some textures can be bland. 

The customization: This is a big one! This game has a TON of customization options, dozens of skills to choose from which only get added on from joining things like the fighters and mages guild or becoming a werewolf or vampire! You can use any weapon and any armor type, there are thousands of builds for each class! The best customization i have ever seen and i've been a rabid MMO gamer since 2003. 

The crown store: It isn't pay to win! It's very similar to GW2 and there are only aesthetic options available. I was so pleased by this that i found myself WANTING to give them money in return for a cool looking mount, pet and costume. They don't pester you for money with pop ups or anything annoying like that. You buy the game and you choose to purchase aesthetics on your own terms. 

I haven't experienced PvP yet and i haven't got to end game, i am enjoying my time in the game as a slow burn and i recommend you do the same! DO NOT be in a rush to get to cap! Live in the world, enjoy your ascent!

In closing i will just say the game got a bad rep early on. Essentially people were paying for a beta until Tamriel Unlimited launched so i can understand their frustrations. But the game is in a MUCH better place now, i'm sure it's going to be very popular when it launches on consoles and the PC community seems to be growing now that the game is B2P! 

Thank you for reading my review and i hope you find it helpful.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'm pushing 1500 hours and decided it was time for a review. Here you go.

As a long time Morrowind addict I was hesitant to jump on the ESO bandwagon.  I'd heard a lot of bad stuff about it when it was first released and solidly decided I was in the camp of 'that's not a real Elder Scrolls game, it's a cashgrabbing, PVPing, mainstream-appealing mess'.  Which. to be fair, was kind of accurate back around initial release (from what I've heard). Jump forward give years though, and it's come a looooooooong way.

Lore: 
If I'd started playing and found the lore side of things to be poorly addressed I would have stopped playing. I haven't stopped playing. Established lore is maintained and adhered to well, and the game adds its own bits and pieces - some new stuff, some expanding on previous knowledge.  And there's plenty of books lying around for the lore enthusiasts to pore over. You could quite easily play the game and completely ignore the lore aspect, if that''s your thing, but you'd be missing out on a huge part of the charm of the ES world.

Gameplay: 
Top notch questing, both the main questlines (of which there are many) and also standalone side quests. Keeping in line with previous titles in the series, there's been an effort made to minimise 'Go and kill X bandits' or 'Fetch me X golden watercress seeds' type quests. While ultimately all quests will be basically 'Go there, do this, come back' they are well presented, relevant to the storyline and generally cohesive.

There are less world-changing decisions that can be made than in other games of the series, but that's part and parcel of the MMO genre. Occasionally you will meet a new character who obviously thinks they know you - as far as I can tell this is an overhand from early days when different areas of the world were levelled, and progress was more linear. Modern ESO has level-scaling across the board, meaning you can access previously 'end-game' zones from the get go. It's not gamebreaking, and very minor - took me ages to even realise it was happening. 

Combat:
My first impression was that regardless of class/playstyle you end up being forced to do magick-y stuff. Coming from earlier games where playing as a warrior (or whatever non-magic class) means you can basically light attack, heavy attack or block I was....somewhat irked. Combat is basically a combination of buffing yourself/debuffing enemies with 'abilities' and then using normal attacks interspersed with other 'abilities'. All these abilities are accompanied by much pomp and circumstance - flames, sparkles, sound effects and such. I was kind of miffed that I couldn't just hit things with a sword/arrow/morningstar and occasionally swig a health potion. Once again, it's an MMO - not a single player adventure game. Took a while to get used to, but you adjust. There's also wiggle room if you want to be more of a purist, but you'll be cutting yourself off from most of the group/endgame activities by doing so.

Classes/Races:
Well handled. Nightblade is the quintessential 'Thief' class, Sorceror is the 'Mage' and Templars, Dragonknights and Wardens are a bit of a mixed bag. There's less of a Warrior/Mage/Thief theme and more of a Damage/Healer/Tank vibe to the whole affair, due to the traditional 4 man party setup for group activities. Too much reading online will convince you that to be any good at all you need to shoehorn yourself into the current 'meta' build for whatever role you want to fill. Reading these guides and builds is a great way to understand how to use skills more effectively or learn how different armour sets can help in combat, but at the end of the day they're best ignored. Play the character you want to play - if you were good enough to benefit from squeezing an extra 1.6% DPS out of your toon you wouldn't need to read a guide to find out how to do it.

Races are pretty faithful to tradition, with 'passives' that are vaguely in line with with the old 'Altmer have extra magicka', 'Khajiit be sneaky' stuff. Nothing to prevent you from making an Orc healer or an Altmer brawler if you wish, though.

Community:
Generally good, always feel free to ask questions in zone chat if you need a hand with something. Lot's of helpful sorts out there. PUGs can be a bit toxic sometimes, but it's easy to just leave the group if you can't be bothered dealing with someone excessively unpleasant. Hundreds of guilds to join, everything from trading to roleplaying to hardcore score pushers. On that note, if you're trying to do an endgame trial and suck, the other people are NOT being toxic. There's an expectation that you will contribute effectively, and if you're not, well tough potatoes.

Crafting:
Only mentioning because it's a big part of the in-game economy and a main reason for lots of people to play. In the course of your adventures you'll collect oodles of furnishing designs, armor and weapon style diagrams, foodstuffs, raw resources and other shiny bits and bobs. Level up your crafting skills and you can make your own gear, make furniture, potions/poisons to use or sell. You can also just go out foraging for stuff and sell your spoils through a guild for a tidy profit. Nice low-key way to spend an hour or two if you don't feel like combat or questing and just want to romp around outside enjoying the landscape.

Real money:
Yes, there's a 'Crown Store' where you can buy stuff with your IRL fundage. I don't think many people use it. Lot's of flashy stuff (and lots of cosmetics) that after a few weeks of playing you can mostly find or make yourself in-game. Subscribing to ESO Plus gets you an unlimited inventory for crafting resources (very handy) and access to all the DLC content (which can also be purchased one-off if you prefer). It also gives you 1500 crowns per month, so you can fritter it away on the more useful/appealing items if you so wish. The game is fully playable without subscribing, it's really just a QOL improvement and means you don't have to pay upfront for the many DLC zones.

Overall:
I love this game. It's huge, both geographically and in terms of content. New areas are being released regularly and despite the whining on forums, the dev team does a good job of addressing issues and making the game enjoyable, accessible and true to the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe.  You can play this as an MMO, a single-player game or anything in between. You can RP your way through the overland regions, or min-max your way onto some very competitive leaderboards.  For me, it's a great continuation of he Elder Scrolls series and also a very enjoyable (and affordable) MMO without that horrible WoW feel to it. You're not forced into any particular playstyle based on your class or race, and there's enough content to keep anyone busy for many thousands of hours. 

If you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, or MMOs, or RPGs in general, I suggest you give it a try. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but such a large bag that you'll never get bored.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"After reading all the negative comments about paywalls, subscriptions, and overpriced items; I was hesitant to buy this game.
I bought the Standard Edition on sale for like 13 bucks, and have logged on every day for the past 2 months. 
There is so much stuff to do, and so many quests, my quest log is constantly filled to max capacity.
I really like this game. It's the only one I play.

I haven't hit a paywall yet, and I haven't felt the need to get a subscription.
You want a mount? You get a mount. 
You want more storage? Buy more storage. 
You want a house with furniture? Buy a house with furniture. 
You want to fast travel? Fast travel via waypoints for free.
You want to create numerous characters? You can create up to 8.
You want to delete one and make a different one? No problem.
I have yet to find something I require, for which I need to pay real money.
You get free daily items. Some of these are crates containing items only available in store.
Dont like the items you got? Trade them for gems, save up gems and get what you want.

If you have the money to spend on subscription gaming, perhaps there are better options out there.
For a gamer on a budget, like me, this is by far the best value I have ever got from any game.

Would recommend. Combat is hard but rewarding to master and quests (while not skyrim worthy) are fun and engaging. 

This MMO stands on its own two feet, and soon it'll be easier to grind out equipment with the curated drops system so you won't have to spend almost 167 hours trying to get the equipment like I did. 

The only thing that I'd discourage you from doing is buying crown crates especially if you have a gambling problem because it'll feed into that.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[h1] Gamble's ESO REVIEW [/h1]
[i] After spending over 4000 hours i feel its time to voice my personal opinion about the game. [/i]

[b] My Own Experience [/b]
I first started The Elder Scrolls online when the Vvardenfell DLC released roughly Mid June 2017, after years of playing other different types of games i decided i needed my MMORPG fix again. I was not sure what to expect but i knew i was a fan of The Elder Scrolls Universe, playing most the previous games in the series and being a big fan of the lore so i decided to give the online version a chance. 

I purchased the normal game standard edition which is the base game. To buy the DLC for the game there are a few options such as straight up buy the DLC which will cost you crowns (they do sometimes have offers for these) or you can buy into their ESO+ subscription. From a fresh point of view, i was thinking ""do i really want to pay more money after just buying the game"". After asking a few of my friends who had played the game before i did more digging and found out it was HIGHLY BENEFICIAL, you get a lot of perks such as:
[list]
    [*]Access to all current and future DLC's 
    [*]Unlimited crafting bag (Go nuts and pick up everything!)
    [*]Double Bank Space
    [*]10% more gold/xp
[/list]
[i] HINT [/i]
I would recommend you buy the base game first, see if you enjoy the game and if you think you will play the game longer buy ESO+ honestly that crafting bag is life, a lot of people from my experience say ""i cant live without this anymore"". and the fact that you get access to all the DLC content is just fantastic.

[b]Factions in the game [/b]
Before playing the game i did some research to find out the best race and class to choose for each role. Like other games i played i wanted to see what each class had to offer e.g. which class did the most dps, who was the best healer or the most beefy tank. When picking a race you are also choosing a certain faction depending where that race comes from in the world, which is one of 3:
[list]
    [*]Daggerfall Covenant (Blue)
    [*]Ebonheart Pact (Red)
    [*]Aldmeri Dominion ( Yellow)
[/list] 
[i] HINT [/i]
Now a days there is an option to buy ""any race any faction bundle"" which some people might see as annoying and an excuse for the devs to take more of your money. However this is mainly aimed at open world pvp, so unless you are going to pvp a lot or want to be in the same faction as your friends, pick any race which you find appealing. There is always the option to make another character of the same faction to play with friends.

[b] Classes currently in the game [/b]
I remember the first Character i ever made was a Warden, As the DLC had just released and not many people had played it i thought it would be good fun. Later down the line however i learnt the hard way the bear can be annoying. There is a way to control your bear so it doesn't randomly pull mobs in trials or the boss at the end. I remember doing this many times :D  but i was never told and it was never obvious there was a button to press for your bear companion to be non hostile. 

Many of the classes tool-kits have been changed which has lead to them getting buffed and nerfed either many times or a few times. Honestly sometimes it feels like the devs are unsure how to balance some of the skills in the class. They either go from one extreme to making it powerful or not very useful and weak. Saying that now a days if you wanted to play, there are so many different sets to wear in the game to help you out, if you want more damage or need better sustain. Please see the list below of the current classes in the game so far.
[list]
    [*]Templar 
    [*]Sorcerer
    [*]Dragonknight
    [*]Nightblade
    [*]Warden (Crown Store)
    [*]Necromancer (Crown Store)
[/list] 
[b] Races currently in the game [/b]
I enjoyed the customisation different races, you get given lots of choices to make your characters look unique and different. E.g a fat male Wood Elf dressed as a belly dancer, or a fancy Orc with a moustache. Please see the list below for current races in the game
[list]
    [*]Breton
    [*]Redguard
    [*]Orc
    [*]Nord
    [*]Argonian
    [*]Dark Elf
    [*]Khajiit
    [*]Wood Elf
    [*]High Elf
    [*]Imperial (Crown Store)
[/list] 
[i] HINT [/i]
Honestly unless you want to min/max your character, you don't really have to worry about choosing which race and class to play. Now a days there isn't too much different between all the races. Other then that just have fun! Try out many classes and see which suits your play style.

[b] What is there to do in the game? [/b]
When first playing I was not sure what to expect but i knew that i wanted to have fun and see all the different things the game offered such as:
[list]
    [*]Map zones (Questing, Fishing, Skyshards, Dolmens)
    [*]PVP (Battlegrounds, Imperial city, Cyrodiil)
    [*]Trials (12 player content)
    [*]Guilds (Trials, progression, trading, Roleplaying, causal) 
    [*]Dueling (Tournaments)
    [*]Housing (Competitons)
    [*]Achievement hunting 
    [*]Arena's ( 4 player content and single player content)
    [*] In-Game Events 
    [*] Dungeons (4 player content, normal and vet)
[/list]
[b] Positives [/b]
Lots of helpful and friendly guilds, there are so many guilds in the game you could almost go as far to call them small communities, usually in a guild if you need help or are unsure they will answer any questions you have about the game.

Progression guilds, are great if you want to get into the end game content, unlike other guilds that require x amount of dps, progression guilds normally don't have such a high benchmark and love to help train new people, give advise and explain the mechanics of tougher content.

You never know when you will make friends, the amount of times i have been doing something random and then i just become good friends with a person is crazy, A lot of people are nice and are willing to help if you have any questions.

So much lore in the game to explore, as the game takes place in the past you can see what the world used to be like.

[b] Negatives [/b]
FPS seems to be an issue when pvping in open world e.g. you run into so many loading screens, or come against so many players that your PC cant keep up and your skill bar doesn't work. 

When trying to get into a dungeon, that can be quite the experience, sometimes even with a full group the finder doesn't seem to work, people can leave randomly halfway through a dungeon, they can just be rude and run most the dungeon and skip bosses. PUG AT YOUR OWN RISK! that's right your heard me, when trying to randomly enter a vet dlc dungeon yikes. It is honestly like gambling with your time, you will either get a really good group, or a terrible group of people who get mad, blame others and leave. 

Dry End game content, sadly this isn't the most challenging game of all time. When you get later into the game with more experience and understand the mechanics from the dungeons, you lose that sense of its a challenge. The same can go for trials, with all the top end raiding guilds out there, they go and smash so many of these trials in record times each patch. 

Steam Login issues, sometimes after a long maintenance you find that some people are able to login fine but people who brought the game on Steam have to wait hours more to play the game.

[b] Overall [/b]
I have really enjoyed my time playing this game, from the social aspect i have met so many people in different guilds, who have become good real life friends. Sometimes in guilds they run so many events like, make the ugliest outfit, dungeon races, fishing together in a group of 20+ or just dress the same as a guild and bombard a town by dancing everywhere. I WOULD RECOMMEND this game if you want to be part of a good community, who loves the ESO lore and wants to have fun, there are honestly so many guilds out there which offer a lot!

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"First and foremost I am a solo player. I am just going to compare this to WoW and my personal preferences as a solo player. This game seems to be a better fit for me than WoW.

I enjoy the leveling process in WoW, but lose interest fast once I hit max level. I am simply not interested in raiding, playing in groups, or PvP. I like being able to walk away from the game or take a break at any time. In WoW the quests are pretty boring, they're primarily text, etc. Your character just really cannot become more powerful playing solo past a certain point. However, I have a pattern of re-subbing WoW every time an expansion comes out and quitting shortly after hitting max level.

Now I am giving ESO a go and I've been enjoying it a lot. Why? The quests are amazing. It's fully voiced over which means I am actually engaged and paying attention to what's going on (all I did was skip the dialog in WoW). The quests are far more detailed when it comes to the story behind them, the tasks, the environments, etc. It's so much more than the zillion fetch quests or kill X monsters quests in WoW. The main story quests in WoW were good, but that's it. The rest of them are not. In ESO there is just no end to high quality engaging quests. I opted for ESO plus as well which opens up a million more. I'm only level 19 after 71 hours and having a great time.

I prefer the combat in ESO. It's simpler. I'm OK but was never really good at WoW. Just OK. ESO lets me keep it as simple as possible. I run 1 bar of 5 skills; that's it. The combat is less twitchy, but still very reactive in nature. You have to block, roll, interrupt caster, and use your 5 abilities, but it's just way simpler. Those basic functions of rolling, blocking, and interrupting are way more intuitive in ESO in my opinion because you're using your movement keys and attack keys to do it; not a special ability. The monsters in ESO are easier to ""read"" compared to WoW. In WoW you really need to sort of memorize different types of attacks, abilities, etc. to know how to avoid or counter them. In ESO there is a target on the ground to avoid, it's always the same interrupt, always the same roll, etc. It's been easy to manage for me as an OK player and, honestly, more fun for me. I don't feel like I suck. I also feel like ""meta"" probably matters less in ESO and small mistakes don't really ruin anything. I might be wrong because I am still new, but that is the feeling I am getting.

Anyway, that's me! Solo player, just OK or decent at playing MMOs in general, needs voiced over content to keep me engaged, etc. I am really liking it and definitely recommend it. Hopefully this helps someone with a similar preference or background make a decision.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",foremost solo compare wow personal preference solo fit wow enjoy leveling process wow lose interest fast max simply not_interested raiding group pvp able walk break wow quest pretty boring primarily text cannot_become powerful solo past certain pattern subbing wow expansion come quitting shortly hitting max giving eso enjoying quest amazing fully voiced mean engaged paying attention skip dialog wow quest far detailed come task environment s_emphasizedo zillion fetch quest kill x monster quest wow quest wow good rest not_in eso no_end high quality engaging quest opted eso plus open million 19 71 hour great prefer combat eso s_emphasizedimpler ok never_really good wow ok eso let simple possible 1 bar 5 skill combat twitchy reactive nature block roll interrupt caster 5 ability simpler basic function rolling blocking interrupting intuitive eso opinion movement key attack key not_a special monster eso easier read compared wow wow sort memorize different type attack ability avoid counter eso target ground avoid interrupt roll easy manage ok honestly fun suck meta probably matter eso small mistake ruin wrong feeling anyway solo ok decent mmos general need voiced engaged liking definitely recommend hopefully help someone similar preference background decision
306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"At the time of writing this I am roughly around 180 hours in the game.

When I first got into Elder Scrolls it was with Skyrim. Playing only that and none of the other previous games I was blown away with how detailed that game was. When I heard that a MMORPG was made with the same title I was very enthusastic. When I got Elder Scrolls Online, I was told it would not be ""Skyrim Online"", and to an extent, those whom mentioned it were correct. However my thoughts and feelings on that statement have changed quite a bit.

After playing for as long as I have, which in comparison to many others, I have found this to be right at home with my previous experience with Skyrim. I absolutley love this game. I feel that it is totally worth the $60 price tag and I invite other open minded players to give this game a shot. There are many differences from the Single Player version of Elder Scrolls but all of the reasons I loved Skyrim are placed in this game.

The ability to customize my character in any way I see fit, the endless caves, areas and places of interest to see. Fully voiced NPC's and endless hours of lore and other content for players to experience. Not to mention that NPC's reconize your heroic feats as you walk by them, often singing your praises and sometimes even questioning some of your actions that you have made in the game. In fact, there are many circumstances where I have had to make a tough decision and have spent much time dwelling after the fact if I made the right call. Should I have helped fight at the docks or was defending the fort the better call? The result might be the same but the fact that I even had to contemplate the lives of fictional NPC's that I would never meet again shows how enriching the plot can be.

The  PvP in my opinion is very hard, but very fun. I die often, but its not frustrating. Being able to team togeather with random strangers, plan an attack and take a fort seems like it would be difficult to do but everyone is on board and ready to play the game. They want to succeed as much as you and I found the community helpful and enriching, not to mention being able to use seige weapons is so much fun and adds a level of excitment I didn't realize was part of the game.

In the non PvP side, I found most players to be felpful, friendly and very outgoing. I found a guild almost right away and in that guild was open minded Veteren players who wanted to help grow and encourage newer players. Often investing a lot of time and energy explaining various parts of the game such as Armor, Weapons, Skill's, ect. Even non guild members and complete strangers are often pretty nice. I can recall looking for a Werewolf Bite and after a few bad players asking me for a ton of gold and crafting materials in order to give me a bite, one player simple messaged me and say ""don't pay them anything, I will give it to you for free."" Not only that but he also gave me tips on how to complete the Werewolf single player quest.

I plan on sticking with this MMORPG for a very long time. Its fun, its first person, its 3rd person and its live action. It has its faults, all games do, but if you can take things with an open mind and a grain of salt you will find much love for this awesome game. It wont ever be ""Skyrim Online"" but in many ways I really feel it is. A great story, great community of players, a big wide open world to explore with choices that are unique to your character. Seems pretty close in my opinion.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I originally pre-ordered this game back in 2014. I found it to some-what fun but other titles at the time were far more interesting to me and ended up side-tracking me from playing ESO.
I had stopped playing the game all together, and did not return.

I recently read that the game had been revamped for 2020 offering many more features, and changes.
I have now played a character from the start in 2020 and leveled that character to max level, here is my honest review:

PROS: 
-Great scenery, graphics are great, character models look awesome.
-Excellent exploration, seriously, you will find yourself just running around looking at interesting things from time to time.
-Fun combat, controls flow nicely. Also cool to see an MMO that can be played on controller.
-Character building is very unique in this and allows the creator of the character to really build a very unique feeling class. This allows for quite a diversity in game-play.
-PVP Game mode is very fun. Definitely has a learning curve, but once you figure it out, the PVP is very unique and offers a lot of replay-ability.
-In game purchases are available but none of them are a pay to win option. (The in-game purchases are mostly stuff like costumes or cosmetic changes.)
-There are some nostalgic elements in this game that remind me of previous single player Elder Scrolls titles.

CONS:
-The questing is interesting, but can become repetitive and chore-like. (As is per normal of an MMO)
-Alot of the quests share some overly similar story-lines. However, I do also understand this is an MMO with tons of quests in it.
-The dungeons do get better towards the higher character levels, but at first they offer zero challenge and are fairly boring. I found myself just kind of running around, using random abilities with no serious sense of direction.
-First person game-play is neat to offer, but is never used. There is seriously no point in using it.
-There can be a few moments when playing where you can get stuck on terrain or find it hard to jump up on top of something, which can be minorly annoying. 
-Group queuing for PVP is currently removed, which in my opinion takes away from the PVP experience.

Overall I would recommend this game if you're a fan of MMOs and of course a fan of the Elder Scrolls games.
This game does have an Elder Scrolls feel to it, the environment and game-play does feel like Tamriel.
If you're going to compare this game to World of Warcraft, you won't like it. It has a very different play style, however I do believe that ESO has a refreshing feel to it.

The developers appear to still care about the game as well, being that content is regularly added to keep the game interesting.

TLDR: Game is good, give it a go.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"***ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS WERE BEFORE TAMRIEL UNLIMITED***

Yes, this game was pretty bad before the free update. They knew that no one would like the paid subscription and so they finally made it free (after initial purchase).

This game is a MUST HAVE for Elder Scrolls fans, and players who want a ""new"" type of MMO.

PROS:
+ Good Combat System, No turn taking, and no point and spam keys.
+ No ""Grab this, kill ten of these"" Quests are INTERESTING AND FUN.
+ Lore is great, I really get immersed in this game.
+ NOT PAY TO WIN.
+ GOOD ECONOMY. I can buy iron ore 12g in one area and sell it to another player 15g in a different area.
Also no Crowns for Gold, So rich people cant mess up the economy.
+ Decisions affect gameplay.
+ Feels like a single player game, plays like an MMO.
+ First person, third person, and birds eye veiw for all players and preferences.
+ Amazing soundtrack.
+ No paid subscription.
+ No lowkey *BUY OUR STUFF PLZ* (ex. Guild wars 2 chest drops and keys.)
+ Quick and fast customer support.
+ PvP is very fun. Destroying forts with siege equipment is a blast.

Cons:
- Character creator is absolute trash. needs WAY more hairstyles and body mods.
- Must do quests to level up. Grinding takes forever.
- Needs more classes besides 4 basic ones.
- Needs more spells.
- Wish it had more of a ""I am me"" feel. 
- Shopkeepers will give you 1 gold for items that took your FOREVER to get.

The good outweighs the bad TREMENDOUSLY. Buy this game, have fun and recommend it! Lets get this to overwhelmingly positive like it deserves.


***EDIT***

After playing for some time, I started to play with a friend. We started two new characters and were going to complete quests together.

The group questing needs some major improvements.

Suggestions to the Developers:

+Add need/greed system
+If I complete an objective, my partner should NOT have to complete that same objective.
+Players should have a ""Waiting for buddy"" before going to next area/ talking to an NPC.
+Players should be able to teleport to buddy, their exact location if they become to far apart.
+Players should be able to ""duel"" friends or other players.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",negative review tamriel unlimited yes pretty bad knew no_one paid subscription finally initial purchase elder scroll fan player type massively multiplayer online pro good combat no_turn taking no_point spam key no_grab kill ten quest interesting fun lore great immersed not_pay win good economy iron ore 12g 15g different no_crowns gold rich cant mess economy decision affect feel single play massively multiplayer online third bird eye veiw player preference amazing soundtrack no_paid subscription no_lowkey stuff plz ex guild war 2 chest drop key quick fast customer support pvp fun destroying fort siege equipment blast con creator absolute trash need hairstyle body mod quest grinding take forever need class besides 4 basic one need spell wish shopkeeper 1 gold item took forever good outweighs bad tremendously fun recommend let overwhelmingly positive deserves started friend started character complete quest group questing need major improvement suggestion developer add greed complete objective partner not_have complete objective player waiting buddy next talking non player able teleport buddy exact location far apart player able duel friend player

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"A few things for new players:
1. Stealing is the right (only) way to make decent gold if you're anti social and don't want to sell stuff on guild stores. There's multiple sets that can be used at once to reduce your detection radius when sneaking and going cat will reduce it even further. To the point you can sneak into npcs and they won't see you (cat not required, but makes it easier). From there it's just how much laundering you can do each day holding you back. Destroy white drops if you want to fast track your gold making.

2. If you ever plan on getting something via crowns, DO NOT buy crown packs. Buy ESO plus instead. ESO plus gets you just as many crowns as the pack, but with the added bonus of the crafting bag for a while. That crafting bag will be your best friend. Yes, it sucks it's a paid service instead of just being baseline, because it really should be baseline.
While you have ESO plus as well, go get companions. NPC allies who will help you fight, heal or tank. They are super helpful when going solo! You may have to look up how to get them.

3. Nothing matters until max level (CP 160) look up a good set for your build and where to get it and *avoid* that area until you're max level. The way equipment drops works is once you get a set piece and bind it you're unable to get that piece again until you have the full set. You do not want to get a super awesome for your build item at level 10. Once you do reach max level and start equipment hunting, do not bind something until it has the perfect stats you want. You can always upgrade quality, but re-rolling stats is much more expensive and requires dlc or a guild. And once you get the full set, anything can drop again. Good luck getting what you're looking for.

4. Guild stores are your friend! Often for cheap, you can get a full set of max level gear that's decent enough to get you started. There's an official website to list everything on sale and it's price and where it is. https://tamrieltradecentre.com/ will help a lot for finding what you need, use it often!

5. NEVER EVER PAY FOR VAMPIRISM OR LYCANTHROPY. EVER. People give these out free so often and you will likely just be scammed. AFK near whichever shrine you choose and you'll be bit eventually. Asking in map chat will often get answers, don't listen to the jerks who try to put you down for asking, it's the best way to get bit. Look up where shrines are if you don't want to do the next thing. You can be cured anytime at any mages guild in major towns, like Riften, for a small cost in gold. This will not reset your XP gain on the skill line, but it will refund the skill points.

6. Addons are a must! For example a Minimap that shows where spirit shards are (skill points), chests, bosses, ect. They are extremely helpful and you're better off learning how to use them before you get started. Is it less immersive? Yeah, a little. Does it make the game playable? Yeah, a lot.

7. On the store there is a free object called the armory. Place this in your first house and every character from then on, fast travel to that house and save a level 6 zero points distributed, no armor set. This will let you reset your character anytime so you can reset skills and stats, and reset any vampirism or lycanthropy you may have for free. This thing is really, really helpful and for some reason not talked about at all! You can get an inn home in most major towns for very cheap or even free, place it there!

The game does have it's problems but it's fun to hang out in, gather gold or bs with friends (or strangers in map chat). You can make a name for yourself in pvp/alliance wars or you can just become a massive collector owning every house in the game and be a guilds pride and joy.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[b]Is this game, like, multiplayer Skyrim?[/b] No. 

[b]Is this game Skyrim 2?[/b] No.

[b]Can I heal mid-battle by shoving 50 cheese wheels in my mouth and then unpausing?[/b] No. 

[b][i]So what is this game?[/i][/b]
This game is an MMORPG. It has the story elements that are familiar to Elder Scrolls fans, but the format is similar to that of any MMORPG. There is a lot of content you can play solo, but there is also content that can or must be done in groups. 

[b]Story[/b]: Depends on the zone, can range from 4/10 to 11/10. 

[b]Quest Design[/b]: Depends on the quest and on play style. Can be a 9/10 if you're interested in the lore, but if you're more interested in skipping any and all relevant dialogue and just doing tasks, it can get dull. 

[b]Content[/b]: 11/10, I am far-too-many hours in and I have about 30%-40% more content left in the game in terms of quests and areas alone, not including dungeons and trials. 

[b]Graphics[/b]: 9/10, the fantasy style means that the game ages well despite being 2014. 

[b]Difficulty[/b]: 3/10 to 9/10. (Easy to learn, difficult to master.) 

[b]Combat[/b]: 6/10. It's average, nothing too insane but not horrible either. 

[b]UI[/b]: 5/10 in its base form, but can be raised much higher with addons on PC. 

[b]Price[/b]: Low. It goes on sale often, and if you get the non-upgrade edition of the newest expansion (Greymoor at the time of this writing), you get all of the past major DLCs as well, so you don't need to play catch-up. Unlike what others may claim, [i]subscription is not required[/i]. You can get the subscription if you want to try out the DLC or if you are a hard-core player or interested in doing major crafting. However, if you are just a casual once-in-a-while player, there is no need to buy the subscription. This also means that if you are about to have a busy time irl, you can pause your subscription without being locked out of the game if you still want to plat occasionally but not enough to warrant it.

Yes, there are crown crates and a crown store and stuff that does cost real money in most cases. No, you can't collect everything in the game, even if you toss a Jeff Bezos salary at it. And that's part of the beauty of it -- no two people have the exact same stuff. Besides, all of the things that people cry are super expensive or in the crown crates?

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"The community is good and I've had a great time over the years until now. The company literally hates its player base by refusing to listen to feedback on how to make it better, obvious the dev's don't really play themselves or they would know. They shut down any criticism and leave bugs hanging for months if not years and ask you keep spending money. The cash shop is ridiculously over priced and the crate system and gems are as most games, a rort. New dungeons that should be included with new map DLC are sold to you as micro DLC's like a damn EA game. They flat out refuse to fix the PVP content and fix the issues in cyrodiil and server lags. The fact they out right silence criticism tells you all you need to know. I'm sad that this game has gone in this direction of instead of making great content they just add more crap to the cash store when game content is what will bring players back old and new. I've spent a shameful amount of hours in this game since launch so this is not a drive by thought.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'll start by saying this. I have played many MMOs in my days. Some more than others such as Ultima, Runescape, World of Warcraft, FF14...but Elder Scrolls Online, mind you this is in this gamer's opinion, has been the richest, immersing, and positive community driven MMO I have ever played.

-:::The community:::-
The player community of ESO has always been thoughtful, encouraging, and kind. There have only been probably two occurrences of a player being toxic in my 1200+ hours of playing. Even if you're not in a guild and you want to ""Sword Online '' it a bit, players you meet in the game are in one word, Awesome! Want to hear something even more dope? Players will sometimes help you get the gear you need by being on the lookout in rando dungeon runs. I do this myself and just trade the gear without asking for anything in return. Why? Because others did it for me when I started to play. Don't know when it started, but this mindset really is helpful for new players or vet players working up an alt. The forums and redit and great places to go for information and if you want to mention something.

-:::Money Stuffs:::-
First, the base game is $20 (USD) with NO subscription cost required. The base game is loaded with content on it's own. There are free-to-play events that last for about a week or two. During the event, usually the base game is even cheaper. Micro transactions exist and expansions will cost extra, but you don't need to spend an extra dime when you start to play. If you want to get a ESO plus membership...you'll mainly do it for the Crafting Bag! You can pay for one month, farm your behind off, toss it in the bag, and you will still have access to the materials even as a non member. Personally, I don't let my membership drop. I have enjoyed Bethesda games for many, many years and I believe in their mission statement as a company. This is my way of supporting them. In truth, I have spent roughly hundreds in a combination of micros/Xpacs/ESO Prime memberships. If you have a tattoo that says ""No Regrets"", give your tat a double pat, because it is how I feel about the money I have spent.

-:::The gameplay:::-
Ughhh...where to start...
There is so much to do in the game. 1200+ hours and I still have things to do and explore. It's mind blowing! Each zone has unique story lines and quests/daily quests with awesome rewards. There is the main quest, which I recommend before doing anything else. It will get you attuned to the game mechanics, your race/class/weapon types/armor, and learn some awesome lore along the way. The character creation and race/class/weapon/armor combinations are endless. Pick the Race and Class you find that most speaks to you, but let's face it, you'll eventually want to build alts to see what else is awesome!

-Character-
The max level is 50, and more growth with Champion Points after capping. Character creation is just as in depth as any Elder Scrolls game. While questing, sometimes your race or class can trigger a line in NPCs to make it more immersive. Each race and class has their own special abilities and passives. There are the ""End-Game"" builds for grrrr dps, beefy tanking, and poofy Healing, but you can customize your play style for questing and solo-work in your way. Example? Hmmm? Dragon Knight...usually seen as a tanking class using one/two handed weapons with shields while breathing fire, throwing rocks, battle screaming, and jumping into battle like a Barbarian Berserker in DND, but...go ahead...equip a bow or a staff and do those same things and go Ham if you want to. Possibilities are endless for each combination of race, class, weapon and armor types.

-Content-
Bethesda is continuously adding new content and revisiting the game to keep it fresh and fun. They just revamped Champion Points...I haven't delved into the new system enough to make a bias comment, but I can say this; ""HOLY CANNOLI BATMAN"", there is great potential and growth for your character in the new system for PVE and PVP. There is usually a new expansion every year and it is treated like a year-long event with a prologue quest, updates, and things to do that get you ready for what is coming. As with most MMOs, there are also seasonal events like the New Life Festival (my favorite), Jester Festival, Witches Festival, Midyear Mayhem...just to name a few. All have great rewards, quests, and things to do. They add to those rewards each year!

-PVP-
You into PVP? Good, cause I'm not (lol). I can't accurately comment on PVP, because I am mainly a questing player trying to build his own home. That said, I can say this; It's a typical MMO PVP experience with dailies and stuff, but it has quite a few modes to choose from with unique objectives! Wish I could comment more, but maybe once I join a guild, I'll team up with those who can teach me the ways of ESO PVP. I'll edit this when that happens.

-Guilds-
Another area I can't accurately comment on, but what do guilds have in them? People! The Players! Look online about people in their guilds, no matter the game. No matter the size of the guild (and they can get big) they have long lasting friendships built with others they have met. Example I can give is my WoW days. I still talk to my old Guild Master and friend. She is like my Big Sister in a way and we live states apart! The people you meet in your guild could bring you joy. Meet with them and become family! Learn with them! Fight with them! FOR THE HOR...sorry, wrong game...the family aspect still applies though. No matter your race or banner you join, your guild could be that family you were looking for.

-Homes-
Yes, you can buy homes in ESO, just like in previous games. Buying homes makes them account wide, so your alts will be able to go into those same homes. Some players have built their own home. I am currently doing this and it is a massive undertaking, but I am enjoying it! You can even invite other players and guild mates into your home! ""Say What!?"". If that's not cool, then how about this. Your non-combat pets and mounts...you can set paths for them to walk or fly while you are in your house...Awesome! There are so many furniture items to collect and showcase. Get enough of them and you’ll eventually need more than one home to place them in!

-:::Conclusion:::-
I have had so much fun doing it solo, but this solo player is looking for a guild now. Like I said above, Richest, Immersing, and Positive community driven. You have all to gain and only a few hours to lose to download and give it a proper go. There is way too much to say about the game and so much more I want to say about individual aspects. You can download it on PS, Xbox, and PC. Just to be clear, cross-play is not a thing, but PC is where I am at. Come play and have some fun! Go! Go do it! Download! Yeeeesssss!!! Download it!!

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[h1][u][b]In Brief:[/b][/u][/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
+ Huge expansive open world
+ Fully voice acted
+ Builds on the Elder Scrolls universe
+ Active player base

[b]Cons[/b]
- Some dislike the combat (varies per person)
- Issues with server performance, especially with PVP
- Hefty file size

[i]Skip to the bottom for my final thoughts[/i]


[h1][u][b]Breakdown:[/b][/u][/h1]
[h3][b]Introduction[/b][/h3]
With the latest expansion [i]Greymoor[/i] on the horizon, I thought I'd write my review for The Elder Scrolls Online a few months in advance for new players who may be interested in the game currently. It's best to get a head start before the content drops!

[h3][b]Gameplay[/b][/h3]
The Elder Scrolls Online, which I shall refer to as ESO, is a popular open-world MMORPG developed by ZeniMax Online Studios, and allows its players to explore a vast amount of Nirn during an unfamiliar time period in the Elder Scrolls universe.

[i][b]Play as you see fit[/b][/i]
One of the best features of ESO which I highly commend is its easy accessibility to all players. That isn't to say that the game is easy - rather, it doesn't punish new players for mistakes they may make in the early stages of the game. Trust me, I myself made countless mistakes across a few characters before really getting a foothold. The learning curve may be a bit steep, but the early stages aren't absolutely brutal on new players. Feel free to put your character points into whatever you deem fit - you can always respec your points cheaply later on when it really matters.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975511257

I'm not the best person to go to in terms of advice for beginners; there are plenty of in-depth beginner guides that can help you off your feet. But if you like going in blind as I did, know that it's never too late to follow a build. Furthermore, ESO is available to play in two main ways, PVE (player vs environment) and PVP (player vs player). I personally stick to the PVE aspects of the game, notably dungeons, delves and questing. I haven't quite gotten to the raids yet.

Choose your role (Damage Dealer, Tank or Healer), set up your skill bar and prepare for battle. I've heard mixed reviews of ESO's combat system, but I personally have no problems with it and enjoy combat. Furthermore, there are currently six playable classes (four of which are available for free with the base game), ten races (nine of which are available for free with the base game), and thousands of unique viable builds to choose from for your gaming pleasure.

[i][b]Puts the Massive in Massively Multiplayer[/b][/i]
One of my biggest gripes with ESO, that is also simultaneously one of my favourite features of the game, is its ridiculously massive world that is incredibly easy to get lost in. But with great power (huge 3D world with nice models, fully voice-acted characters, etcetera) comes great responsibility - in the form of 100-odd gigabytes on my hard drive. You read that right: over 100 glorious gigabytes of disk usage.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975507520 

On the other hand, ESO is also massively multiplayer in the sense that it is still very much alive. Unfortunately, the game isn't cross-platform, but on NA PC you still see other adventurers *mostly* wherever you go. The community is also *mostly* friendly, with many guilds waiting to welcome you in with open arms. By the way, you can be a member of up to FIVE different guilds, so there's really no excuse not to make some friends.

If you're the type of player who likes playing through content by yourself, don't worry. You're not alone. You can play through the majority of ESO's content, sans high-tier PVE challenges.

[h3][b]Story[/b][/h3]
In my humble opinion, ESO is one of the best MMORPG story content-wise. I used to be the type of player who would skip through dialogue and cutscenes to get straight to the combat. Eventually, though, I started taking the time to listen to the fully voice-acted dialogue. Some quests are certainly better than others, but overall the quests are of good quality. I highly recommend you level your main character through questing rather than grinding. Not only do you get to experience the quest, but you can also get unique rewards and lots of XP.

[h3][b]Audio and Visuals[/b][/h3]
ESO is a great looking game and is again one of the best MMORPGs visual-wise in my opinion. I'll admit, there are definitely some meshes that look better than others (outlier examples), but for the most part, the game looks great. I really enjoy riding on my mount from point-to-point rather than just teleporting. The better rig you have, the better the game looks. The soundtrack is also superb, and as I've mentioned, the dialogue is fully voice acted.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975507736

[h3][b]Value[/b][/h3]
In terms of the base game, which frequently goes on sale, there are hundreds of hours of content available with no other purchases, microtransactions or otherwise. 

[i][b]The Business Model[/b][/i]
On the other hand, there is also a plethora of paid DLCs, expansions, and microtransactions available in ESO's Crown store. The game's premium currency, Crowns, can be traded among players in the form of gifting items in exchange for gold. This is often done through middlemen and can be risky. ZeniMax offers no other form of currency exchange. There also exists a paid membership, ESO Plus, which is not required for the base game, that grants subscribers unlimited access to all DLC (excluding new expansions), a number of crowns and other benefits.

Again, the aforementioned microtransactions are not at all necessary for hundreds of hours of enjoyment, but I myself have made purchases on the Crown store and am currently an active ESO+ subscriber.

[h3][b]Bugs/Issues[/b][/h3]
In the actual game itself, you don't run into issues all too often. I experience the occasional crash, but this may not necessarily be due to ESO. Regarding server performance, however, much of the community have raised complaints about the poor performance of the games servers and matchmaking capabilities specifically. This problem mostly applies to those interested in PVP, however, problems do exist with the Dungeon Finder (hit-or-miss queue times).

In general PVE play, especially if you're sticking with the overworld content, you shouldn't experience many problems. If necessary, restart your game every few hours to keep the memory usage low.

[h3][b]Performance[/b][/h3]
My computer (see below) has no problems running ESO at high settings, however, I acknowledge that for lower-end rigs you may encounter difficulty in running the game. Make sure to check the minimum specifications, and if your PC has equivalent or better parts. The in-game settings menu allows you to customize the graphics settings to suit your needs.

CPU: i7-8750
GPU: GTX 1060
RAM: 16GB DDR4

[h1][b][u]In Closing:[/u][/b][/h1]
[i][b]Greymoor is coming.[/b][/i]
The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited is one of the best MMORPGs currently available on Steam. Play how you want in the game's expansive world, against other players or enemies, and prepare yourself for the Dark Heart of Skyrim.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"first, please pardon me for the grammar error
second, i played this game about 40+ hours now, and just only get lvl 20, so i don't really have any experience with the  end-game content yet, but i'll talk about negative and positive side of this game that i experience through out my journey

positive side :
1. storyline and storytelling system
for an MMORPG, this game got really good storyline, zenimax not only concentrate on the main-quest storyline, but also on the side quest, about 90% of the side quest i've done got really great dialogue and very interesting story, most of them always revolve around TES series lore, which is really interesting by itself

and so far 100% of all quest i done are voice acted, it adding the immersive-ness of the game, and help the player with ""tl;dr"" problem 

2.Quest system
as i said, questing here really fun, not feels much like a chore because of the story they offer

and also this game give you multiple choice in some side quest, which will effect you gameplay and the outcome of the quest, its quite rare to find this kind of feature in other MMO

3.Job System
you practically can be whatever you want, wanna be a tank-mage? you can, or a warmage?, you can of course, every job can access all weapons and armor, so you can customize your character whatever you want what will suit your gameplay

4.Skill System
if you ever played GW2, skill system here rather similar BUT much more interesting and complex, because you got a lot of skill to upgrade, and you can choose whatever skill you want, theres your basic job skills, racial skills, world skills, weapon skills etc, and when 1 skill already achieve max level, some of them you can transform it into much more powerfull version of it, create your own skill combo

5.World Design
indeed probably the world design not as detail/as beautifull like other MMORPG especially P2P MMORPG like FF14, but it fit the theme really well, theres variations in each area and faction which fit the lore and add make the game much more immersive, i find my self waste hourse just for exploring the world :))

6.Gameplay
well imagine skyrim/TES series with classic MMORPG skill, thats practically what you get, it's fun, at first probably need a little bit adaptation, but when you get hang of it, its fun even though probably not as fast paced as you imagine, but TES series never been a fast paced action RPG genre

7. Economy system
now, this part that i really like, there is no public auction whatsoever, you can trade/get some kind of auction, but only through a guild, thus in this game you could join up to 5 guilds

with this system, you can cross trading between guilds, looking for best price to buy and sell on each region, really reminds me of XIAN online type of economy, dynamic controlled by player

now, let switch to the negative side of the game :

1. the soundtrack
IMHO, theres no single memorable soundtrack in this game, in FF14 i always remember which soundtrack belong to which area, but here....every music feels the same, theres like no identity at all for each music.

2. the character creation
the character creation too shallow imho, theres no clear different between each slide bar for every part of the character body, thus i can't made the character i really want even though i waste 30-50 minutes creating it


tl;dr -> The Elder Scrolls Online : It sucks no more, highly reccomended for everyone :)","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",please pardon grammar error 40 hour lvl 20 talk negative positive side journey positive side 1 storyline storytelling mmorpg good storyline zenimax not_only concentrate storyline side 90 side great dialogue interesting revolve te series lore interesting far 100 voice acted adding immersive ness help tl dr problem 2 questing fun not_feels chore offer multiple choice side effect outcome rare kind massively multiplayer online 3 practically whatever wan na tank mage warmage course access weapon armor customize whatever suit 4 skill gw2 skill rather similar interesting complex skill upgrade choose whatever skill there basic skill racial skill world skill weapon skill 1 skill already achieve max transform powerfull version create skill combo 5 world design indeed probably world design not_as detail beautifull mmorpg especially p2p mmorpg ff14 fit the_emphasizedme there variation faction fit lore add immersive self waste hourse exploring world 6 imagine skyrim te series classic mmorpg skill thats practically fun probably bit adaptation hang it_emphasizeds fun probably not_as fast paced imagine te series never_been fast paced action role genre 7 economy no_public auction whatsoever trade kind auction guild join 5 guild cross trading guild best price region reminds xian online type economy dynamic controlled switch negative side 1 soundtrack imho there no_single memorable soundtrack ff14 remember soundtrack belong music feel there no_identity music 2 creation creation shallow imho there no_clear different slide bar body waste 30 50 minute creating tl dr elder scroll online suck no_more highly reccomended
306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I love this game, but I think it's time that I air my grievances.
As you can see, I have spent quite a lot of time in ESO. I have probably played ESO more then any of its developers, and all we as a community ask from them is that they listen and understand our problems. So, that's why I am writing this rant as a means of informing the devs. However, any ESO dev has probably already stopped reading and decided to play a match of Tales of Tribute, or, as I call it, a waste of time. Speaking of Tales of Tribute, to even play that, you need too pay for it, so let us discuss...

Now, if my math is correct (which it probably isn't), buying all of the DLC's at launch, and not counting limited time free events, you will have spent around $690. Some will argue that you can just buy the monthly subscription, but why is it that games such as Wow and Warframe can give away their new and old content for free? Sure, ESO DLC's have one major quality that others lack which likely contributes to the price, full voice acting, however, they use the old Bethesda trick of hiring the same actors to voice countless NPC's but, whatever I guess...
I'm not asking for everything to be given away for free, I am quite literally asking for scraps that are several years old. You can however, purchase things from the crown store with gold. This is done via in-game gifting. So, you would send a player gold, and in return they will spend their crowns to gift you the crown store item that you want. This is not without its problems, with the biggest obviously being scams, but, getting DLCs this way is fine... I guess. However, if you do get scammed, you will have to contact support, and speaking of support...


2: Zenimax as Developers and as support:
While I do somewhat respect @Bethesda_Kraken for responding to reviews, I personally think that no response, is better than a copy/paste generic response. Anyway, let me walk you through communication between the players and Zenimax, in my own experience.

Experience 1:
1: Ignore the steam forums.
2: Several players post a bug/problem, in my case, a bug regarding a lead.
3: Players say that the lead is not dropping and that it is probably bugged.
4: Zenimax says that it is not bugged, and that it is very unlikely that something like this would be bugged.
5: Time passes.
6: Zenimax says that it has been bugged, and that they will work on a fix.
The fact that this has happened several times is hilarious.

Experience 2:
1: Players ask for something meaningful to be added or fixed.
2: Zenimax releases an archeology/antiquity minigame.
3: Players once again ask for something meaningful to be added or fixed.
4: Zenimax releases a card minigame.
5: Players complain.
6: Forum thread locked/deleted.

This game has come a long way in 9 years, and I don't want it to fail or get worse, but for many like myself, we play this game because we like the world of the Elder Scrolls. So when the Elder Scrolls 6 is released, why should I stick around and play this? When I compare this to something such as Warframe or Destiny 2, which also had rocky starts and have changed dramatically over time, I can't help but feel disappointed and cheated. Both of those games are free with zero subscriptions. and yet I feel that they are less predatory than ESO. Anyway, I will continue to update and change this review over time, thanks for reading.

It's all so tiresome...

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I don't know where to start with this review but I want to say that this has been a game I keep coming back to and now currently play as my main MMO. I picked it up between the Legion and BFA expansions of WoW as a game to kinda dip my toes into. Now it's my main MMO and I'm in love with this game and all aspects of it. Well...most aspects, not all

The combat feels deep and rewarding with a plethora of ways to handle building your character. You can try all types of creative and fun builds without the worry of being a parse monkey (unless you're going for the highest level of progression). The only bad part is the fact abilities sometimes fail to fire off which can be frustrating. Pls fix the bugs, ZoS.
The open world is the best of any MMORPG with how the game utilizes its world. All quests are voice acting, all NPC's are voiced. The questlines in the game are amazing.

I love the PvP even if it can be frustrating in its performance lately. But there's no game that feels quite like this one. Most people write off PvP because the skill gap and don't know why they are dying. But I promise if you take the time to learn the fundamentals and mechanics of it, you might fall in love as well.

Dungeons: Best dungeons of any MMO hands down. Maybe not the base game stuff, but the DLC dungeons on veteran and vet hard mode are incredible.

Trials/Raids: The only part of the game I can't speak to the quality of because I don't have the patience to be on a raid team. I enjoy the dungeons and the pvp and that's enough for me.

Arenas: Amazing solo and group arenas exist with tons of awesome rewards and weapons

Character building: This game is a true RPG in how you kit out your character and play specific builds. You'll find out when you play

The bad: Crown store. Stay so far from it, it is predatory to new players and half the stuff on it shouldn't be on it. Even worse, the crown crates rely on FOMO to get you to buy them. Please do not buy them. I am a hypocrite for saying this because I've bought them, but I'm the exact player they're preying on it with. I know I shouldn't buy them yet I do.

ESO Plus is also pushed on you pretty hard as a new player because you won't have a craft bag and won't have access to any of the DLC content. Fear not new players. When starting the game. DO NOT pick up crafting materials while on non-sub account. Instead, use the time to put items on research because you can't even really use those materials unless you have things researched. So research while exploring the game and playing at your own pace. Craft later

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Your expectation of The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™ should first and foremost be that of an MMO, not an Elder Scrolls game. While the game does have the lore and basic 'dumbed down' aesthetic of The Elder Scrolls it lacks the atmosphere. What I mean is it does not draw you into the lore and entice you as does it's single player cousins. Rather, you find yourself mindlessly fighting through zone to zone, quest to quest, dungeon to dungeon with no genuine interest in its lore or atmosphere. This is a hugely common trait to an MMO and not something the Elder Scrolls is known for bringing.

That being said it's by no means a bad game or MMO. In fact, it's outstanding. The combat loosely resembles The Elder Scrolls and has a fairly decent spectrum of play styles between the classes. PVP in ESO is a breath of fresh air but can soon become stale and has a hugely disadvantages experience curve in the start.

To summarize, you'll find yourself trying to delve in and love this game as you would the world of The Elder Scrolls. However, you should not add this to your library simple because it wears The Elders Scrolls 'cloak' as you may be disappointed. As an MMO, it's fantastic and fairly unboring but does leave much to be desired despite its large amount of content. 

If you are looking for a good MMO that wears The Elder Scrolls aesthetic and features a few new treats to the MMO scene then this may be the game for you. If you are looking for a multiplayer skyrim then you will be sorely disappointed.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Review after a long long play time

As you can see i am pretty busy trying to complete the Game with all its content. After 2k + hrs. i think i am able to do a Review.

Yes i played other Es Games. I started with Skyrim as it came out, i loved it. i also tryed Oblivion after that and the last game before i  went to Eso was Morrowind. All games have 1 in common. the Absolut freedom from the very beginning. After you finished the Prologue you will be gently released into a huge open world Area. The ammount of quests you can find in eso is absurd. Its things like "" Bringe me this Staff or kill that Monster "" But there are also Mainquest lines in every Map you can explore ( yes the maps are connected to eachother and you can travel them even by foot. ) These quests can get very long. maby you need 1 or 2 days to complete them. 2 lvl systems are ingame. once you hit lvl 50 you start over with the so called cp system ( Campion Points ) its similar to the skyrim skilltrees from the look. the cp point system gets up to cp lvl 690 right now. every point is a powerfull passive you can connect to eachother to build your own char as you like. Want a Tank who can heal just with 1 weapon bar swap ? go for it. Ant there comes the point where all gets much more interesting. The endgame: I have never played a Game with so much Endgame content as eso. once you hit cp 160 ( which is max gear lvl ) you can start to build up your own Warrior. There are many sets. 5 pice sets, 3 pice stes 2 pices and even 1 pice sets. all of these Items can be combined as you wish, to experiment and build up. Some sets can be crafted, others need to be found. The grinding aspect isnt that bad in eso. There was a update , not long ago. now we all can transmute the Traits from all our weapons and Armor as we like. No more farming 1 dungeon 100 times because the dagger you want just dropps in training. Some dungeons can be extremly brutal, even with a good groupe. ( up to 12 man raids ) 80 % of the game can be beaten very easy, but if you wana min max and bring out the best in your char you have to face greate evil.

The next thing i wana talk about is the pvp system. Everyone hwo played Oblivion will know the place very well. Huge battles are going on in Cyrodiil for the fight of the Emperor title. 3 Allianz Teams build a triangle in the map ( wich is abnormal huge for pvp. so train your horse in speed ) the main goal is to dominate arrount the Imperial city. capure as many castles as you can and hold them. This can be buggy to a point where you are not able to play the game . loading screens of death ( unending loading screen ) if a fight between 200 + players breakes out the fps dropps so low you cant even attack... well thats really a - Point in my opinion. But there are other fine Options where you can battle other players. the imperial city itselfe is a battleground and is very stable. the whole city has a huge dungeon system blow the ground where you can battle too. Battlegrounds ar a new form of 4v4v4 Battles. Normal modes like deathmatches, capture the flag and so on can be played here. A very interesting point is the fighting mecanics. rolldoge, block and weapon swaps in the fights allow you for offensive and deffensive manouver at the same time. even animation cnceling is possible, which allowes good players to nearly double the dps or hot you can dish out. Shure there is and will always be a meta, but it changes and after a while you will know that in eso skill matters. its not just the sets and weapons that makes a good fighter. it takes months to really handle a 2h sword the right way. 

the marked system is a whole dimension in itselfe. there are hundreds of traiding Guilds ingame. every guild can hold up to 500 players i think or 600.  you can have 5 guilds at the same time in evry guild you have 30 slots for selling your stuff. some people play the game just because of the marked. ( Master merchant addon is a must have for traiding )

The community is very nice and friendly. no pay to win at all. the whole real money store stuff is just for the looks.
eso + is another thing. i dont think you need it but it is very awesome. you have no storage problems at all and you can travel to dlcs you dont have in your game. there is a festival once every year where you can try out eso + for free. a whole week. try it first for free and if you cant be without it just do it then.

All in all i wnat to say this game has a huge potential and it uses it the right way. shure the game has bugs, lots of them, but its nothing else like skyrim or oblivion. if you can handle the bugs from the older games you can handle the bugs from eso too. nothing that whould spoil your fun. Lots of content as i said before and much to come in the next time.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I have played this game for the past 3 years and would not recommend it. I would like to start with the positive aspects first.

[h1] Pros	[/h1]

[list]
    [*]ESO has great graphics for an MMO, and the environments look amazing. Its possible to use Reshades to make the game look even better to look at. The cities are really big and its possible to visit most the interiors of most buildings.

    [*]The world feels very alive as there are players everywhere, in every zone even the most outdated ones. It makes it easy to find people to do activities such as world bosses.

    [*]In game community is often helpful, lots of people have helped me out when I was new, but the endgame community can be toxic.
     
    [*]The dungeons are fun and have some cool mechanics. They each have a story in them and also each dungeon is unique and the bosses are quite challenging. I had a lot of fun playing them with friends.
[/list]

[h1] Neutral	[/h1]

[list]
    [*]The story and questing is one of the biggest aspects of ESO, and I have mixed feelings about it. Some of the zones have really interesting and engaging story lines, such as Grahtwood and Orsinium, but I found most of it boring. The main story quests of most zones are ok doing it once but it lacks replay value since there are no actual choices you can make that affects the story to a large degree. Most of the choices left to the player are really small and they mostly show up in side quests. I don't like the side quests most of the time because its often about helping someone who really doesn't have any proper background and isn't interesting, and the quest bosses are highly repetitive and too easy to kill.

    [*]The soundtrack is good I guess but I feel that the best tracks are remastered from the previous Elder Scrolls games. I found  the combat music to be pretty annoying.
[/list]

[h1] Cons	[/h1]
[list]
    [*]I found the combat to be awful, mainly because of animation canceling as well as the combat feeling floaty. So the animation canceling is when you can perform a light attack between abilities. All skills have a one second GCD, but light attacks are on a different timer, which causes this issue. Animation canceling increases DPS by a lot and its essential in endgame content. It requires a significant amount of skill to perform correctly, but it just isn't any fun. What's more is that it makes the character look like they're having a seizure, and it clearly isn't an intended feature. The game makes no mention of this anywhere, but if someone wants to do any endgame content they need to be able to do it, as otherwise most guilds will not consider them.

        Another issue is the champion system, its meant to be the endgame progression system. There are 810 points to obtain in total, and they are obtained by just gaining exp. But the system is boring and it just offers something like +1% damage or +1% magicka recovery and stuff like that. There are no class new abilities added with this system and it isn't really fun for endgame progression.

    [*]Classes feel too similar to each other. ESO has 6 classes, but there exists two variations of each class, magicka and stamina. The stamina version wan't intended by the developers(I think) because there currently is stamina sorcerer and stamina necromancer which don't make much sense. But due to the way abilities work it was found that stacking stamina in builds results in being able to do good dps as well. The problem is that every single class has the same types of abilities, just with different colors and effects. Every class has a similar ground based DOT, one spammable, one buff which grants increased damage, one defense ability which boosts armor and so on. When performing dps rotations, every class plays almost the same due to this. But some classes are tweaked every patch which keeps shifting the meta, so one needs to have every dps class available.

    [*]PVP is too laggy and not fun or balanced. The PVP in this game was intended to be a major aspect, however these days it seems to be neglected. The game was supposed to support 200 vs 200 battles, but even with 20 people on the screen it starts to lag and sometimes gets disconnected. FPS also drops, however the game doesn't use a lot of system resources either. Its also unpredictable to tell what enemy players are casting because of the combination of animation canceling and lag. The PVP isn't balanced in the sense that sometimes one faction has way less players than the other one. Also some classes are just better in every way than other classes, and some sets are overpowered.

    [*]Endgame trials(raids) are also laggy, and the trial design is bad in my opinion. There are only three or four bosses in each one of them, and there is too little trash mobs in between bosses. Bosses have some interesting mechanics but it just isn't very fun due to the poor combat, lag and low fps. Trials also don't drop very powerful gear which is worth chasing after or any cool cosmetics.

     [*] Too much focus on crown store. The game is very hard to play without the monthly subscription as inventory space is highly limited. Even after subscribing, too many things are pay walled, such as mounts, pets and housing. The monthly crowns which are provided are so little that its possible to only buy a pet or a costume. The game has 95% of mounts pay walled with no other way to get them. The better mounts are kept in the loot crates which use another currency system called crown gems, and the coolest mounts are called as radiant apex rewards which cannot be obtained with even crown gems and must be gambled for. Housing in this game is really fun and its possible to make all sorts of structures, but its so ridiculously overpriced, the best houses are crowns only, and even then the best furniture is sold exclusively through the crown store.

        The problem with this is that there is very little incentive to play through the game and collect stuff. And now even skill lines and skill points will be sold through the crown store. Skill lines are an important part of the game because they have important passives which are needed in more difficult content, but they are grindy and boring to level up. It literally takes a 100 hours to grind all the skill lines such as mages guild, undaunted, psijic order and to collect every skyshard to unlock all the abilities on one character. Many players have asked for it to be account wide, but in the end the solution is sold through the crown store. So the crown store isn't limited to cosmetics only, there are game play impacting items as well. I would call it pay 4 the convenience 2 win or something like that( p4c2w :)).
[/list]

I wouldn't recommend this game due to these reasons, as the game is slowly being designed with only the cash shop in mind. I've spent a lot of time and money on this game and I regret it a lot. I mainly maxed out my all of my characters skill lines and skyshards, as well as spent many hundreds of hours becoming a master crafter. Almost everything is available for purchase through the crown store these days, its so bad that its possible to become a master crafter in just a couple of minutes with the crown store. I would only advise this game for TES fans who may be interested in playing the story casually, because as an MMO its just not that good for the amount of time and money that it asks.","Very Positive83% of the 117,983 user reviews for this game are positive.",past 3 year not_recommend positive aspect pro eso great graphic massively multiplayer online environment look amazing possible reshades look look city big possible visit interior building world feel alive player everywhere zone outdated one make easy activity world boss community helpful lot helped endgame community toxic dungeon fun cool mechanic dungeon unique boss challenging fun friend neutral questing biggest aspect eso mixed feeling zone interesting engaging line grahtwood orsinium found boring quest zone ok lack replay value no_actual choice affect large degree choice left small mostly side quest side quest helping someone proper background interesting boss highly repetitive easy kill soundtrack good guess best track remastered previous elder scroll game found combat music pretty annoying con found combat awful mainly animation canceling combat feeling floaty animation canceling perform light attack ability skill gcd light attack different timer cause issue animation canceling increase dp essential endgame requires significant skill perform correctly fun make look seizure clearly intended make no_mention anywhere someone want endgame able otherwise guild not_consider issue champion meant endgame progression 810 point obtain total obtained gaining exp boring offer 1 damage 1 magicka recovery stuff no_class ability fun endgame progression class similar eso 6 class exists variation class magicka stamen stamen version wan intended developer currently stamen sorcerer stamen necromancer sense due ability found stacking stamen build result able good dp problem single class type ability different color effect class similar ground based dot spammable buff grant increased damage defense boost armor performing dp rotation class play due class tweaked patch keep shifting meta need dp class available pvp laggy not_fun balanced pvp intended major aspect day neglected supposed support 200 v 200 battle 20 screen start lag get disconnected shooter drop resource unpredictable tell enemy player casting combination animation canceling lag pvp balanced sense faction player class class set overpowered endgame trial raid laggy trial design bad opinion three four boss trash mob bosses_emphasized interesting mechanic fun due poor combat lag low shooter trial drop powerful gear worth chasing cool cosmetic focus crown store hard monthly subscription inventory space highly limited subscribing thing pay walled mount pet housing monthly crown provided possible pet costume 95 mount pay walled no_other mount loot crate currency called crown gem coolest mount called radiant apex reward cannot_be obtained crown gem gambled housing fun possible sort structure ridiculously overpriced best house crown best furniture sold exclusively crown store problem incentive collect stuff skill line skill point sold crown store skill line important important passive needed difficult grindy boring literally take 100 hour grind skill line mages guild undaunted psijic order collect skyshard unlock ability on_emphasizede player asked wide solution sold crown store crown store limited cosmetic impacting item call pay 4 convenience 2 win p4c2w recommend due reason slowly designed cash shop mind spent regret mainly maxed character skill line skyshards spent hundred hour master crafter available purchase crown store day bad possible master crafter couple minute crown store advise te fan interested casually massively multiplayer online not_that good asks

1449850,Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"[h1]A very real review from a Yu-Gi-Oh! vet and ive played since 99 for reference.[/h1]

Listen ill be blunt, dont come to this game if you thought it was gonna be anything like those old gameboy games we once played with updated graphics and pretty animations. The game as is has lot of balance issues and has a lot of things that need to be added, but its not rushed in any way or form and you can tell they have spent a lot of time polishing things to look great and feel as smooth as possible on launch. That being said it can be smoother and it can be tweaked to fit the current player base. But for the vets that wanted an old school game this isnt for you...YET!

This game can honestly be their next longevity game but they have to add some things and help balance the game so meta decks dont run rampant and people are not compelled to go to the other community based ones. that list is as followed and please add things as you feel needed that way we can hopefully get this the attention it needs and people can see a real review and Konami can see some things that will greatly improve there game!

1. Timer needs to be much lower to force people to play there combos faster and know there cards better and ultimately streamline the game, you either know what you are doing and do it quickly or suffer because you sat there for 3 minutes doing absolutely nothing but trying to read your own card. My suggestion is 2-3 minutes per turn which is more than enough time to get your combos out, and with each successful card use it adds 2 seconds which may not sound like a lot but after 10 cards its 20 seconds and can help stabilize longer combos.

2. implement 3 other modes outside of ranked mode ,Casuals, Ranked gen 1, and ranked gen 2. Casuals needs no explanation , so for ranked gen one its a ranked mode for all people who wish to test there might against all other who use only cards that involve ritual and fusion cards, nothing past that, no synchro no XYZ nothing, now that doesnt mean they cant use cards like the new blue-eyes max and such but it means they have to fine tune the deck to be more inline with literally just fusion and ritual monsters at their core. and rank two is the same thing but it goes all they way up to synchro and XYZ summoning and doesnt include pendulum and link,thus creating a more 5Ds era of ranked and dueling. By doing this it opens up to a more wide range of players and people can compete without feeling power crept by all the new gen cards and it can even bring in old school people who know how to make a ruthless toon deck.

3. A few more ways to earn more in game gems even if it takes a bit longer, also a way to unlock secret packs permanently. for this i believe for more in game gems maybe have weekly missions that people can do throughout the week that give them 1k gems for a 10 pack draw a week, not to much but atleast something to look forward too. now as far as secret packs i believe that once you get 1 of every copy of the featured card on the secret pack list maybe it should be opened permanently or for every 1 time they get every featured card on secret pack maybe its time is extended exactly one week, because at that pint all they need is maybe a couple of copies and if they have a weekly mission that gives them 10 pulls that will literally be there time frame (hopefully that makes sense).

4. A Banlist please... good lord having three copies of maxx C is insane and man is that hilarious, i crafted exactly one copy because i know its gonna be limited, but please make an updated banlist and limited list.

5. Community engagement, you guys have a chance to make this one of the best games Yu-Gi-Oh! has seen since duelist of roses( dang im getting old) and that can easily be done so long as you listen to the community and watch for the trolls and dont cater to the top 1% and streamers, please understand i dont hate streamers and the 1% because ultimately they help grow the player base, but when you cater to them the game literally slowly but surely dies off and thats when things get to being unbalanced and none new player friendly.

There are more issues but those are the ones off the top of my head and hopefully the community here will add some that they feel is important and i will edit this and add them as i see fit. these next issues are something that can be added for QOL and just to help maybe a few people.

6. More animations for boss monsters I.E special attacks and effects for their cards. For example if someone summons blue eyes and they attack it could have its own special attack animation, along with certain spell cards and popular cards having really unique animations to bring the game to life in a new way. like if Halberd Cannon uses its effect you literally get a small animation of him using it etc.

7. Some deck features that could be nice like a few more cards sleeves,  a few more search functions and maybe a few more deck slots.

8. More in-depth tutorial. Newer players might not skip the tutorial but they also dont get a lot from this one, having a more in-depth one that actually teaches them the ins and outs for cards and uses could improve the longevity of this game.

Now this issues is a specific one for those that do like to spend money and dont mind uses mommies credit card.

9. You guys seriously need much better gem prices and i mean way better, look at what happen to halo with there prices when they were not good, they had to go back, apologize and revamp half their store, it was crazy. soon you guys will definitely hear the backlash of your gem prices i can assure you that because 25 bucks is 1 10 pack pull and thats insane i would argue that every 16-17 bucks is about 10 packs thus thats like a 7 dollar difference per 10 packs which is 35% i believe. Now while i understand that its new and the game hasnt had any balancing and such and basing things off 10 pack purchase isnt always wise this is again for those whom wish to spend money and after ding math and looking at TCG and OCG card box prices which this should be based off of because its virtual and there are other cosmetics and such people will want to spend money on, its wise to slightly lower the price of gems to help people who do want to spend money and not have them feel ripped off, the happier they feel the more they want to spend Just saying.

10. Cosmetics, Yes i know the game just released and they have some cosmetics and such this is just saying that adding more will definitely be a good idea and i believe the price for them is spot on, maybe even a bit cheap but again i digress it a great thing, please add more and maybe even have community votes and such on what can be added.

11. Add in character mates. Joey wheeler or Jaden as my mate sounds freaking amazing and i believe they should be 800-1k gems over the other mates and have a few more animations and should have special animations when summoning cards they either used or know bringing the game to life once again in a unique way.


If you have made it this far i thank you and hope that you will add what you believe the game needs to help balance it and give it more life for both the community sake and the game sake.","Mostly Positive75% of the 69,676 user reviews for this game are positive.",real yu gi oh vet ive 99 reference listen ill blunt dont thought gon na old gameboy game updated graphic pretty animation balance issue thing not_rushed form tell spent polishing thing look great smooth possible launch smoother tweaked fit base vet wanted old school isnt honestly next longevity add thing help balance meta deck dont rampant not_compelled community based one followed please add thing needed hopefully attention need real konami thing greatly improve 1 timer need lower force combo faster card ultimately streamline quickly suffer sat 3 minute trying read card suggestion 2 3 minute per turn combo successful card add 2 second not_sound 10 card 20 second help stabilize longer combo 2 implement 3 mode outside ranked mode casuals ranked gen 1 ranked gen 2 casuals need no_explanation ranked gen ranked mode wish test card involve ritual fusion card past no_synchro no_xyz doesnt cant card blue eye max mean fine tune deck inline literally fusion ritual monster core rank go synchro xyz summoning doesnt include pendulum link creating 5ds era ranked dueling open wide range player compete feeling power crept gen card bring old school ruthless toon deck 3 way earn gem take bit longer unlock secret pack permanently believe gem maybe weekly mission throughout week 1k gem 10 pack draw week not_to atleast look forward far secret pack believe 1 copy featured card secret pack maybe opened permanently 1 featured card secret pack maybe extended exactly week pint maybe couple copy weekly mission give 10 pull literally frame hopefully make sense 4 banlist please good lord three copy maxx c insane man hilarious crafted exactly copy gon na limited please updated banlist limited 5 community engagement guy chance best game yu gi oh duelist rose dang im old easily long listen community watch troll dont cater top 1 streamer please understand dont hate streamer 1 ultimately help grow base cater literally slowly surely dy thats thing unbalanced friendly issue one top head hopefully community add important add fit next issue qol help maybe 6 animation bos monster e special attack effect card example someone summons blue eye attack special attack animation along certain spell card popular card unique animation bring life halberd cannon us effect literally small animation 7 deck feature nice card sleeve search function maybe deck slot 8 depth tutorial newer player not_skip tutorial dont depth teach in out card us improve longevity issue specific spend dont mind us mommy credit card 9 guy seriously gem price look happen halo price not_good apologize revamp half store crazy soon guy definitely hear backlash gem price assure 25 buck 1_emphasized0 pack pull thats insane argue 16 17 buck 10 pack thats 7 dollar difference per 10 pack 35 believe understand hasnt balancing basing thing 10 pack purchase isnt wise wish spend ding math tcg ocg card box price based virtual cosmetic spend wise slightly lower price gem help spend not_have ripped happier spend saying 10 cosmetic yes released cosmetic saying adding definitely good idea believe price spot maybe bit cheap digress great please add maybe community vote 11 add mate joey wheeler jaden mate sound freaking amazing believe 800 1k gem mate animation special animation summoning card bringing life unique far thank hope add believe need help balance life community sake sake

1449850,Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"I love playing Yugioh
I love the way master duel is designed visually
I love the fact there's a solo mode so you don't have to duel players
I love that the solo mode starts with an in depth tutorial, that taught even a complete newbie who hasn't even seen the anime how to play the game enough for them to make a functioning Toon deck and start enjoying the card game I'm so passionate about.

But unfortunately, it's designed that you SHOULD duel players, that's what Yugioh is for, and that's really the only way to get more stuff anyway, and it SHOULDN'T be a problem in a well designed online card game with skill-based match-making
But god, I just want to rip my hair out, every single time I play this game, 224 hours in, and I think I've lost more hairs to pulling them out in frustration than I have to accidentally getting my hair caught in a blender.
In fact, the feeling of having your hair put into a blender is more enjoyable than this.

The biggest issue, the ranking system is pointless, there's 6 rankings, beginner, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, and master. And of those, once you start really playing, there's only 3, platinum, diamond, and master. Because you can't drop below platinum, so there's physically no point to the others.
I play decks that I find fun, decks that aren't necessarily meta, because this is an easily accessible game, and, if you ignore the micro-transactions, you can get decks you want to play in a day or two of playing early on, but over a week or so once you get past the early stages where they give you gems like Halloween candy.
But with the way the ranking system works, I should be down in bronze or silver, but I'm up in diamond, I'm fighting the same floodgates, spright, tearlaments, synchro negate spams, mass interaction, and FTKs that everyone is fighting, but because I'm using a deck I enjoy, rather than a deck that's meant to counter the meta or is the meta, I'm losing 80%-ish of my games, and several of those wins are my opponent losing connection, or misplaying before I've had a turn and then surrendering, or just doing it because their hand wasn't good enough. I'm not fighting the decks more my level, I'm David fighting Goliath, and I have to hard draw into my sling or I just get ass blasted like my opponent has some deep-seeded rage against someone trying to have fun, or get lucky and hope that Goliath just walks away and goes home.

The banlist is also very problematic, and, CONSTANTLY is too. One deck doing too good for a month? Fine, we'll hit like, two cards, and then release a new deck which causes even more problems and not get around to fixing it until two months later when everyone has spent money to get the deck in order to have a chance to compete.
Tearlaments are a perfect example of this, practically unlimited, full power Tearlaments, for nearly 3 months, all the tear cards, all the Ishizu's, all at 3, if you wanted to stand a lick of a chance, you either hard drew Dimension Shifter in your opening hand, or hoped they drew 3 Crymes and 2 Sulieks. It was practically impossible to beat with anything other than a lucky opening hand, or a better opening hand going first in a mirror match, and once Konami was absolutely certain everyone was tired of Tearlaments, and/or had paid top dollar to get a full functioning Tearlaments deck, they hit them with a ton of limits, so you had to dismantle all those extra copies of cards you got with no benefits. And sure they're still seeing top competitive play, because they hit a lot of cards, buuut, they didn't hit enough, Kitkalos is still around, all of the Ishizu's but one are at one, and the one that ISN'T is the strongest one at 2, etc etc. But they aren't the only problematic cards in need of bans or having had too much time unbanned
MAXX ""C"" IS AT 3
It took them far too long to ban Cyber Stein, who was a CONSISTENT FTK ENABLER though all that time. And other problem cards, like Sales Ban Rhongominiad, are also everywhere up in higher tiers, because they thought it was a good idea to ban the enabler and not the problem, when nobody wants to use the problem, but many people would like to use the enabler, for other things. Sure it's a double standard, ban Cyber Stein the Enabler, but don't ban Gossip Shadow the Enabler, but when you look at it case by case WHICH KONAMI SHOULD BE, it's pretty clear why.
MAXX ""C"" IS AT 3
There are tons of Decks that can still semi-consistently pull of FTKs, and even a 50% chance to win the game with no way your opponent can stop it is stupid, because if you flip a coin 100 times, gaining two points for each heads, and losing one point for each tails is still a profitable chance! And if you surrender, your rank doesn't go down, meaning these FTK decks just flip that coin until they get Heads, and leave every time they don't, like it never happened.
MAXX ""C"" IS AT 3

Something DESPERATELY needs to be done about the ranking system, and make a better way to punish and reward players. If a player Surrenders, make them lose points, if they surrender too many duels in a short time span, punish them with a time-out, make it so when you go up a rank, you can still fall back down to the rank below it, so you don't end up in platinum on a fluke and win one of every 20 games while permanently stuck there, not getting the chance to do dailies because you just end up dying before you get a chance to play. Ban cards that only see play in decks that are designed to lose the game so they can drop ranks. Just do SOMETHING. Because ALL they've done, is add a new rank, because players were complaining that the ranks didn't go high enough, and then LIMIT the ranks you can drop to by another one, effectively making the whole thing redundant, there's still 3 ranks- all you've done is make more room for players who play the game twice a month to not end up with ALL of the tryhard sweats that make the game unfun.
Yes, a lot of this is me complaining about me not playing the better decks and saying the meta is OP, I get it, it looks like a 'git gud'-able moment, or a 'skill issue', but that's just part of it. I shouldn't have to ignore 95% of the cards in the whole GAME to be able to play it and enjoy it. I shouldn't HAVE to sit through turns that take 10+ minutes of summoning, connection delay, summoning, connection delay, summoning, connection delay- just to start my turn, draw a card that doesn't help me, and then surrender, wasting all that time. This is supposed to be fun, I want to play a deck I want to play, say some goofy ah summoning chants to myself whenever I bring out my boss monster, and win/lose games 50/50 with people around my deck's strength level.

Until these issues are fixed, I think it's safe to say, the 224 hours I've spent playing this game have been completely worthless.
Unless you're a hyper-competitive Yugioh player who doesn't have the money for IRL decks, or a complete beginner who's only here for the tutorials, this game is a complete waste of time, and brain cells.

If you're going to play Master Duel, just know you're not in for a fun time, unless you're willing to constantly keep up with the meta, abandoning what's fun, to play what's good. And hey, if that's how you enjoy your time, using the best possible set ups to ruin others' days, I say go for it.
But please, please don't drop ranks to screw over people trying to have fun with your meta, Master Duel is the ideal game for beginners and casuals alike, cool animations, semi-auto functions and understanding of problem-solving card-text that makes things function as intended. And the only way it can be kept like that is if people stop ruining the game for others.

I REALLY want to keep going, cause there's so much more I want to address, but my head hurts already.


TL;DR: Master Duel isn't worth your time unless you're playing it for the Tutorials, or are playing Hyper-Competitive.

1449850,Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"[h1] 8/10 [/h1]
[h1] As a Duel Links former player and a fan of the Yu-Gi-Oh card game, I came to the following conclusion after a brief experience. I hope my opinion helps those who are still on the sidelines. [/h1]

It can be said that this game is one of the best video game works of Yu-Gi-Oh's physical card in recent years. Unlike Duel Links, which focuses on fast-paced combat and nostalgia for anime plots, just like its name, the game's duel rules are the orthodox ocg-rules, which can be said to be one of the most complicated rules in card games. A large number of cards, a wide variety of rules, all flowers are in bloom decks, unexpected situations, and reversal of life after death, are the biggest charms of Yu-Gi-Oh.

At present, the music, scene design, and animation effects of the game are still quite satisfactory. At the same time, new players can build their own deck at a very low cost, which is crucial to the player experience for a card game. The only shortcoming at present is that the cost of building a second deck after building the first deck is relatively high (except for some general-purpose cards). The characteristics of the game are also doomed to the existence of tiered decks. At present, the dominance of mainstream decks over the environment is still unshakable. Let us look forward to how Konami will coordinate and balance in the future.

Overall, I'm still optimistic about this game right now. For those new players, the learning cost of ocg-rules is too high, and new players may need a long transition period, and the Duel Link is still suitable for players who like Yu-Gi-Oh's animation and want to have a simple duel.","Mostly Positive75% of the 69,676 user reviews for this game are positive.",8 10 h1_emphasized duel link former fan yu gi oh card following conclusion brief hope opinion help sideline best video work yu gi oh physical card recent year unlike duel link focus fast paced combat nostalgia anime plot name duel rule orthodox ocg rule complicated rule card game large number card wide variety rule flower bloom deck unexpected situation reversal life death biggest charm yu gi oh present music scene design animation effect satisfactory player build deck low cost crucial card shortcoming present cost building deck building deck relatively high except general purpose card characteristic doomed existence tiered deck present dominance mainstream deck environment unshakable look forward konami coordinate balance future optimistic player learning cost ocg rule high player long transition period duel link suitable player yu gi oh animation simple duel

1449850,Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"Overall review: Not reccomended for new players or casual players. Competitive players will need to accept a coin-flip meta that embraces a large number of unfair game-winning cards.

Pros:
1. The game is frontloaded with enough gems to make your first deck with little effort.

2. Larger playerbase despite continuously dwindling numbers.

3. Much better graphics, UI, and music than previous Yu-Gi-Oh! titles.

4. Occasional once-per-month ""events"" that introduce a temporary change in deckbuilding limits but only stick around for 2 weeks, leaving you with little to do in-between.

5. A crafting system allows players to dismantle cards for crafting points at an unfavourable rate in order to craft cards that they need.

Cons:
1. Throughout the game's first year, Konami has continued to fail to utilize their ban list effectively. You should expect most games at higher ranks to end in the first two turns - usually due to a surrender after a game-winning card is played. Cards that have been banned for a long time for good reason in the real game run rampant here and result in a coin-flip meta.

2. The card pool is frustratingly outdated. While the game was initially marketed as a modern Yu-Gi-Oh! platform and many had hoped it would be a good virtual simulation of the current TCG, Konami has failed to keep it up to date with the modern game, and it trails a good 6 months behind for no good reason.

3. The pack system is very poorly handled. None of the card packs are available straight away. New players will be encouraged to spend their limited gems on the few packs that they unlock, and packs are only available for 24 hours at a time.

4. There is a significant lack of any substantial solo content such as that included in Duel Links or Legacy of the Duelist - occasionally you might see a new ""story"" added that includes 3 duels against a faceless bot using a slight variation on the same deck. (Once per month) This equates to about 30 minutes of ""content"" every month.

5. Once you've exhausted your supply of initial gems (Missions, solo mode, etc) you will have no way to farm gems to open packs. Expect 140 daily gems, which will allow you to open a single pack which is unlikely to provide anything useful.

6. As time progresses, new cards are being ""rarity-bumped"" before being added to packs with the intention of making new decks prohibitively expensive. Many newer decks will have at least four times as many ultra rares as those from the game's launch. 

7. Konami has been embracing a gem paywall in a small number of their recent events while releasing alongside them powerful unlimited meta strategies to encourage players to spend their gems to compete in the event. During the Link Regulation event, they replaced the casual play-for-gems format with a much more competitive win-for-gems style. At the same time, they left two powerful archetypes unlimited in the event ban list, while introducing their new cards to the shop.
The result is that players unwilling to spend on the two ""new"" archetypes had a difficult time getting hold of all the rewards.

8. Konami has exhibited an unacceptable lack of communication throughout the course of their game, and have made efforts to reduce information getting to customers via ""leaks"". Upcoming events, packs, banlist changes, and even celebration milestones are all left unannounced until they drop, leaving players unable to gauge whether they should be saving their limited resources and bored as they wait an entire month for a sign of new content.

9. Despite now reaching its first year anniversary, (although ignored by Konami) the game still has little-to-no appeal for long-time fans of the anime, casual players, or competitive players of older formats. Konami's continued failure to implement a ""classic mode"" or older formats is one of the many factors that ensured the playerbase has continued a downwards decline since launch. A lack of other interesting modes like ""tag duels"" and best-of-3 matches means that other applications such as Duel Links and fan-made applications like EDOPro are still the ideal choice for providing captivating games of Yu-Gi-Oh! with regular updates, interesting game modes, or a modern card pool.

10. The nature of the game's marketing and Yu-Gi-Oh!'s previously-established community means that it has fostered a rather nasty hyper-competitive playerbase. New players and casual players will struggle to enjoy interacting with long-time players of the TCG and OCG. Playing a casual or sub-optimal deck, being a fan of the anime foremost, and voicing frustrations with the game's lack of balancing or ban list utilization are sure to result in condescending, childish, or hostile reactions from the playerbase.","Mostly Positive75% of the 69,676 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_reccomended player casual player competitive player accept coin flip meta embrace large number unfair winning card pro 1 frontloaded gem deck effort 2 larger playerbase despite continuously dwindling number 3 graphic ui music previous yu gi oh title 4 occasional per event introduce temporary deckbuilding limit stick 2 week leaving 5 crafting allows player dismantle card crafting point unfavourable rate order craft card con 1 throughout konami continued fail utilize ban effectively expect game higher rank turn usually due surrender winning card card banned long good real rampant result coin flip meta 2 card pool frustratingly outdated initially marketed modern yu gi oh platform hoped good virtual simulation tcg konami failed modern trail good 6 month no_good 3 pack poorly handled card pack available straight player encouraged spend limited gem pack unlock pack available 24 hour 4 significant lack substantial solo included duel link legacy duelist occasionally includes 3 duel faceless bot slight variation deck per equates 30 minute 5 exhausted supply initial gem mission solo mode no_way farm gem open pack expect 140 daily gem allow open single pack unlikely provide useful 6 progress card rarity bumped pack intention deck prohibitively expensive newer deck four time ultra rares launch 7 konami embracing gem paywall small number recent event releasing alongside powerful unlimited meta strategy encourage player spend gem compete event link regulation event replaced casual gem format competitive win gem style left powerful archetype unlimited event ban introducing card shop result player unwilling spend archetype difficult hold reward 8 konami exhibited unacceptable lack communication throughout course effort reduce information customer via leak upcoming event pack banlist change celebration milestone left unannounced drop leaving player unable gauge saving limited resource bored wait entire sign 9 despite reaching anniversary ignored konami no_appeal long fan anime casual player competitive player older format konami continued failure implement classic mode older format factor ensured playerbase continued downwards decline launch lack interesting mode tag duel best 3 match mean application duel link fan application edopro ideal choice providing captivating game yu gi oh regular update interesting mode modern card pool 10 nature marketing yu gi oh previously established community mean fostered rather nasty hyper competitive playerbase player casual player struggle enjoy interacting long player tcg ocg casual sub optimal deck fan anime foremost voicing frustration lack balancing ban utilization result condescending childish hostile reaction playerbase

1449850,Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"I've spent a lot of time agonizing over whether I want to put Master Duel as a recommend or dislike in this review. This one's very hesitant; there is a lot to dislike about Master Duel. But, regrettably, I still enjoy it, and know several people who enjoy it and got into YGO through it.

Master Duel is modern YGO in a video game. It's relatively barebones, honestly; there's a simple (and often not-so-perfectly translated) solo mode going over the lore of various cards, there's a best-of-one ranked ladder (that occasionally hosts unique events), you can buy cards and make your deck... yup, that's about it.

Let's talk about the elephant in the room first:


[b] The Economy and Being F2P(-ish) [/b] 

The F2P economy is... generous at times, harsh at others, and often feels like Konami isn't entirely sure what they're doing. Early game gems dry up fast, and later if you're playing optimally you can get enough gems for abouuuut two packs per day, which isn't much. The methods of gaining packs are strange and encourage saving up for a long time and spending all in one inning - or getting impatient and spending money for more. The IRL money-to-game currency exchange is prohibitively expensive - even the absolute best deal, which you can only get for 3 months after starting the game, is a costly ask.
But at the same time, the events that run each month or two are shockingly generous in terms of new gems, and the amount you'll get early is probably enough to make one or two decks either for metagaming or for fun; but if you want to make more than that, gods help you. 

The fact that both Actually Powerful In The Metagame decks and Neat For Fun Decks are often around the same cost is a double edged sword, that's for sure.

[b] The Presentation [/b] 

Honestly, despite it all, Master Duel's presentation isn't all that bad. The music is nice (though nowhere as numerous as the selection of Duel Links; although that game has a ton of its own problems), the graphics are engaging enough, and it's far more easy to understand what's going on by watching it than the card game is IRL.
I've had a lot of friends tell me that even when they're losing games in Master Duel, they're still enjoying it and understanding what's going on, so that's definitely a good sign.
The Solo Mode is a neat series of trying various loaner decks, and the story of various card groups is neat, but the translation is far from the neatest, and it often feels like Konami didn't feel to put all that much work into that part. 
(Seriously, they mistranslated ""Dark Magician"" - strong contender for the MOST iconic card in the game - as ""Dark Spellian"" for a bit. Find-And-Replace algorithms moment.)

[b] Gameplay and the Metagame [/b] 

We can't really talk about Master Duel without talking about YGO proper.
Yu-Gi-Oh! is... a messy game. Decades of power creep in a format without rotation has left many games often decided by turn 1/2.
This isn't necessarily a bad thing! Games in older YGO formats were often just as unbalanced. But it's not for everyone, and when the solo content is finite and playing on Ranked Duel is essentially required to earn gems after a while, the metagame needs to be addressed.
The fact that games don't include the side deck means several decks in Master Duel can essentially make something unfair that, unless you have the very specific counter to, you lose to on the spot. (Lookin' at you, D.D. Dynamite Burn and Skill Drain Eldlich. Hell, this is coming from a non-floodgate Eldlich player, even!). It can be frustrating, it can be unfair.

Nonetheless, there are somehow - perhaps accidentally - diamonds in the rough of all this. The current N/R Festival event, which uses only cards available for essentially no cost, has a neat format and is easily accessible - though even its meta still has a few of its own problems.

There's ways to play with friends, but the function behind it is quite janky. 

[b] Final Thoughts [/b] 

Master Duel... sure exists. It's as messy as the card game itself, many of its successes feel like accidentally stumbling into good ideas, and I worry that the economy or game might only grow worse as time passes.

But for now? I've enjoyed it! I've enjoyed playing with friends, I liked the solo mode, the current N/R Festival is delightful, and I even enjoy ranked duels more than I'd expect.

It's a shame that every single match is god forsaken awful. I understand what their approach to the banlist has been. More leniency with certain historically broken cards to allow those archetypes to have their spotlight on a wide online platform, which means every game becomes a sort of pleasant mixed bag where you can never fully plan for what you'll find on the other side. But because the format is a Best of One where fundamentally broken cards like MAXX C, Protos, Eva, Colossus, Scythe, the list goes on and on... decks end up going into one of two fundamental camps: decks that can ftk you, or decks that can stun you. 

This ultimately means that no matter what decks are available, the top cuts are always going to be a predictable mess of win turn 1 strategies. The boss monsters and win conditions are almost all the same, the only difference is how they reach that end board. We're more or less permanently stuck in the exact same environment as the Adamancipator/Eldlich era because Konami refuses to remove decks that can abuse the best of 1 format to its maximum.

Yes, obviously there are ways to out floodgate boards and ways to break mass negate and handtraps to out ftk, but it's borderline impossible to play a deck that can run all 3 and still have a game plan that won't lose to a Numeron or Accesscode Talker OTK on turn 2. This is exactly why the sideboard is invaluable, and until Master Duel does something to acknowledge the fundamental issue this game will never be anything more than a ""go second, concede"".

1245620,ELDEN RING,"I'm a total noob when it comes to Souls-Games. Usually I play RPGs on easy mode to enjoy the story in peace.
Obviously there is no proper easy mode in Elden Ring, but the game allows you to play it in your own pace.
I literally spent the first 12-14 hours just riding around on my horse which I named Dolly, picked up flowers & only killed some easy enemies. The more I played the more I got confident & noticed that I'm able to kill some small dungeon bosses, because the game allows you to level up without going for the big bosses. When I felt strong enough I went for my first story boss & it was fun, not too easy, not too difficult. 

Like that's the great part of Elden Ring: you don't have to be this awesome Souls-Veteran to be able to enjoy the game. 
You can just take your time with everything, explore the beautiful world from the get go & just enjoy the view & smaller bosses.
The game doesn't push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere ingame. You're not forced to farm the same enemies for hours on end until you're strong enough to continue your journey. You can just keep exploring & will eventually level up in the mean time. & if you're not getting any further with a specific boss, then you can just leave it be for now & do hundreds of other things instead.

I would also like to mention that the open world is done really good! You're able to explore every single corner & the game even rewards you for being curious.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1]Honest Review from an Old Codger[/h1]

[b]First impressions and on the fence: [/b]

I am an older gamer and a father of 4 boys. Elden Ring was the first game for me in the ""Souls-Series"" that I have really played. I did buy Dark Souls 3 and try to play that once it released on Steam, and it took me nearly 3 hours to kill Gundyr; only to find myself constantly invaded, and relentlessly killed when I was trying to play with my youngest son, Griffin afterwards. Needlessly to say, I quickly put that game down and moved on with my life. Years later, my sons showed me Elden Ring and I fell in love with the trailer. My wife encouraged me to try it and be open; maybe this would be a better experience. Time would tell. My gamers of all age and creed, I have put in 1000 hours in and I have no intentions of stopping. 

 I told myself that I would give an honest review from my point of view if I ever played the game for 1000 hours.

[b]Arising as a Tarnished: [/b]

I can safely say that this game is one of the best games that I have ever played in my life; I have played many. I have experienced such a range of emotions of this game, and no matter how many times I failed at a boss or a mechanic, I always knew that I could better myself if I applied myself; a nice lesson learned in life that transcends quite well into the gaming universes. Once I was able to get my noodle around the mechanics of this game, I fell in love and I could not put it down; I still cannot. You just have to be patient with yourself and believe in yourself. That is one of the many cornerstones of life that leads to success and in these Souls games, it is no different. You can quite literally play the game however you want. Any build you can think of, any style you desire, you can do it here.  Your limits are only set on your imagination and will power.  I have created many different kinds of builds for my complete playthroughs and I never get bored beating the games and repeating the content as a different character from the hit MOBA: League of Legends. 

[b]Support beyond the Fog[/b]:

As an older gamer, and father of 4 boys, my time is limited, and it is always an opportunity cost when learning how to play a new game. The community that surrounds Elden Ring are amazing as well, which was very strange at first. I did not expect a game, that is heavily singleplayer, to have an immense amount of care, and support from a community. From this community, the amount of resources of knowledge and guidance they give, often reminds me of my first time playing Star Wars Galaxies, EverQuest and the original World of Warcraft.  From wikis to video playthroughs, and everything in between, anything you could possibly want to know, and answers to the questions that you did not think you could have, the community has your back. Keep this in mind if you are ever stuck in this game, or on the fence about this game. The resources are there for you, the support from the community is there for you both in and out of game. Shout out to Fextralife, Fightincowboy, Giggathiccas, Onion Samurai, Titus Actual, YMAH (the goat), and Steelovsky for helping me in all aspects of the game. If you are ever struggling, please look any of those up on how to better yourselves in PvE or the PvP Aspects of the game. 

[b]A Seamless Land, that is as vast as the oceans[/b]

When I reached the 25 hours mark, I told my wife that this game reminded me a lot of Nintendo's 1998 hit classic ""Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"". That world space was so vast for its time, it was like nothing that the world of gaming has ever seen before.  Seamlessly wondering around, adventuring around, didn't matter if you got lost or hit a dead end, I was so engaged back then to explore and find what wonders and secrets held, low and behold, Elden Ring delivered that same experience that I had in my youth. That was so captivating for me and it really left an impression on me of what it means to explore in a game and actually enjoy yourself. It has been literally decades since any game has been able to deliver that experience again and trust me, I have bought nearly all those AAA open world games that have sucked in comparison on delivering a wholesome experience. 

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]

When I buy a game, I invest my hard earned money AND my limited time in it. I expect to have a good time with my family and friends that also play that game. I took a leap of faith with this game; especially after my first experience with a FROMSOFT game was quite miserable (LOL not anymore, I have nearly 100% Darksouls III and absolutely love the Dark Souls games, yes including DS II). Needless to say, this game has not only surpassed my expectations, but it has been quite sometime (I would say 5 years) that I have thoroughly enjoyed myself playing a game. Gamer-Rot is a hard experience to endure and live through as a passionate gamer, and Elden Ring got me out of it. Elden Ring has paved the road for me and my sons to spend more quality time together. Thank you Elden Ring.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"This being my first FromSoftware game, I was a bit nervous about the difficulty as I'm not usually a fan of hard content (or very good at it), but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't as daunting as I'd thought it'd be, and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games.

[h1][u]The World[/u][/h1]
I can't remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game's open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming. I spent something like 50 hours exploring Limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls.

If I had trouble with a boss or an area, I'd just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on, and there's plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss. 

Creature summons were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.

[h1][u]The Gameplay[/u][/h1]
My first playthrough ended up being something like 300 hours long, though plenty of those hours were spent doing random things like climbing hard-to-reach places to enjoy the view or leaving fellow players a message!

I also spent plenty of time stubbornly dying to enemies I wasn't quite yet ready to take on, and there were two specific bosses that I had a really hard time with, but finally beating them felt SO satisfying, and it was worth all the rage I'd felt when dying repeatedly to them.

[h1][u]The Multiplayer[/u][/h1]
I asked for help from some friends at times, and there are a lot of funny moments to be had when playing with others. It's also not that difficult to find a random player to summon if you need help with a boss or dungeon. 

When you're in a boss arena, you can't be invaded, so if you're worried about that, you just have to limit summoning other players to when you're fighting bosses.

Though honestly, the invading wasn't as scary as I'd expected, especially when you have the option of asking a hunter for help. I have some great memories from when me and my friend were invaded, times where we got absolutely decimated but also close calls that made us whoop or sigh in relief!

[h1][u]Ending Thoughts[/u][/h1]
I loved the npc's, although some of the quests felt like they ended too suddenly :( Also, I don't care what anyone says, Fia's hugs are nice and warm.

Seeing my character in cutscenes, however few, felt very satisfying. Especially as I can't help but dress up for that purpose alone lol.

The only bad experience I really had with the game was towards the end. I absolutely hated a certain zone ([spoiler]Farum Azula, cough[/spoiler]), and it was the only zone I ended up trying to rush through. Moving around the environment was annoying especially because of the enemies. It's also the only location where my game crashed multiple times. 

I have to say the location boss was awesome though, as was every main boss honestly. 
The optional boss in the area was also one of my favorite designs and one of my most memorable experiences in the game.



Other than that, I had a few stutters here and there, but nothing too disrupting to my experience.

Even if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options if you're struggling, and there are plenty of playstyles you can give a go. 

Suffice to say, I'm super excited to see what the future dlc will bring and I [b][u]highly recommend[/u][/b] the game!

1245620,ELDEN RING,"Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:
- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.
- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world
- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign
- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.
- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.

There are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:
- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.
- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.
- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.
- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as ""respawn only"" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.
- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...
- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.
- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.

As with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.","Very Positive92% of the 576,811 user reviews for this game are positive.",medium performance issue 2_emphasized8 22 goty amazing dripping fromsoft dark soul 4 dark soul 4 5 6 massive open world attempt pad game picking item open world pickup animation not_seem dragon age inquisition talking pick item horseback no_animation greatly speed looting open world summoning pool make summoned boss easier general overworld location pool location summon sign sooooo bonfire location fast travel anywhere map packed stuff rarely walking riding long period running dungeon bos camp non single side location discover plus never_know feeling discovery unlike there_emphasized improvement previous installment no_particular order standouts powerstancing babyyyyy favorite ds2 slottable weapon art taking weapon art ds3 tied weapon affinity allows switch scaling weapon bonfire no_more committing specific element stat open world make accessible wall zone else stronger sekiro extremely pronounced statue marika runbacks boss not_nearly grueling statue respawn bonfire choose respawn usually outside bos fight room lengthy rest adjust build prevent grueling runback allow smash face bos minimal downtime dedicated button power attack risky usually counter low swinging attack add next poise breaking enemy heavy attacking attacking guard countering add move type make weapon totally different playstyle add replay value guard counter successfully blocking attack follow special heavy attack high poise damage allows critical hit make easier take skill riposte feel good not_for love soul game disservice missing never_played soul best accessible far no_crazy hard tutorial boss ashen summoning bell give great support difficult area leave harder fight make rarely situation booting mean gon na brick walling bos dy

He's not wrong that the game seems perfect for me: a character customization heavy ARPG that actually makes the player work to [b]play better, not farm harder[/b], with mysterious lore, gritty aesthetic, and rogue-like punishment.  Yet time and time again, as much as I [b]want[/b] to be enamored by the game, I find myself too frustrated to justify spending time improving, and default to things that are more forgiving.  I am weak.

But when I walked out of the gates and saw The Lands In-Between for the first time my jaw hit the damn floor.  I immediately identified multiple places I wanted to explore, and I felt like there was nothing stopping me from doing it.  Of course, the first thing I investigated reassured me that many things could, in fact, stop me from doing it.

That's actually what I realized I needed from other Soulslikes.  I don't mind a linear path, but I don't like feeling trapped in the same mistake.  When I'm playing Elden Ring, if I can't figure something out, I don't feel like my entire experience is blocked.  I can walk away and go check out something nearby, maybe find a spell or new armor that gets me through the fight that was stopping me.  I'm [i]always[/i] progressing, even if I walk away.  That option solved my biggest problem with getting into the genre.

What KEPT me, was all the stuff I'd hoped to get out of the other games.  The characters are vague, but the details they share are just specific enough to cause a sense of wonder.  I actually feel like I'm a part of this huge world torn apart by a tremendous war.  I didn't feel important at the start...but I slowly started to say ""Wait you think I'm not tough after I took down [[redacted]]?!""  I actually felt like the world was reflecting my actions and I worked to earn my place as the difficulty rose, and it was fun doing it!

I felt this way when I was a kid and played The Legend of Zelda for the first time.   The storytelling is enough to get you interested in doing things/going places, but doesn't flood you with details.  Dungeons are fun to explore and you know you'll get something out of them.  There are clear rules to getting to the end, but your path there is mostly up to you.  It's wonderful!

Now to be clear, there are some issues I have.  The UI is pretty unintuitive, the important things are difficult to recognize as such, but honestly they're so small compared to the highs I really don't care.

If you want your hand held, you'll hate this.  If you want to feel like you're discovering a new world that will constantly have you wondering if you can survive the next encounter and push a little further every day, this is for you.","Very Positive92% of the 576,811 user reviews for this game are positive.",bought spite best friend convinced 5th row soulslike barely bothered bos previous entry not_wrong perfect customization heavy arpg make not_farm harder mysterious lore gritty aesthetic rogue punishment enamored frustrated justify spending improving default thing forgiving weak walked gate saw land jaw damn floor i_emphasizedmmediately identified multiple place wanted explore stopping course i_emphasizednvestigated reassured thing realized needed soulslikes mind linear path feeling trapped mistake elden ring figure entire blocked walk check nearby maybe spell armor get fight stopping progressing walk option solved biggest problem genre stuff hoped game character vague detail share specific cause sense wonder huge world torn apart tremendous war important slowly started wait not_tough took redacted world reflecting action worked earn difficulty rose fun kid legend zelda storytelling interested thing place flood detail dungeon fun explore clear rule path mostly wonderful clear issue ui pretty unintuitive important thing difficult recognize honestly small compared high care hand held hate discovering world constantly wondering survive next encounter push

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]
Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph. 

[h1]GENRE:[/h1]
Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' game

[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]
Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats  (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes"" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops. 

'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.

Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.

[h1]GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:[/h1]
Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs (AMD FX 6300, RX 480) averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient). 

In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well. 
 
[h1]STORY:[/h1]
The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to ""order"". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)

[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]
•Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.

•Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.

•Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)

•You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.

•There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough

•The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.

•Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.

•Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.

[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]
•PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens. 

•Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully ""exit"" when you quit out until a while later.

•Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.

•There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.

•UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items

•Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a ""connection error"" and the game boots you back to single player. 

•Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.

•(Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.

•So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).

•'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power. 

•Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.

[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]
9.9/10; easy recommend

Elden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and can't wait for future DLC.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"My mother has always been a gamer. She played many various series throughout the decades, but her most recent interest was Elden Ring. I've personally never played any of the Souls games for my own reasons, nor did I have much interest, but my mom would tell me about her grand adventures exploring The Lands Between. She was always enthusiastic about it and I would listen, even if I had no idea about anything she was saying.

On April 7th, my mom had a stroke and I found her slumped in her chair. She was rushed to the hospital but, after five long days, she passed away. After the funeral and some time to grieve, I was going through her things and found Elden Ring on her computer. It dawned on me that she never finished this game she was so ecstatic about, so I decided I would complete it in her memory.

Elden Ring is a fantastic world of exploration and discovery. It allows the player to cheerfully change course as they discover the next distraction every few seconds. There's hardly any required order of activities to perform and you can serpentine across the world at your leisure.

The gameplay is challenging, but rewarding and exciting. Hitboxes are tight, animations are fluid, and everything controls well. Melee combat is weighty and the enemies react in a satisfying manner. Magic is powerful and varied in execution to keep things fresh. Just about everything is viable, so have fun with it. There's many small rewards to enhance your gameplay hidden around, so it pays to take your time and comb over areas you think you've completed.

Dueling against other players is also exciting. They're capable of everything you are, so you have to stay on your toes. Be ready to counter their actions and punish openings.

Difficulty is high, but not impossible. I spent enough time wandering early on that the first real boss fight was no issue at all. You can also level up and grind stats, if you want/need. Some fights are obviously going to be harder than others, but you can learn most of them and overcome anything the boss throws at you if you relax and read their inputs.

The story is interesting, but obtuse. Not enough is explained well in-game, and I relied on some abridged lore videos to better understand what's going on. I'll refrain from spoiling anything here though.

I played through the first half of the game on my own, offline. Then I decided to try online when a friend was continuously asking if he could join. Both are enjoyable experiences, but I would suggest offline/solo play if you're a slower and more thorough individual.

I enjoyed the time I spent in Elden Ring alone, with friends, confused, triumphant, and even despaired. It's an exhilarating experience that invaded my dreams and had me theorycrafting builds during my work hours. I'll enjoy many more hours in the near future when DLC arrives.

I hope my mother enjoyed watching me play and was satisfied with the story path and ending I chose. I will never forget the life she gave me and the struggles she faced along the way. There are so many things I never got to say, so many milestones in my life she will never get to see, and locations we never got to visit.

To anyone reading this, please do not take for granted the time you have with your loved ones. Life really can surprise anyone at any time, anywhere.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"Being my first souls game, I was convinced I would be wasting my money, and that the first boss I encountered would kick my ass. And I was proven right in no time, by the Grafted Scion. “But you were expected to be defeated by that one!”, you say. Worry not, the Tree Sentinel was also quick to put me back in my place once I had built the tiniest bit of confidence after beating the tutorial boss.

The game is fantastic. It got more and more rewarding as I progressed, and I was happy to beat the game a second and a third time, finding out new secrets during each playthrough. There’s no compliment I can come up with that hasn’t already been used to describe this game.

There are so many weapons with so many different builds to try. Bosses can be frustrating but there’s so much fun to be had. Even what is considered to be one of the toughest fights (looking at you, Malenia) is incredibly fair and fun. And the spectral horse you get is most likely the best horse I’ve ever ridden in any game, ever.

If I had anything to complain about, are the platforming sections. But after looking it up a bit, apparently FromSoftware never really knew how to do those, and they are so few and far between, that's hardly a reason not to buy the game.

I could also complain that I was unable to romance Boggart or Blaidd. They’re so cool.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1] Welcome To Elden Ring -A Dying Simulator- [/h1]

This game delivers the entire experience in a way I've never quite seen. I'm new to the souls-like genre, and FROMSOFTWARE games. Here are the thoughts: 

I've spent 200+ hours in this game as of writing this and I've barely left the starting area - Limgrave. My nightmares consist of Runebears, traversing the mist, and boss fights. I've been startled, pillaged, rekt, and absolutely confused many times, but I wouldn't change any of it. I remember the first time I saw a giant I had Attack on Titan flashbacks and began trying to summon my inner Captain Levi. It's just a blast. An absolute blast. The greatest feeling of accomplishment is when you start to beat bosses or new enemies on your first attempt. You can feel your ability, your reaction time, your muscle-memory coming more and more into play as you practice, and it creates a thrilling experience. Struggling with an enemy type for hours only to come back a few days later and realize how much stronger and faster you've gotten is a very rewarding experience.

I was a bit nervous about the difficulty as I'm not usually a fan of hard content (or very good at it), but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't as daunting as I'd thought it'd be, and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games.

I can't remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game's open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming. I spent something like 50 hours exploring Limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls.

If I had trouble with a boss or an area, I'd just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on, and there's plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss. Discover new dungeons, Cave, Hidden Item, Secret Spells, Underground, Mini bosses etc.. Summoning Spirit were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons art was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.

Even if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options In open world amazing quest, beautiful scenery that is pretty enough reason to try it. If you're struggling, and there are plenty of play-styles, magical spells build as well to play with.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"So, I came into this game as a person who hates the Souls-genre. I'm not that good at combat in video games as I typically like games where you can just hack or slash your way through everything. So when Elden Ring was announced and talked about pre-release, I was like ""Nah, i wont like it."". Fast-forward to when it released I was watching a few friends play it and it looked amazingly fun. So I was like... I gotta bite the bullet and try it.
Lo and behold it was the best decision ever! Elden Ring while a souls-game has a feature to it that actually made it a lot more comfortable for me to play than any other souls game: It was open world without a defined path you have to take. Sure, the grace sites tell you WHERE you should go, but you can generally ignore them. Also sure, you have to beat certain things in order to ""win"" the game, but you can like ignore that for a really long time and just explore. I had so much fun exploring the game and just messing around with magic that it really didnt feel like a souls game until like mid-game. That's when the bosses started to get really punishing for me. However, I only had to really call in my friend like three times? One of those times was just because it was like eleven at night and I was exhausted and just really wanted to get past the boss.
So, honestly, without going further into it and allowing you to explore on your own, YES get Elden Ring, even if you typically hate Souls games. This game is literally the souls-genre redone in a way that almost anyone can get into it. One last thing to mention before i peace out, but I have REALLY bad ADHD to the point where it's rare that a game actually keeps my attention.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"After 98 hours I believe I have fully finished the game, completing all bosses and completing what I believe are all 6 endings to the game, although I'm convinced there's 7 and now confidently write my review on the game.

[b]For the sake of not wasting much of your time with this review i will start with the bad[/b]

- Weird FPS stuttering issue, I didn't really get this bad compared to most people seemingly but I did encounter it in a particularly foggy and snowy area of the game. Hopefully they can fix up these PC port issues quickly.

- The worst PvP invasion system out of all their titles. The only way you can invade is if someone has summoned help already, that means the invader has to always 2 v 1 at a minimum but in fact most of the time they are actually 3 v 1ing as the person being invaded will summon in additional help. I personally think this invading system is absolute garbage awful design and it's especially tragic with how well the rest of the game is designed and it really cuts deep with the potential this title had in regards to PvP.

- Bad summoning multiplayer system. I believe this game has a level scaling system if you play multiplayer with your friends and use a password so your high level character can help out a friend, however for absolutely no reason, this is not the universal multiplayer system and they did not extend this level scaling system to the random summons to help people or the random invading PvP. This means that I, with my level 165 character are destined to never be able to use multiplayer system to help out new players kill early game bosses even though they actually have a system in the game that I should be able to use in order to do this.

- An issue that almost all open world games have towards the end of the game. Copy and Paste enemies and bosses where unfortunately due to the scale of the game that variety of bosses and enemies gets thin, and you get bosses that are 2 or 3 man of previous bosses. Also due to the nature of an open world if you explore and happen to successfully grind through a difficult or area you're underleveled for, this will ultimately mean you have thus overleveled another area. I had this problem myself where I explored and facesmashed through a couple of massive hidden zones and thus overleveled probably 2 main zones I had to progress through later. Having said that in the last 2 or so zones and especially the last hidden zone of the game I seemed to be at the correct level for them so it seemed to equalise regardless towards the end of the game. 

- I believe the game actually tricks new players into a more difficult experience. At the start of the game you are given a direction of where to go through arrows on the map pointing you where to go. The arrows in Limgrave, and in Liurnia point you towards a major boss / zone that is actually substantially more difficult than the other major boss and Points of Interest in the zone. I believe for the sake of new players they should somehow adjust the arrows. I highly recommend new players, especially to the series as a whole explore zones to their maximum before actually following the arrows which seems counter-intuituve design.

[b]Now let's talk about the good parts[/b]

- There are a couple of systems in place that make it the most accessible From Software title for new players. The main system is the Spirit Ashes system that is basically an offline summoning system that summons an upgradable NPC or group of NPCs to help you. This system alone makes the game exceptionally accessible for new players to the series as these NPCs are frankly and I believe intentionally busted, if a player ever gets bored and wants to progress a frustrating part of the game they can pop one of these and fly through it.

- Another major plus to this game compared to previous titles is the sheer variety of builds, especially through the Ashes of War system that allows you transform any standard weapon to scale with any stat. This with the sheer variaty of weapons, armour etc. that are already in the game adds massive replay value to the game over time. Also the game has a built in easily accessible respec function. I'm already looking forward to trying new builds through new game+. The culmination of this variety in builds really solidifies Elden Ring as the Magnum Opus of the Souls combat system, which once again makes how bad the PvP is sting extra hard.

- Open World, Storytelling and Characters. I really enjoyed the Open World myself and believe it was a great evolution to the series that just requires some kinks sorting that I've discussed previously. You can actually see landmarks on the map without having visited them yet. Caves, Towers, Churches and especially the Ruins are all clearly visible on the map before you have visited them although there are also some hidden ones for the people like me that also like exploring.

Overall I found the world and zones themselves very varied and interesting going between zone to zone, so that's definitely a big plus of the Open World design. Whilst From Software isn't the pinnacle developer of graphics, From Software has always been phenomenal at environmental design and they carry on their form in Elden Ring.

- I enjoy the Elden Ring story more than other Souls titles. I found it had a much stronger foundation that you could more easily understand and follow, it made you want to explore the world more and interact the NPCs regularly. Elden Ring didn't leave a lot of the story vague, throughout the game it solidified the lore into quite an easy to understand package and I believe this is a plus personally.

In my opinion Elden Ring has the most interesting NPCs and also Quests out of all the titles. I love the secrets in From Software games and fortunately Elden Ring has a good few of them that were a treat to discover with all the NPCs. The NPC quests were quite long, fleshed out, interesting to the story and if you explored the game fully weren't really terribly difficult to miss. They also contributed a lot to a few of the endings which I found really cool.

[b]Middling things that can be positives and negatives[/b]

- The ambient soundtrack for the zones is the best out of all the From Software games, however I found a lot of the actual boss music quite hit and miss. Overall it was good enough for me to buy the Soundtrack so there's that I guess.

- They managed to make, in my humble opinion the worst 'poison swamp' area out of every souls game. Take that as you will. Hidetaka Miyazaki spared no expense in the creation of this area.

[b]Closing Notes[/b]

To summarise this review, I strongly believe this to overall be the best From Software title for a singleplayer experience and possibly the worst for a multiplayer experience. New players and Veterans alike can have an absolute blast due to the systems they have implemented. The sheer freedom in this game is incredible from the build variety to how you explore and progress through the game which gives this game a ton of replay value compared to previous titles and also gives Elden Ring the strongest combat in a souls game so far. The story is interesting and in my opinion more concrete than previous From Software games which made it very fun to learn about as you played through the game, the NPC quests are the most interesting so far. The PvP invasions had the potential to be the best in all Souls games due to the aforementioned build variety but they messed that up, hopefully they will change it. The multiplayer with randoms is unfortunately hindered for absolutely no reason. Hopefully they fix the performance issues, luckily I didn't really have any except a little bit in one zone.

Naturally this review is all my opinion, if you disagree that's cool. If you have performance issues that's unfortunate, hope they fix them.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"It will seem unfair, almost rude and insulting to play, at first. Every step of the way Elden Ring challenges what you think you know about action games, and video games in general. You're plopped into a world with little to no map markers. Zero quest log. Dialogue is spoken once to you by npcs, better remember what they say! And the world is completely open. It takes modern open world concepts that have been overused and some how makes them feel fresh. The reward of continuing on despite your many failures, is what makes Elden Ring so unique and enjoyable to play. 

Nobody in their right mind would release a game like this in 2022. But here we are. Elden Ring feels like it's from a different time period in gaming. Like it came straight out of the 1990's early 2k's but with the graphics and precision you would expect from a title in 2022. Without all the bloat and nonsense. Elden Ring doesn't waste your time when you play it. 

It's just a masterpiece. It's like the game we have all been waiting for. If you have been playing games since you can remember and loved Ocarina of Time, the Elder Scrolls and multiplayer games like Halo. There is something you will love in this game. The multiplayer alone is an exceptionally unique and wacky experience that I highly recommend.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I am almost 60 hours into the game at this point. It is a very *grueling* experience. I am not even half way through the main stor. Spoilers below.

I don't care about the lack of achievements. I don't care about it not being a sneaky AC Game. I can respect this game as an RPG with elements of the AC World during the Viking Raids of England. I don't even necessarily care that the game can't seem to decide if it's Isu technology or if magick is actually real (At this point I'm leaning somewhere near the latter).

Issue #1: The Main storyline is WAY too long and way too repetitive. I'm sorry but I really have no incentive to want to explore the world and help EVERY SINGLE little count or ealdorman in England just so I can beat the game. And that's not even including the missions in Asgard and Jotunheim through Valka. To put into perspective how many quests there are in the main storyline, I lost count at around 112-ish. These quests can range from ""Go to Randvi and tell her you finishes the last story arc"" to ""Find 8 unmarked locations at the map and kill people and find supplies"" I enjoyed Origins on my Xbox One. I loved Egypt, I loved following Bayek's tale of revenge. There was a clear goal that was driving you, the death of his son and getting justice for that. With Eivor I don't even know what I am doing at this point. Like: We have the support of like 6 kings or ealdormans and like I don't really know WHO THE BAD GUYS ARE! In theory, the order of ancients are the bad guys but the game never really makes it a priority to hunt them down (there's also like no real reason for me to want to hunt them down. They haven't DONE anything to Eivor and there's no real reward, as far as I can tell, for killing them all), they're really a secondary concern to the acquiring of alliances, but at this point there isn't a point to collecting alliances. There are no immediate threats to Eivor or their clan. At the beginning, it made sense for Eivor to ally with Grantebridge or Seek out the Ragnarsons, that was in line with the original goal of establishing a home for the clan. But at that point the clan is pretty safe all things considered so there isn't really any pressure at this point anymore. Also the game is REALLY INSISTENT on Eivor and Sigurd being angry and hateful to fulfill Valka's prophecy but there hasn't really been enough development, to me at this point, for them to want to be this close to coming to blows.

Issue #2: The World feels empty and at the same time cluttered with useless junk. There are many collectibles in the world of AC Valhalla, and at the point I'm at in the game they are all useless. I don't have a need to upgrade my gear because I have not faced enemies that have forced me to reconsider my strategy or way of fighting, I haven't reached a blocking point, in fact I'm TOO Strong at this point. None of the armors or wealths or mysteries interest me anymore. They don't reward me anything of value. I understand that part of this is to encourage players to explore, but what's the point? I see why people WANT the achievements, because this would make it worth it, but I would take anything for collecting all of the mysteries, artifacts and wealth points in a certain number of places. The armor isn't really that good compared to the upgraded berserkir armor. At the same time, the world doesn't make you feel like you're in it, it makes you feel like you're the center of it. Nothing happens without Eivor, the all powerful ubermensch who can literally be the difference between an army winning a battle and just losing. No one does anything without you. Sure there are some funny voicelines in cities and such, but the world doesn't feel alive. Even the mysteries, which are meant to be these sort of side quests are just so boring and insignificant, they are only worth doing when they give you a key to get some supplies you desperately need to build one more part of your settlement.

Issue #3: The Legendary weapons are very underwhelming. These are meant to be the ""Weapons of Gods and Heroes"". They feel like weapons in skyrim that you enchanted with shock damage... It would be cool I guess if the weapons looked a bit more impressive or if they had like actually good special abilities aside from ""Pew pew lightning, *stuns for like a second*""

The final thing I want to note is that, it feels like some of the writing and items are just there as fan service. Like, this game has a LOT of fan service. Kassandra didn't need to be in the game, you could've avoided that entirely, they did it because ""OMG LOOK IT'S THE CHARACTER FROM THE LAST GAME!!!!"" And you didn't need to make the Egypt armor from the Wrath of the Druids DLC literally just be partially based on Bayek's armor...

All of this said... I want to praise it a bit as well. Eivor's character is interesting and there are good moments where their qualities shine through, One of the best ways is at the beginning, Eivor places the hidden blade over their wrist and says ""Why would I want to hide such a weapon?"" This is really fascinating on many levels: It sets up that Eivor is not a fan of hiding their power, it says something about the culture Eivor comes from, it sets out that Eivor is not the sneaky type, they're a warrior and proud of it and they want everyone to know they're proud of this fact. Eivor also manages to do it without seeming, to me at least, overly arrogant and self righteous. I think this is because Eivor really goes out of their way, at least out I play them, to do the right thing and find BETTER solutions than the problems present.

One of the best storylines in this game is the Wrath of the Druids DLC. Eivor gets a message to meet the King of dublin, their cousin Bairid and his son Sicfrith. Bairid asks Eivor to help him gain the favor of the High King of Ireland, a godly man who hates Pagans and Vikings on account of them killing his father. In doing so, you are roped into building up Dublin as a center of trade and in trying to stop a cult of druids who are trying to kill the High King of Ireland and Bairid. Along the way you meet one of the Good Druids, the High Poetess and you start to see this tension between the christians and pagans in Ireland. Eventually you go hunt down all of the Evil Druid cult leaders and the last mission is killing the leader. Your reward for killing all of these leaders is the legendary Gae Bolg, the weapon of Cu Chulainn. Afterwards the kings of Ireland call a meeting with the High King and they all decide to do an inquisition to purge the island of all of the Druids. The High Poetess storms off and attempts to unleash hell upon the isle and kill the High King, You then either kill her or spare her life, in which case she flees. the High King is convinced of his faults and calls of the Inquisition. The story ends with you and Sicfrith mourning Bairid who died in the course of the war trying to earn the favor of his High King. 

THIS IS WHAT A STORY SHOULD BE LIKE. It's not Oscar winning by any means, but it doesn't force you to win the favor of every single gods damned lord in England, AND THEN some quests with the gods.

I think it would've been better for all of the alliances to be optional and instead maybe make them simplified or offer a reward for creating all of these alliances like special merchants or buildings for Raventhorpe or maybe a special set of armor or something. Kind of like the Templar Hunt missions in AC4.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"TL;DR Good viking game, bad Assassin's Creed game.

All this achievement talk and nobody seems to be able to review the game itself. I understand that people are upset about there not being any achievements and of course I hope they add em ASAP. However, is the game even worth playing to get such achievements. That is an easy question to answer.

If you are looking for a game similar to the first few of the franchise, you are not going to find it here.

If you are looking for an open world game revolving around vikings, this game is for you.

I see many people getting upset because they see ""Assassin's Creed"" in the title and hope it's what they will get. Unfortunately that is not the case. This game is nothing like the first few installments of the franchise. Even with that being the case, I do still think that this game is fun, the story so far seems to be quite basic but the setting is interesting and the scenery is beautiful. 

Get this game, if you just wanna roam around in a beautiful world and explore the Nordic seas.

If you want something similar but with more of a classic AC feel, play Origins","Mostly Positive71% of the 17,395 user reviews for this game are positive.",tl dr good viking bad assassin creed achievement talk able understand upset not_being achievement course hope add em asap worth achievement easy question answer similar franchise not_going open world revolving viking upset assassin creed title hope unfortunately not_the case installment franchise case fun far basic interesting scenery beautiful wan na roam beautiful world explore nordic sea similar classic ac origin

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Okay, here's the thing.

The game itself is alright. Pretty decent open world exploration and combat. Put its a definite downgrade from the last couple entries gameplay wise and the story is showing a LOT of wear and tear from trying to fit AC into the RPG Mold.

-The Skill tree is so meandering and inefficient its confusing to try to make a good build. Luckily you eventually get some many skill points you kinda brute force a good build regardless, especially at lower skill levels. We need a return to at least the Odyssey/Origins level where there were separate skill trees that made it a lot easier to decide to specialize in a specific playstyle.

-Stealth seems a lot harder to pull off. Not enough places to hide, too many wide thoroughfares, that type of thing. Unless you deliberately set stealth to easy, soldiers seem to notice you immediately, and even then its easier to be noticed than not. Even as an RPG, Stealth should be a very supported level of playstyle in AC.

-The Weird MMOification of AC games continues apace. All of these dailies and microtransactions for single-player game stuff, and the pressure to log on every day to farm Opals and check the vendor for stuff you will with the siren song of opening the real cash store and grabbing it there instead, for a game you will probably finish and abandon forever in no more than 100 hours or so and certainly wont play long enough to buy a full cash armor set with Opals, if only because all pieces likely wont appear on the Opal store and if they do, you might miss it because you decided to play another game or couldnt game at all that day.

-The Viking Story is... kind of iffy, theme-wise. Listen, there's not really an easy way to make the Vikings the Good Guys. For better or for worse, they are invaders and colonists. Trying to make them decent hardworking folks just looking for a new land just kind of... falls flat, in the face of that? Cant make me a dude just looking for peace when Im out here raiding villages and monasteries for loot. I get that not every game has you play as the good guys, but I appreciate a little themeatic clarity that just isnt coming across in this game. These dudes are raiders, like it or not.

-The ""Long Term"" Romances are so flat I kinda just wish they hadnt been included? Also the story feels like you were definitely supposed to romance Randvi for it to make sense. I didnt feel any real connection to Randvi, so I romanced Petra instead, and a few storylines just make a LOT less sense that way. I loved some of the romance options in Odyssey/Valhalla, don't get me wrong, but if you're not gonna at least give me Bioware level attention to this stuff, just cut it out or give me one canon romance the storyline leads toward. 

-Honestly, in general most of the choices were kind of iffy. They lead to weird changes in the narrative, some where its obvious the game expected you to make the other choice, so the choice you made just kinda... petered out? Or the game rushed bullheadedly along as if you'd chosen the other choice, narrative-wise? Not every game needs to be a ""Choice"" RPG, and Valhalla has definitely tipped me full on into the ""AC does not need to be a 'your choices matter'"" RPG camp. I dont need to make narrative choices, just let me watch Edward Kenway be an asshole and destroy his personal life completely while I help him kill soldiers and pursue treasure that should have been left buried, you hear?

-The Order of the Ancients storyline was especially weak. As a non-Assassin, Eivor's choice to go after the Order was about the weakest its ever been. She needed a personal stake, she didnt have one, so the whole thing felt flat, a checklist to mark off rather than a quest to bring order or seek vegeance or etc as it has been for most of the other MCs.

-Just Make Lady Eivor the only Eivor you cowards. She was superior anyway, and it feels like trying to ""Have your cake and eat it too"" to make her the canon Eivor but also let people play as a Dude. Not like you're gonna let us play Lady!Basim in Mirage are you? Just let a Lady have the spotlight instead of this cowardly ""Well the lady is canon but you can play as a dude if you think she has cooties""

-After a while, Titanium becomes a massive bottleneck. If I want to upgrade even one set of armor and weapons, I have to go around buying Titanium off vendors or tracking down treasure chests. Annoying side quest options.

-There's no less than two side-quests/""Game Modes"" where I can't use the weapons, armor, and skills I've ground for for dozens of hours, and where the content is implied to be ""Endless."" Let Single-Player games END, y'all. Sometimes I just wanna spend 50-100 hours clearing out a big map full of interesting stuff and jet to the next thing in my games library, and that's FINE.

On the plus side:

-River raiding is fun. There's too little of it in the overworld, but luckily you can get a whole side quest where you open up special river maps. Do wish there was a little more variety on these maps, a little tougher enemies, but you know. Fun storming a castle with a bunch of cool Jomsvikings.

-Still a lot of solid open world combat and areas to explore. 

-A few of the weapons are pretty fun to play around with.

Anyway, yeah, I know, Haha, look at Thumbs Down girl with 115 hours played, but I couldnt in good faith give this a Thumbs up.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"[h1] Exhausting and Disappointing [/h1]
I wanted to love this game, and for the first 10 hours of gameplay, I was hooked by the game, but then the problem started to reveal itself. The main issue I had with the game was the narrative structure. It is ""exhausting"" and diminishes the motivation to finish the game. Plus, the dead open world doesn't feel as lively and exciting to explore as Origins or Odyssey, which is disappointing.

If you're really into Viking stuff, you're in for a treat. But if you need a game that doesn't feel like a chore when you get back from real-life work, this is not the game for you. This game doesn't even make RPG grinding fun.

The initial hours were fun, exploring the stunning landscapes and engaging in raids. However, as I delved deeper into the game, it became painfully clear that Valhalla suffers from a serious case of bloat and sheer repetitiveness.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Well hello this is my first review so be kind:) 
i will break down the game into a list of the things i find great with the game and the negatives of the game here we go!

positives (great things)
-if you like the Norse mythology lore and brutal combat there is no shying away from that here.
-combat is smooth ability's are similar if not close to the same layout as odyssey so i found it familiar and comfortable to get used to the control's in this ac quickly.
-story is what you would expect from a viking story line some of the characters are very remember able and off there rocker some are just bland but i will touch up on that later in the negatives. 
- your bird companion is helpful and not over powered like the origins and odyssey makes game a little more challenging in my opinion and enjoyed this version of the bird eagle raven etc call it what you will.
-customisation is very well done in this game tattoos ship cosmetics hair raven cosmetics so forth and so on for all weapons and armour as well.
- Mini game such as Orlog and flyting are extremely fun in this ac creed game and i hope they bring back more games similar to Orlog or flyting in future ac games.
-side quest in ac Valhalla or a mixture of bland OK and well done i would say the side quests here are slightly less on par with odyssey and better then origins how ever i may be bi-est as i am very much into viking lore and history and personally i would say i prefer Valhalla side quests over ac odyssey.
--Negatives 
oh boy here we go everyone's favourite  part :) now let us begin 
-- loading times seem to be longer then the other last 2 ac game that have came out.
-expansion was not nearly as fun as the expansion sets for ac origins and Odyssey i found them to be very bland and repetitive with the expansion of wrath of the druids.
--frame rate issues and screen tearing on older pc not sure about new machines but i have heard some issues as well.
-- main story can drag out and get repetitive.
-raiding is very repetitive and always the same goal.
Well that pretty much sums up my first review please comment and let me know any feed back or just to say good job thanks for reading and if this is well reviewed i may continue to review more in the future 
--cheers apothis09!

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I'll keep this really quick. If you can get this game on sale and you already enjoy Assassin's Creed games, then this one is an easy buy. 

BUT, this game isn't the best in the series, and after 150 hours of playing, I can safely say it varies between fun and frustrating in equal measure. The top reason is that it's not REALLY a stealth game, and not entirely an AC game. It's more of a viking game with AC elements. 

Honestly, as a fan of the series, it really felt like Ubisoft gave up on any sort of 'modern era' plot that they'd been going for after Desmond Miles' death. Layla is a character I hated and thankfully we didn't have to spend much time with her in this game, but I was shocked at exactly how little time or effort is spent tying this game to other games with the modern era cast. 

As for world inside ""the Animus"", male Eivor is definitely the way to go, the voice actor is amazing. But the story is really most a long series of short stories around this character and his alliance building throughout England. Very little time is spent with series staples like the Assassins and Templars, (which in this game are still ""The Hidden Ones"" and the ""Order of the Ancients""), Eivor really isn't part of either faction, and the DLC's expand on the ISU lore mostly through the trappings of a fantasy lens filter. Most quests went fairly smoothly, except for the ones where i forced to do one of the mini-games, (like drinking game or dice game) as part of a main mission, which is a type of filler I despite. It only happened a few times, but I hate being forced to play a mini-game I don't like as a MSQ requirement. 

Overall, I found the gameplay mostly fun, the stealth kind of frustrating since it's cutting and borrowing from dissimilar systems from previous games, and the ending was very dissatisfying.  But, many of the short stories, their characters, the world exploration, and the combat was fairly fun, which is what you'll spend a lot of time doing. It's just that you'll ask yourself 'why' when you hit the end. 

I didn't finish every DLC out of fatigue, but I did finish the core game, hunting all the Order members, and everything but the end of Ragnarok. Customizing Eivor with hair, beards, tattoos, and a lot of different gear was always fun until I landed on what I felt was my 'canon' look. That was a big step up from previous games. But a big step down was that the ending seemed to put the series' fate in the hands of the villain. I'm not wild about that. 

Overall, fairly fun to play if you're aiming for axe wielding combat. If you're more of a stealthy player, this game can be frustrating for how it shoe-horns in things like half-a$%ed social stealth or a distracting cloak that feels more like a bother than a boon.  

However, the game is gorgeous, there are a ton of locations, some fun playstyles and gearing options, and a few genuinely fun stories. The negatives of the game are well-documented and true, which is why this game is a good bet if it's on a good sale, but otherwise, very skippable in this series.","Mostly Positive71% of the 17,395 user reviews for this game are positive.",quick sale already enjoy assassin creed game easy t_emphasizedhe best series 150 hour safely varies fun frustrating equal measure top not_really stealth not_entirely ac viking ac element honestly fan series ubisoft gave sort modern era plot desmond mile death layla hated thankfully spend shocked exactly effort spent tying game modern era cast world inside animus male eivor definitely voice actor amazing long series short story alliance building throughout england spent series staple assassin templar hidden one order ancient eivor faction dlc expand isu lore mostly trapping fantasy lens filter quest fairly smoothly except one forced mini game drinking dice mission type filler despite happened time hate forced mini msq requirement found mostly fun stealth kind frustrating cutting borrowing dissimilar system previous game ending dissatisfying short story character world exploration combat fairly fun spend ask finish dlc fatigue finish core hunting order member ragnarok customizing eivor hair beard tattoo different gear fun landed canon look big previous game big ending series fate hand villain not_wild fairly fun aiming axe wielding combat stealthy frustrating shoe horn thing half ed social stealth distracting cloak feel bother boon gorgeous ton location fun playstyles gearing option genuinely fun story negative documented true good bet good sale otherwise skippable series

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Hello Friends, 

Today i wish to review the game Assasins Creed Valhalla. This is technically my first playthrough with a newer Assasin Creed game. I have personally played earlier ones, but not in this new format that is open world version. It was very fun to play for me personally. Although this game sufferes from some issues, some big and low, but if you can survive thru them, you may enjoy the game. Following is a list of all bugs i have encountered in my playthough of this game:

#1. Constant crashing all the time in this game. This causes alot of problems. There is a workaround i used to temporarily fix it was to delete shader cache everytime i started new playing of game, file cache deleted everytime i started the game, set fps to 60 FPS in the game, and that did the trick. It is not a permanent fix as there is none. SO BE WARNED, the game will crash most likely.

#2. Many bugs, including armour bugs that switch in cutscenes, clipping issues with many armours, issues with the ending swithing character types in the scenes, and many smaller bugs.

Due to the above bugs, this will put off many purchasers of this game. Many people also do not like the steam version as it is required to download ubisoft connect to even play the games thru steam. This also is why there are no achievements on steam. Personally, getting acheivements do not bother me. 

So as for the game itself, It follows the adventures of the viking Eivor and how he conqueres England. There are many twists and turns in the story, and some choices can change how the ending is. Depending also how you act too in the game can change the ending. The game has so many quests and side quests, if you want to finish it, it will take you quite awhile, especially if a player takes their time to finish all of them. This is what i did and why my playtime is so high. Anyways, here is the PRO/CON list:

PROS:

- A viking saga set in the dark ages of history.
- Many side quests and lots of main quest storyline to finish.
- Beautliful world locations and great music.
- Nice voice acting for many of the characters.


CONS:

- Major crashing bugs that effect the game. At this time, no permanent fixes will completly fixes this issue.
- Many small minor bugs including swapped characters in scenes, clipping issues, and issues with maps and environment.
- The ubisoft connect store that has many microtransactions to force people to buy their special money version to buy items in the game. The opal store in the game helps a bit with buying stuff for free in the game, but you still need to hunt down opals to buy most of the stuff.


So do i recomment this game? Personally, i would rate it as neutral, as it has it's good points and bad points. The crashing is a very bad turnoff of the game. BE AWARE IF YOU DO WANT TO BUY THIS, YOU WILL CRASH WHETHER USING A NVIDIA OR AMD GRAPHICS CARD. Personally, when the game worked, i enjoyed it. I do recommend it, but only if you can ignore the constant crashing, the minor switching bugs in some scenes, and clipping issues. Otherwise, avoid this game with a 100 foot pole.","Mostly Positive71% of the 17,395 user reviews for this game are positive.",hello friend today wish assasins creed valhalla technically playthrough newer assasin creed personally earlier one not_in format open world version fun personally sufferes issue big low survive thru enjoy following bug encountered playthough 1 constant crashing cause alot problem workaround temporarily fix delete shader cache everytime started file cache deleted everytime started set shooter 60 shooter trick not_a permanent fix warned crash 2 bug including armour bug switch cutscenes clipping issue armour issue ending swithing type scene smaller bug due bug purchaser not_like version required download ubisoft connect game thru no_achievements personally acheivements not_bother follows adventure viking eivor conqueres england twist turn choice ending depending act ending quest side quest finish it_emphasized awhile especially take finish playtime high anyways pro con pro viking saga set dark age history side quest lot storyline finish beautliful world location great music nice voice acting character con major crashing bug effect no_permanent fix completly fix issue small minor bug including swapped character scene clipping issue issue map environment ubisoft connect store microtransactions force special version item opal store help bit buying stuff hunt opal stuff recomment personally rate neutral good point bad point crashing bad turnoff aware crash nvidia amd graphic card personally worked enjoyed recommend ignore constant crashing minor switching bug scene clipping issue otherwise avoid 100 foot pole
2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla commits a grave sin. It didn't kill off a beloved character nor was it a buggy mess on launch. The fault with this game is much simpler than that--It's really, REALLY, effing boring.

I will say, I have been an AC fan since the first game came out. I remember being excited for the launch and enthralled with Altair and his secretive clan of assassins. I loved the intrigue of slowly unraveling the bigger picture of the story as each new installment came out. Over the years the vision for where the franchise was going changed, and the games changed with them. Some of these changes were good, most were not. AC Valhalla represents the culmination of what is wrong with the modern take on Assassin's Creed games. 

What does one expect from an Assassin's Creed game? Let’s get to basics, cause by god we're gonna need 'em.

1) The main character is an Assassin and/or joins the order at some point.
=> Eivor is pointedly NOT an Assassin, never intends to become one, flat out says that he/she doesn't really have much interest in their cause beyond using the assassins as allies. I have not completed this game at time of writing, however it is my understanding that this does not change. In fact, while Eivor may have the hidden blade, they do not keep it actually hidden, opting instead to wear it like glorified brass knuckles and use it in head-on attacks. 

2) The main character will complete assassinations on high profile targets that involve some stealth combat.
=> There is stealth combat in this game. There are not, however, many opportunities to use it. The main story does not have the assassination targets as an objective, instead this game went the route of AC Odyssey and opted for a tree of mystery-unraveling to unveil the big players of the organization. In Odyssey that system worked with the story and was at least partially relevant to what was happening. Those characters had a reason to hate the members of the cult and want to  hunt them down. In Valhalla? I have no idea why I would bother taking down the Templar figures because Eivor isn’t even an Assassin. They want power and glory, sure, but that's such a weak motivator that it doesn’t keep the player’s interest for long.  Eivor (as a Viking) goes for a straightforward “raid and pillage” style of fighting so during missions the game often immediately puts you in combat and thus eliminates the possibility of a stealthy approach. Large scale castle raids are played this way as well. Eivor is NOT an Assassin.

3) There is a complex and engaging story.
=> This game has a good 3-4 hours in the beginning where it starts to feel like they are building a complex narrative with key players that I could buy into. Then, instead of building on that, they use it as a call to the hero’s journey and dump you smack dab in the middle of what I have begun to call the “open world grind”. Do you enjoy following objectives to the next place you need to pillage? Opening every chest to get generic ‘supplies’ so you can push a button back at your village and upgrade a shop? Killing wild animals and breaking rocks so you can fuel the upgrade machine? No? Then don’t bother playing. The game is so desperate to show the player that they have an open world to explore that they didn’t stop to write in a reason for me to do so beyond endless tiers of upgrades. The missions are also uninteresting. Go here, kill some bad guys, go there, talk to someone, etc. 

4) The game will have parkour movement that will be used in creative ways for infiltration or assassinations.
=> This game has parkour movement. It has unbelievable parkour movement. You can climb anything and everything, effortlessly  latching onto a flat wall with your spiked gloves or something I suppose because there’s clearly no other explanation. Look, far be it from me to advocate for less freedom of movement, but I remember when parkour in games felt cool because it had some limitations that required different gear, or an upgrade, or--I don’t know--some mild puzzling to figure out how to get to where you wanted to be. It feels so lifeless and uninteresting to be able to climb all over everything like a spider-monkey without even earning it. And again--Eivor is NOT AN ASSASSIN. Why do they just know how to do this? And even putting all I have said aside, stealth and parkour just isn’t super relevant to completing objectives in AC Valhalla. Story missions are straightforward assault battles.

5) Interesting setting.
=> This reason is much more subjective, but honestly I think it’s still a valid point for reasons I’ll expand upon. Vikings just feel…very done as a concept right now, in my opinion. Obviously this game was conceptualized years ago, but it just doesn’t hit as an unexplored interesting locale and time period to set an AC game. However even beyond my opinion, the color palette is definitely limited by this setting. I was getting flashbacks to the drab, boring and ugly locations in Assassin’s Creed 3, and that’s not a good thing. The game is pitched as a Viking raider vs English townspeople struggle for power but somehow also tries to convince me that the Vikings were the good guys and all of the people who lived on that land are corrupt. Like ok sure the king might be selfish and a despot but was the farmer and his family? You know, the one I just mugged for supplies during a raid? I’m not saying that the main character of a game has to be a good guy but when you try and convince me they are while also asking me to pillage towns it just rings hollow. 

There is more I could say that I haven't even touched on (pointless boat transit, equally pointless city management systems, etc.), but this review is already quite long and I don’t want it to double in length. I guess what you should know is:

TL;DR--Valhalla is an extremely boring game that fails to give the player any motivation to keep playing it. It is an aimless and drab experience of half-considered systems and features that feel shoved-in to justify the title of Assassin’s Creed. It did not need to be an Assassin’s Creed game, nor was it compelling enough to have existed as a standalone title. It is a vapid example of a game that might be designed by some corporate AI that seeks to check off boxes rather than make something truly interesting.

Also in case you were on edge on what edition to buy I would recommend the base game, you can grab the deluxe edition if you want some basic equipment to give you more options early on. Then after getting your own opinion on the game you can just grab the complete edition later as the DLC's haven't been relevant to my experience so far 25 hours in. Also if you have Amazon prime make sure to pick up the reward for an Elven shield and bow + cosmetics.

The complete edition is also available on Ubisoft+ for 15 USD.



1. The game is enjoyable as hell and mostly without issues and bugs that take away your

2. No steam achievements sucks, but also irrelevant to my own enjoyment.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"[h1]Ubisoft's interpretation of an open world adventure. [/h1]

Assassin's Creed Valhalla. A typical Ubisoft game. A so called Ubisoft Original. A great open world bottlenecked by a ""storyline"" that's okay-ish at best but why did i hit the recommend button? Most likely because there is still no neutral review option on Steam.

[u]Gameplay & Open World [/u]
As i previously mentioned, the open world of AC: Valhalla is fantastic. There is no shortage of serene landscapes, astonishing pieces of architectures and vivid cities. In one moment you're daydreaming in colorful fields with a chill spring breeze down your neck and moments later you're knee deep in gloomy, disease-ridden swamps. Green forests, tall mountains, freezing cold regions as well as crypts: This game's design is incredibly diverse and exciting. I must admit that i'm not really into ancient nordic history and mythology yet Ubisoft has created a world that's simply breathtaking even for modern gaming standards. In addition to that, the environment is filled with some minor world events like in Red Dead Redemption 2 and some small yet fun activites like tabletop games, drinking duels and flyting competitions. 

The gameplay is not really much different to the previous Assassins Creed titles. As a matter of fact the mechanics feel not much different to those from Origins and Oddysey. The enemies in Valhalla are wide-ranging but have been mostly taken over from the mentioned earlier titles in the series with a few new yet neat additions. Some enemy types are archers, brutes, swift lightweights, pikemen and the new pyromancers. No worries though, every one of them feels unique and do offer an own arsenal of attacks and weaknesses. You, as the protagonist, can choose between light or heavy axes, greatswords, hammers, daggers, shortswords, a variety of shields,different bow types and plenty more. There is a playstyle suited for everybody. Furthermore, the skill trees aren't just simply base stats improvers but contain entire new attacks and animations that can be used as an advantage during combat.

As someone who played both AC Origins and Odyssey i was kinda afraid of the non-stop grinding that took the fun out of both games for me. Luckily, the gear and weapons do not have any level locks anymore! Yet what remains are level-locked regions. Sure, you can move to those regions at any given time but you'll get mauled by wolves because they're a much higher level than you. Okay, maybe it's not that severe but enemies will be alot stronger than you even though they're the exact same ones as in the other regions. Instead of farming XP you'll spend a great amount of time gathering materials for your own settlement in order to build new buildings such as vendors or stalls. A similar feature was introduced  in AC: Brotherhood. If you plan to build your own collony be ready to raid settlements with your crew and if you plan to improve your armor prepare for a search through the entire world as the crafting materials are in hidden containers throughout the map. They are marked on the (mini)-map though once you come close to them! 

[u]Story[/u]
Why did i put the word ""story-line"" in quote marks earlier? That's because there is no real storyline. Rather a dozen of major side quests that will lead to the grand final. Those are linked with each other but you can choose the order as you like. Thus there is no real main antagonist but plenty of minor ones. The below average story line with its shallow and stereotypical characters is definetely the number one weakpoint of AC Valhalla. At least half of the time you spend helping out other settlements and each region has its own unique story arc. Moreover, you can choose Eivors gender and between a few hairstyles and tattoos. Most of which you have to purchase with ingame money at vendors. Just like Kassandra being canonically accurate in Odyssey, i recommend playing as male Eivor. In my opinion his voice actor did a fantastic job.

[u] Identity crisis and the lack of realism [/u]
Remember when Ubisoft removed crossbows from a game because they were not historically accurate? Those times are no more: AC Valhalla feels like a fantasy game with glowing weapons and colorful skins. Eivor is walking around in heavy plated knight armor. Aren't assassins supposed to be light on their feet? This game feels like anything BUT an Assassin's Creed. Ubisoft being Ubisoft, there are plenty of microtransactions. Microtransactions.. in a full price singleplayer game.. sigh.. I guess we have to thank Bethesda for its horse armor DLC back in Oblivion. The good thing is that they're clearly optional and don't affect the story. The bad thing is that they simply exist. Even single player gaming is becoming a money milking industry with Ubisoft and EA being the pioneers.

[u] Final thoughts [/u]
.. but should you buy it? The answer is pretty simple. Do you like the Ubisoft open world formula? Did you enjoy Origins and Oddysey? Do you like free roaming and exploring? Then go ahead, this game is worth the price. Do you want to enjoy and concentrate on a fleshed out storyline with unforgettable characters and decisions? Make sure you  stay way clear from this title. A great game that focuses on an amazing storyline around the nordic mythology is God Of War, which is a unique masterpiece. For achievement hunters it is crucial to mention that the Steam version doesnot have any achievements and trading cards for whatever reason. However, there is a pretty decent photo mode which i personally enjoy very much!

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"Unfortunately a big disappointment

I can't recommend this game. I guess it's fine to play it just once. After Origins and Odyssey, which were both superb games, I expected much more from AC Valhalla, but sadly I found it to be a downgrade from previous games, in almost every aspect.
Short-story: Valhalla is not so fun compared to its predecessors, and much more forgettable. Also, it borrows too much from the older games.
Below I will leave some hints on what to expect, based on my opinion after completing the game:
- Graphics look good and the viking-theme is interesting, but the setting is not better than Ancient Egypt or Greece; of course this would not be a problem IF all this big map wouldn't look the same
- Following the above, there are a lot of points of interest to complete, which should encourage the player to explore them, however they are just too repetitive and get boring quite quickly. Therefore, I would say that exploration is not rewarded enough, both visually (e.g. nice new places to discover) and as in-game rewards (e.g. new gear); some view points are in the middle of nowhere, far from anything, and seem to be placed randomly
- Another bad/frustrating element about the exploration/looting would be that any chest and other insignificant collectible is made as a puzzle, which is not quite funny after a while
- The game seems just too easy; I understand that it is made for the large public, but higher difficulties just make the game more time-consuming and not harder, at least in my opinion
- I did not enjoy the boring dialogues, repetitive quests and some of the voice acting; characters are easy to forget, I skipped a lot!
- Stealth feels broken: sometimes is works, sometimes it behaves strangely (e.g you can be seen through obstacles, detected from afar, not spotted at all)
- The combat: I'll just say it's for sure worse than in Origins/Odyssey
- Furthermore, the skill tree seems complicated and challenging at first, which would be a good thing for an RPG, but they really don't matter that much and are just small perks; some of the skills are special abilities, still most of them just improve your stats and you won't really notice any difference; I personally didn't like the leveling system (one quest gives you 2 skills points to spend). Last but not least, in the end you get all the skills so the feeling of building your character according to your playstyle is gone
- The game crashes constantly and this seems to be a common problem that has not been solved for quite a long time, despite of many complaints; UBI launcher has problems - constantly not being able to sync, logging out and sending verification emails without a reason
- There are quite a few bugs and glitches, nothing too serious, but together with the crashes and long loading times it can get frustrating
- No achievements on steam; while this is not a big deal for me, I realized that the community complained and I approve that there is no reason why they wouldn't add them
- Weird camera angles and focus sometimes

Now some good things:
- Music is still good, still not at the same level as previous 2 titles
- Horse mechanics seem to be improved, training is a good idea but it needs more elements
- Both male and female main characters are likeable and seem equal this time
- Fps is constant and the game runs well (besides the crashes and long loading times)
- Character customization is fine, I had a lot of in-game currency to purchase what I wanted from the merchant; you can get as free rewards items that you will normally have to pay for, also there are some bonus rewards that you can get with UBI credits and you have a lot of options regarding paid stuff.

Verdict: 
I do not recommend it. I can't say that you must avoid it, you may give it a try, I'm sure some will like it, just don't have high expectations like I had. Anyway, I would not pay the full price but wait for a sale.
Please note that I did not try the DLCs and do not plan to get them. My opinion is that their price is too high, just to extend the game that is. Basic version is already big, try it and then get the DLCs (on sale!), if you really liked it.
There is more to be told about the game, but this review is already quite long and I hope it's enough for an opinion. I also hope that I don't seem to be complaining too much but sadly that is my honest opinion.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I have played 100+ hrs on Playstation and I've seen 100% of the base game. It was a mistake 

AC Valhalla is not a bad game, but it's not Assasins Creed...Ubisoft could have just named this game ""Valhalla"" and it would be better, but it's Ubisoft so no, lets milk the name. A lot of boring quests, repetitive open world missions, bland characters, mediocre combat, bugs glitches and on PC I really feel that the game was made to be played with a controller, with keyboard and mouse it's very clunky. Audio is terrible, high music and effects, very low dialogue and dialogue boost option in settings doesn't help. Loading times are pretty fucking long compared to the PS5s for some reason and my PC has faster storage than the PS5, so it's probably intentional. DENUVO...why? Story is ok, gets boring after a while, cause it's mostly the same stuff. One think I really liked was the music in this game, they did an amazing job with the OST with Einar Selvik.

2 years after release, the game finally came to Steam, without achievements, no steam cloud saves, no actual steam features like trading cards (Origins and Odyssey both released with those things). I wonder what's even the point of releasing this game on Steam. Oh wait I know, basically a cash grab. To be honest it is expected form Ubisoft and I knew all of these things before I got the game, still it's frustrating. Every time I close the game the Ubisoft Shit Connect launcher tells me that I've been logged out due to inactivity and I gotta re-enter my credentials. When I buy a game from Steam I expect to be able to play it if I have only Steam installed, what's the point of having a million game launchers for each title? The biggest problem is that the Ubisoft app is garbage. If I wanted to play the game from there I would have bought it on the ShitConnect app, not on Steam. Currently Ubisoft employees are deleting steam discussions, where people are compaining about the missing features for the game. That's what they do in their free time, cause obviously making games is so easy, just copy and paste and boom a 70$ AAA title. 

I definitely do NOT RECOMMEND AC Valhalla. Even if all of the features were not missing and the game was released on Steam properly I just do not think that it is worth your time. Ubisoft is so shit and it's been shit for more than 7 years with their AC wannabe RPG games.

2208920,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,"I played this game on Ubisoft connect before it came to steam and was happy when they announced it was coming to steam even if it is 2 years late. Im not a big fan of the new AC games, but I would say its much better than odyssey, but not as good as origins.

Sadly I cannot recommend this game right now, as its release on steam seems like more of a cash grab than an actual thoughtful release. There is no steam achievements, trading cards or any of the steam features that both origins and odyssey had on steam. And to make things worse, Ubisoft devs are banning and deleting discussion threads in the steam forums that dare to criticize these missing features.

It makes Ubisoft look really bad when their return to steam after 3 years is a low effort steam release, and their devs going out of there way to silence the steam users who expected better after waiting 2 years for this game. It feels like a spit in the face.

Also Ubisoft connect is a buggy, glitchy piece of trash. When origins and odyssey released they were still using uplay, which while not ideal, could be mostly ignored as it just opened in the background, but since valhalla released, ubisoft ""upgraded"" to ubisoft connect which is still plagued with issues after years. It randomly logs me out my account every time I quit the game because it ""can't upload save game to the cloud"", and every time I open Ubi connect I have to give it permission to make changes to my PC 3 times before it will open. These and a bunch of other bugs make it horrible to use and theres really no reason for it to exist at all other than for Ubi to spy on their users and collect user data.

686810,Hell Let Loose,As an old guy who is new to online FPS this game is very tough. It is on the realistic side.  One shot will usually kill you or the enemy.   Artillery and tank fire is devastating.   I died  at least 20 times before I even saw my first enemy.   I finally fired my gun after about two hours of playing.   And it took me about 4 hours of playing before I actually killed an enemy.  I appreciate it is difficult.  It makes any success I have more rewarding.  The game looks fantastic and it plays very well.  I am sure if you have any FPS online experience it will go easier for you.  Newbies should take baby steps and have patience.  Spend a lot of time being a grunt infantryman.  Learn the game until you move on to other jobs.  I have joined empty servers just to practice throwing grenades.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"[b]To preface:[/b] [i]A lot of the issues I have with the game in its current state (as well as the state it was in when I wrote this review) have now been adressed by the developers and promises have been made to remedy those issues. But as we all know, promises are easy to make and hard to keep, so until there are actually significant improvements, this review will stay as negative (also Steam doesn't allow neutral recommendations).[/i]

Well, I've sunk over 2000 hours into this game. I've met a lot of good friends in this game's community. And until a few weeks ago, I would've wholeheartedly recommended this game to any of my friends looking for a more hardcore WW2 shooter without going down the rabbit hole of full realism.

So why the negative review?

It's really simple. Black Matter, the original developers of the game, had their issues. Their updates weren't perfect, but they at least tried to get the worst issues fixed as soon as possible via hotfixes, sometimes within a week. And they were quite tardy with content updates up to the point that stuff that was promised for 2021 wasn't even in the 2022 version, but they at least made the impression that they were working on them.

But now Team17 has taken over. Yep, the Worms NFT guys. They paid over 40 million for the IP, came in with a long-winded video in which they were talking about their devotion to historical accuracy and the player base. 

What we got was a half-baked British faction with WWI weaponry, no alternative uniforms and glaring historical inaccuracies plus a bunch of QoL issues and new bugs, and no hotfixes but an ANNOUNCEMENT that some bugs will be fixed over a month after they've been introduced. 

Now some people might say the Brit update was Black Matter's last creation before the takeover. But still, T17 deemed it fit for public consumption and released it in the state it currently is in.

Oh, and there's also been a price hike. Because new bugs cost money.

They also announced a new gamemode - with what possibly is the most abysmal, half-assed trailer you've seen north of a PS2-era cutscene that made many of the devoted players really question their dedication to the game. And judging by their track record so far, hopes for it are - as is to be expected - pretty low.

All of this does not bode well for the game's future, and similar games that are in development cannot come out too quickly because it looks like the HLL ship is sinking fast, brother. And Team 17 is drilling more and more holes into the hull.

So, to sum it up: 
The game itself is fine in its basics, but declining in quality sharply lately. Still worth checking out, so maybe not dismiss it out of hand. But since all new purchases will now go directly into Team 17's pocket and he best way consumers can leave feedback for a product is with their wallets, I absolutely would not recommend paying full price for it. Wait for a big sale or get the key from somewhere else for less money.","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",preface issue state state wrote adressed developer promise remedy issue promise easy hard significant improvement stay negative allow neutral recommendation sunk 2000 hour met good friend community week ago wholeheartedly recommended friend hardcore ww2 shooter rabbit hole realism negative simple black matter original developer issue update perfect tried worst issue fixed soon possible via hotfixes week tardy update stuff promised 2021 2022 version impression working team17 taken yep worm nft guy paid 40 million ip long winded video talking devotion historical accuracy base half baked british faction wwi weaponry no_alternative uniform glaring historical inaccuracy plus bunch qol issue bug no_hotfixes an_emphasizednouncement bug fixed introduced brit black matter last creation takeover t17 deemed fit public consumption released state currently oh price hike bug cost announced gamemode possibly abysmal half assed trailer north ps2 era cutscene devoted player question dedication judging track record far hope expected pretty low not_bode future similar game development cannot_come quickly look hll ship sinking fast brother 17 drilling hole hull sum fine basic declining quality sharply lately worth checking maybe not_dismiss hand purchase directly 17 pocket best consumer leave feedback product wallet not_recommend paying price wait big sale key else

686810,Hell Let Loose,"A detailed HLL review/overview |June 3 2022 

Hell Let Loose is THE best WW2 game I have played, it's less hardcore than a game such as Post Scriptum and therefore is enjoyable for casual gamers but is challenging enough to satisfy Hardcore players.
If you want to win in this game you must work together, this means running with your squad, listening to your Squad Leader and communicating often, lone wolfs generally have a lower overall score than someone who plays with his squad, kills do not count for many points but are satisfying nonetheless, especially the *tink* sound of headshots.

Before you start your HLL experience make sure you have a functioning microphone, communication wins games and you don't want to be having to stop every 10 seconds to type something.

Building ""garrisons"" in this game is super important, they are the static point at which your entire team can spawn at, they require a Squad Leader and a support player to build, the support drops ""supplies"" and the SL builds the ""garri"".
Each Squad Leader can also build an 'Outpost or OP', this is a mini garrison that only your squad can deploy on.
Enemy garrisons can be destroyed by blowing them up with  bazooka/panzerschrek/tank rounds or just dismantling them manually. Removing an enemy garrison is very important because they can only be built every 200m and thus giving your team greater map control.

You can either play as Infantry, Armour, Recon or Commander.

Infantry is the main source of aggression and defence in the game, they push the objectives, protect your tanks and cap points while also defending positions while other squads attack the point. You are awarded points when you are in enemy and friendly territory so staying back and defending captured positions nets you just as much points as attacking while also allowing you to have the defenders advantage of the enemy pushing right infront of your gun.

My personal favourite is Armor, you play as a 3 man squad (Driver, Gunner and Spotter) it is your task to eliminate enemy tanks and support the infantry, it is adrenaline filled fun and hugely exciting.
 
The driver role is much more than just ""driving"" you need to listen to your spotter who will be telling you where to position the vehicle and you also have a hull MG for infantry suppression, it is your responsibility to keep your frontal armor facing the enemy. 

The gunner is more self evident; you shoot things, but it also takes skill and patience to place a shot from 700m+ and hit the right spot to do the most damage, especially if you are outgunned by a heavier tank.

Lastly the spotter, this position is very important, you have a periscope which enables you to see the enemy from long ranges, this means you may be telling your gunner to shoot somewhere so far away he/she cannot see the target and are relying on you to use the marking system (called pinging) to see targets. The driver also relies on you to help find a path through the countryside because he only has a small window slit to see through, so again, communication is key. 
You are in overall charge of the tank and it is recommended you play the ""Tank Commander"" role from the Spotter position so you can mark targets swiftly and communicate with other leaders effectively. 

Tanks on the German side are the Puma Armored Car(50mm), Luchs light tank, (armed with 20mm autocannon) Panther medium tank (very mobile but hard hitting medium tank with a 75mm gun) and the Heavy Tiger tank (slow and methodical beast with it's massive 88mm gun)

Tanks on the Allied/Soviet Side are the Greyhound armored car (37mm gun), Stuart Light tank (37mm) the 75mm and 76mm Sherman Jumbo's, BA-10 recon car, T-34/76 and IS-1 Heavy tank. 

The recon role is a two man team consisting of a Spotter (binoculars) and a sniper who has either a 4x scope (Americans, Soviet) or a 8x scope (Germans). While there is a massive difference in zoom between the two scopes, the smaller zoom on the American/Soviet rifle allows for quicker and more aggressive up close play (100m-250m) while the german scope is cumbersome therefore encourages you to finding a nice position and picking the enemy off from 250m-500m. Recon is responsible for either helping your team push by taking out high value targets such as MG's, officers or other Recon Squads but can also slip behind the lines and destroy enemy garrisons and resource nodes (more on those later). 
Unlike regular Squads which can only place their OP two ""red squares"" back, recon can place theirs anywhere which enables deep flanks and stealth missions. 



The Squad Leader role.
Playing the SL role is rewarding but does come with a lot of responsibility, your 6 man squad is relying on you to make informed and quick decisions on a tactical level, i.e. Do you move to the exposed flank and hold it from a vantage point such as a farmhouse and prevent the enemy from streaming through, or do you be more aggressive and try to flank yourself while having to worry about your comrades being hit from that exposed flank? 
At first it can be a bit overwhelming (you have Command chat and squad chat in your ears). I would suggest you try the other roles (especially the Support role) before you attempt to play as an SL. The key to this role is communication, patience and also making snap decisions as well as taking advice from other squad members. Your main role is to push the points with your squad, flank the enemy, mark enemy movement on the map, build garrisons to support the push and communicate with other SL's and the Commander constantly, all while under fire and trying to figure out where the enemy are.


The Commander role.
The Commander is responsible for major Strategic decisions and influencing the flow of battle. The role can be played in a few different ways, some prefer to get down and dirty building defensive or offensive garrisons and being closer to the front line, whereas others prefer to sit further back and direct traffic from their map (more like an RTS game) and micromanage.

For the Commander to be effective he/she needs resources, and the only way to acquire them is for SL's to have 2 members of their squad (support for the supplies, and an engineer to build) build "" nodes"", these consist of munitions, manpower and fuel.
Munitions are used for artillery and anti-tank gun shells as well as enabling the Commander to drop ""supplies"" on a chosen position (as well as other abilities). SL's and their Squads can use these supplies to build nodes, garrisons or just to fortify a chosen area (engineers can build bunkers etc with supplies, anti-tank can build AT-guns). Manpower enables the Commander to use specific offensive/defensive abilities while fuel allows the Commander to spawn in tanks, and recon vehicles.

Naturally, if the Commander has no resources because players have not built nodes they cannot do these things, and as anyone who has played an RTS knows, No resources= no win.
It is highly advisable that you DO NOT play Commander until you are very comfortable playing the SL role, because it is much more nuanced and does require you to be a stingy bugger, you need to make hard decisions and prepare to take the blame if it back fires in your face. 
You need to delegate tactical responsibility to the SL's via the command channel, and focus on the greater strategical picture. My advice is to be firm but not a tyrant, every SL will be telling you ""we need supplies here"" or ""we need a bombing run here"", it is up to you to decide whether they actually need those things or if they could be better put to good use and send them another squad to help out instead.

You can also earn XP (and support your team) by driving supply trucks to and from the front line laden with supplies for the engineers.

This turned out to be a mammoth review and I hope it helps anyone who was sitting on the fence about buying the game, it is 100% worth it and the community (Australian at least) is very welcoming and helpful.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I have logged 29 hours so far on this game. Sure, probably not impressive. But I'm a dad, married and have a needy dog. Logging that many hours is a big deal to me because that means I successfully snuck that many hours of gameplay in. So, if you're someone like me that loves video games but has to sneak away at night after the spouse falls asleep and the kids are down for the count after 13 bed time stories, keep on reading.

I bought HLL in lieu of Battlefield 2042. I have logged many years of gameplay on the Battlefield series. But, the reviews came out and I was let down. So, I browsed and browsed for a game to play. I have experience on Squad, liked it, but it wasn't fully drawing me in. Was very complex. A fun game (definitely check it out), but there was so much going on I just couldn't commit. Hell Let Loose is very simliar to squad. So, I'mma break this down as best I can.

What I like: 

o 1 shot 1 kill, for the most part. It's hardcore. Literally. Don't worry about pumping rounds into people's bodies. One shot will do.

o Games can last for 1.5 hours, so you get REALLY into it. You have to, just so the game can end.

o It is extremely well balanced. It doesn't matter if you are level 3 and the other team is level 132. You all get the same guns. Snipers get scopes. That's it. None of this ""oh well in WW2 they had a type of red dot site"" garbage that some games do. Nah, fam. That carbine? Iron sites. That STG-44? Iron sites. That LMG? Iron sites, my guy. Which is great, because that means when you die, it wasn't from some garbage or BS. It was a legitimate kill.

o The community is fantastic. I was so lost when I joined my first server. Had no clue what was going on. I hopped into the ""recon"" squad and was the spotter. Told the dude ""Hey man. First time playing this. What do I do?"" You know what his response was? ""Not a problem man! I'll walk you through it."" This dude literally explained how this game worked for me in one match. It was fantastic. When you join regular infantry squads, I have had the same experience. ""Hey, how do I do nodes? How do I mark things?"" The community has been my favorite part. They're all there to have fun, and they hate toxic individuals. Very rarely do I encounter someone who is toxic. And if they're a dee-eye-see-kay, they usually get booted from the game.

o Are you a tank guy? You like driving around in track vehicles shooting big rounds? You can do that and not get destroyed by a squad full of rocket launcher dudes. Nah, each squad gets 1 person to have an anti tank launcher. Which means it takes coordination and team work to take down armored vehicles. Don't worry, to run a tank? You need 3 people. Everyone plays a role in the tank, not just 1 person. You need driver, gunner and tank commander. So, that helps offset the fact that they're giant beasts and gives the guys on the ground a fighting chance.

There's a couple others, but overall, this game is exactly what I was looking for. Big maps, great graphics, SO MUCH CHAOS oh man the audio! It's insane. Artillery blowing up everywhere, machine guns ripping over your head to where your screen goes blurry and you got the spins like it's St. Patty's Day and you're in Boston.

But overall, it's just the balance of the game. No squad can be overpowering and dominating. No vehicle is overpowering. It's all balanced as it should be, because neither succeed unless everyone works together.

So, if you're like me who's a sort-of-casual-player-but-also-wants-to-be-hardcore, get this game. It's a breath of fresh air from Battlefield, the community is great, and it's nice to play a game where everyone is communicating but also, for the most part, treats each other with respect.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I have nearly 4,000 hours in this game. Team17 recently bought this game and is wholly incompetent with updating this game. There are 6 major issues.

1) Recent updates didn't fix any major outstanding bugs, and instead added new ones like a double reload animation on bolt rifles, XP not being awarded for duplicate actions, and several others. 

2)They released the British faction with historically inauthentic British uniforms, incorrect dates on loading screens, and incorrectly themed weapons like naval SMG's for infantry units and ww1 bolt rifles / machine gun during a ww2 themed game.

3) Not only was this faction historically inaccurate, but it was unbalanced in the negative. Their guns sway more than existing guns, their guns take up more screen space than existing guns (making it harder to see targets), their weapon spread across classes leaves them outgunned by the Germans, Russians, and Americans. The heavy tank for the British faction is using pre-armor overhaul driving mechanics and it's front armor isn't working properly. In short, the faction is trash. 

4) Most controversially, they increased the run speed for all infantry by 15% which allows infantry to effectively chase down heavy tanks and zigzag across open fields effectively. This change was not asked for and it has ripple effects through the game - Negatively impacting armor, small unit tactics, medic's usefulness, etc. The best part - Black Matter (the previous developers) used to have this 15% increase and in Update 8 they outlined EXACTLY WHY they lowered the run speed in the first place (it was for game balance, pacing, and to prevent zig zagging). Team17 didn't do any homework into the history of the previous developers and why game design decisions were made and instead decided to make a muck of the meta just because. 

5) Team17 also decided to add a new game mode which only can contain 50 players total instead of the 100 players total of every currently existing server. Which means people hosting servers will have to purchase an entire new server simply to host this new game mode. Never mind that the new game mode is antithetical to the premise of hell let loose in the first place and wasn't really asked for by serious players of Hell Let Loose.

6) The icing on the cake was the Devotion to Duty trailer which was so embarrassingly bad they had to take down from their official Youtube account and publicly apologize for. It still exists by PC Gamer channel if you want to look at the pure mediocrity.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"My very first game on HLL: I join a server, select the Allies, enter an open squad (yes, they can be locked) and select a machinegunner. As soon as the match begins the squad's officer asks via voip if there are any new players. I answer ""me"", ask him and my other squaddies to forgive me if I make mistakes, and the squad leader just laughs it off and tells me ""no worries, just follow my directions, keep your eyes sharp and your ears sharper and you'll do fine"". And then, we start moving towards a quaint French town called Carentan. 

""See that church at the center of the map?"", the squad leader tells us. ""Our orders are to occupy it and defend the area no matter the costs. Watch out for windows and rubble because there'll be Krauts everywhere."" And there WERE lots of Krauts in the area. I run forward in the open like a headless chicken, and a German rifleman shoots me in the torso. I crumple to the ground, as the noises all around me grow duller and duller and my vision starts to blur as life abandons me. 

""Don't let go and hang in there mate!"", the squad's medic shouts. So I wait, while the medic tosses a smoke grenade to conceal his movements, reaches my dying frame and brings me back to the realm of the living with a quick morphine shot. ""Now dive for cover! Go behind those barrels over there!"", he tells me, which I eagerly do, still bleeding out. Once behind cover, the medic pulls out the bandages and starts to apply a field dressing, while the squad leader checks the surroundings with his binoculars.

""Enemy infantry in those windows! Shoot, damn it!"", and before I ask him exactly which window, he points me a specific one in the distance. I squint my eyes as hard as I can, and notice that there are indeed a couple of indistinct shapes looking at us. I then deploy my mighty M1919 heavy machinegun, ignoring the gunshots that plink all around me, and start laying down a withering hail of suppressive fire against that and nearby windows. I doubted I ever got a single kraut, but that wasn't what mattered - what mattered was that the jerries had no way of peeking out of those windows without getting mulched. With me supporting their advance, the remainder of my squad moves towards the building under the cover of smoke grenades, while our riflemen toss as many grenades inside the windows as they can. I hear gunshots coming from the buildings, a couple of players curse as they get downed while the squad leader shouts ""I've got 'em, I've got 'em! Come here gunner, we need your mg!"" 

I make a mad dash towards the building right as a hail of enemy machinegun fire is poured into the smoke, not aiming at anybody in particular but still managing to hit me - again - and cause me to bleed. Nevertheless, I manage to get inside the building and get the medic to patch me up again. ""This is becoming a habit, mate. I should start to charge you for every dressing"", he jokes. We both laugh, at least until a kraut tosses a grenade inside a nearby window, something the medic does not notice. ""Grenade right behind you! Run!"", I yell at him. We both run as far away from that room as possible right as the grenade goes off, I emerge unscathed from the blast but the medic is hit and starts bleeding. ""Cover me while I patch myself up"", he asks me, but right at that moment one of our squaddies who was garrisoning the building's ground floor yells ""OH s**t, they're insi-"" before an SMG burst causes him to scream. Realizing that there's only one way up the building and that I am right in front of the stairs, I lay on the ground and deploy my machinegun yet again. A kraut climbs the stairs and runs right in front of my machinegun, getting riddled with bullets and falling on the spot. Two more krauts enter after him, both of which get similarly cut down while I yell ""they're coming! Right up the stairs!"". A friendly rifleman arrives, tosses a couple of grenades down the stairs, and I see torn human limbs flying everywhere. ""Germs're sanitized"", he shouts back. The squad leader laughs it off, congratulates us both, and then orders us to keep marching towards the church at the center of Carentan. It's only 100 meters away from our position, but due to a german Tiger parked right in front of it and at least two German platoons, it might as well be miles and miles away.

The Tiger is relentless in its attempts to kill every single yank its spotter sees. At least until a Sherman outflanks and destroys it with its powerful 76 mm gun. Suddenly the tide of the battle has been turned, and the germans are the ones desperately scrambling away from that hulk of steel on tracks, falling back inside the church. Around the church, artillery fire starts falling on the battlefield like rain, tearing to pieces any soldier unfortunate enough to get hit. Undaunted, our assault specialist throws a couple of smoke grenades before getting cut down by submachinegun fire. His heroic sacrifice allows us to enter inside the church in relative safety and engage the last kraut holdouts in a desperate close quarters battle they are hopelessly outmatched for due to their bolt-action rifles and the elevated number of automatic and semi-automatic firearms we possess. 

At long last, the church of Carentan has fallen into Allied hands, but we do not even have the time to pat on each other's shoulders that a massive artillerly barrage rains all around the church. Allied soldiers who aren't quick or lucky enough to get inside are pulverized by the concentrated explosive fire, the sherman that was covering us gets blown to smithereens, and all that's left to defend the capture point is our 5-men squad and a rifleman from another platoon who somehow made it to the church by the skin of his teeth. 

""They're couterattacking. Run for the bell tower!"", our squad leader orders us. We dash for the church's bell tower like madmen, while the rifleman straggler tosses a couple of grenades to cover our retreat. Finally at the top of the bell tower, I realize that it is spacious enough to give us ample room for manoeuvers, gives us a very nice overlook of the entire town, and has only one way in or out. ""Defend the bell tower at all costs, G*ddammit!"", I hear the squad leader scream. Thus, I pick a spot with a clean line of sight to the stairs and deploy my trusty machinegun again. 

Kraut soldiers start coming our way, in unorganized waves that get mercilessly scythed down at first, and in coordinated attacks with grenades, smoke grenades and submachinegunners later. Me and the straggler get shot again, but the medic in our team quickly bandages up again. It is only in that moment that I realise my machinegun is completely out of ammo. ""Out of ammo!"", I yell to my squaddies, which prompts the straggler to drop an ammo box right next to me. Thanking him, I proceed to restock while the Germans keep on assaulting our position. The situation grows more and more desperate until, at long last, it happens.

Allied reinforcements arrive, three whole platoons of soldiers supporter by a Sherman Jumbo. Realising that they have been beaten, the krauts cease their attempts to storm the bell tower and focus on the attackers. It is at that moment that our squad leader orders us on the offensive. With the desperation that only a cornered animal can muster, we toss the very last two grenades we have down the stairway and catch the german defenders in a devastating pincer attack. The church of Carentan is now ours once again, for real this time. The squad leader congratulates us all, me in particular. ""You did very well for a first timer, mate"" - he tells me - ""now try to keep it up with the two remaining capture points. Let's go!""

686810,Hell Let Loose,"This review is written from the perspective of someone who has predominantly played Battlefield, and only Battlefield, since 1942 came out when I was in high school. Therefore it draws heavily on comparison between the two games, not to try to contribute to any kind of rivalry, but because it's really my only frame of reference. I'm in my mid-30s with a full-time job, so most would probably consider me a filthy casual, but I've been playing long enough to not be completely clueless.

With that said:

Hell Let Loose is the kind of epic scale, cooperative shooter that I always wanted Battlefield to be. When BF2042 came out and abandoned many of the core ideas that drew me to the series initially, I turned to Hell Let Loose out of desperation. I'm glad I did, because HLL is chock-full of those ostensibly ""only in Battlefield"" moments that keep you coming back.

If you're coming to the game from Battlefield like me, it's important to note that this is a far less arcade-y, far more strategic game. When I got started, I was constantly getting one-shotted a few seconds after spawning. Because getting it wrong is so punishing, HLL forces you to learn about good positioning and battlefield awareness. In fact, I noticed that after a few months of playing HLL that when I went back to BFV, my play had improved significantly. While definitely more hardcore than Battlefield, once I adapted I didn't find gameplay significantly more difficult or tedious, or less action-packed.

Is the game perfect? No, definitely not. It's not as polished as a AAA game, the graphics are good but not spectacular, performance isn't always great, and many of the mechanics are boring and/or frustrating (artillery, resource nodes). But the most significant factor that has made it easy to look past these complaints is the awesome community.

I had not played other, more hardcore shooters (like Squad or Post Scriptum) before, but the veterans I played with were friendly and helpful and helped me quickly acclimate. While I regularly play with a friend, unlike in Battlefield, it's not a night and day different experience between squadding up with friends and squadding up with randoms. Mic use is prevalent (in fact, I wouldn't recommend playing without one) and I've had many, many games on public servers with a full squad communicating and working together. It's awesome. 

I'll end with a tip about the game that I wish I had known before I started. Obviously, it's not a game that you win by K/D ratio alone, but then neither is Battlefield. But unlike Breakthrough or Frontlines, it's not even really about attacking or defending cap points, either. While these things are all obviously important components, at its heart this is really a game about SPAWN POINTS: building your own (garrisons, outposts) and finding and destroying the enemy's. Without actively prioritizing both of these things, I rarely see teams win, even if they're doing everything else correctly.

In short, this game saved me from the pit of sadness I experienced after the disappointment that was BF2042. I've played a ton over the past few months, and almost every game is fresh, dynamic and chaotic. It's taken on the mantle of delivering the large-scale, historical combined arms combat experience it seems DICE is no longer able to deliver. In many ways, I consider it the true spiritual successor to the original Battlefield 1942 I fell in love with so many years ago.","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",written perspective someone predominantly battlefield battlefield 1942 high school draw heavily comparison game not_to contribute kind rivalry frame reference mid 30 probably consider filthy casual long not_be completely clueless hell loose kind epic scale cooperative shooter wanted battlefield bf2042 abandoned core idea drew series initially turned hell loose desperation glad hll chock ostensibly battlefield moment coming coming battlefield important note far arcade far strategic started constantly shotted second spawning wrong punishing hll force learn good positioning battlefield awareness noticed month hll bfv improved significantly definitely hardcore battlefield adapted significantly difficult tedious action packed perfect no_definitely not_it not_as polished a_emphasizedaa graphic good not_spectacular performance great mechanic boring frustrating artillery resource node significant factor easy look past complaint awesome community not_played hardcore shooter squad post scriptum veteran friendly helpful helped quickly acclimate regularly friend unlike battlefield not_a night different squadding friend squadding randoms mic prevalent recommend many_emphasized game public server squad communicating working awesome tip wish known started obviously not_a win k ratio alone neither_is battlefield unlike breakthrough frontlines not_even attacking defending cap point thing obviously important component heart spawn point building garrison outpost finding destroying enemy actively prioritizing thing rarely team win else correctly short saved pit sadness experienced disappointment bf2042 ton past month fresh dynamic chaotic taken mantle delivering large scale historical combined arm combat dice no_longer able deliver way consider true spiritual successor original battlefield 1942 fell love year ago
686810,Hell Let Loose,"(This review is mostly about the recent update 14 and the acquisition of the Hell Let Loose brand by Team17, and it may change over time based on future updates and insights.)

Black Matter, the former developer, has crafted something truly unique in the gaming market with Hell Let Loose, setting it apart from other games with its distinctiveness, tactical elements, and deliberate, slow-paced gameplay.

The former developers had a vision that they expanded over time through numerous changes and improvements. Although the game gradually shifted from its original Kickstarter vision to a more ""arcadish""-style shooter and had to sacrifice some historical authenticity for balance reasons, Hell Let Loose remained a passion project by Black Matter, with its unique charm and great attention to detail. Black Matter had also the reputation to maintained a close relationship with the community. This endeared Hell Let Loose to many longtime players who loved and shared the game.

Since the acquisition by Team17 and the release of the recent Update 14, noticeable changes have taken place in Hell Let Loose. These changes have sparked intense debates about the game's future and the direction that Team17 intends to steer Hell Let Loose towards.

Issues began to arise shortly after Team17 took over with the 13.5 ""health"" update. This update not only introduced questionable and unwanted design changes and animation replacements, which the community considered not only worse than the previous one but also unnecessary and low priority and also brought persistent bugs that could have been identified, avoided, and resolved through intense testing before launch.

The recently released Update 14 and the lack of a testing phase prior to its implementation is already demonstrating noticeable impact:

- During the beta stage, Black Matter made an adjustment to the sprint speed in order to balance the game flow and prevent what is commonly referred to as ""Zig-Zagging"" or ""Mosquito"" movements. The game does not feature an inertia or stamina system, enabling players to sprint indefinitely. The previous developer opposed the implementation of such a system and instead opted to adjust the speed as a compromise.

The re-implemented higher sprint speed with this update (which is also higher than the beta speed as many already figured out) not only reintroduces the ""Zig-Zagging"" Issue. 
The game has also evolved around the adjusted sprinting speed, which brings additional issues to other aspects in the game that still operate at different pace and were adjusted in response to it, such as vehicles, tanks, spawns, and certain weapon types. 

Now, for example, it is possible to catch up to a medium tank that is in its highest gear and traveling at maximum speed, all while continuously sprinting.

All these aspects should logically be upscaled for balance reasons, but remained untouched by Team17, which could have been avoided through an intensive testing phase before launch.
There were also no information given by Team17 regarding why this change was implemented or considered priority.

- The current repetitive spamming and exploiting of the new dive-to-prone in mid-animation (dolphin dive) introduces questionable movement into the game. These techniques not only provide unfair advantages but also feel completely out of place.

The update also raises questions about its design choices and appears to be poorly shaped and optimized, to name a few examples:

- The new British weapons exhibit noticeable weapon sway during side-to-side movement and have bulky sights that obstruct a significant portion of the vision. This implementation is completely unique and only occurs with British weapons; it does not happen in such extent on any of the German, American, or Soviet weapons, as they were implemented under Black Matter and feels completely inappropriate and inconsistence in the game.

- According to many players, many weapons of the new British faction are historically inaccurate, something that would have been unthinkable under Black Matter's careful research and dedication to presenting the weapons and factions in the game as historically accurate as possible. 

- The driver controls of the British heavy Firefly are reminiscent of the controls of the medium Sherman prior to Update 10 (when all armor in the game was updated). It appears that Team17 used outdated code for the Firefly, neglecting to bring it up to par with the other tanks in the game. It is also possible right now to penetrate its front with a medium tank.

And again, persistent and annoying bugs:

- Incorrect amount of XP rewarded at the end of the game.
- Holding the tab key or opening the map cancels certain actions in the game.
- Overall network problems, with many players complaining about server connection losses and rubberbanding issues.

Many of the current issues raise the question of whether there was any QA prior to the release and if the new developer truly comprehends every aspect of their own game and shares the same vision as Black Matter, which has been cherished and loved by many long-time veteran players over the years.

Some decisions Team17 also made to the game deeply split the community in an extent, which I never have expierenced with any other update under the old developer Black Matter. 

Prior to Update 14/13.5, Hell Let Loose was far from being a perfect game and needed urgent optimization and adjustments, but the current state of the game introduces unnecessary additions, which not only bring new issues to the game, but should also have lower priority in comparison.

Edit: 16.07

In case someone wonders, although they announced the revert of the speed change with an upcoming update and also mentioned an overhaul of many issues with the British forces in the subsequent patch, this review will remain negative until these announcements are actually implemented.

Always remember that actions speak louder than words. 

But it was a necessary first step to make that overdue announcement in the latest dev brief.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Seriously the best WW2 shooter (aka PTSD simulator) I've ever played. COD WW2 and Battlefield V were absolute jokes and this game puts them to shame. This game is for everyone: milsim lovers, casual players, WW2 history buffs, etc. Do yourself a favor and get it.

Note: To make the game run better you need to do 2 things:

1). Click on the Settings cogwheel to the right of the game's Play button in your Steam Library --> Properties --> General --> in the Launch Options put: -dx12 -USEALLAVAILABLECORES

2).*Do this step AFTER already setting all your in-game graphics options* 
Go to C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\HLL\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor and open GameUserSettings.ini. with Notepad. Find the FrameRateLimit value (you can search for it by pressing CTRL+F) and change it to whatever your monitor's refresh rate is (mine for example is 165hz, so I would change it to 165. This will tell the game to run at a maximum of 165 fps). Then click File --> Save. After this you need to right click the file and go to Properties. Next to ""Attributes"", checkmark ""Read-only"" and click Apply.

The reason for doing this is every time the game starts up it tries to set the framerate limit back to 60 fps, so if you don't do this step you are just gonna be locked at a maximum of 60 fps. Also, when you change GameUserSettings.ini to be Read-only the game can't change the framerate back to 60; it can only read the file and then it will use whatever you put in for the framerate limit. If you need to change any of your graphics settings you will need to uncheck Read-only so the game can save the settings to the file. Make sure the framerate limit is correct before re-checking Read-only.

Optional bonus fix: Watching the intro movies every time the game starts up is annoying, so if you want the game to skip them go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hell Let Loose\HLL\Content and rename the Movies folder to ""Movies (rename to just Movies to enable intro movies)"". Alternatively you can just delete the folder.

LESSONS:

1)This game has nothing to do with K/D ratio
2)Need to capture objectives on the map to win
3)My microphones costed twice of what the game did
4)yes you need microphones, you can still play without them (alone) or in a squad where none use them, but to feel the stress of the game, you need microphones.
5)friendly kill is not at all tolerated in this game,you can apparently punish your friend for killing you, it will add 10s to their deploy time(ones). making your friend stare at a black screen for 10 extra seconds for killing you in cold blood is justice.
6)Get ready to see a lot of crazy things, 
my fastest death time is 00:00(instant deploy die)
Got killed by artillery 4 times at the same spawn place simultaneously, (deploy die deploy die deploy die deploy die.)
7)yes, get ready to die a lot, around 50 times/ match if you dont know what you are doing.(around 30/match for me now) :D

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Team17's inherent ineptitude and complete lack of a stakeholder engagement strategy is on full display following U14. As a community owner and server provider, I am extremely disappointed with the level of communication we've had through official channels both prior to game updates/patches, and afterwards when we've encountered issues. 

Communities such as mine form the backbone of the broader Hell Let Loose community. We host 6 servers across three regions ($780 AUD/month), attract and retain new players, promote the game to our broader audience, and contribute to the game's social fabric. To say I am disappointed that I cannot elicit answers from Team17 on the most basic hosting questions is an understatement. 

The lack of a PTE (or anything outside of developer QA) prior to the latest updates is nonsensical, and it really shows in U14. Other reviews have articulated the myriad of bugs better than I can, but needless to say, the amount and severity of the bugs is unacceptable for an established $70 game made by a large studio. The QA processes need an overhaul, and desperately needs broader community involvement. 

Invest in your key stakeholders as we have invested in your game.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I've been compelled to write this review because I'm tired of seeing all these jaded vets rage on and on about how the game is dying despite being part of the problem themselves. There will be a TLDR, otherwise here we go.

This game is a good game. Is it a great game? No. Is it a bad game? No. It is a solid good title if you are looking for a game that is not a twitch, run and gun shooter, but also don't really have the patience to learn to play something like ARMA III. This game is all about team play and communication. If you can't do either of these things this game is not for you. Having a mic is pretty much required if you want to play in anything other than a regular infantry squad, and even then you are putting your team at a severe disadvantage by not having one. The game is strongly in favor of being historically accurate (with some minor tweaks for gameplay reasons), so much so that the maps you play on are straight up recreations of the real life locations from back during the years of World War II. The various fronts, uniforms, and sounds this game uses to create its atmosphere is awesome. When you're in the shit with your face in the dirt you honestly get scared from how intense it all can be. Players will even do some light hearted roleplay over proximity when they're calling for a medic which can get pretty funny.

This game is slow and the gameplay reflects this. The fact that the two game modes (Warfare and Offensive) can last for a whole 1 hour 30 minutes or 2 hours respectively frequently speaks to this. You will be running for minutes on end a lot. You will be dying a lot. Respawn waves often take 20+ seconds depending on where you spawn. Capturing points takes 2 minutes and the enemy can stop you very easily. There will be many times where you will be shot, burned, blown up, or knifed and you will never see your attacker. There will be times where you will never know where the enemy is coming from. There will be times where you will go half an hour without a single kill, or maybe even a whole game. There will be times when you push the enemy back to their last point only for everything to fall apart on that final push and suddenly you are the one on your last point.

Then there will be times where you kill 20 people all by yourself. There will be times you singlehandedly turn the tide of a match with one spawn point, one kill, one explosion. There will be times where you work with your squad to accomplish an objective that allows another squad to accomplish theirs which allows the commander to do his thing to clinch you the game. There will be times where you fight for every bloody inch of a point for 30 minutes and then finally come out on top. There will be times where you fight over the midpoint the whole game and it comes down to the literal second on the timer, and then everyone cheers when you successfully cap. There will be times when you lose, but you won't care because the enemy played so well and your team matched them blow for blow that it felt like you didn't lose anything at all. There will be times when you fight an epic last stand and you just manage to beat the clock that it makes you feel like you really are fighting a war.

Hell Let Loose is not without its issues. Medics are alright, but they could be better, the artillery system needs changes in how it affects gameplay (although personally that issue is way down on the list), the British faction is kind of a mess, there are some bugs still stubbornly around, the flamethrower is underpowered, and collision (especially driving) on certain objects is really annoying. But you often forget about a lot of this when your charging towards the point and people are blowing up around you and machine guns are laying down suppressive fire and you finally reach the trenches and sweep through them killing everyone in your path. Those cinematic moments straight out of Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan is what you play for.

Sometimes you will hate this game and wonder why you wasted your time on such a hopeless match with such idiotic teammates. Other times you will love it and wish you could play with the guys you met in that game forever. The lows can be really low, but the highs can be really high.

There are those that say this game is going down the drain and this is not a true. Some of this game's veteran community has become extremely jaded over the past year and a half or so for a variety of reasons. Some of them are warranted and some of them aren't. When I first got this game back in December of 2021 the community was awesome. Never met such nice and patient people so consistently in a game about brutally murdering each other during the worst war of human history. This community is no longer that most of the time. It is full of veterans who are no longer understanding of new players. It is full of servers run by admins who think they are always right, who can't be challenged at all lest their fragile egos crack. Bickering is frequent, arguments and name calling are plenty, roaming bands of clan tags will constantly complain and heckle in chat, and most people don't want to lead teams because they don't want command screaming in their ear constantly the whole game.

Not all veterans are like this, but most of the whining does not come from the new players because these vets constantly scare them off with their horrid attitudes and elitism. It's like watching a CoD lobby unfold over the course of an hour and a half. There are those who still try to make the game as enjoyable as possible (shout out to McBluffin and his crew, go check them out and join their discord awesome people), but they are unfortunately the minority of interactions I see nowadays. I will never forget teaching a new player how to tank and him telling me at the end of the match ""Hey, thanks for teaching me. I was gonna drop this game because of the previous crew I was working with, but you guys made me change my mind.""

To all the new players or prospective buyers there are kind veterans out there, so stick it out. It is worth it, trust me. Once you find the right group this game is like magic (and drugs), you will never want to stop playing. This game is worth your money. The Team17 take over has been bumpy regarding the release of U14 and the ""trailer"", but this game is far from dead. Most of the bugs seen nowadays are legacy bugs from when Black Matter was still developing (something the vets will neglect to tell you due to their hate boners) and Team17 is currently ironing them out. They've already tackled/fixed quite a few and I am hopeful that they will figure the rest out soon. This game is in no worse a state than it was a year and a half ago, and is no worse off than when Black Matter was developing. So please, give this game a try. It will surprise you. I know it surprised me.

TLDR: This game is solid. It's got problems concerning various longstanding bugs and certain systems need attention, but they are being worked on. Its got great atmosphere and some real cinematic moments. Its had some bumpy trials since Team17 took over, but they have smoothed them out for the most part. Some of the veteran community could use a real attitude adjustment, but not everyone is crotchety. Its not great, its not terrible, but it is good and worth your time. Give this game a try, hop on with some buddies or find some of your own in-game and go win the war. 7/10","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",compelled write tired seeing jaded vet rage dying despite problem otherwise good great no_is bad no_it solid good title not_a twitch gun shooter patience learn arma iii communication thing not_for mic pretty required regular infantry squad putting severe disadvantage not_having strongly favor historically accurate minor tweak reason map straight recreation real life location year world war ii various front uniform sound us create atmosphere awesome shit face dirt honestly scared intense player light hearted roleplay proximity calling medic pretty funny slow reflects mode warfare offensive last 1 30 minute 2 hour respectively frequently speaks running minute dying respawn wave 20 second depending spawn capturing point take 2 minute enemy easily time shot burned blown knifed never_see attacker time never_know enemy coming time half single kill maybe time push enemy last fall apart final push suddenly last time kill 20 time singlehandedly turn tide spawn kill explosion time squad accomplish objective allows squad accomplish allows commander clinch time fight bloody inch 30 minute finally top time fight midpoint come literal timer cheer successfully cap time lose care enemy matched blow blow lose time fight epic last stand manage beat clock make fighting war hell loose not_without issue medic alright be_emphasizedtter artillery need change affect personally issue british faction kind mess bug stubbornly flamethrower underpowered collision especially driving certain object annoying forget charging towards blowing machine gun laying suppressive fire finally reach trench sweep killing path cinematic moment straight band brother saving private ryan hate wonder wasted hopeless idiotic teammate time love wish guy met forever low low high high drain not_a true veteran community extremely jaded past half variety reason warranted december 2021 community awesome never_met nice patient consistently brutally murdering worst war human history community no_longer veteran no_longer understanding player server admins challenged lest fragile ego crack bickering frequent argument name calling plenty roaming band clan tag constantly complain heckle chat lead team command screaming ear constantly not_all veteran whining not_come player vet constantly scare horrid attitude elitism watching cod lobby unfold course half enjoyable possible shout mcbluffin crew check join discord awesome unfortunately minority interaction nowadays never_forget teaching tank telling hey thanks teaching gon na drop previous crew working guy mind player prospective buyer kind veteran stick worth trust group magic drug never_want worth team17 bumpy regarding release u14 trailer far dead bug nowadays legacy bug black matter developing vet neglect tell due hate boner team17 currently ironing already tackled fixed hopeful figure rest soon no_worse state half ago no_worse black matter developing please surprise surprised solid problem concerning various longstanding bug certain system attention worked great atmosphere real cinematic moment bumpy trial team17 took smoothed veteran community real attitude adjustment not_everyone crotchety not_great not_terrible good worth hop buddy win war 7 10
686810,Hell Let Loose,"// Please scroll down to ""EDIT #3"" - I still like the game, but the devs have dropped the ball in a few ways

For an early access game, Hell Let Loose does everything right.

This is the best modern WW2 shooter on the market IMO. You have the pacing/action of Red Orchestra/Rising Storm with the tactical play of Squad and PS.

Unlike Squad and PS, you won't have 30 minute breaks between fighting and won't have to wait 15+ minutes after the match starts to fight. The maps are large enough, but their design encourages players to get into the action quickly, while still retaining a very important tactical meta. That meta doesn't just include field tactics such as flanking, defending, finding superior firing positions, etc., but also a Commander role which leads your team and has the power to call supply drops, strafing runs, and bombing runs.

Armor can dominate the battlefield if used appropriately, and player-controlled artillery guns can wreak havoc on enemy positions. The experience of being an infantryman while tactically pushing forward alongside armor and a platoon's worth of soldiers, while being hailed with artillery and enemy small arms fire, is really a sight to see.


There is both role and career progression that unlocks authentically-appropriate cosmetics, FOR FREE. No MTX, no lootboxes, you can only earn these items by playing the game.

The devs post updates almost weekly; some are small, and some are quite large.

There are 5 completed maps on live servers, 1 more is being released within the next few weeks, and they stated they have 3 additional maps in the current development pipeline (community believes at least one of these is Carentan). (edit: I think it's more like 10 or 11 maps at this point, with plenty more on the way)

Graphics are surely good enough. Audio design and animations could use some reworking, which is exactly what is happening. The current audio for weapons and animations for weapons/movement are being upgraded significantly at the moment, and this update will be pushed to player clients within the next few months.

The devs have stated they intend to include the Asian theatre (likely US-Japanese) and Eastern Front. 

If you were disappointed by BFV, this game might be for you. It doesn't exactly play like BF, it isn't quite a sandbox. And you really really need to work with your team. Having a mic is preferable, but most leaders in-game will be OK with your presence as long as you can understand/follow orders and occasionally type in the chat.

Very bright future ahead for HLL, and it's already shining quite a bit IMO.

I rate HLL in its current state an 8.5/10, and I believe the release product will be truly amazing.

EDIT #1: Changed 4 maps to 5 maps.

EDIT #2: Adding performance information I posted in another thread -

i7 3820
EVGA GTX 1080 FTW
16GB 2333mhz
850 EVO SSD
1440p

Almost all maxed settings, slightly higher than default FOV, and two settings on Medium - I think one is Shadows and I forget the other. FX/textures are definitely kept maxed. Also using FXAA. And setting corpse despawn to lowest possible.

Steady 60 - 90, drops to 40-45 with heavy action/lots of players. Pretty playable, it's not like a twitch reaction shooter like CoD that often, though I still would like a better processor. But due to Intel's annoying socket release I'm stuck with this until I get a fully new PC.

EDIT #3: Well, things have faltered slightly. Since I last updated this review, the devs have added MTX and a console version. Pacing of updates has slowed down as well, and the game suffers from long periods of imbalance in which everyone (including the devs) agree certain features aren't working well, but they refuse to diverge from their ""once every 5 to 6 months"" patch schedule.

Example: they are deactivating the Commander's Final Stand ability in the upcoming early December update (U11)  - this has literally been publicly known to be exploitable for YEARS.

It's still a great game, but there are rough edges that will likely never be sorted out. HLL is an indie game that likes to pretend it's AA, but it's far from it.","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",please scroll 3 dropped ball way early access hell loose best modern ww2 shooter market imo pacing action red orchestra rising storm tactical squad p unlike squad p 30 minute break fighting wait 15 minute start fight map large design encourages player action quickly retaining important tactical meta meta include field tactic flanking defending finding superior firing position commander role lead power call supply drop strafing run bombing run armor dominate battlefield appropriately controlled artillery gun wreak havoc enemy position infantryman tactically pushing forward alongside armor platoon worth soldier hailed artillery enemy small arm fire sight role career progression unlocks authentically appropriate cosmetic no_mtx no_lootboxes earn item post update weekly small large 5 completed map live server 1 released next week stated 3 additional map development pipeline community belief carentan 10 11 map plenty graphic surely good audio design animation reworking exactly happening audio weapon animation weapon movement upgraded significantly moment pushed client next month stated intend include asian theatre japanese eastern front disappointed bfv exactly bf sandbox really_emphasized mic preferable leader ok presence long understand follow order occasionally type chat bright future ahead hll already shining bit imo rate hll state 8 5 10 believe release product truly amazing 1 changed 4 map 5 map 2 adding performance information posted thread i7 3820 evga gtx 1080 ftw 16gb 2333mhz 850 evo ssd 1440p maxed setting slightly higher default fov setting medium shadow forget fx texture definitely maxed fxaa corpse despawn lowest possible steady 60 90 drop 40 45 heavy action lot player pretty playable not_like twitch reaction shooter cod processor due intel annoying socket release stuck fully pc 3 thing faltered slightly last updated mtx console version pacing update slowed suffers long period imbalance including agree certain feature working refuse diverge 5 6 month patch schedule example deactivating commander final stand upcoming early december u11 literally publicly known exploitable year s_emphasizedtill great rough edge never_be sorted hll indie like pretend aa far

-Notify the squad that you just put an OP.
-Push through to Dog point with the mad lad.
-Clear out the Dog point, rest of the squad is proning inside the bushes close to dog point not knowing what to do.

-The H squad who is full of newbies overwhelms the Dog point and captures it, winning the battle as a result while none of the other ""experienced"" squads could do something about it.

Up to this point, I found this game as nothing but a running simulator, as you spend most of your time mobilizing one place to another. But the H squad.. H squad changed everything and the course of the war at that very moment.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"This review is primarily aimed at recent events ( 6th of July, 2023 )
Will update if needed.



Currently, I recommend you to not buy it, do not support the lazy devs. Or better say publishers.

The game was never perfect, many things are totally dumb, broken, overlooked and undone. But the progress was there. Slow, but visible...

Suddenly the devs left and publishers took over. And oh boy, are they worse. By a lot. It feels to me that publishers went like ""oh the game is kinda finished ? Lets kick the devs out then so we can take all the money and just milk it.""

They even released such a fake deep and structured video bambling about progress, family, focus on realism, future updates etc. After just a first month or so, we all know it was just bunch of horseshit. 



 - Half cooked British faction.
Its not even half cooked, its simply not done. Publishers took the file with ""British"" and simply put it in. They didnt even check that 90% of the folder is empty.

 - New map - El Alamein
It feels like a design demo. Undone, unpolished, weird, unfinished.... Just yuck.

 - New faction trailer - US Para
Oh boy. What a movie. What a shitshow.... I recommend you to go watch it. It looks like it was done by a fan with zero experience (but a lot of passion) in Garry's mod. Not by a big company whose game is one of the most notable Steam games in the past 2 years.

- SHITTON of new bugs
Most game breaking of them all, they fucked up the server browser. So basically a big number of players can no longer see around 300 servers, we see like 5. 4 of them are Hong Kong or Russia. With 0 people. With ping over 200. Nice.



After the take-over, the game suddenly feels a lot worse. Milked. Used. It almost feels abandoned...

And I feel cheated....


But Im not trying to be just a hater, so some Pros are in order as well:

FPS aspect is nice, it definitely can be a lot of fun.

If you find a squad that actually cooperates (rare) you can live thru some awesome tactical experience.

Kinda ok realism. Gore, sound affects, enviroment, mud everywhere. It feels authentic. Just kinda fucked up by publishers who had F in history. 
Main British SMG in WWII was definitely NOT Lanchester. 
The main British rifle of WWII was definitely NOT Enfield P14. Thats a World War ONE rifle.... jesus.... 
Nice, we have Gewehr 43....How bout Gewehr 41, while being in 1944 in most battles ? 
M3 grease gun was definitely more common towards the end of the war. 
M1 Carbine as well.
The cosmetics aspect is definitely weird as well. Feels like they forgot to make it, eveybody already left the studio so they had to ask the janitor.

Maybe Im just pedantic....



Overall the game deserves a solid 6,5/10, maybe even 7/10.
Current state however be like 3/10. Maybe even 2,5/10.


UPDATE
2nd of January, 2024

The game is still shit.

Random crashes, sudden FPS drops from 50 to 5, server browser sometimes not working, net code feels worst to be honest, (maybe my PC / internet are dying ?? Dont think so, its only HLL), sometimes the game doesnt load properly, etc.

British got a lil update, they have the correct kind of Lee-Enfield now. Nice. But nothing game changing otherwise, it still feels half cooked.

But dont worry ! We have yet another cosmetic DLC, the Pea Dot uniform ! Hurraaay ! .... Only problem is that it was kinda common in 1944 when Panzer and SS divisions got relocated to Normady to help the Panzergrenadiers defend. But you have to pay 5 Euros. For a quite common, definitely not rare, uniform. Well...


So yeah.... Will update in needed again, but I dont think its gonna happen anytime soon....

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I don't often review games because I am lazy, but this game deserves it. I am a 32 year old gamer and my fps experience goes back to Doom. I played all the FPS games. A few of the cod's, all the counter stirkes, most the battlefields, tribes,unreal's, quake's, titanfalls, rainbow six etc. This game is different then them all. Team work isn't wanted its absolutely needed. There is no kill feed, no glamour for the solo person with 50 kills at the end you just get to celebrate the win while your countries music plays on the score tab. Its a very, very different game. I am not super familiar with this genre having only played ARMA 3 for a few hours but the people playing this game are passionate. A lot of them take everything super serious which has its ups and downs but mostly ups. The player base is small enough you start to see the same people in games, but its large enough its always possible to find a full server to play on in less than 5 minutes. There is so many niches to fill in this game I suggest watching a youtube video before loading it up. The strats you need to win in this game take a lot of team coordination (average game has around 10 diff squads all geared towards diff tactics to help you win). I'm semi drunk and rambling but I really enjoy this game, yes there are times where you are getting crushed and you basically spawn in, run for 5 mins and die but those are few and far between. After a few games you get the hang of it start your own squad so you can have some control on where to place down spawn points. Who knows, maybe someday you'll have the balls to lead the entire 50 person team as commander.","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",game lazy deserves 32 old gamer shooter go doom shooter game cod counter stirkes battlefield tribe unreal quake titanfalls rainbow six different wanted needed no_kill feed no_glamour solo 50 kill celebrate win country music play score tab very_emphasized different not_super familiar genre arma 3 hour passionate super serious ups down mostly ups base small game large possible 5 minute niche fill suggest watching youtube video loading strats win coordination average 10 diff squad geared towards diff tactic help win semi drunk rambling enjoy yes time crushed basically spawn 5 min die far game hang squad control spawn point know maybe someday ball lead entire 50 commander

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Hell Let Loose lies at an excellent intersection between Battlefield, Squad and Insurgency. It brings the scale of the former, the logistics and teamwork of the middle and immediacy of the latter to impress with its 50 vs 50 WW2 battles that teeter between bombastic chaos and matter-of-fact single shot kills. Having just two modes - a 90 minute Warfare mode with single objective conquest, and the staggered 30 minute Offensive mode where a frontline is gradually and permanently pushed back by attackers -, restricting loadout customisation to two or three presets and no allowance for custom rules might seem overly strict or boring to some, but really it allows the game to enjoy an unusual focus foRr a genre that's by now bogged down in noise and lack of polish. HLL's ambition is to push you into almost a slice of life style of storytelling, where each individual is but a small cog in a grand machine.

It does this by dividing teams into neat hierarchies, where equipment and abilities are restricted to roles, themselves restricted to categories: At the top of the pyramid sits the commander, who gets access to the leader voice chat channel to communicate with officers, and who can use map-wide abilities like supply drops, bombing runs, spawn vehicles or issue map marker orders for the team. Beneath the commander are the officers, who are in charge of relaying information between their squad and other officers and the commander, and issuing orders to their squad. An infantry officer's squad who has access to the usual shooter roles: Engineers can build and destroy structures, support can provide construction supplies and ammo, medics can revive and heal teammates, assault gets access to SMGs and more grenades, and so on. Each squad is expected to follow orders from their officer and communicate as a small team of their own. Alternatively to infantry, there are special squad types for recon and armour, with two-man sniper teams and tank crews respectively, each having their own specialised roles and exclusive abilities and gear.

Ideally, a match will unfold with the three squad types working together under their officers, who in turn work with other officers and their commander as one great team, shifting between attack, defence and support. The latter is most interesting, because there are cases where some players or even an entire squad will be dedicated to logistics, driving supply trucks back and forth to build defenses in controlled territory. These unofficial roles are just as important as any medic or rifleman, allowing players to fortify points, man artillery, or act as infantry support or repair crews for tanks. Participating in this massive cooperation never fails to be thrilling. I enjoy getting headshots on the frontline or sneaking into an enemy objective and laying mines down, but there's a quiet satisfaction to spending an hour transporting supplies to engineers or building intricate layers of barbed wire and barricades that's just as rewarding. Intellectually engaging with the map, the movement of the team, evaluating risk and reward - these are rare treats that make not shooting a single time the entire match just as fun as doing so a thousand times, and no matter the role, extensive use of the map and compass's grid coordinates, bearings, cardinal directions and distance measurements separates the good players from the best.

Agency works differently in HLL compared to most shooters, but it's one of the first pressure points where things can go horribly wrong. A match in Battlefield can be turned around by a single person, even despite the vast scale. All it takes is a great flank and quick reflexes or helicopter pilot to potentially dominate an entire team, but in HLL the opposite is true - most conquests are a meat grinder regardless of your individual experience or skill. In fact the better both teams are, the longer conquest takes. It can thus become frustrating to have your performance tied so intrinsically to the team's. A great squad could theoretically turn the tables, but most of the time you're simply at the mercy of your officer and commander (or lack thereof), and while the highs of teamwork are higher than they otherwise would be, the lows of miscommunication and a lack of team autobalancing are very low indeed. This is offset by the game's intentional deemphasising of player stats, hiding kill/death ratios or victim/nemesis trackers away in a secondary screen, but the act of dying 20 times in a match and losing at the end still stings. Such an issue is however an unavoidable result of the demands of teamwork. When things go well - which they mostly do - HLL shines. Matches tend to ebb and flow over wide frontlines, incorporating the staccato pacing that can at times near the absurd. There are points when you'll have been lying on your stomach for five minutes until a single shot pierces the silence and your enemy a hundred metres away falls dead in a heap, and the rifle's echo fades into silence; there are others when you'll be sprinting out of a trench into a wall of enemies in a vast field scarred by craters and debris, dodging the rain of bullets and competing bombing runs as tanks charge through the cacophony and their thunderous fire sends your head spinning. The magnitude of the action can be truly impressive, and knowing that it's often the result of those 49 coordinating strangers, from infantry riflemen to sniping saboteurs all following the violent vision of a single commander at the helm, is awesome.

There are some bugs, imperfections in audio, and poor level design that marr the proceedings, but presentation and controls are generally excellent, giving HLL a sleekness uncharacteristic of multiplayer shooters, and far surpassing Arma 3, Squad, or any other milsims. And realistically, you're going to struggle to find another indie/AA game that looks or sounds as good as this, much less at such an enormous scale. HLL isn't a perfect game by any means, but its relentless focus on teamwork, trimming of fat, and straightforward design make it the best time I've had with a shooter in eons. There isn't much room for one man army heroics in its action, with all facets of its design encouraging and rewarding teamwork instead. With ample space for gameplay styles from solitary sabotage to quiet construction and frontline armoured engagements, there's something for everyone. It's a mature game for players who are tired of the uncontrolled chaos of Battlefield or Call of Duty that makes most matches blend together into an indistinct haze of inconsequential mass slaughter, and enormously thankfully it also eschews their stats pages, storefronts, caricaturesque customisation, battle passes, daily missions and endless notifications and popups that make those competitors become overwhelming assaults on your senses that also demand to be treated like a second job. It still needs some polish, and some new maps and equipment would be welcome, but I've hugely enjoyed my time playing HLL. Cerebral without becoming exclusionary, intense without becoming mind-numbing, I cannot recommend this enough as a minimalistic breath of fresh air.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"In 1998, after seeing Saving Private Ryan at the tender supple age of 16, I wrote a letter to god knows what game developer that essentially outlined what this game actually is:  gritty, slow-paced foot races to take objectives, forced team work and communication, and the iron-sight dominated battlefield.  

I won't lie:  I had the exact same frustrations as everyone else: ""I can't see anyone!"".  Take it from me:  MOVE SLOWLY.  APPROACH CORNERS METHODICALLY.  STICK YOUR HEAD OUT SLOWLY.  WAIT.  LOOK FOR MOVEMENT.  IF NONE, TRY MOVING.  REPEAT.

The only way to have a ""truly"" enjoyable time is to use a headset, participate in chat and strategy, call in requests for supplies, put down garrisons and outposts.  If you are a squad leader, make sure someone is an engineer and set up nodes.  This may require having supply drops on the HQ or having someone else run support and drop them in your squad.  Resources and a competent commander make the game SO much more enjoyable.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Hell Let Loose: Review and recommendations

My name is General Rocker. I am sixty-three years of age and I am a life-long gamer. Started young, will game till the day I die. As my name indicates, I am a musician, but I got my alias via facilitating one of the largest Counter-Strike group around the turn of the century, [CoFR]Crusty old Fossil Rockers-- our motto: One foot in the grave, the other on your neck!

Hell Let Loose caught my attention since its inception because I've played Day of Defeat for twenty years now, having started as a BETA tester, and continue to look for new WWII first person shooters. I also play modern-era shooters that emulate modern tech, such as, Arma and Recon (with my 93 YO father), but I find the iron sights and limited tech far more challenging. I am partial to WWII strategy games, too. 

My first experience with HLL was amazing. I started playing the last patch before release. I cowered and was totally blown away by the weapons emulation, with suppression fire tearing up all around me. The battle dynamics in this game are fantastic, and quite realistic in much of how the game deals with accurate fire from weapons that are not dumbed down for the kids. Bombardment runs are amazing to see and horrific if you get caught up in one. Wow! A pistol kills just as well as an MG in this game so long as you know how to use it. Additionally, good luck if you are a frag whore interested in going alone. You will get all shot up without support from friendlies in this game, which makes squad chat integral. 

I appreciate the way in which the HLL team has figured out how to balance re-spawn in an interesting light, using garrisons, outposts and half-tracks to accomplish this task fluidly. The interface is cumbersome, though, and I wish a chit-mark would help me re-spawn without having to click on an icon all the time, for I frequently miss the timer and frustrate myself having to wait to re-spawn. The fact that re-spawn points are dependent upon leadership is brilliant, but the voice system needs a good rework. We shall see. You do need a mic to play this game!

Frankly, I'm impressed by the work conducted by the  HLL developers, who continue to improve the game. I get the sense that they are on to a solid niche for a franchise, and will continue to expand content so long as the game is profitable. That said, I do find intrinsic flaws in the game design that hinders its potential, as is true for most games that struggle with profit margins and marketing demographics. Such issues are for publishers to decide, whereas, I offer my feedback free of charge with hope my input might offer insight to creative coders. I was happy to see how the developers have incorporated feedback from users, and have made many improvements as a result. 

It would be nice if DEV incorporated their insight into a robust configuration platform that would enable the server admins to curtail the gaming experienced based upon preference; however, I see lots of rigidity to this effect, which may or may not be technical. What I mean is lots of defaults on the game are pretty ridiculous from a WWII squad perspective. I'd like to edit the size and configuration of squads, limit the use of artillery and other roles, along with other aspects that would be better if set as optional. Don't want tanks? No ART? (that would be so nice on occasion) No snipes for this map? I prefer a squad of 12 for WWII games, for this is not Counter-Strike. ETC. How about you let the clan decide how to set up the battles? Flexibility is lacking in most FPS games, and this is yet another who wants to create a canned, out of the box experience, and falls short simply because there are insufficient set-up options. 

I wait impatiently for MODS that might address my concerns. I follow the revisions and see the work going on, and the new maps on the way, but no indication that they will create more flexible server game-play options. In the mean time, other than way too much artillery, the game is a winner, and will get better as the DEV team ramp up content. As is true with all these kinds of games, much better on a closed server with like-minded individuals.","Very Positive84% of the 75,365 user reviews for this game are positive.",hell loose recommendation name general rocker sixty three year age life long gamer started young till die name indicates musician alias via facilitating largest counter strike group turn century cofr crusty old fossil rocker motto foot grave neck hell loose caught attention inception defeat twenty year started beta tester continue look wwii shooter modern era shooter emulate modern tech arma recon 93 yo father iron sight limited tech far challenging partial wwii strategy game hll amazing started last patch release cowered totally blown weapon emulation suppression fire tearing battle dynamic fantastic realistic deal accurate fire weapon not_dumbed kid bombardment run amazing horrific caught wow pistol kill mg long additionally good luck frag whore interested alone shot support friendly make squad chat integral appreciate hll figured balance spawn interesting light garrison outpost half track accomplish task fluidly interface cumbersome wish chit mark help spawn click icon frequently miss timer frustrate wait spawn spawn point dependent leadership brilliant voice need good rework shall mic frankly impressed conducted hll developer continue improve sense solid niche franchise continue expand long profitable intrinsic flaw design hinders potential true game struggle profit margin marketing demographic issue publisher decide whereas offer feedback charge hope input offer insight creative coder happy developer incorporated feedback user improvement result nice incorporated insight robust configuration platform enable admins curtail gaming experienced based preference lot rigidity effect not_be technical lot default pretty ridiculous wwii squad perspective size configuration squad limit artillery role along aspect be_emphasizedtter set optional tank no_art nice occasion no_snipes map prefer squad 12 wwii game not_counter strike clan decide set battle flexibility lacking shooter game want create canned box fall short simply insufficient set option wait impatiently mod address concern follow revision map no_indication create flexible option artillery winner ramp true kind game closed minded individual
1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"For months and through numerous requests by the developer after every update, I have considered how I was ultimately going to post my review for this game. For the first 9 months of playing this game, it was one of the best games I have played, and certainly the best idle game. The progression system is outstanding, the different areas in this game to progress in are many, and it feels like you are still making progress towards something or other no matter what you are doing. I was ultimately planning on this being a positive review. 

Unfortunately after the most recent update, I can no longer recommend this game, and it's not just for the content in the update, but primarily because of how the developer has handled the situation since the update has been released.  While the update itself was a travesty (adding a very obvious pay to win system introducing some incredibly powerful pet follower bonuses, the average person will need to spend hundreds of dollars (or wait on average several years) for a good chance at getting incredibly [i]game altering[/i] bonuses), I was confident that the developer would quickly identify the criticisms laid out by the community and address them with a plan on how to fix the new system. Instead, he's banned numerous people making complaints, deleted criticism from posts made on the subreddit which he moderates, and hasn't issued a single statement since the update was released, which at this point has been more than 10 days ago. That silence speaks louder than words.

The developer and his mod team ban people and delete criticisms constantly. I say this as an outsider who has never been punished in any way. I can no longer stay silent on their behalf. The dev, unfortunately, has what appears to be a long history of making bad decisions when it comes to punishing people in his game, on discord, and on the subreddit. It's shameful, and ultimately the people they end up banning or punishing (just look at how he handled those who used the sailing exploit) are usually the game's biggest supporters and i'm sure many people who have spent money on the game.

The developer constantly touts ""solo dev"" as if that were a positive. From what I have seen, that also means he's never held accountable to anyone but himself. When he comes up with a terrible pay to win system, there's nobody in his corner to tell him it's a bad idea and to rethink the system. When he issues bans to numerous members of the community, there's nobody there to review the legitimacy of the ban, or to tell him that kneejerk bans are harmful to the game and community.

I think what's more pressing than fixing the most recent update is fixing the authoritarian system of control that's been the norm in this community. Lava should take some of the money he earned from this update and hire a community manager who should be the one handling all bans, and review all retroactive bans. They need a panel of three members of the community (NOT selected by Lava) for this to review them - I am guessing the VAST majority of bans and mutes on discord, reddit, and in game are complete and utter nonsense that no panel of three would uphold. If I am wrong, great, prove it by having a panel go through them all and release a statement on the number of bans and mutes they reversed.

If the developer continues his heavy handedness, there will be nothing but sycophants left to sing his praises, which ultimately hurts the game and the community rather than being able to accept hard truths and work to improve the game based on those truths.

I think there's still a chance for this game to be saved. I'm willing to change this to a positive review, in the end, if instead of a knee jerk reaction that I'm expecting from all the negative reviews he instead reacts with a thoughtful response that both fixes the issues with the update, in game, but also fixes some of the grave concerns I've raised about the heavy handed moderation resulting in numerous unjust bans.

I don't know why the developer has been silent for so long. I am going to guess that, when he ultimately makes a statement, it's going to be something about spending all his efforts on fixing the issues that iOS has had resulting in the update being rejected there. That's ultimately not a good excuse for being silent so long. Most of us want the game to succeed, and with such a backlash, there should have been a statement made the very day of the update, let alone by now 10 days later. I had been holding off on this review to give the dev a chance to make this statement, but it's been too long at this point, and with no promised changes, again, I cannot recommend this game as-is.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",month numerous request developer considered ultimately post 9 month best game certainly best idle progression outstanding different area progress feel progress towards no_matter ultimately planning positive unfortunately recent no_longer recommend not_just primarily developer handled situation released travesty adding obvious pay win introducing incredibly powerful pet follower bonus average spend hundred dollar wait average year good chance incredibly altering bonus confident developer quickly identify criticism laid community address plan fix banned numerous complaint deleted criticism post subreddit moderate issued single statement released 10 day ago silence speaks louder word developer ban delete criticism constantly outsider never_been punished no_longer stay silent behalf unfortunately appears long history bad decision come punishing discord subreddit s_emphasizedhameful ultimately banning punishing look handled sailing exploit usually biggest supporter spent developer constantly tout solo positive mean never_held accountable come terrible pay win corner tell bad idea rethink issue ban numerous member community legitimacy ban tell kneejerk ban harmful community pressing fixing recent fixing authoritarian control norm community lava earned hire community manager handling ban retroactive ban panel three member community not_selected lava guessing vast majority ban mute discord reddit complete utter nonsense no_panel three uphold wrong great prove panel release statement number ban mute reversed developer continues heavy handedness sycophant left sing praise ultimately hurt community rather able accept hard truth improve based truth s_emphasizedtill chance saved willing positive knee jerk reaction expecting negative review reacts thoughtful response fix issue fix grave concern raised heavy handed moderation resulting numerous unjust ban developer silent long guess ultimately make statement spending effort fixing issue io resulting rejected ultimately not_a good excuse silent long succeed backlash statement alone 10 day holding chance statement long no_promised change cannot_recommend

He did not fix the 2.1B integer limit that I complained about over a year ago, rather he capped it at 1.05 bil which is laughable since I could easily hit 1B over a year ago before the W5 power creep.

Capping the number go up dopamine in an incremental game is a sin. 

Additionally, I encountered a neat bug where random parts of the screen were opening a link to his twitch channel. 

So yea, my review has not changed. Lava still being lava. I noticed he deleted a criticism thread of the new patch on Reddit already. Classic. 

UPDATE 2: The developer has now banned me from the reddit for making a single post criticizing him. https://imgur.com/a/MVzXQWy and here is proof and my username https://imgur.com/qHJ8nf0

UPDATE: Shortly after this review I have been banned from the discord for criticizing the latest patch (v.156) and how it hurts F2P players and did not achieve what he promised. 


Note: Here's the image linked in the reddit post. https://imgur.com/EqMq9TS
This is also what I reference below in the review. 

I love this game and will probably always love it, but it feels like I am Johnny Depp dealing with Amber Heard when playing it sometimes.
I can not recommend this game to new players as the developer constantly makes the experience worse for new players and endgame. I will change my review if the situation gets better. 

[b]The Good[/b]

[*]Game has good systems to progress with.

[*]Being able to control multiple characters without actively grinding them all is cool.

[*]Resource management and hoarding [i]billions[/i] of items makes you feel rich and powerful.

[*]Interesting and quirky monsters.

[*]Artwork looks great if you enjoy pixel art.

[*]Always a goal to strive for.

[*]A lot of different systems to min-max.

[*]Choices you make can heavily impact how well or fast you progress. 

[*]Smooth leveling process 

[*]Most systems have no caps. Endless character levels. 

[*]Loot explosions from collecting your ""afk gains.""

[*]Decent jokes through the quests.

[*]Community is nice and helpful for the most part.

[/list]


[b]The Bad[/b]

[*]Every world increases the amount of gems you must spend to stay competitive. The latest world gave as much as 20x the character power for spending money on gems. 

[*]In-game currency acquisition is consistently getting nerfed. An example would be the KIng Doot mini-boss. The boss has gone from 72 gems possible to 19 gems to now 9 gems per kill. That is a massive nerf. 

[*]The dev keeps adding more and more gem shop purchases each patch despite nerfing the rates of obtaining the currency.

[*]The dev has laid out the current patches to be QOL and Bug-fix focused, but ignores the most crippling bugs that plague the game.

[*]A lot of his ""QOL"" ends up being nerfs with a pretty paint coat.

[*]in Patch v.156 his dungeon ""QOL"" was some party find features such as invite others and find group. These features essentially broke trying to find a party and now no one can find a group when it was already difficult before. The dev just keeps on trucking and talks about making adding more to dungeon 1 when his other dungeons and party features are broken. 

[*]Endgame players are constantly getting nerfed in damage and progression.

[*]Endgame players that discover an oversight and use it are threatened with bans because of the developers mistakes. 

[*]Old bugs are not being fixed like mobile overflow (when your materials or money hit 2.1B you just lose them on mobile).

[*]The game white screens if you are performing actions that require a lot of input (people in the community have a solution for this, but the dev refuses to listen).

[*]The community has a lot of smart and talented programmers that have solutions for a lot of the games problems but the developer will not take the help and frustrating problems just continue to exist.

[*]A lot of the issues stem from the developer's ego and his refusal to listen to the people that are playing his game.

[*]His responses to criticism can be emotionally charged at times. 
Last month he went on a banning rampage in the discord over people that had negative criticism towards the game (as noted by the other top review). 

[*]The latest patch was hyped up as nightmare versions of the games bosses, but turned out to be a flop because you make more in-game currency by doing the easiest bosses. The developers response to negative criticism was, ""ok then dont farm nightmares dude"" and ""if youd like i can remove all gems and make that mroe clear.""

[*]Normal bosses drop 1 gem each, which is a great way to farm up gems for F2P players. However the new nightmare bosses take up 30,40, and 50 keys respectively but still only give 1 gem each. This means F2P players have to give up 29,39, and 49 gems per nightmare try for a 1/1000 drop rate of a cosmetic item. (Gems are the in game store currency).


[/list]

[b]The Ugly[/b]

[*]Players and mods are banned on the discord for petty reasons.

[*]The dev reprimanded staff he personally hired for fixing situations he caused and in his lack of transparency with his own team decides to punish his long time staff with an immediate ban without hesitation.

[*]Any form of negative criticism is deemed toxic by the dev and makes you worthy of banning.

[*]Dev has a history of censoring people whenever he can. He will take down YouTube vids because he feels they take away from his own channel, he will make you change your name if you are an Idleon content creator the name is related to his game, and he will ban you if you mention certain people that he doesn't like.

[*]I was banned without warning after being a member with over 10,000 posts over a year without a reason listed. I assume I was deemed as ""toxic.""

[*]The dev banned several active and long time users over an April fool's joke spoil. Only one has been unbanned.

[*]The dev criticized my feedback in Discord by saying, ""so do the last 1.5 years of your enjoyment mean nothing to you?"" As if the game can't degrade or my feelings change over that time frame. 

[*]The dev adds things to the game because he wants to, not because the game needs it. He will spend an entire day streaming him drawing frogs for the first dungeon, when the dungeons have bugs and the party system is broken. His stream on 5/8/2022 had him explicitly say he does things because he wants to. 

[*]You must join the discord to be competitive. You will not be able to ""exploit"" his oversights without the help of the community that does the code digging. Many of his oversights are bugs that go on for months and give massive advantage to those that are adamant about staying ahead. You must be part of the discord to even know what is an exploit and what is deemed ok by the dev. 

[*]The developer's communication is poor. He has no community manager and doesn't address the communities concern. His version of addressing concern is by adding things no one asked for and saying people wanted it. 
He has put out two game polls since the latest world release based on what the community wants, and nothing in those polls have been addressed in 2 months. 
The only thing that was addressed were an issue with players auto clicking a new feature. His solution was to just hard cap clicks and screw those that didn't exploit early.

[*]Cheaters are free to roam the game and can even unban themselves.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I'd been playing this game since before World 3 was out; the game was [i]originally[/i] a fantastic F2P experience - freemium currency was easy to come by and prices for upgrades were relatively inexpensive, but there's been a massive negative shift in terms of how the game is presented and how in-game purchases are pushed.

When I first heard about pet companions coming as an update, I was [b]thrilled[/b]...[i]until[/i] I saw the absolute huge shift towards P2W in regards to the drop chances of the most game breaking pet in the system. It's nothing more than a glorified loot box system jazzed up to look less like one. I then started to notice the massive cracks in how badly the game had become predatory in terms of in-game microtransactions - constant on-screen pushes for limited time gem packs with seemingly no way to close them without clicking on the shop, along with new limited time offers on premium equipment all to induce FOMO and get you to spend money. [b]Predatory.[/b] Plain and simple.

Shameful to say now, I did throw money into the game previously, I was playing the game often and incorrectly thought, ""Hey, the dev seems like a pretty cool dude.

I don't know if I'll continue playing at this point.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"This is the best game I would not recommend to any new players. The game has the bones to be a great idle experience but unfortunately it is helmed by a sole developer who's ego is contributing to its eventual failure. I am writing this out of frustration as I am a victim of LAVAflame's limitation as a developer. I've lost my account with no chance at a back up with no support from Lava despite emails and messages in his discord seeking it. You can look at my profile page to see how invested I was in this game until that point. Worse yet this happened to a decent amount of the player base and Lava's response was to ignore and ban any players from the official discord trying to ask for support or help in addressing this. I have devoted a large amount of time and money to playing this game only to have the door slammed in my face when asking for help in trying to recover my account. I am reiterating this as this is a game you will need to sink countless hours into it only to have it suddenly taken away from you with no word or care from the developer of the game. To add salt to the wound it seems Lava is more interested in posting his PR for bench and flexing on the people who play his game than to care about the players who are supporting his vision and buying his product.

TLDR; DO not play this game, it is something that lures you in with potential but is created and run by a man who is more interested in getting praise without any real care for his game. If you do play this game I urge you not to spend money as it has the chance to suddenly just disappear with no recourse.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I dont normally review games, but this is not merely any game. It's lightning in a bottle. However, before I get into my review of the game I want to start by clarifying a few points:

1. You might have noticed the abnormally high amount of play time I have accumulated at the time of this review. This can be simply explained by describing the nature of the game. Idleon is an ""idle"" game, which means that most of the game progression is accomplished offline. Despite the offline nature, there is actually a lot to do online; crafting, fighting mobs or bosses, and completing quests are some of the active features a player can enjoy. A player can simply leave his or her character actively fighting mobs while they go get a coffee or read a book, hence the reason many players have boosted hours played when in reality ""active"" play time is probably much lower .If you are familiar with the notorious amount of mobile games in this genre, with their premium currencies and scantly clad female heroines, you might turn your nose away from this game in disgust. But fear not, this game elevates the genre as much as an idle game can be elevated by modern game design.

2. It is in my opinion that the developer of this game does not in any capacity understand the technique of game design. After watching one of the dev streams on twitch an viewing him live code a bug fix, it is apparent that he has little programming experience as well. The code language he uses seems to resemble Scratch code, a block-based coding language, and it is inconceivable to me how he was able to use such a language to create the complex yet beautiful mess that is Idleon (this alludes to my lightning in a bottle theory). His poor naming scheme for variables alone justifies putting him in an institution. Additionally, the complex systems of an idle game, with player progression relying heavily on math (make numbers bigger in various ways), seems to resemble a house of cards that could fall at any minute. Yet, surprisingly, game breaking bugs are far and few between (at least those that affect a large swath of the player base).

3. The attribution of MMO does not quite apply to this game and possibly leads to disappointment and a feeling of being tricked for the average player who has played actual MMOs before and has stumbled upon this game. technically, the game is multiplayer, and technically it is online. There are guilds, and there are dungeons in which players and their friends, or complete strangers, will band together to complete for worthwhile rewards. But in truth, the game stretches the limits of what can be called an MMO. Unfortunately, this review is long enough as it is, so I will refrain from going into any more detail, as this point is not nearly relevant enough to deserve the effort, only noting and moving on.

Now at this point, it must seem absurd that this game could be as successful as it is; I have done very little to give you confidence that one could possibly experience any enjoyment in Idleon. As it so happens, the developer has succeeded in making a game that is simple enough to attract the most casual MMO enthusiast while also implementing a complex enough system to scratch the itch of the most avid min maxer. The best part is that players in between those two ends can enjoy the game as well, because their is no PvP to require more acute balancing. To be more clear, even though the most OCD player will ensure they are progressing at the fastest, most efficient rate, their advantage has no affect on another player's casual attitude toward progression. Each player can progress at a rate comfortable to them without the necessarily feeling a pressure to make the most out of every mechanic of the game to prevent falling behind. While there exists some debate as to whether the game contains ""pay to win"" features, the reality is that it only would be a problem if there was a PvP feature, for without PvP, their is no ""winning"".

Idleon has many things that a idle game enjoyer would look for, and some things that they would not expect. The developer clearly has a passion for his game and listens closely to community feedback. As the game is constantly adding new features such as worlds, items, and quests, you have no worry about hitting a progression ceiling for too long. There is crafting, fighitng, skilling, exploring, bosses, secrets  and more. In the free time you have while your characters are whacking away you can think about the meaning hidden within the game. You watch your characters grow and become stronger and think what it is like to be a little pixel character in a world where all they know is fighting and gathering materials to craft better gear to fight stronger monsters and gather better materials. On and on and on and never a moment of rest. Even while you are asleep they toil away, and in the morning when you wake up and open the game, they are there, waiting for your next command. They can eat food of course, but only to heal their wounds or buff their stats. They cant even choose what to eat. I wonder if they can think, if they aware that they are unable to control their bodies. Do they feel pain? Surely the developer would not give them a conscious.

________________________________

[h1]TL;DR Lava Introduces actual gacha mechanics that are way worse than actual gacha games. I am disappointed with the way this game is going developer-decision-wise.[/h1]

So, I've been an avid player of the game for a while, but who would have guessed that a tactic that was once applied to Idle Skilling would come over to IdleOn! And it's in a much worse state that I could have imagined.

This game had minor gacha systems in the Gem Shop for a while, ever since World 4 was released, and it was partially fine - There were methods for getting the premium currency, the bonuses were alright for the price and while there was some backlash for it, people in the end accepted the system as it is.

However in this update, we got cursed with another wave of Gacha systems, and it certainly tops other games in terms of how scummy and p2w it has become.

You get one pull per week of a certain follower, and it can give you bonuses, which range from nonexistent to downright gamebreaking, devaluing entire classes.

King Doot, which we can call the 5* Character, currently grants the ability to get all Divinity Gods linked to every player on one's account. Divinity bonuses are nothing to scoff at, as they're super large bonuses (x6 printing value, Lab becomes optional, 30% AFK Gains, etc). The current odds of receiving it are 0.28%. A f2p player would need over [b]6 years[/b] on average in order to get that follower. Before you lash out in the comments saying ""Oh but the odds get higher!"", please let me elaborate. There is no potential way to reduce the timer or to influence the odds other than rolling more. And the rolling progress resets at every new ""batch of characters"" which happens every 10 weeks(?). Statistically speaking, you will not reach the third Tier of odds before the new batch appears. The argument still stands.

There are many other currently available ""characters"" that devalue other abilities and ignore limits that were imposed because of the game's mechanics, but I really don't want to go on too much about it.

In order to have additional rolls for these characters, you need to pay Green Gems. Which on paper sounds alright, but note that at the time of editing this review, there is no way of acquiring that currency as a f2p player. The only source is by donating real $$$ to the dev (the cost for these gems is twice as large as normal gems).

Other gacha games at least allow you to farm for that, but here? Nope. Nothing, nada. You get nothing. You lose.

""Batches of characters"" means that these business practices will continue and repeat several times with every new update introducing potentially new gamebreaking benefits, while inducing FOMO to every other player that has not acquired the top-Tier characters yet. If one hasn't received the characters now, how long would they have to wait in order to have a chance on getting them again?

The tactic of introducing a gamebreaking feature with a premium currency unavailable for f2ps was introduced in Idle Skilling before. However, IS's version is much more acceptable compared to what was done here in IdleOn

It sucks to see such a great game go downhill like this. I hope things get better, but unfortunately it's likely not going to change, given that Lava, the dev, has likely already amassed 7 figures through this mechanic, and did not address the drama that happened around his game, only praising himself for the ""success"" that it brought both financially and playercount-wise. He doesn't understand that it came at the cost of trust of quite a part of his playerbase.

If you decide to play this game, know that the dev in the end will milk you for your money after making it look like he's super gamer-friendly. He's pandering towards whales, instead of the f2p community like he advertised. Past tense used intentionally.

My trust in the dev feels used. This is why I have trust issues.

14/08/2023:
- Lava pushes even more mtx through popups during the game, and you can't close them until you either change maps or enter the gem shop.
- The game is consistently losing concurrent players. On July alone the playercount dropped by 12%.
- Moved the edits to the bottom of the post.

5/07/2023:
- The King Doot pity does NOT apply to free rolls. You're still stuck waiting 6 years on average for your first gamebreaking Companion. If you intend to try out the game, please spend a minute and consider whether you're the target audience the game is trying to pander to. Don't fall for the scummy predatory tactics.
- Edited the initial review to acknowledge the past edits.

1/07/2023:
- An update has been released, with no changes to the companion mechanic (aside from King Doot, the ""5* Character"", to have an unforgiving pity of 200 rolls). Lava has stated, albeit ambiguously, that the mechanic is going to stay the way it is.
- Lava has not addressed the backlash, and only praised himself for increasing the playercount despite that increase in players likely being due to iOS players moving up to Steam in order to take part in the companion mechanic (purchasing green gems on iOS was disabled at that time) and due to sponsoring a YouTube video. He clearly ignored all the negative feedback thrown at him, selectively responding to only the positive messages in the server. He clearly misunderstands his community, or at least the ones that have concerns. [url=https://i.imgur.com/skiY7Jl.png]He did, however, respond to a negative post by pulling the ""if you don't like it, don't play it"" card on a member of the community[/url]. His attitude towards the entire situation feels super childish. There are way more messages sent by him in the server, just do some searching.
- A few hours after the update I have been muted on the game's main Discord without a ping or reason given (likely permanently). [url=https://i.imgur.com/y8c2KRv.png]I strongly believe my messages at that time were in no way harmful to the community, the dev, or the game[/url]. This is wrong.
- The edits caused the review to exceed the character limit, so I cut the old review and inserted a Pastebin link with that same old review for anyone interested.

25/06/2023: 
- There has been no official developer response ever since the p2w gacha nightmare has been released. If this doesn't say enough about his attitude towards his game's playerbase, I have absolutely no idea what does. All signs point at the fact that he's abandoned the game and is cashing in on the rest of his playerbase. Please do not defend this behavior.
- There are speculations that Lava, the developer, has already amassed seven figures through this update alone. This very likely may cause these business practices to keep on being introduced, assuming any update is ever going to come.
- Cheaters have already figured out ways to game the system despite the developer claiming otherwise.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"[h1]5/24/23 EDIT - THE FINAL STRAW[/h1]
Lava and his echo chamber of a community have been writing off legitimate complaints being written at this time as ""people are just whining because they got caught"": https://imgur.com/2g6JMyX As if what happened yesterday isn't a PERFECT, SHINING example of everything that Lava deserves criticism for.

[u]What happened:[/u]
[olist]
[*]Yesterday, this NPC offered more gold bars in exchange for gold bars (effectively an infinite gold bug): https://imgur.com/8QHNFZz
[*]This bug was predicted to happen by a third-party tool and was spoken about multiple times in the official Discord: https://imgur.com/CO7EYyL
[*]The main problem was that if someone went high enough AND had a very late-game, specific Artifact, they would be able to influence other areas of the game such as Sampling, Atoms, Alchemy. And then, if they went TOO high with the gold bars, the numbers would break.
[*]Some samples of things Lava said after waking up: https://imgur.com/a/4uVxA6Y
[*]After Lava confirmed that accounts would be ""severely reset"" and people would be ""put in their place"" for interacting with this bug ( https://imgur.com/a/MzFIqyr ), he goes on to reset progress for anyone he decided met the cutoff for being an ""exploiter."" Note: players who started with more gold bars would be able to click WAY fewer times to get into w/e the arbitrary ""exploiter range"" was.
[/olist]

[u]Other things of note:[/u]
[list]
[*]He did the same thing for everyone, which meant that some late-game players got their progress SEVERELY set back, while exploiters newer to W5 actually got buffs to some things (I am in this camp). He not only reset sailing progress for everyone (including eldritch artifacts), he reset Atoms, Alchemy, Sampling, and probably other things that I don't know about. He was dishonest in what he actually reset: https://imgur.com/a/88nYTo3
[*]For non-players, gold bars are NOT the main currency of Idleon. They are materials that are largely isolated to the Sailing skill. If you aren't a late-game player, you could not have gotten any meaningful gains with infinite gold bars unless you had also purchased Bottled Winds (instant AFK time) from the premium shop, which some people definitely did.
[*]Lava has let slide MULTIPLE other exploits that are now treated as ""you should have been there when it mattered,"" which have resulted in LITERAL YEARS of progress for other players. NOTHING was done to remedy, which is a pretty clear message to players to ""get it while the gettin's good."" Why was this situation different? Lava makes a lot of money by resetting progress.
[*]This game has a longstanding history of making players ask the question: ""is this intended or not?"" Lava prides himself on being ""troll"" and this is a huge part of the actual game.
[*]This game is not an MMO in a way that actually matters. there is no player economy. no one can trade with each other. there is no PvP, there is no ranking system, and the party dungeons are isolated from any outside gains. it is effectively a single player game. So why the harsh, vindictive punishment and language?
[/list]

[u]On ""exploiting"":[/u]
[list]
[*]People are saying ""Lava has to punish people."" What? Lava's role is not to ""discipline"" his playerbase. That's insane. A normal response would be ""Whoops, there's a bug, sorry about that, fix will be out soon."" NOT ""you all are at fault for exploiting it"" and whatever the fuck this is: https://imgur.com/a/nRjQOOi What kind of dev talks to their playerbase like this?
[*]The exploit that happened is also not some obscure thing that the average player would never know about. It's not ""press this sequence of buttons and clip through the floor, crouch, ragdoll into the wall."" No. It's right there in the interface of the game. It asks you to trade with it. It requires no cheats, no third-party tools, no extra knowledge.
[*]""But you should have [i]morals[/i], you should be a [i]good[/i] player and not do something so OBVIOUS"" Lava and I are not friends. I have no obligation to him. HE, however, the creator of this game that people have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on, has an obligation to deliver a clean product.
[/list]

Lava has successfully cultivated a community of the most toxic players I have ever experienced. He constantly pushes an ""us vs. them"" mentality about whatever thing he arbitrarily decided he is mad about that day. Him and his community are perfect for each other. They protect Lava like he's some poor, sad, rescue mutt that has tried to eat your niece like ""pleaseee things are soooo hard for him right now"" HE'S AN ADULT who can make his own choices. Own up to your mistakes or hire a team instead of trying to pick and choose what you want to experience as a solo dev.

You may be wondering why I leave the comments open if all of the above is true. I want you all to see for yourselves what having a parasocial relationship with Lava does to you. 

To any reasonable people reading, let this be a sign to leave this game. Something like this WILL happen again. You don't have to be around for it. Nothing about this game is actually fun anymore - it all died long ago. I'm uninstalling for good, and I won't miss it.


[h1]Original Review:[/h1]
I only started playing because a close friend advertised it to me as a game with a solo developer who is super cool and often interacts with the playerbase. When I first started in April 2021, I definitely got this impression. I tuned into the dev streams and even watched as he made an improvement I suggested. I even spent money on it, and I very rarely engage with the microtransactions in ANY game. 

Since then, it seems like I've only been disappointed.

[h1]What I dislike about the game:[/h1]
[list]
[*] That you HAVE to be connected to the Discord to receive any useful details about updates, explanations on how a particular skill works, gameplay issues, etc. No one would otherwise know what all of the utterly inscrutable language in the in-game text even means. The dev's descriptions of things are largely unhelpful, the UI can be very unintuitive (where tf do I click for things?), and more.
[*] Some parts are just not idle. You get hundreds of times more gains playing ""actively"" (leaving the game on in the background) than by actually idling. Some things ask you to check every 20 minutes. Another feature gives you the most returns if you check every 2 minutes (though not explicitly). That's nuts. 
[*] For a game that LOOKS like it would be pretty easy to run on even the cheapest setup, it is so poorly optimized that it makes my laptop (which can generally run most things I throw at it) scream bloody murder. What the hell is this game doing that is making the fans go insane?
[/list]

[h1]What I dislike about the developer:[/h1]
[list]
[*] He does not care about bug fixing, only about creating new content. Some bugs that are still there have been there from the start. 
[*] He says his game is not pay-to-win per his values, but every single update he comes out with also comes with a host of new microtransactions that would literally, LITERALLY, take free-to-play players MONTHS TO YEARS of playing to acquire without gems. Some purchases are literally buying stats. 
[*] So much of the game is ""create the problem, sell the solution"" on the dev's part. He often advertises new updates by saying ""good news! with this new thing, you can play the game LESS!""
[*] He moderates the Idleon subreddit and any negative posts about the game get removed.
[/list]

I think the saddest thing for me is to see beloved members of the community either get banned or leave. I can't tell you how many times I've searched up a well-made guide someone posted just to find out that the person is no longer in the Discord or no longer plays the game. The dev apparently also deletes any evidence of his own toxic behavior.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"Good game. [strike]Fair monetization.[/strike]** Active developer. Great balance between idle and active playing. Recommended for idle game fans.

Main criticism is that it's not really an MMO. The only interaction with other players is in a limited chat (used in a few quests) and in guilds to unlock some extra stats/bonuses.

Update:
**Monetization has unfortunately got a bit more predatory. 

The cash packs always gave access to bonuses pretty much exclusive to paying players (some can be bought through Twitch chat redemption, or regular discord giveaways), but they were basically very minor improvements or early access to non-shop items. Even the auto-loot is something that you can replicate for free with programs like auto-hotkey. The most significant boosts were always obtainable with gems, which can be obtained in-game through many different means. Purchasing the gem packs was just a way to skip the farming of the gems, with the exclusive stuff being a slight bonus. 

However, the addition of ""companions"" has slightly changed this dynamic. There is now a second type of gem. This type can only be obtained through purchasing them, or recycling companions bought with gems. The companion system is basically gambling (a gacha system). You get one free attempt a week, but you'll have to be incredibly lucky to obtain the best companion with that roll. IIRC I've seen it said that you need to spend around $400 on the companion gems to be guaranteed the best one (the pity system being added after a large amount of negative feedback). 

The companions are supposedly in an early stage, so maybe things will turn around with ways to obtain additional free rolls (it's unlikely to be free gems, as there's a trade function to be added). Either way, the game is still fun with lots to do before the companions affect it too much (the best bonus being a world 5 effect). And even then, it's still fun. Just be aware that it may be a sign for things to come.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",good strike fair monetization strike active developer great balance idle active recommended idle fan criticism not_really massively multiplayer online interaction player limited chat quest guild unlock extra stats bonus monetization unfortunately bit predatory cash pack gave access bonus pretty exclusive paying player bought twitch chat redemption regular discord giveaway basically minor improvement early access non shop item auto loot replicate program auto hotkey significant boost obtainable gem obtained different mean purchasing gem pack skip farming gem exclusive stuff slight bonus addition companion slightly changed dynamic type gem type obtained purchasing recycling companion bought gem companion basically gambling gacha attempt week incredibly lucky obtain best companion roll iirc spend 400 companion gem guaranteed best pity large negative feedback companion supposedly early stage maybe thing turn way obtain additional roll unlikely gem trade function fun lot companion affect best bonus world 5 effect s_emphasizedtill fun aware sign thing
1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I would like to clarify I have many hours in this game, and have spent a lot of time reaching goals, grinding, and the balance of mindlessness and brain usage is great. And I had fun.

However, this review is a recommendation. And as such, I do NOT recommend this game. With all it's micro-transactions, the new pet companion system, this game is deceptively pay-2-win, not in a way of ""You can only win if you pay"", but rather ""It is extremely easier to win if you pay. As such, F2P players are dragged behind, with these boosts unobtainable by any means. Combined with the developer who is not good at taking criticisms, combined with a hardcore community who does not seem to give a shit, these things add up to a game I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE ELSE TO PLAY.

While I understand the developer has to eat, and does not have any ad revenue from this, with his micro-transactions being his income source, this was handled very poorly, and furthermore refuses to change.

I love this game, have spent some money, and will continue to play it, but I do not recommend it to anyone looking for an idle MMO. 

For more info, take a look at this. This was originally a sheet managed by a group of people to have a guide when it comes to playing the game. They stopped maintaining it, leaving this message.

However, almost instantly, a group of people within the community disrespected their wishes, and restoring the original sheet for usage. 
If you think I'm too sensitive, well I'm sorry that I have some sense of principle and morality.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I fell in love with this game a few years ago before it was released on steam, and have played almost daily since. But I've now decided to quit.

The game has had a lot of updates over the last few years, some good and some bad, but the overall trend is the game getting progressively worse and more tedious. 
New systems are being introduced without ways to automate old systems, changing builds used to be fairly simple but now requires an excel sheet to remember everything you have to change.

P2W is getting worse with every new world released. It started with a very fair business model but has since moved on to loot boxes and time limited offers for upgrades/equipment that is much more powerful than anything you can get through actually playing the game.

The game is riddled with bugs and unfinished features that the dev won't fix or finish because he's more interested in making new content rather than fixing what's currently there. 

I can't recommend this game in its current state, and if the past few years are any indication I don't think it'll get better.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",fell love year ago released daily decided quit update last year good bad trend progressively worse tedious system introduced way automate old system changing build fairly simple requires excel sheet remember p2w worse world released started fair business model moved loot box limited offer upgrade equipment powerful riddled bug unfinished feature fix finish interested rather fixing currently recommend state past year indication t_emphasizedhink
1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"Has more bugs than a high school programming classroom.
There *was* a 90 page list of bugs people submitted in the forum, but the dev never fixes bugs. His solution was to delete the list.
He wants to be popular, and he thinks that the only way to get attention is by adding new stuff. The problem is that he never tests anything new for more than a couple minutes. Seriously, he posts his timeline on discord. So the bugs grow and grow and grow.
There's entire skills that you can put points into that do nothing. They have spreadsheets over on discord to keep track of what doesn't work. The bug reporting channel *never* stops growing. It's annoying because you can spend weeks putting points into something, thinking you were improving some stat or another, only to discover that it did nothing at all. Just doesn't work. Doesn't do what the thing says. Just off the top of my head, I can think of four entirely different systems that did this to me. Someone on Discord mentions, ""Oh, that doesn't do anything"" and you realize how much time you've wasted because he just never fixes bugs.
On android, he has a bug where large numbers aren't supported. So if a large amount of money drops, it just vanishes. Items in large stacks? Vanish. And he has no idea how to deal with it other than tell people to stop playing on the platform. I never did play much on Steam, but I have thousands of hours on Android. His defenders will go on and on about how it's just not possible to fix on Android because it's a platform limitation. That's nonsense. Computers have been dealing with higher numbers than 2 billion for a long, long time. There's tons of workarounds and tricks that computer scientists have developed over the years. You know what hasn't developed over the years? The dev's sense of professionalism or honesty.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"This game has an amazing premise, and is really, really fun for the first weeks. 

Unfortunately, it evolves into a very toxic, p2w endgame, which not only forces you to spend hundreds of dollars on lootbox-style purchases (chips in w4, sailing+gaming progress items, time limited progress candies), it also introduces FOMO-based premium items which outclass everything else in the game (premium wings, hats, dungeon chains). 
Secondly, this game is not idle at all, at least if you care about progress - most idle mechanisms are scaled in such a way, that the longer you afk, the less rewards you will actually get (limited inventory space for claiming afk in combat/skills, getting less cogs in construction as time goes by, sailing rewards being limited to a couple of chests in f2p - to name a few). On top of that, there are multiple mechanics that reward active play (or active afk), and that's why you will see players with absurd amounts of hours. Reaching endgame is not only impossible without having a device which will keep the game running 24/7, you are also forced to perform a very min-maxy process of sampling materials, which takes hours of active, yet very repetitive play every week (You need to perform the same steps on every character, otherwise you are going to lose potential gains).
Thirdly, the game solo developer is not accepting any forms of negative feedback - games Discord community has evolved into massive echo chamber where only praise is allowed, and complaining about any issues (for example bugs, there's an excel with hundreds of those) will simply get you banned. 
Lastly, there is no real balance in the mechanics. Every update brings in unbalanced features (there is no proper beta/alpha testing due to the devs fear of leaks), which ruin the gameplay (examples being - atom collider ruining alchemy and stamps, spice clicker, pet arena builds, divinity god linking).

To sum up, it's a cute little game that could have been an amazing idle MMORPG, unfortunately it has devolved into a buggy, p2w mess.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",amazing premise really_emphasized fun week unfortunately evolves toxic p2w endgame not_only force spend hundred dollar lootbox style purchase chip w4 sailing gaming progress item limited progress candy introduces fomo based premium item outclass else premium wing hat dungeon chain secondly not_idle care progress idle mechanism scaled longer afk reward limited inventory space claiming afk combat skill cog construction go sailing reward limited couple chest f2p name top multiple mechanic reward active active afk player absurd amount hour reaching endgame not_only impossible device running 24 7 forced perform min maxy process sampling material take hour active repetitive week perform step otherwise lose potential gain thirdly solo developer not_accepting form negative feedback game discord community evolved massive echo chamber praise allowed complaining issue example bug excel hundred simply banned lastly no_real balance mechanic brings unbalanced feature no_proper beta alpha testing due fear leak ruin example atom collider ruining alchemy stamp spice clicker pet arena build divinity god linking sum cute amazing idle mmorpg unfortunately devolved buggy p2w mess

Mad with power might follow. I can't even recommend this to my friends or people I talk to about idle games anymore.

The community is not happy and anyone that speaks out against him, even constructive criticism gets banned. I might get banned for this if he can but I don't really care that much anymore. 

I've been playing since his first game came out on the google play store. I decided I was gonna give it a month to see if he fixed the obvious problems and design that went against his repeatedly stated intentions of not needing or using scummy business practices in his games.

He clearly has no intention of correcting the issue, regardless of the number of players who are gone/banned or in the process of leaving.

I submitted an issue well over a month ago that is causing my refinery (major resource producer for the game) to take over a MONTH to spit out the resources that are supposed to days less than 2 days. The game is now impossible to enjoy, both because of the bug and the utter lack of care from the developer.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",month loved spent hundred dollar support developer come player supporter evidently care major issue submitted issue ago causing refinery major resource producer spit resource supposed day 2 day impossible enjoy bug utter lack care developer

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"[h1] At the time of this review I had 169 ;) hours in the span of two weeks and I still haven't even come close to complete the game. Also, completing the game is probably impossible.

[b]World 3 added A LOT more content, which wasn't out at the time I wrote this review.[/b][/h1]

This game being 100% free is the closest thing to robbery. On top of that, it's 100% playable if you are completely F2P. The fact that it's developed by a single person just blows my mind away. The guy is an active member of the community, listens, and is hilarious (protip: read everything in the game).

Legends of Idleon is the master of all idle games. I've dropped $50+ already and I'm easily going to spend more. The event deals are extremely worth it. If you were a fan of MapleStory, chances are you are going to love this game. 

There are so many things to explore and customize in this game, it's insane! Brace yourselves.

1) Damage Classes (more coming soon)
Beginner --> Journeyman 
Warrior --> Barbarian / Squire
Archer --> Bowman / Hunter
Mage --> Wizard / Shaman

Each of these classes have a unique specialization and they all level up independently. For example, warriors can mine or fish better, archers can craft items easier or catch bugs, mages can chop wood or do better alchemy, etc. When you are investing time into each task, their unique exp bar will take over. The best part is that, this way, the game promotes creating multiple characters with different classes that specialise in different things, while they all farm simultaneously. Every time you switch, what you'd be doing in the game changes and provides a great sense of variety.

2) Skill Classes
- Mining
- Chopping
- Catching Bugs
- Fishing
- Alchemy
- Smithing (crafting)

3) Tasks
In the two current worlds (3rd coming early May) that currently exist, there is a huge variety of achievements you can do to acquire merit points and unlock new crafting recipes.

4) Statues and Obols
Throughout your explorations you will acquire Statues and Obols that drop from monsters (you can acquire obols from alchemy too) that you can use to further enhance your build. Statues are applied to the particular character you use them on, while Obols have slots in 2 tabs, personal and family. 

5) Worlds
Currently there are 2 vast worlds (as mentioned next one is coming in early May) that you slowly unlock by killing a certain amount of monster in a particular map or by reaching certain skill levels (mining, chopping, catching, fishing).

6) Guilds
Their functionality is simple but heavily promotes working together to do your guild tasks, earn guild points, and unlock guild skills that further help your progress.

7) Items
- Armor (helmet, rings, amulets, breastplates, leggings, shoes)
- Weapons (spears/swords, bows, and staffs)
- Tools (pickaxes, axes, catching nets, fishing rods)
- Food (boosts certain stats and you have 2 slots available in the beginning)
- Trophies (cool-looking titles under your name that adds stats and effects)
- Premium Items (hats, chat rings, enhanced in-game features that make things happen faster)
- Bags and Shared Storage (you unlock inventory slots for both of them throughout the game)

8) Mini-games
Each skill (mining, chopping, etc) other than alchemy and smithing have their own unique little mini-game that you can play four times per day to acquire more drops and exp. Some are actually really fun.

9) Alchemy
Oh man, so many things here, you just gotta see it for yourself.

10) Smithing (crafting)
There are items that come from an auto-production system that works to build your exp for smithing and, thus, creating higher level items. You basically choose what to auto-produce, go farm, check the anvil, and auto-store all the produced items in your storage, profit.

11) Travelling
You can walk through a map and move to the next one when reaching the kill cap (kill X monsters to unlock the portal). You can also teleport anywhere you want once a day (you can upgrade this once for free or multiple times in the premium shop). This is only not-so-fun part of this game if you don't buy the ""+7 teleports / day"" premium item. But to be fair, it's really cheap.

12) Cards
Oh boy. Another fantastic aspect of the game. Each mob has a unique card that represents it and only drops (somewhat rare) from that specific mob. These cards have added stats that further help you customize your build (eg. +3% money, +5% mining efficiency, +5 base dmg, etc). You can equip up to 4 cards for free, then you can unlock 4 more slots for a premium fee.

13) Bosses
There are a few bosses in the game that drop some unique items, other than the final bosses of each world the battles aren't anything special.

14) Active vs. AFK
You can play the game actively and you can play the game afk, both work. There are builds that focus in better progress through AFK gameplay, and other builds that work better when actively playing. The option is yours.

NOTE: Just so you know, at this point I debated to stop writing my review because this game has so much friggin' content! And it's even done yet (it releases in a year)!

15) Star Signs and Constellations
Mid-late game content, accessed through a telescope and almost hidden little star drawings throughout the game. These constellations enhance your gameplay with bonus effects and stats that are unlocked by doing certain tasks (eg. farm afk for X hour(s) at Y map, reach X map with Y class) when you encounter those sneaky star drawings in a map.

16) Stamps
Throughout the game you will find or buy stamps (in-game currency) that enhance your stats (eg. +X defense, +X% smithing speed, etc.) for all your characters account-wide. 

17) Colosseum
It works like a Tower Defense game. You're placed in a small map, there's a timer, multiple rounds that spawn mobs, and you get to choose if you want to spawn the next wave instantly or wait. As a Barbarian (AoE auto-attacks), you'd go at the spot that the mobs spawn, activate auto-attack (spells activate automatically too), spam ""next round"", SLAUGHTER! Oh man, this is one of the most enjoyable things for me in the game.

18) Post-office
This is one the things I haven't unlocked yet, but from what I've seen it combines the concept of make and collect X items to receive Y reward. Seems kinda plain and monotone, but I haven't explored it yet.

19) Food
Food provides bonuses like:
+100hp if your health goes below 50%
+10% exp and has 80% chance to be consumed after killing a mob

There are some rare Food drops that are golden, which also stack (eg. 2 golden nomwiches give 12.4dmg instead of 6.8) and only occupy 1 Food Slot!

20) Vendors
They sell Rings, Amulets, Food, utility items (return to town scroll, skill reset shard), weapon / armor / storage / inventory upgrades, and stuff like that.

21) Quests
Personally, the least entertaining part of the game. I love the dialogue and the characters as they have unique and interesting personalities, however, the quests themselves are quite plain and monotone. Most of them are ""Kill X amount of Y monster"" or ""Acquire X amount of Y drop"". There are a few unique and fun ones, but nothing too special.

== My Idleon Experience ==
The game is absolutely fantastic if you want to keep yourself occupied with work or something else while you're using Legends of Idleon as a game of management. I set my characters to farm what I need for my next craft, or kill the mobs I need for a quest, or do a task for my guild. Then, IRL, I do work, hangout with the waifu, do the dishes, and lift weights. After all of those things that I [i]actually[/i] do, a few hours have passed by. I open up Legends of Idleon, I visit each character one-by-one, I get lost in the sea of drops that fall on the ground, my character glowing in a ray of light-beams while the EXP bar is going bananas with all my AFK gains, dopamine taking over my body with each single drop and level up... all in life is good again.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",169 hour span week close complete completing probably impossible world 3 wrote 100 closest robbery top 100 playable completely f2p developed single blow mind guy active member community listens hilarious protip read legend idleon master idle game dropped 50 already easily spend event deal extremely worth fan maplestory chance love thing explore customize insane brace 1 damage class coming soon beginner journeyman warrior barbarian squire archer bowman hunter mage wizard shaman class unique specialization independently example warrior mine fish archer craft item easier catch bug mages chop wood alchemy investing task unique exp bar best promotes creating multiple character different class specialise different thing farm simultaneously switch change provides great sense variety 2 skill class mining chopping catching bug fishing alchemy smithing crafting 3 task world 3rd coming early currently exist huge variety achievement acquire merit point unlock crafting recipe 4 statue obols throughout exploration acquire statue obols drop monster acquire obols alchemy enhance build statue applied particular obols slot 2 tab personal family 5 world currently 2 vast world mentioned next coming early slowly unlock killing certain monster particular map reaching certain skill level mining chopping catching fishing 6 guild functionality simple heavily promotes working guild task earn guild point unlock guild skill help progress 7 item armor helmet ring amulet breastplate legging shoe weapon spear sword bow staff tool pickax ax catching net fishing rod food boost certain stats 2 slot available beginning trophy cool title name add stats effect premium item hat chat ring enhanced feature thing happen faster bag shared storage unlock inventory slot throughout 8 mini game skill mining chopping alchemy smithing unique mini four time per acquire drop exp fun 9 alchemy oh man thing ta 10 smithing crafting item auto production work build exp smithing creating higher item basically choose auto produce farm check anvil auto store produced item storage profit 11 travelling walk map move next reaching kill cap kill x monster unlock portal teleport anywhere upgrade multiple time premium shop not_so fun 7 teleports premium fair cheap 12 card oh boy fantastic aspect mob unique card represents drop somewhat rare specific mob card stats help customize build eg 3 5 mining efficiency 5 base dmg equip 4 card unlock 4 slot premium fee 13 boss boss drop unique item final boss world battle special 14 active v afk actively afk build focus progress afk build actively option note debated writing friggin release 15 star sign constellation mid late accessed telescope hidden star drawing throughout constellation enhance bonus effect stats unlocked certain task eg farm afk x map reach x map class encounter sneaky star drawing map 16 stamp throughout stamp currency enhance stats eg x defense x smithing speed character wide 17 colosseum work tower defense placed small map timer multiple round spawn mob choose spawn next wave instantly wait barbarian aoe auto attack spot mob spawn activate auto attack spell activate automatically spam next round slaughter oh man enjoyable thing 18 post office thing unlocked combine concept collect x item receive reward kinda plain monotone explored 19 food_emphasized provides bonus 100hp health go 50 10 exp 80 chance consumed killing mob rare food drop golden stack eg 2 golden nomwiches 12 4dmg 6 8 occupy 1 food slot 20 vendor ring amulet food utility item return to_emphasizedwn scroll skill reset shard weapon armor storage inventory upgrade stuff 21 quest personally entertaining love dialogue character unique interesting personality quest plain monotone kill x monster acquire x drop unique fun one special idleon fantastic occupied else legend idleon management set character farm next craft kill mob task guild irl hangout waifu dish lift weight thing i_emphasized hour passed open legend idleon visit lost sea drop fall ground glowing ray light beam exp bar banana afk gain dopamine taking body single drop life good
1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"In my opinon and with 500 hrs + played I do think this is one of the best IDLE game out there,
Yes IDLE. If you play this game thinking it's a MMO, it's not. do not expect to have a community/social experience.

It's mostly a solo game where you only compete against YOURSELF.

You can do EVRYTHING in this game ALONE and FOR FREE. Yes for free. Contrary to what some other reviewers said, you can absolutely do everything in this without ever paying a single dollar. Although, spending money on the gem store does accelerate/make easier certain aspects of the game while encouraging the dev. 
Keep in mind Lava gets a bigger cut if you spend money on the website instead of steam.

Don't let yourself get discouraged by the bad reviews, most of them are salty players that probably didn't understand what this game is about before playing and their expectations were unrealistic. Try it and make your own opinion, it's FREE TO PLAY

Pros:
- lots of stuff to do
- Great skill system
- The dev has a great sense of humour (in my opinion)
- There is an active AND AFK aspect to this game but you can play it mostly AFK if you do not have much free time.
- the community on Discord and Reddit is great and helpful
- Dev does frequent streams on Twitch and is always adding new stuff to the game

Cons:
- SINGLE DEV. this is important to point out since, even though LavaFlame tries his best to develop the game, fix bugs and do customer support, it can take some time to get answered if you have an issue.
- There are bugs in this, it's not perfect. Once again it's a single dev, give him a break
- the chat system in game is lacking which makes it difficult to interact with other players. If you expect the same social experience as AAA MMORPGS like WoW, do not play this game

TL;DR: Great IDLE game. Not An MMO like you would expect. Keep in mind this is a Single Dev game so of course there will be bugs and slow customer support but be patient because LAVA is doing the best he can and he just want to make this game the best it can be (Not my words but his from a stream on Twitch he did lately)","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",opinon 500 hr best idle yes idle massively multiplayer online not_do not_expect community social mostly solo compete evrything alone yes contrary reviewer paying single dollar spending gem store accelerate easier certain aspect encouraging mind lava get bigger cut spend website discouraged bad review salty player probably understand expectation unrealistic opinion pro lot stuff great skill great sense humour opinion active afk aspect mostly afk not_have community discord reddit great helpful frequent stream twitch adding stuff con single important lavaflame try best develop fix bug customer support answered issue bug not_perfect single break chat lacking make difficult interact player expect social aaa mmorpgs wow not_play tl dr great idle not_an massively multiplayer online expect mind single course bug slow customer support patient lava best best not_my word stream twitch lately
1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"*Was* a great game until the dev decided to go back on his previous promise of not being 'P2W', which is why most people started playing this game (myself included). If you are seeing this and you think you might want to get the game, please don't. The dev stated that he doesn't care about the other players who stopped playing because of his additions due to the fact that the additions give him enough money to make ads and replace the other players. This means that the P2W is also just undoing any protest or fight back (especially since they also prevent people from talking about it almost anywhere aside from here or on mobile reviews).  Please, if you see this, give the game a bad review otherwise they will continue to think that this behaviour is okay and most likely instil even more P2W in this game.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",great decided previous promise not_being p2w started included seeing please t_emphasizedhe stated care player stopped addition due addition ad replace player mean p2w undoing protest fight especially prevent talking anywhere aside mobile review please bad otherwise continue behaviour okay instil p2w
1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"Been playing for around two weeks now, very much enjoying my time with the game.  I have 6 characters, about 15 levels away from unlocking slot #7. Almost done with world 2 (The current end-game content)

Pros:
1. Gameplay loop is pretty good ( warning: a lot of grinding )
2. Systems upon systems  for character growth
3. Amazingly friendly and helpful discord server for all new player questions
4. Relatively fair pricing in the gem shop
5. Cross play  on steam, browser, and android
6.  Solid single player experience, and true to its idle genre, allows for smooth AFK progression
7. Developer actively listens to suggestions in discord.  Not sure how much of the suggestions have been implemented, but its nice to know our feedback is at least looked at.

Cons:
1.  Inventory space is a huge problem.  Full disclosure, I've bought all inventory, and storage upgrades from the gem shop on day one, so I don't even know what life is like with the default inventory.  I also have most of the current end game carrying capacity upgrades, but even with that, I am completely out of space in storage.  In a game about grinding and collecting an ton of loot, inventory should not be an issue.  Honestly storage should be infinite.  But considering the monetization, this is not an option.  So a realistic option would be to least allow for large amount of bag purchases like Path of Exile.  The current limitation is simply not enough

2. Crafting/Gathering profession talents are mixed in with the class talents.  This means you are either leveling your character and are specced for combat, or your specced in your profession (miner for example).  This simply doesn't feel good.  I would like to be able to be specced as a miner, while also being a warrior, and not having to constantly re-spec my character.  Dual spec could resolve this.

3. Crafting professions are too talent point dependent.  Since class levels and profession levels are not separate, and u get 3 talent points per class level, compared to just one for profession levels, it forces you to  level your class in order to be viable.  For example a level 30 miner that is a 50 barbarian would be a better miner then someone who is a level 30 miner but has a 30 barbarian simply because he has 20 more levels of barbarian talent points to invest in mining.  A solution could be to separate out the profession talents so class talents cannot be used to massively buff professions.  Would probably require a rebalance of all skills (buffed most likely)

4. ""MMO"" aspect is not fully fleshed out.  Players can join guilds and talk, but your unable to see what someone else is doing in your lobby, they just stand there doing nothing.  Chat also doesn't feel persistent. I'm not sure if this is just because nobody talks but sometimes I re-log into the game and my previous chat isn't there, just the last thing i said


Overall its a good game with some obvious flaws,  I'll keep playing and hope some of these issues are addressed.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"It's pretty good, but not without certain glaring issues. 

IdleOn is touted as an idler and for the most part it is. With that said, If you're coming into IdleOn thinking there isn't going to be much of an active time investment on your part, you would be mistaken. There is an active element involved and it is a pretty large part of the game, more so than one may originally notice while starting out.

I should also point out the development stage is still relatively fresh, as you may notice by the ""early access"" tag. The biggest development issues I've noticed to date being jarring dialogue and unfinished, empty, or lacking areas. Combat, skills, and movement in general can be quite janky as well. While development is ongoing, the promise of new content, fixes, and reworks leads me to believe the future IdleOn will be an amazing experience.

While IdleOn is called an idle MMO, that can be a bit deceptive. It's online but it doesn't come across as 'massive' nor is the 'multiplayer' anything to write home about. The big gripe being there's no decent in-game communication or coordination that takes place despite having entities such as Guilds. Social interactions are limited in nature - borderline nonexistent across the board. Overall, I'd even go so far as to say you will find better ""MMO"" interaction in the Discord server than in-game at this point in time.

The final piece I want to touch on is the current content, which can be hit and miss. Some aspects are nothing short of atrocious while other bits are great. Mini-games for instance, are the #1 most obnoxious, off-putting, and otherwise janky activity currently available. On the other hand, I really enjoy crafting, whether it's getting a recipe drop while hunting or gathering loads of materials to make a shiny new weapon. Quests can be a bit iffy too. Most progression questing seems spot on while Guild questing leaves a lot to be desired in terms of reward and the ability to actually complete the tasks at whatever your current stage of progression may be. I suppose you could chalk a lot of this up to personal taste.

So, despite the obvious issues, do I recommend IdleOn? Yeah, all things considered it's pretty decent and a good bit of fun. I think the takeaway here is that development is ongoing and while content and labeling could use a lot of work, the framework still provides quite a lot of enjoyment.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"Alright, after playing this game for around 10 months and wasting more than 2000 hours in it, I've gotta change my review from positive to super negative.

While the game itself is okay for the most part if you intend to play it very, very casually, the unprofessional and childish behavior of the Developer should not be supported.

He actively deletes any form of criticism on the Steam discussions, on Reddit (ironically the Dev moderates his own subreddit) and on Discord, and even bans people for expressing their opinion if they don't fit his narrativ.

I've once took my time to give some feedback on Reddit, seen from the perspective of an Endgame player. The post was as objectively written as I could, and reached  the frontpage of the Sub within a few minutes.

However, once the Developer woke up and saw my post, he immediately went on Discord and threw a tantrum about how this post ruined his morning,
how ungrateful the players are and how he is going to ban everybody who brings certain topics mentioned in my post up again.

With that not being enough, he also banned me from the Discord after telling him that he should not take criticism about the game as a personal attack on his person, followed by banning another person from the Discord who tried to call him out on his censorship right after.

This is not the first time this has happened. Within the last few weeks the Dev had multiple tantrums
on the Discord where he complained about players criticizing him, youtubers calling his game p2w and other absolutely normal things a gaming community does. Every time this is followed by himself purging the last 1000 Discord messages, so the proof for his little panic attacks vanishes to the void and people don't see how much of a jerk he actually is.

Like a child the dev is absolutely incapable of handling any form of criticism, no matter if your only intension was to help the game out by speaking about content that got neglected for a while, he will see it as a personal attack and whine about it.

Also, the game is full of exploits which allows you to completely break certain aspects of the game and the developers refuses to fix. He occasionally fixes some really minor bugs that barely impact the game, but all the big exploits have been in the game for multiple months, making it completely impossible comparing yourself with other
players stats without knowing who did, and who did not abuse certain things. 

So instead of playing Tropico, you could simply play this Dictatorship simulator. If you don't like those, go ahead and search a game in which the developer actually values the feedback of his players and isn't full of game breaking bugs.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",alright 10 month wasting 2000 hour ta positive super negative okay intend very_emphasized casually unprofessional childish behavior developer not_be supported actively deletes form criticism discussion reddit ironically moderate subreddit discord ban expressing opinion fit narrativ took feedback reddit perspective endgame post objectively written reached frontpage sub minute developer woke saw post immediately discord threw tantrum post ruined morning ungrateful player ban everybody brings certain topic mentioned post not_being banned discord telling not_take criticism personal attack followed banning discord tried call censorship not_the happened last week multiple tantrum discord complained player criticizing youtubers calling p2w normal thing gaming community followed purging last 1000 discord message proof panic attack vanishes void jerk child incapable handling form criticism no_matter intension help speaking neglected personal attack whine exploit allows completely break certain aspect developer refuse fix occasionally fix minor bug barely impact big exploit multiple month completely impossible comparing player stats knowing not_abuse certain thing tropico simply dictatorship simulator ahead search developer value feedback player breaking bug

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I've spent many hours playing this game, spent hundreds of dollars. I can safely suggest saving your money for something else. There were so many promises made and broken with this game. The cost of each world keeps going up, and time walls keep being put in place to try to force people to spend $$ on the game. I was one of the people buying every bundle to support the dev. I even created discord bots, and invested time working with the dev community to try to improve the experience for players.

When I started playing the game was great, there was only w1 and w2 available but they were fairly challenging and it was a good experience. As new worlds come out the previous worlds are nerfed to be easier so that players can push into the next worlds. What took me months/years are taking players 1/10th of the time to achieve now.

I just mentioned in another discussion about autoloot being the first pretty concerning part of the game. The game is written in a language that I wouldn't consider optimal for a game of this caliber. It's a block programming language that is generally used to teaching children how to code. Not only has this game found itself with constant memory leaks if you leave game open, play with cogs too much, or too many party dungeons (some of these possibly fixxed) as items pile up on the ground, the game gets progressively slower and slower and you'll find yourself hours behind vs real time if you aren't keeping the items off the ground. When autoloot was added it was a godsend, helping relieve some of this lag unless your inventory filled up. But as others have pointed out it's only available for $$, not gems so it cannot be earned by playing the game but it's important to the game running smoothly.

With w3, we got a ton of new bonuses that people balked at with I think over $100 in new bonuses to buy if you were to use $$ to buy gems. With w4, we were introduced to both weekly and possibly daily shop items to help progress. Specifically in w4 you had jewels and chips which you can craft in game for free but require you to have quite a considerable amount of resources and be at a certain stage of the game when the cycle rolls around. Seeing how it takes a while to get your kitchen going, you find yourself missing a lot of the jewels or chips and so you can gamble to buy mystery jewels and chips to try to progress faster. Not a required thing, but it still felt really scummy.

W5 has more daily/weekly items to buy, but of course the most recent thing that sent everyone into a frenzy is the new gacha/gambling mechanic where you can buy a new currency with $$ that is not available to be earned in game (currently) and with that new currency gamble on getting new pets that have wildly increasingly insane bonuses. I believe they were also mentioned to be seasonal and you can only trade pets that you bought with $$, free players cannot trade. So with the insane bonuses and the FOMO, you are almost stuck with the choice to gamble possibly hundreds of dollars or find a new game, which is where some of the players found themselves.

I personally cannot continue to support the predatory practices. I'll still casually play the game, but I'll be taking down my projects for the game.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"I have played this game since mid-2021, before the World 3 update.

I have spent.. I don't know, probably around $200-300 on this game? It's hard to say, I used to insta-buy packs when they popped up in game.

I spent so much money on this game because the Developer, LavaFlame2, was incredibly communicative and community-conscious in developing his game. He was always clear and decisive in his statements.

Then came the dreaded ""Pet Followers"" update. Lava, without any sort of notice, dropped an update in which you could roll in a gacha system to get a ""Pet"" that completely shattered the previously carefully curated game balance.

Now, most detractors have said ""It's a solo game, there's no leader board, no competition, who cares?? Get over it and stop playing if you don't like it"".. those posters are technically correct, but the issue is Lava spent YEARS pretending not to be this kind of developer. He literally edited statements out of his Steam page about the game ""not being pay to win.""

I spent money on this game because I loved Lava's attitude, approach, and message.. but sadly, he has chosen to cast off the community he built over the last several years. He is now chasing the quick buck via an unforgiving monetization system. You can't even gamble in the new system with the old currency.. I have ~6000 gems and can't roll for the broken ""pet"" because there is suddenly a new currency.

I could honestly have forgiven all of this, and waited to write this review for weeks/months after the aforementioned update, if Lava had just communicated with us. If he said ""Listen, I'm so sorry, I know this goes against what I stated previously, but I need to monetize this way for X/Y/Z reason"", I would have understood, forgiven him, and continued to spend the very limited budget I have for games on his projects.

Please.. I beg of you.. if you are some random Steam user reading this review, RUN and give your money to devs that aren't disingenuous snakes. Lava has seismically changed his development philosophy and REFUSED to engage with his own playerbase about it.. please don't be part of the next wave. LavaFlame2 should fail, because he saw the pain and confusion in his own community and was silent. To this day, MONTHS later, he has been completely and utterly silent about this controversy, despite very public statements from some of his older, most dedicated players. 

I don't count myself among the ranks of ""most dedicated,"" not by a mile. That said, I am a casual player that loved this game and spent more on it than I should have, and NEVER will spend again.

The developer started breaking promises (such as not being a ""scummy mobile game"" or possibility to obtain everything from the premium shop by grinding in-game), deleting or editing his old messages to fit his current views and to hide ""evidence"", being condescending.

==========
[b]BUGS & ISSUES[/b]
- Sometimes after doing everything in the game and just closed it, the game didn't save my progress however. The safest way is go to the Character Selection Menu then only close the game
- Sometimes it's frustrating to double click on the player to see their info. You would often misclick the items behind (like chest / anvil)
- Classes are imbalance. [spoiler]Obviously the warrior is the strongest now, in terms of most of the questline and boss fight. Warrior's skills CD is low and requires low mana, whereas archer's skills CD too long and consumes high mana. Warrior's required stats boost a lot of hp/mp as well, unlike the other classes that requires AGI doesn't do much on stats.[/spoiler]
- Pathing in F1 - Forest Outskirts should be improved. When I'm on the lower middle right platform and clicked the portal to next map, it will climb back up instead to walk along the default pathing.
- (Archer) Kinda hard to stand next to Amarok for attack, as one of archer's skill is a melee attack.
- Sometimes the portal does not work for auto pathing, the character will stop halfway instead of walking towards the portal. Eg: T1 - The Base of Bark, F2 - Encroaching Forest Villas, D1 - Jar Bridge


==========
[b]SUGGESTIONNS[/b]
- While searching for Guild, there should have a list of guilds for the players to choose
- For the guild member list, dev may consider adding on the last log in record, and how much increment of GP
- Please add an auto sort function in storage. eg: Monster drops categories, Food categories sorting.
- You may consider adding on more keyboard shortcut, eg: G for guild, L for quest
- Please do an IOS version, I beg of thee.
- [spoiler]More secrets & easter eggs plz[/spoiler]


=========
Overall, this is pretty much an enjoyable game. You may play it slow and chillax, or you want to play it fast, or even with $$$ (?). It's all up to you.
Lastly, I really appreciate the developer for spending his time & effort in this game, and the community.

1476970,IdleOn - The Idle MMO,"Edit 01/07/2023
Developer has provided a response to the recent gacha update.
He thinks that because he is a game developer his sole job is to develop the game and to not address the issues at all since he isnt a ""political streamer"", which isn't really the case when you're a solo indie developer. You also need to address the issues that you cause with your updates.

Edit 07/03/2023:
Lavaflame2 has decided to add a hidden update for anyone who hasn't spent money on the game.
When you first load into the game, if you've never spent money on the game, essentially being a free to play player a bunch of cursors will spawn around your character, berate you for never spending money on the game and then kill you.
If you were claiming afk gains you've now lost them if you don't have your daily instant rez available.
This is only suppose to happen once, but it can bug out and kill you multiple times.

I'm not sure what kind of joke the developer thinks he's pulling by openly berating what is 90% of his playerbase for not spending money on his game. I'd never recommend playing this game unless you enjoy being mocked for not wanting to spend money on an idle game.

Game is no longer okay.

The paying aspects are becoming more predatory if you want to gain meaningful progress.
Various free ways to earn gems have been reduced to enforce this predatory behaviour. 
I can imagine this trend will continue with future updates.

Also Developer never seems to want to fix bugs even though there's a massive list of them.
Once promised weekly updates + bug fixes, never actually followed through.
Developer also likes to pull the ladder up on players so that they can't catch up to those who are ahead due to fixing things that aren't working how he intends, but then doesn't balance the content to match the fixes.

Edit 04/03/2023
Developer has decided to remove the cosmetics part of the store due to ""too many options"" and that it apparently turns people away from the store, instead of just making the cosmetics tab not be the first tab you see.
Instead though, he's decided to add everyones favourite /s FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) to the store instead, where you have around 2 weeks to buy various Pay to Win items that're better than what you can earn from playing the game before they're gone.

Also the cosmetics have apparently been added to the FOMO Store also, but only 1 or 2 at a time, so if you wanted that cool Corgi hat that you see people wearing, well too bad it's gone since it was in a previous FOMO Store.","Mostly Positive77% of the 15,601 user reviews for this game are positive.",01 07 2023 developer provided response recent gacha think developer sole develop not_address issue isnt political streamer case solo indie developer address issue cause update 07 03 2023 lavaflame2 decided add hidden spent load never_spent essentially play_emphasizeder bunch cursor spawn berate never_spending kill claiming afk gain lost daily instant rez available suppose happen bug kill multiple time not_sure kind joke developer think pulling openly berating 90 playerbase not_spending never_recommend unless enjoy mocked not_wanting spend idle game_emphasized no_longer okay paying aspect predatory gain meaningful progress various way earn gem reduced enforce predatory behaviour imagine trend continue future update developer never_seems fix bug massive promised weekly update bug fix never_actually followed developer like pull ladder player catch ahead due fixing thing working intends balance fix 04 03 2023 developer decided remove cosmetic store due to_emphasizedo option apparently turn store cosmetic tab not_be tab decided add everyones favourite fomo fear missing store 2 week various pay win item earn cosmetic apparently fomo store 1 2 wanted cool corgi hat wearing bad previous fomo store

1144200,Ready or Not,"Look, I am not exaggerating here when I say this but, Ready or Not is genuinely one of the most thrilling, nerve-wrecking, exciting and best games I have played so far this year. For someone like me that grew up playing SWAT 4 pretty much every day after school on my dad's old Dell PC this game brings back a lot of nostalgia for me which makes it even better. I think I speak for all of us that played SWAT 4 when I say we have all been waiting and seething for a similar title that can scratch that itch - Ready or Not does just that. The game is fantastic in every single aspect. I also love how punishing and difficult it can be at times. The margin for error is very small, which just adds to the realism. 

The game very much fits the ""Early Access"" model at this current state and content is neither here nor there in my book. At the moment there are currently 6 vastly different maps, a hotel, a gas station, a crack house, a port, a farm and a car dealership. All 6 of aforementioned maps are beautifully crafted with the visuals immediately immersing you in the world you are playing in. The sound design is awesome as well, might I add. The sound of explosions, flashbangs, the guns, they sound and feel impactful, something even AAA studios fail to replicate at times. 

The AI are either good or straight up stupid at times, they are definitely the one thing that needs the most work. But I find that most of the time they do work relatively fine. 

I hope to see the implementation of achievements - which would be cool to grind for/incentivise us to play - and more customisation - that stays true to real life, of course, Jesus forbid we get another RS6 - and potentially more weapons to fool around with. The game comes in expensive at around 35 bucks but if you are looking to get your tactical shooter fix, Ready or Not will do just that for you.","Very Positive88% of the 127,116 user reviews for this game are positive.",look not_exaggerating ready not_is genuinely thrilling nerve wrecking exciting best game far someone grew swat 4 pretty school dad old dell pc brings nostalgia make speak swat 4 waiting seething similar title scratch itch ready not_does fantastic single aspect love punishing difficult time margin error small add realism fit early access model state neither_here nor_there book moment currently 6 vastly different map hotel gas station crack house port farm car dealership 6 aforementioned map beautifully crafted visuals immediately immersing world sound design awesome add sound explosion flashbangs gun sound impactful aaa studio fail replicate time ai good straight stupid time definitely need relatively fine hope implementation achievement cool grind incentivise customisation stay true real life course jesus forbid rs6 potentially weapon fool come expensive 35 buck tactical shooter fix ready not_will

1144200,Ready or Not,"Just when everyone thought 2021 was over in terms of relevant releases, [i]Ready or Not[/i] appeared out of thin air. Well, not exactly out of thin air. People knew it was coming, and it has been under development for a while now, but [i]Void Interactive[/i] was being rather secretive with the early access release date, throwing people off the scent with a [i]Twitter[/i] post two days before the public EA release with the classic “it just might come out this year”. And it did. 

[i]Ready or Not[/i], or [b]RoN[/b] like people usually refer to it, is a tactical shooter in the making, that promises to eventually become just as good as the legendary [i]SWAT 4[/i] from [i]Irrational Games[/i]. Your character is a [i]SWAT[/i] operator and your job is to arrest or kill bad guys, make sure civilians are safe and apprehend drugs, illegal weapons, destroy human trafficking schemes, and so on. The usual tactical police stuff, done brilliantly. You can either play alone with four AI-controlled teammates or cooperatively with up to four teammates, with the twist that there’s no friendly AI to offer a hand or two, meaning that heading to the mission with just one or two friends will be rather challenging. The enemy count varies per map and it’s often dependent on the environment: some will naturally have a higher civilian to bad guy ratio due to its sheer likeliness while the opposite also occurs. Currently, there are five different maps to choose from, with an extra two [i]WIP[/i] environments, still untextured and ridden with glitches. Granted, it’s still an early access title and more maps are going to be released, along with full modding support so that the community can also help provide extra content to warrant unlimited hours of fun.

As far as content is concerned, there isn’t a lot just yet, but the variety is good enough to allow different approaches to each mission so that the replay factor is nearly endless. From your average M4 rifle to a paintball gun (yup), they got you covered. The gear list is also rather extensive, with different vests, masks, cop paraphernalia like battering rams, breaching shotguns, C2 explosives, flashbangs, even a camera thing that allows you to look under doors. Who’d ever imagine that voyeurism could be used to enforce law and order!

As it couldn’t be any different with an [i]Early Access[/i] title, some things still do not work as expected, an OK thing if it gets fixed, and it probably will. The AI can be rather unpredictable sometimes, with civilians running from you, sometimes locking themselves in rooms with the enemies, or just straight up hiding from you and making your mission take a lot longer because you and your friends end up forced to play tridimensional [i]“Where’s Wally?”[/i].  Something else that might annoy you ever so slightly is the fact that civilians and enemies don’t have a lot of different voice lines, meaning you will hear the same sentences over and over even during the very same mission. Granted, it’s probably a placeholder. On that same note, the cop’s voice is way too calm, which differs a lot from real-life operator footage telling bad guys to drop their weapons. But once again, a placeholder card probably applies. 

The gameplay aspect is where [i]RoN[/i] truly shines, sporting the possible best gunplay on the market, shootouts are dynamic and challenging. The AI can be very accurate at times, making it so you and your friends got to be on the very edge, with eyes wide open. It doesn’t take much to die, just like in real life. You are not a bullet sponge, nor are the enemies or civilians. As a matter of fact, civilians are even more fragile, so be mindful of that and take extra care when breaching into a room with thugs and civvies inside. That’s where the tactical element comes into play and cohesive play rewards you, while recklessness can be punishing. There are multiple ways to approach the different situations that you will be faced with and no right answers. Go with your guts, trial and error, or develop standard operating procedures with your friends so that everyone knows what to do and what not to do to get things done the cleanest way possible. It’s easier said than done, as [i]Ready or Not[/i] is very hard and will give you a tough time if you are not paying enough attention. The sheer unpredictability makes for very fun and engaging gameplay. 

It would be interesting to have a little more dynamism on certain stuff, like objective items that always spawn at a fixed location, making it so you always know where to go and how to get there efficiently without major hiccups, which is good from a speedrunning standpoint but doesn’t help when it comes to longevity, because it will get repetitive quickly. On the other hand, enemy spawn points are always random, with no mission playing the same, even if the items will always spawn at the very same location. Just like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get.

Visually, [i]RoN[/i] is impressive. Powered by [i]Unreal Engine 4[/i], it certainly does not disappoint with textures, lighting, level design, and performance. It doesn’t take much to run, and my old faithful [i]RTX 2070[/i] could easily run it on epic settings in 1080p, well above 100 fps, with eventual drops here and there. As expected from any so-called next-generation title, it supports [i]DLSS[/i], which boosts the overall performance quite significantly, up to 40% even in sub-4K resolutions, without compromising the visual acuity, meaning no ghosting, no artifacts, as clear as it can be. A really solid implementation, even more so considering it’s still a work in progress.

It’s no exaggeration to say that [i]Ready or Not[/i] is perhaps one of the most solid early access releases ever. As much as it still has a lot of things that are not quite up to standard yet, the gameplay mechanics and the challenge are enough to keep you coming back for more. A breath of fresh new air into a genre that we haven’t seen much from, apart from [i]Zero Hour[/i]. It was a long, painful wait, but SWAT 4’s spiritual successor is finally among us and it’s great.

+ realistic, and slow (as I have long wished in a swat/rainbow six successor)
+ complex maps that are always being expanded and new ones are added.
+ very intelligent AI even if it has times aimbot.
(hides in closets, fake surrender, throws away gun takes it again when not paying attention or pulls knife)
+ always feedback from the devs current work on the game (as I know it in no other game like)
+ sound backdrop 
+ very nice atmosphere
+ friendly community

= game is from price performance really good, 
so don't be fooled by the supporter edition it is only there to support the developers.

- the footsteps sounds you can partly not distinguish whether they are under you or above you.
- in current status still too few weapons
- singleplayer is no fun because the ally ai is too strong and everything aimbottet away

1144200,Ready or Not,"Before I started playing this game, there was quite the divide between my wife and I. She wasn't a big fan of video games, but I spend a decent amount of time playing them. I always tried to get her to play with me, but she always refused. She'd say, ""It's just not fun for me. I'm not good.""

But then I downloaded ""Ready or Not,"" and everything immediately changed.

The gameplay is smooth, and the graphics are much better than I expected. The gun mechanics are the most realistic I've ever seen in a game. There is a surprising variety in types of enemies and civilians. It's always a rush when you have to make a split second decision on whether you're about to shoot a person in defense, or take an innocent civilian's life.

1144200,Ready or Not,"[h1] 1.0 Review Update: [/h1]

WIP

[h1] Old 'happy' Early Access Review: [/h1]

They wrote ""SWAT 5"" wrong.

Seriously, though; the game is sick!
It is made to be highly replayable and punishing.

It has all the great things late SWAT titles had plus ergonomics simulation.

Pros:
Punishing.
Made to be as realistic as possible.
Weapon sounds are the BEST around, I'd risk saying.
More features coming on top of what we encountered over previous games.
Hostile AI is a challenge. (harder the better, without escaping from realistic)
Maps are well made.
Outstanding lighting techniques on graphics.
AMD FSR to keep your GPU happy and cold.


Downsides:
Graphical glitches.
AI glitches.
Limited content as in early access.
Weapon customization design makes it impossible to have flashlight and laser at the same time. (Escape from Tarkov still is king on weapon attachments).


Notes: RON doesn't compare to Ground Branch. If you have one, the other one will add a lot as they overlap each other very little.

PLEASE, DEVELOPER: Don't make this game focused on PVP. Single player and Co-Op is where the longevity is. Keep it as replayable and creative challenging as possible. Update the AI and keep that content coming...","Very Positive88% of the 127,116 user reviews for this game are positive.",1 0 wip old happy early access wrote swat 5 wrong seriously sick highly replayable punishing great thing late swat title plus ergonomics simulation pro punishing realistic possible weapon sound best risk saying feature coming top encountered previous game hostile ai challenge harder escaping realistic map outstanding lighting technique graphic amd fsr gpu happy cold downside graphical glitch ai glitch limited early access weapon customization design make impossible flashlight laser escape tarkov king weapon attachment note ron compare ground branch add overlap please developer focused pvp single co overpowered longevity replayable creative challenging possible ai coming

1144200,Ready or Not,"Good game. Intense and realistic. However, I really can not recommend if you have no one to play with. Matching, as with any game, is a gamble for good players and the performance can be good on the older maps but the newer the map is, the more you will notice performance issues. Also, if you do play alone like me, expect some annoying AI teammates. They are janky looking, move in weird, almost robotic ways, and they will ignore your commands from time to time so you have to help them with it. For instance, if they do not open the door after you say ""open and clear,"" you will have to do it for them. Then they will move in. If they simply do not enter the room with the door open, you will have to enter by yourself and tell them to ""fall in.""

[h1]UPDATE (May 28 2021):[/h1]

[list]
      [*] [b]New content is still being released![/b]

      [olist]
            [*] More mechanics are being added to the game, which changes how survivors play. Ex: Zombies being added in the R.E. chapter (in Player Test Build at the time of this update). 
            [*] Some cosmetics can be purchased with shards, unlocked through game-play, or redeemed via codes released by BHVR.
            [*] Periodic events. Currently, there's an event to find Gnome Chompski once the exit gates are powered. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]Map and graphical updates.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] The game generally looks a lot better now.
            [*] Multiple variants of maps.
            [*] Maps tend to be smaller now, which can be both good and bad. Gens feel closer together but that also applies to hooks. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]The Rift[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] A battle pass has been added to the game.
            [*] Auric cells (paid currency) are part of the reward system- if you complete the Rift you actually get your money back!
            [*] Players are rewarded with cosmetics, lore (The Archives), and various forms of in-game currency. 
            [*] Challenges from the Rift add an extra layer of fun (or psychological distress and anguish) to matches. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]Matchmaking... Again[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Queue times are substantially faster for survivors in the morning than in the afternoon/evening.
            [*] I'm a filthy survivor main heathen, so I can only assume that means killer queue times are better in the afternoon/evening. 
            [*] Still occasionally end up in lobbies that are very unbalanced or entirely unfair, but it's better than it used to be. 
            [*] There's a lot more player consistency in terms of skill, but also toxicity, in higher ranks. 
            [*] If you want to meme and enjoy, the higher ranks tend to be very serious... 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]HIT BOXES MAKE ME CRY.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] This is just a game.
            [*] Please, self... It's just a game...
            [*] [i]Sobbing intensifies.[/i]
            [*] In all seriousness though, the hit boxes need some improvement. Lag, frame-perfect timing, and other aspects all influence whether the hatchet hits your face or clips through your face. 
            [*] I may be a survivor main, but if a Huntress nails me across the map, I'm impressed with the shot and outraged on the killer's behalf if it doesn't register. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]What accessibility options?[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Changing the struggle phase on hook to a series of skill checks was a huge improvement in terms of accessibility for wider audiences. 
            [*] An option to suppress screen flashing effects or toggle an alternate view for them would be helpful. A fade-in, solid color, then fade-out screen aura might be a good option for this? It would preserve visual information without giving an 'unfair advantage' to players.
            [*] For the record, players with disabilities just wanna grind for bloodpoints and cry like everyone else. If your primary concern is giving players an 'unfair advantage,' please remember that accessibility options compensate for a set-back so that people with disabilities have an even playing field.

[h1]I'd say that the changes boost my rating to a 9/10, but the hit box issues can definitely make this game feel like a 2/10.[/h1]

To BHVR, if they ever stumble their way into this review: 
The new content is great but please look into hit registration and hit boxes. Accessibility options for a wide range of players would also be highly appreciated [i]and[/i] it would increase audience reach and profitability. Keep up the good work.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Out of all the reviews I wrote, This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. 

For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.

But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.

As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. 

I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.

But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. 

I wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!","Very Positive80% of the 512,225 user reviews for this game are positive.",review wrote probably serious wrote starter community suck online wan na talk jerk wan na suck camped blah_emphasized rare nice compliment talk community unlike online game mic worry hearing twelve old cry raging talk beginning start survivor killer survivor chat killer talk mostly good good survivor basically man sneaky screw player good mate rescue hook someone jerk chat not_to save hooked mostly killer fun survivor someone ta killer hear enjoy survivor probably becuase survivor feel horror mate killer trying great community suck ignore community someone raging good leave seeing argue waste mad last word aka good 8 10 wonder read write wan na swear censor heart like read leaving comment someone read peice crap yay
381210,Dead by Daylight,"The game has a lot of potential but is ran by people that don't have a vision and only care about themselves and what they think is best for the game.

I have played since 2016 Beta and have more than 10,000 hours of actual playtime on this (my personal account) and previously worked at BHVR on the game. If this was years ago.. I would have recommended the game without any question. However, with the game's current state and direction, I could never recommend it to anyone under any circumstance.

It's just going downhill and that's the reality of it. They are partnering with anyone in an attempt to stay relevant and keep quarterly stats up but that only lasts for a week and then it's back to being a dead game for the most part.

If you ever decide to work at this company, just note that your personal account is at high risk of being permanently banned if you are accused of anything and are wrongfully terminated as a result.

They will not only ban your dev account (which is fine) but your personal account as well, which is actual bullsh*t and petty. I'm living proof of this.

They won't conduct a proper and thorough investigation behind their claims before terminating an employee and will sh*t all over your 6-years of dedicated gameplay, time spent and work into a product that you once loved and cared for to the point that you even took a job to work on the game to make it better not just for yourself but for the community who also loves the game.

Clueless company making clueless decisions on a game that they're clueless about since they don't play it.

I was one of the literal few at the company who has more than 4,000 hours of actual gameplay in the game.

P.S. they still haven't fixed the IP leak vuln that has been the cause of people being DDoSed, doxed, swatted and much more. They've known about it for over 2 years now and refuse to fix something so simple while knowing what the root cause of it is and know what exactly to fix.

Just to give you an idea of how little they care... I brought this up before and during my time working there and it was never fixed. We're now going into 2023 with this vulnerability that's been in the game for over 4+ years.

Still think BHVR cares about you now? Their main focus is and always has been to make money and that's why this issue has never been addressed even though their own Fog Whisperers like Otzdarva, Elix and many others have questioned why they haven't fixed it yet and are victims to these issues.

Their priorities are all over the place and have no idea how to run a game company let alone keep the community safe. It's pretty evident that these are the facts.

They would rather ban innocent people than to solve the huge security risks and flaws in the game. It's disgusting and this type of ""behaviour"" should not be condoned.

I'm more surprised Valve/Steam is even allowing the game to remain playable on their platform considering the company refuses to fix these issues that is allowing these events take place.

Cheaters? I won't get into that. Everyone knows the answer to this already. The company looks at them as paying customers that deserve respect (direct quote from an employee that's in a leadership role btw) and would rather keep them around than get rid of them entirely.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Disclaimer: I survivor main. 

I play games for fun, not for competition, so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps, oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately, hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops), and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with), then no biggie. Next game please~

I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.

As a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up - there is always the next game :)

That being said, this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it, have fun with it, and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ;) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine - just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!), and even then, recognize that there are jerks who play this game, like any other game, and have fun while you compete!","Very Positive80% of the 512,225 user reviews for this game are positive.",disclaimer survivor game fun not_for competition dbd community bad killer face camp oh die move next good killer find immediately hook bc juke whoop patrol camp 100 ok no_biggie next please community salt killer come dealing rank survivor properly flash killer face legitimate strategy take fun opinion killer horrible called name survivor tell gud older player ruin newer player player 1000 hour relax fun pip next crazy fun saltiness community buying grab fun ignore hard fixate ranking process unless absurdly highly competitive fine not_to push spout anger recognize jerk fun compete

But they refused to compensate me, saying they couldn't find anything strange in their logs. Rather, they said that if you keep providing false information, you'll be punished strongly. Then, they closed the agenda obstinately. I really loved this game, but now I feel betrayed. I would never recommend it. There are so many bugs in this game and no compensation for the victim. Even the crew doesn't have basic manners. Don't buy this game. Don't waste your money and life.

Hello,

This is the last answer from Buckymanny of the DBD team. In the last request, I said ""If you don't believe the information, I could give you my Steam ID and password, so if you want, tell me"". BUT He closed the agenda with this answer when nothing was been fixed.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"""Nothing is meant to be fair, and apparently by design"" - Mathieu Cote (Game director On Dead by Daylight)
I will try to explain why I write a negative review despite having a lot of hours and constantly playing this game to this day.
[b] The game lures people into gambling addiction!!! [/b]
If you're online enough, you could have seen people complaining over the fact that they don't really appreciate Dead by Daylight but they are unable to quit it. The fun fact is the game that is based a lot on RNG factors, aka luck, and tries to look ""competetive"" develops gambling addiction. 
You win, then you lose, after that you go for another match to show off your skills of defeating the unfair events and survive or killl every survivor. It's addiction is based on a constant feeling of irritation, the developers acknowledged it during one of their interviews. Gambling addiction funnily comes from losing, not winning. You will be annoyed by everything. By one of the most toxic communities, by poor balance decisions, countless bugs. Despite bringing the feeling of satisfaction sometimes, your mental state overall will be worse by the end of most play sessions. You won't play this game because you like it, you will play it because you're addicted to the constant feeling of surpassing the irritation. And the worst part is that you will feel rewarded because of the fact that you outsmarted players who are there to mock you and verbally abuse you by the end of a game. It's not healthy no matter how you look at it. Even if you have ""thick skin"", it's simply unenjoyable to waste your time on such people when you think about it.

Talking about the other reasons why I can't recommend this game: 
- It requires you to waste too much time grinding and paying. Licenced characters can only be purchased via real money and if you want to get original ones for free, you need to put 100 hours for each character. And there are so many of them, it may take 1000, if not more, hours to gain them all for free. 
- The developers work on their game when they WANT. The reason for that is the fact that this game does not have any competition. This brings flaws and small patches that do not really feel drastic and entertaining. Moreover, if the upcoming changes are disliked by the community, they will be rolled anyways since what can people do, find another Dead By Daylight? Money were put into creation of the things players didn't like, get it or leave. Oh, wait, you won't. 
- The game feels dull. We have no new content despite new killers and perks that kind of change gameplay. The issue here is that the perks don't do much, currently the game has a few strong perks that the community takes and the other perks are not being used at all unless a player wants to feel less powerful for some reason. And the killers often feel dull as well. Instead of constantly working on the previous perks and killers the developers prefer to make new perks and killers for the sake of pumping up money. They rarely change anything, it's lucky to have a patch with some big interesting changes at least once a year.
- The developers obviously lean towards the side that brings more money with the help of the cosmetics. It's not a secret that killer issues take much more time to be solved than the survivor ones. It brings unfairness into the game in certain cases.
- Moderation on the Steam and the official forums will literally ban you for showing any concern about the game's health. If you complain too much, well, stop spreading negativity. This creates a false sense of positivity when the community is furious at BHVR.
- The support isn't really helpful and deals with many issues quite poorly. The in-game report system only flags certain players, they won't get banned if you press a few buttons there. To have a person banned for sure you need to take extensive amount of steps and most of the times you need proof. So if you don't have your games recorded, you can't sumbit tickets to support effectively. 
- They have started doing limited time payed content, they even took out certain cosmetics that existed before that decision. Feels icky, you can see how they try to pump the money out of you. 
- You will have to close your comment section. I've never seen a community being this obsessed with leaving toxic comments on your profile. 

Please, do not support this mess. It looks fun on the outside but it's a mess.

I would like to mention one pretty significant thing about the game's developers that had happened at some point.
The community asked for colorblind setting for more than 4 years. This request had been dismissed until some point when the scandal occured because of it.
One of the developers called the whole thing boring. Clearly they aren't interested in wasting resources on something that won't bring them much income. The game has lost it's initial charm long time ago and has nothing passionate about it.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"I'm originally a day one Xbox player with 5500hrs, I had gotten tired of being ignored as a player and bored of being maxed out on the game and swapped to PC. Sadly I've come to find that PC players are just as ignored as console when it comes to BHVR. 
Dead by Daylight is an incredible product that is trapped underneath the thumb of idiots who don't know what to do with it. Every update just adds more bugs than features.
At one point, years ago, Cote had described the game as ""no longer theirs, it now belonged to the community"" which at the time I thought was beautiful. Years later, however, after new hires like Ethan, the game has belittled, ignored, and straight up asked veterans to leave.
DBD releases ptb's to put up a front that they listen to the community while then releasing multiple patches like The Twins, and Mid Chapter 4.5 that completely ignore the complaints of the community. 

After how many new things broke today, I finally had enough that I was going to submit individual bug tickets to them for every bug they've been neglecting, only to find out they've updated their website to hide bug tickets at the very bottom and shrunk the box to a 5th of the previous size, while having added tons of pictures and ads for the game, and top centering a small FAQ style technical support for things already fixed. 

BHVR is a company that actively disrespects their community, herds morons like sheep into defending their actively bad decisions by posting occasional memes, and milks the game and its players by working minimally and at their own whim while we beg and plead for them to just acknowledge they heard what we have to say. I'm ashamed I've spent so many years of my life believing in and supporting a game that left me behind years ago without me noticing.","Very Positive80% of the 512,225 user reviews for this game are positive.",originally xbox 5500hrs gotten tired ignored bored maxed swapped pc sadly pc player ignored console come bhvr dead daylight incredible product trapped underneath thumb idiot add bug feature year ago cote described no_longer belonged community thought beautiful year hire ethan belittled ignored straight asked veteran leave dbd release ptb front listen community releasing multiple patch twin mid chapter 4 5 completely ignore complaint community thing broke today finally submit individual bug ticket bug neglecting updated website hide bug ticket bottom shrunk box 5th previous size ton picture ad top centering small faq style technical support thing already fixed bhvr company actively disrespect community herd moron sheep defending actively bad decision posting occasional meme milk player working minimally whim beg plead acknowledge heard ashamed spent year life believing supporting left year ago noticing

381210,Dead by Daylight,"I absolutely love this game. The design of (most) killers, gameplay, chase interaction and being able to play with friends or by myself.

I have invested 4 years of game time into DBD. Currently sitting at just over 4K hours total. I've played through all eras of the game and all the ups/downs bugs/problems the game has had. Pre this latest patch the game was sitting at its best point in terms of playability. It absolutely had a myriad of problems but they weren't game breaking and my love for the game helped me to see past them.

However, this latest update is an absolute spit in the face to anyone who has invested any serious amount of time into the game at all. The developers changed multiple things that nobody asked for, received the feedback that nobody liked it and implemented the changes anyway. I have been playing online games for years and BEhaviour are by FAR the worst developers at both time management, choosing what to focus their resources on and ESPECIALLY player feedback. They do not listen.

Even besides the changes nobody asked for and how poorly they were implemented this newest update has also not only has more incredibly unfun breakable walls added and a shitty UI but a myriad of literal game breaking bugs. Walls with no collision, areas of the map (auto haven bus) where the killer CANNOT pass through but the survivor can- which was completely fine last patch AND on the PTB (test servers).

The developers stumbled upon a cash cow and just release skin after skin, DLC after DLC, battlepass after battlepass with no care for the people who helped build their game. They balance the game to the casuals and do not care about their core playerbase as they constantly have new players coming in dropping money on DLC's/cosmetics. I do not want to target anyone specifically but they mention in livestreams that they ""use the wiki"" to know what certain perks do- they do not even know their own game. The lead game designer who I won't name is an absolute moron, his views on the game are INCREDIBLY bad and having someone like that helm the ship is HORRIBLY unhealthy for a good player experience.

For 4 years time players have been asking for a colorblind mode in order to be able to play the game as some people were unable to see scratch marks due to their condition. For 4 years we were told ""its not on our priority list"". Only when the community REALLY made a big fuss about it did they release that they were ""happy to announce we are working on colorblind filters"". They do not care about the player, only their image.
When the last absymal twins update game out riddled with bugs they were very quick to change Moris- something players have been asking to be changed for years, an incredibly easy fix. The only reason it was changed then was to take the spotlight away from how disgusting and unprofessional their released DLC was. I cannot state enough how little they care about their playerbase.

I absolutely love Dead By Daylight. But in its current state and with the way the developers handle their game I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Do not buy this product. This is now the second major update in a row that has come RIDDLED with bugs/problems.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Absolutely love the game, but ofcourse there are flaws. Not gonna say its the community or ""OP"" killers, but a major glitch in the system.
The whole reason i decided to write this review is to warn new players of a game ruining glitch, and how to fix it.
Today my data, 58 hours of gameplay, was completely reset. While playing, i got a connection error, then a message saying ""The season has ended"". When i went to check out my characters, THEY WERE ALL LEVEL ONE.
now, to save yourself from this utterly horrible and game ruining experience (which i know will lead to you leaving a pretty bad review of the game), here's a fix!

STEP 1: Go to the location of your steam data, then your Dead by Daylight save. (Which in my case is OS (C:)\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\129389900\381210\remote\ProfileSaves)
STEP 2: Copy the file located within ProfileSaves to a safe location. (I leave it directly on my desktop)
OPTIONAL STEP 3: Make a Shortcut to your ProfileSaves folder and place on desktop for easy access.
STEP 4: Update your save (copy save and replace) everytime you close the game. If you dont do this, you could lose hours of progress like i did today. (I lost about 4 hours of progress)

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Dead by Daylight is a very fun [spoiler]and sometimes toxic as hell[/spoiler] 1 Killer vs 4 Survivor survival horror game with unique and interesting mechanics.
Each Killer has their own unique power and playstyle to it and each Survivors and Killer will have teachable perks that can be unlocked in their own individual progression bloodweb to ""teach"" the perks to other characters you own to let the players to be able to create their own build and perk combos.

[h1]-Game Objective-[/h1]
[b]Survivors:-[/b]
The goal of the game for the Survivors is to repair generators around the map to open the exit gates and escape the trial.
Survivors can bring items that are beneficial to their survival like flashlight to blind the killer momentarily,med-kit to heal yourself/other survivors,and using the environment to escape from the killer's chase by dropping pallets to stun the killer,and looping the killer to waste time so that other survivors can help complete other objectives in the meantime.

[b]Killer:-[/b]
The Killer will need to use their own power and scratch marks/blood trails left by survivors to track and down the survivors and hooking them to sacrifice them to the entity and ultimately preventing the Survivors from escaping the trials.
A hooked survivor will not be able to escape unless saved by a teammate or successfully unhooking themselves from the hook with a 4% chance or by using other perks.

Pre-conclusion mini-rant:-
[spoiler]Sometimes some players are going to be pretty toxic when playing dbd,there are some players who uses map exploits,teaming up with the killer,sandbagging, BM'ing or insulting others in the post game chat,and as a newbie killer,when matched against good survivors will be very frustrating as u will feel helpless against some god loops and tiles that u simply cant counter while you slowly see ur gens being rushed by other survivors and just feel like you cant do anything....but,theres no other way other than to git gud,develop better mentality and gamesense to counter the gap between.[/spoiler]
no matter how much ranting I did,I still love and enjoy playing dbd<3

[h1]Conclusion:-[/h1]
Dead by Daylight is a very good game to play with friends or by urself,and if u enjoy this type of survival horror game or being indecisive on whether or not you should get it,I'd say give it a try and make that decisive strike!

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"I've always asked myself, how can people play a game for 1000+ hours and then give it a thumbs down? 

Then I played PUBG.

The European servers are in tatters, ruined by cheaters. I log in to 4 or 5 new perm-ban reports each session, but nothing changes. Cheats are readily available and are pre-installed in internet cafes in many parts of the world. Hit the death cam to spectate a HUYATV or DOUYUTV account and watch them 6x spray you with an AK from 100 yards, every shot hitting you in the head.

And it's not, GET GUD or REKT M8 - it's just sad. It takes all of the fun out of the game. I've played for over 1000 hours, I've paid for season passes and I've been promised changes and improvements - it just isn't happening. The devs don't care about about their player base and they don't listen to feedback.

PUBG still offers something other BR games don't and this is the game I want to play. When this game is good, it's probably one of my favourite games ever - certainly the game I've played the most.

I can put up with bugs, I can put up with poor geometry and I can put up with not being the best player at this game. But I can't put up with cheats.

Don't REGION LOCK CHINA, build a better cheat engine. I will happily play against anyone from anywhere in the world, but I don't want to play against cheaters.

This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd. 

I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.

My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned.

Very clunky, glitches, bugs, FPS drops, desync, you name it!
Still, I can live with all of the above...

One thing I cannot stand though is the massive cheating/hacking which ruins the experience for everyone. 
You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"".  What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"Update: 01/26/2022 

This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.

Updated: 06/03/20

The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.

Original Review Written 03/20/2019

I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through. 
 
I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.","Mixed58% of the 2,306,037 user reviews for this game are positive.",01 26 2022 released honest issue gotten ten time worse hacker problem bad s_emphasizedtill no_actual suckered buying worst team industry updated 06 03 20 solid stride combatting hacker possible foul bug fixed graphic improved animation quality life customization option improved progression present pubg provides gritty brutal earthy experience battle royal present deliver promised love_emphasized recommend honestly predatory monetization talking battle pas practically begs spend slide apex warzone game paid battle pas unacceptable pay front love access cosmetic item paying twice god forsaken mind season pas crap loot box vote wallet no_to crap original written 03 20_emphasized19 hope next pretty big promise not_hold breath follow waited long fix pubg provides gritty realistic pulse pounding shooter battle royale game market able replicate feel pubg despite excellent moment moment garbage come hacker inexcusable bug practically non existent update tired watching someone aiming kill cam single shot fire abusing region ping flat hacking tired watching mobile event temporary mode hundred style choice pc version paid get tired worst battle royale loot customization entire market god awful soldier crate crate currency real world key kidding hour hour grinding semi decent outfit half coughed real marketplace finally bug fixing past month hacker rarer six month ago look game apex fortnite help frustrated game bug hacker functioning paid crappy mobile rip offs game customization loot progression paid willing alpha beta tag understood meant process trial error thing fixed reworked sheer lack meaningful progress left frustrated cannot_in good conscience recommend anybody

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"After nearly 3000 hours of playing time, im sorry to report, that this game development is going into the completly wrong direction.
- Developers are not listening to loyal players
- Features like map selection have been removed 
- Too many strange maps - who needs Karakin or Paramo? If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD
- Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split
- All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players
- The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets -  for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again

Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.

Yes it plays quite well and visually looks better than ever - but it's really lost that PUBG magic and feel. Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions. Everything just feels cluttered and complicated as soon as you log on with a very messy UI.

When you get into a lobby you're now greeted by people running around as multi coloured anime looking characters/skins, and I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point... It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!

It really feels like the Devs completely lost the roadmap and made the rest up as they went along, stealing other games recipes and jumbling it up into one mess.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"I have over 6 thousand  hours in this game, so I'd have some ground to stand on when it comes to posting an honest review of this game:

It's a fun game, when you are playing with the right people and don't really care too much about actual game-play. But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out. 

Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game. 

Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning. But, there are so many issues that need to be resolved that Krafton are just not addressing which is why I can't whole heatedly recommend this game.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"Patch 7.2 released 5/20/20 has effectively KILLED this game.  A short sighted money grab by the devs has conspired to inject loads of BOTS into virtually all BR game types (ranked squads being the exception).  With this move, the very core of what made PUBG's gameplay special has now been eviscerated.  Getting a kill or a win used to be difficult and in turn rewarding.  Now you can hop into a vehicle and proceed to run down enemy AI with impunity.  They've also made terrible changes to the circle,  all but eliminating any intermission between circles, making it a running match from start to end.  I've always felt that the dev team had a certain amount of contempt for it's player base, but this move confirms my suspicions .  As of today, the NA player base has dwindled down to 230K avg concurrent users.  Expect that number to drop by at least  50% within the coming months..

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"I've encountered this game just like 99,9% of it's player-base did, by watching Twitch streams and youtube videos.
Being something relatively new in the multiplayer scene (THAT ACTUALLY HAD A MASSIVE PLAYER-BASE), I managed to talk few of my friends into playing it.

I'm not going to lie, we've spent hundreds of hours on it.

That was until the official release of 1.0
Keep in mind that we're talking about previously most played game in the world at some point, a game which brought it's developers millions (if not 10 digit numbers), and as any sane person, you'd expect that it will be poured into further development and fixes, right?

LOL wrong. We're talking about Bluehole here.

You really have to be next level special in order to stumble upon a gold mine, and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in. They had everything, massive FREE ADVERTISEMENT (NOTE: FREE > NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR) in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creators, insane ACTIVE player-base, a product that's close to being 1.0 ready... Everything.
They got money, they got everything. And what do they do?:
 
In game purchases.

It's disgusting seeing that someone who had all the foundation required to make a masterpiece ignore all that and just attempts to drain more money from players.
They rushed the 1.0 to be able to implement in-game purchases, and instead of actually WORKING on it, what do they do? More platforms.
Not only that none of the platforms performed remotely well, they completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more in-game purchases.

Since I could go about this all day long, and considering I'm actually rating a game here and not it's thirsty developer, I'll focus on it now:

Pros:
- Fast queue times due to high player-base,
- SOLID graphics.
- Good ballistics (Sniper and AR bullet drop)


Cons:
- Fully released game some of the problems that should have been fixed before the release.

EDIT:
- PLENTY OF CHEATERS. Even though the developers started to take action against hackers now that the game has headed to ruin, there are still PLENTY of non-conventional cheaters such as VPN abusers (lifting ping on purpose to abuse the poor netcode and hit detection) and Macro users (Auto-aim/Recoil control). Even though the numbers have dropped, this is still heavily affecting the game and user experience.

- Countless game breaking bugs (getting killed by nothing when vaulting, getting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killed, reloading sometimes doesn't reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed...)

- HORRIBLE performance issues (High end PC users can be happy if they hit constant 60fps on medium-high settings at all times)

- Hilarous netcode. So many instances when you get killed by someone who didn't even have a line of sight, constant stuttering, 60%+ fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnect.

- Horrible bullet detection system (this one mostly affects Shotguns)

- Retarded level design. This one is a great issue mostly focused on the Miramar map. They forced a new map which is massive in terms of size, but ironically has least content, least quality looting area, a MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map (mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 20 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone). Even though the original map is better, they still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zone.

- EDIT: Since one of the recent patches, my character no longer stutters while running, proving my point this was indeed caused by the game, and not by my PC or internet connection.

- I will stop with Cons for now since there's only so much time I can waste on this review. But yes, there are way more.


################

Bottom line, if you haven't already bought this game: DO NOT. Save your money. There are better alternatives if you're just taking up a new game, and they're even free to play. They don't have some of the mechanics PUBG has, and that's a shame, but at least they're optimized. Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the game, let alone play it properly.

This is not a dead game yet, there's still time to fix it.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.

Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant. 

4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this bullshit is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market. 

Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed. 

Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game. 

TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of shit.","Mixed58% of the 2,306,037 user reviews for this game are positive.",filed dictionary definition missed potential let wind look began pubg released 2017 dominates market battle royal literally get bright gaming light 144hz monitor gun tight issue performance cheating significant 4 year suffering issue along trouble invented not_listening community cheater not_refining core adding feature noone want asks expensive scam defining skin defining characteristic shame bullshit best gun shooter market honestly issue forgive someone 2k hour great potential real defining problem significant problem blue ball aka brain dead developer never_listened community community recognised red zone removed simply trimming bad map adding mechanic ensure safer rotation focus med ammo wasted spawn fix suggested pilars community simply quick patch double map 500 skin patch break tl dr save 30 buck ring old pot smoking friend highschool life mum basement moment hear voice crack recognise changed 10 year 4 year pile shit

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]
PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a battle-royale, 100-players, open-world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo, duo, and squad (3-4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward, you hop off a plane, loot weapons, armors, and equipments from buildings, and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath.

PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle-royale game out there, yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known, PUBG has had a highly successful launch, securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle-royale PvP, look no further. You've struck the gold.

My claim is not without reason. The following is PUBG's pros and cons in my opinion:

[h1]Pros[/h1]
1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle-royale PvP games are mostly in Early-Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gathering as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game - PUBG is exactly the opposite.

2. Great gameplay concept. No pay-to-win and no grind-to-win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.

3. Non-toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team-only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.

4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no-scoping bozos. You have to plan out your movement very carefully and quickly since time is of the essence. Difficult decisions comes up often, especially in squad play (e.g. risk your life to revive your mate or run like hell to safety; Kill someone and give out your position to nearby players or stay quiet; Deciding your next 'safe spot', etc.) An enjoyable learning curve definitely exists - not too steep and not too lean. 

5. A shooting game that applies semi-realistic weapon recoil, bullet travel time, and bullet drop is always appreciated.

6. Various vehicles, weapons, weapon mods, clothings, and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. The weapon stats variety amps up the gameplay - It can be quite a challenge to engage in a firefight when you got the wrong weapon for the situation.

7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV, the game supports both FPS and TPS.

8. Minor performance improvements can get quite noticeable after several updates. Devs truly are working on the optimization issue. We can look forward towards better performance in the future.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
1. Currently, very performance-demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very unstable fps even on high-end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum - virtual RAMs can't help your 4-gigs-RAM PC. In terms of GPU, one of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from <30fps and extremely slow loading progress. Another friend with a GTX1060 suffers from fps drops during rain/smoke.

As a response to comments' feedback for my 1st cons list: The game is still playable on all those mentioned GPUs. I just want you to know that the game is not optimized well. FPS drops, crashes, and screen freeze will sometimes happen even on high-end rigs. It happens randomly - I don't measure the frequency.

[i]UPDATE: Although the game is still quite laggy, minor performance improvements are already noticeable after the latest updates. I no longer suffer from fps spikes with my GTX1080. Most performance issues are related to server lag instead of PC after June 27 update.[/i]

2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example, you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover, but 2 seconds later, blood spurts out of your chest, you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you, but then...okay you get my point

3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO's Competitive and Dota 2, you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in-game.

4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.

5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three, four RMBs to activate the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game - devs better fix this quickly.

As a response to the comments' feedback: I have to add that my statement about the terrible control is a rare occasion. Generally, 1, or 2 key inputs would be recognized. I would say having to press twice is much more common than 3/4 times like I said. But it does often take some miliseconds for the inputs to be recognized. My point is still valid: The controls are NOT reactive - horrible for a PvP game.

6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to drive

7. Door and movement bugs seem to be quite prevalent lately. Whenever I move a step ahead, the game throws me back 3, 4 steps backwards. Seems to be affecting the entire server whenever it happens. Invisible doors also prevent players from entering a building, throwing us outdoors whenever we try to enter a building. Similar to fps spikes, these happen randomly.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Don't lose all hopes because of my cons list - remember that this is an early access game. I know some of the cons can be too much to handle and disturbs the gameplay, but devs are very active in updating the game. I dare to conclude that PUBG is currently the best battle-royale MMOFPS/TPS PvP game out there. The current state of the game is more than playable. Definitely worth purchasing even when it's not on sale.

Well that's all I have to say about PUBG. Hope it can be of help to potential buyers!

UPDATE: Never expected my review would go up top on Most Helpful for this game. So I've decided to [b]not[/b] take down this review after having more playtime hours. I'll update it if there're any significant changes.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"Boy oh boy, here we go.
I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.

PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.

The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.

PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.

I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.

PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem.
But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. 
The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.

Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.

Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.

And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content. 

In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.

Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.","Mixed58% of the 2,306,037 user reviews for this game are positive.",boy oh boy qualified write comparatively low hour early 2017 popular pubg extremely polarizing hate t_emphasizedhere reason this_emphasized mainly focused giving snapshot obviously ultimate verdict not_this worth 30 usd concept great battle royales battle royales simple pubg focus realistic skill based weapon handling obviously not_a simulator sense realism weapon physic bullet drop bullet velocity shotgun spread reasonable difficult learn alone master unless game similar dayz arma 3 not_going variety weapon map tactic purpose address primary issue includes reading review issue hacker lag desync poor optimization bad support break pubg major hacker problem following pubg corp company owns fighting hacker release hundred thousand maybe million banned lifetime killed someone aimbot half remember looked kill feed suddenly saw 15 left 2 minute shotgun watching deathcam saw naked man holding shotgun spinning rapidly direction shooting wildly halfway across map killing hacking problem but_emphasized not_as big problem read review oh die hacker literally 90 stuff slander hard believing review last three month 900 game track stats closely killed obvious hacker twice_emphasized reported time time message day telling reported banned inherent problem understand difference good hacking easy cry aimbot someone killed auto burst assault rifle 100 meter maybe god tier 3000 hour belt hacking no_longer huge gamebreaking issue not_be stop buying next lag desync history problem lost game desynced fault developer crappy internet connection last three month experienced major desync maybe maybe lag anymore internet connection bigger chance ruining lag desync t_emphasizedhink broken poor optimization big terribly optimized especially shooter gtx 1080 70 shooter moderate setting able fix others problem others justification popular long poorly optimized tough deal finally poor development support different opinion developer next pubg corp care player usually focus releasing obscenely expensive skin conclusion pubg flawed divisive recommend issue mentioned usually overblown hate know hooked 3 hour t_emphasizedhink be_emphasizedcause big issue be_emphasizedcause t_emphasizedhe thank reading hope help

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.

So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"Backstory :  I started with MS Flightsim on an amber screened IBM clone in 1987. It took several 'disks' to load, and I would go make coffee and  drink most of it before it would be loaded and ready to play. Looking back, it was simply atrocious. It had no graphics to speak of, ran at less than 5 fps, and used a keyboard as input. In short, it was the equivalent of flying a very stubborn turkey. 

But I was hooked. ""One day, I mused - this will be real. One day places will look like it does in the real world. One day planes will feel like planes, not just an illusion of something clearly being tortured on a screen. 

Finally,  37 years later, 'one day' is here. 

I can nitpick little flaws in this game, like the fact that the frame rate is inconsistent, and it slows down substantially around massive built up areas, or that the drone camera system is somewhat cumbersome and flight planning could be a lot more user friendly when adding or re-ordering waypoints. But these are minor. And  though I am sure they will be ironed out, I could also live with the game as is, because all the rest is just so far ahead of anything else I've ever seen. It not just great, its phenomenal. 


I've been a hopeless pilot, trying my best for years and years, and I'm still rubbish at it. However, this simulator is a quantum leap from the ones before. I can actually land every time without crashing when realism is maxed out.  The actual simulation of flight systems and avionics has been vastly improved, making it so much easier to hand fly aircraft  than in previous iterations.  It actually feels like you are flying a plane, not a simulation.  It actually feels like you are in your hometown when flying over it. (And no - that house you are flying into looks nothing like your actual house. In fact it could be mine.  )

Sometimes a product comes along that changes everything about its genre. This will change flight simulation forever. This is groundbreaking.

So seeing this being delivered before I get to go to that big refrigerator in the sky,  makes me so unbelievably happy. It gives me untold pleasure to admit: ""Its finally here and its better than I ever imagined possible""

I'm not going to complain about a single thing, when, for $60, I can go fly anywhere in a faithfully recreated virtual copy the world. Fly over a place and exclaim: ""This actually does look like it does in real life.""

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"I'll post a full review later but just wanted to warn anyone out there that after buying the game you download a ~600MB launcher. The game itself is a ~90GB download from that launcher. The problem is, the launcher being open appears to being counted as play time, so just a heads up if you were thinking to return it if you don't like it. But, based on everything I've seen, it's clear that this is going to be a phenomenal sim, but just wanted to let people know.

Also, for those of you, like me, who are installing this to a secondary drive, note that your main drive (C:\) will need to have at least 8.4GB free as it uses a ""Rolling Cache"" that's located in %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator

Edit: Earlier I said that it “appears” that the launcher being open counts as play time. I can now confirm that it DEFINITELY counts as play time. Left machine running overnight to download and install and came back to learn that Steam thinks that I’ve been a pilot for 7 hours. Just 243 more and I’ll get my CPL!

For those of you who want to leave and let it install, at least in my case, I came back and it looked as though the launcher had frozen at 15% (that’s where I left it when I locked my PC). I exited the launcher and reopened Microsoft Flight Simulator via Steam to learn it had fully installed. Important thing to note, I didn’t put my PC to sleep overnight, I just locked it and made sure it wouldn’t automatically put itself to sleep by changing the sleep setting in Windows Settings.","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",post wanted warn buying download 600mb launcher 90gb download launcher problem launcher open appears counted head return based clear phenomenal sim wanted installing secondary drive note drive c 8 4gb us rolling cache located appdata roaming microsoft flight simulator earlier appears launcher open count confirm definitely count left machine running overnight download install learn think pilot 7 hour 243 cpl leave install case looked launcher frozen 15 left locked pc exited launcher reopened microsoft flight simulator via learn fully installed important note pc sleep overnight locked automatically sleep changing sleep window setting
1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"I'm a sport pilot so fly in real life, here's what I can tell everyone else about VR and MSFS2020.  Using a reverb G2 and flight yoke and throttle.

1) It easy to complain.... this building does not belong here, or it has to many levels, or my airport is not depicted just right - but when you step back and look at the big picture this is a gigantic leap forward for flight simmers.

2) I fly VFR in real life and mostly public airports, I can tell you that the at times tonight for moments I literally lost reality and felt like I was flying in real life, the sim can be that realistic, of course the wind, noise, and vibrations-turbulence are missing from the feedback, but in VR it immerses the senses even more making those points above even less noticeable while flying.

3) I am amazed how good VR is, how good the sim is compared to real life and again while it would be easy to complain about various things - wow a jump forward for flight simmers! There are times while in the traffic pattern I'll turn downwind, base, or on final and look down and out the window and I get that same feeling as real flying, I literally forget I'm in the sim because the terrain and building match up close enough to trick the mind. Performance wise it may be running better in VR than on my triple screens, still to be determined.


Some things I would like to see improved:

- Load the obstacles databases so that we have radio and water towers where they should be at the proper heights.

- Maybe this already exists but need the ability to turn off road car decals - those have never appealed to me

- Runway lights in the middle of many airport taxiways

- Multiple ATC voice change options

- Better data for the smaller airports, many have hangers, FBO's, or other vital landmarks missing. Example at airport 02a the FBO, one set up of public hangers, and Tuskegee Airman hanger is missing, not sure how because that is certainly big enough to show up on maps. The closer to real life they can make this that much more immersive it's going to be for those who have flown over areas.

- Would like the weight shift trike added to the planes

All in all very pleased, specific to VR very impressed! The fact it can make me forget I'm at a computer at times and not in the actual plane is something no flight sim as done before. I highly recommend this and can tell you from a visual perspective it's highly realistic and in VR that much more immersive.  

Highly recommended but don't buy from Microsoft if you want to use Reshade because they lock you out of the executable, had to cancel gamepass and buy the game on steam in order to play it the way I wanted.","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",sport pilot fly real life tell else vr msfs2020 reverb g2 flight yoke throttle 1 easy complain building not_belong level airport not_depicted look big picture gigantic leap forward flight simmer 2 fly vfr real life mostly public airport tell time tonight moment literally lost reality flying real life sim realistic course wind noise vibration turbulence missing feedback vr immerses sens point noticeable flying 3 am_emphasizedazed good vr good sim compared real life easy complain various thing wow forward flight simmer time traffic pattern turn downwind base final look window feeling real flying literally forget sim terrain building close trick mind performance wise running vr triple screen determined thing improved load obstacle database radio water tower proper height maybe already exists turn road car decal never_appealed runway light middle airport taxiway multiple atc voice option data smaller airport hanger fbo vital landmark missing example airport 02a fbo set public hanger tuskegee airman hanger missing not_sure certainly big map closer real life immersive flown area weight shift trike plane pleased specific vr impressed forget computer time not_in actual plane no_flight sim highly recommend tell visual perspective highly realistic vr immersive highly recommended microsoft reshade lock executable cancel gamepass order wanted

Updated Full Review as of 2020-08-20

After testing the simulator for a fair bit of time, I wanted to give my inputs on how I feel about the simulator. 

Microsoft Flight Simulator graphically speaking, is simply the best we've had in a flight simulator. For the longest time, clouds rendered in simulators like P3D or X-Plane 11 were 2D and flat (albeit now P3D has TrueSky which significantly improves their clouds) but with FS2020, we are finally able to get an overhaul to one of the most significant problems in flight simulation. 

The weather system is great but has a flaw that I've seen. The METAR will sometimes be outdated by 1 hour and show weather that is not representative of what the weather actually is at a certain airport. It can sometimes be significantly behind or sometimes be accurate to the weather currently at an airport but hopefully with time, these issues will be sorted out with their weather provider meteoblue. The gusts however are great with the frequency being shown and able to be adjusted. Gives the wind a more ""alive"" feel.

The aerodynamics have been improved from the days of FSX and P3D. In those sims, it felt as if you were on rails. The aerodynamics are not comparable to X-Plane 11 which I feel has the better flight model (though it does feel too exaggerated). Flying in the third person camera however feels kind of arcade-like which is dislike but I enjoy flying more in the cockpit than I do flying in the third person camera. I feel the aerodynamics will need some work done on them as planes tend to be tail heavy in my experience with them pitching up too much upon touchdown.

The biggest selling point to the game in my opinion is the use of satellite imagery and AI to create autogen. The ground scenery is some of the best ever seen in a flight simulator to date. It uses Bing Maps which is not as good as Google Maps in my opinion but it does the job well enough to make for a realistic experience.

Some of the aircraft have problems with autopilots not functioning correctly, missing features in the GPS systems such as in the G1000 where it can make it difficult or near impossible to fly with them on networks like PilotEdge or VATSIM, and just general performance issues. They look really nice but don't have the greatest functionality but they are just default aircraft so it is to be expected that not everything works in them. They should however, try to make really good avionics. Kind of like how X-Plane 11 has a fully functional G1000, GNS430 and GNS530 avionics systems as they work really well and are included by default. Most payware planes will end up using the default avionics and having strong base avionics is a must in a simulator in my opinion.

The biggest problem I have with the simulator is how buggy and unoptimized the simulator is. I feel that the simulator needed more time to be ironed out with the bugs (such as not being able to click anything in the cockpit upon loading it up) and the performance issues (only 50% gpu usage in the A320 cockpit, glass cockpits suffer hard on performance). The game really needs you to have a beefy computer to run it optimally. The best place to test your performance is in a major city like JFK.

Overall, I'm enjoying the simulator and love to just fly around with my friends and do FSEconomy flights here and there. It is an enjoyable experience so far and with the team wanting to support the game for a long time, I have hope that many of these issues will be fixed.","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",recommend xbox pas 1 otherwise 6 download xbox pas downloaded file launcher version sim fantastic worth wait hand simulator updated 2020 08 20 testing simulator fair bit wanted input simulator microsoft flight simulator graphically speaking simply best flight simulator longest cloud rendered simulator p3d x plane 11 2d flat albeit p3d truesky significantly improves cloud fs2020 finally able overhaul significant problem flight simulation weather great flaw metar outdated 1 weather not_representative weather certain airport significantly accurate weather currently airport hopefully issue sorted weather provider meteoblue gust great frequency shown able adjusted give wind alive aerodynamics improved day fsx p3d sims rail aerodynamics not_comparable x plane 11 flight model exaggerated flying third camera feel kind arcade dislike enjoy flying cockpit flying third camera aerodynamics plane tend tail heavy pitching touchdown biggest selling opinion satellite imagery ai create autogen ground scenery best flight simulator us bing map not_as good google map opinion realistic aircraft problem autopilot not_functioning correctly missing feature gps system g1000 difficult near impossible fly network pilotedge vatsim general performance issue look nice greatest functionality default aircraft expected not_everything work good avionics kind x plane 11 fully functional g1000 gns430 gns530 avionics system included default payware plane default avionics strong base avionics simulator opinion biggest problem simulator buggy unoptimized simulator simulator needed ironed bug not_being able click cockpit loading performance issue 50 gpu usage a320 cockpit glass cockpit suffer hard performance need beefy computer optimally best test performance major city jfk enjoying simulator love fly friend fseconomy flight enjoyable far wanting support long hope issue fixed
1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"I am a real-life private pilot. This game is not only beautiful, but accurately represents a large portion of my time in the air. The detail within this sim truly allows for realistic VFR flights to be performed like never before.

There have been many moments where I almost thought I was actually flying the real thing, especially when coming in on final at an uncontrolled airfield.

I would highly recommend this title for both avid simmers and newcomers to the flight sim world. The tutorials are basic, but more than enough to get you started on your journey through FS2020.","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",real life private pilot not_only beautiful accurately represents large portion air detail sim truly allows realistic vfr flight performed never_before moment thought flying real especially coming final uncontrolled airfield highly recommend title avid simmer newcomer flight sim world tutorial basic started journey fs2020
1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"If  you're someone who has an interest in aviation, this game is totally worth it. I have been playing non-stop, however here are some tips:
- Make sure to buy a sidestick or yoke controller with it, doesn't have to be expensive just anything as a beginner as it is extremely difficult using a keyboard and it's not immersive. There's no need for one of those fancy throttles and stuff at the beginning, the cheapest sidestick works.
- Make sure to have a lot of storage, it takes a long time to get it started
- Just buy the standard version, the rest is quite useless as it's just extra planes that you can get for free as mods
And just a little bonus tip to make it more fun:
Get Volanta and track all your flights, it keeps me going being able to see all of my flights around the globe. Try to get custom liveries of real airlines and pretend to fly them and their routes, it's amazing and gives you a goal!","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",someone interest aviation totally worth non tip sidestick yoke controller expensive beginner extremely difficult keyboard not_immersive no_need fancy throttle stuff beginning cheapest sidestick work storage take long started standard version rest useless extra plane mod bonus tip fun volanta track flight keep able flight globe custom livery real airline pretend fly route amazing give goal
1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"I figure at the 1200hr mark, I feel It's only reasonable to leave my remarks and squawk my experience so far.

As a game, MSFS is a work in progress. It's much, Much better than it was at launch, and with each Sim Update you have a bit of frustration depending if they focus on PC, or on Xbox as for reasons, when they attempt to focus on patches for one, it breaks the other, but coming past SU9, I feel they are continuing to be on the right track and little by little, the game continues to get better and better.

You have read it all before, the Graphics are between good and downright fantastic. This is at the moment, the only game on my system that is the main push for me to build a new PC just to play it. Sim Update Performance improvements have helped quite a bit, but the draw of VR/4K gaming even with a 3090, demands a better CPU and my pretty much ancient X79 based system just isn't enough for this game alone. Even the most recent chip from AMD, the 5800X3D showed that the game Loves CPU Cache, and will use as much as you can get it. Zen 4 is on my radar to be the next big step for getting that bottleneck off the CPU.

Sound is another thing that MSFS does really well at times. Most of the stock planes sound great, and most of the time, a quality 3rd party plane does put some fantastic effort into their audio as well. (PMDG's DC-6 and the Wing42 Boeing 247D are two of my absolute favorites for Radial Relaxation.) When the planes sound good, it really helps nail the experience more than just pretty graphics alone.

VR finally came to the game, and with one of the best implementation using the OpenXR system. Being able to hot swap between 2D and VR on the fly is something many other games should adopt. And if your system is powerful enough for it (Hah, like one truly exist yet with current CPU tech) the game looks amazing maxed out while in VR. The first time I loaded up in the Just Flight Arrow in VR, I could swear I could smell the plane as it was exactly as I would be in a real one many times before. There is still plenty of work to be done for VR. The VR Controls continue to need work and adjustment as well as 3rd party support, but when they can finally get to the point that you can just click, rotate, pull, etc all the cockpit buttons, dials, and levers in VR, it will be an absolutely amazing experience. For now, it is still extremely good, and will continue to get better as technology and the systems improve.

Flight Model is something that some people may love, some may hate, some may like for some plane and not others, some may say X-Plane/P3D/etc does better. For a Sim and a Game, MSFS has nailed a pretty solid representation of how it feels to fly most planes. They are continuing to improve it immensely with added physics and aerodynamic model improvements and again, the game continues to grow and improve over time where the physics will inevitably follow. On the smaller planes, things are quite close to real life comparing to my real world experience, larger birds seem to be pretty close as well depending on the ones you are flying and how much you trust the Weather systems effects on the plane as well. Is it Perfect, no, but I do feel that over time it can be made as simple, or as true to life as one may want and has the CPU performance to emulate down the road.

Weather is another thing that while its had it's fair share of bugs and goofy issues, when it does work correct, it really does add to the immersion factor of the game and gives you the true sense of flying in something other than a clear calm blue sky. Hopefully it can be expanded to truly emulate hurricanes and other more extreme weather, but for now, being able to fly a little Cessna into a Hurricane during the season is kind of fun for something you would never want to do in the real world.

Gameplay is something that at the present system, is possibly lacking to those that are either a little unfamiliar with Flight Sims of this type, but also a lack of implementation ingame that at least for the time being, is being somewhat provided by third party services to add a form of ""Campaign"" or ""Career"" mode. My personal favorite is Flight Sim Economy (FSEconomy), and The Skypark from Orbx. The Skypark gives you some fun and adventurous routes to fly in all sorts of interesting parts of the world, and has a extremely slick app and interface design that works really well. FSE is a much more dated interface and system, but has a lot more depth for things like the world economy, the ability to own and rent/lease planes, maintain and service them, and even run your own FBO network. It too will take you to many different parts of the world but you do have to make your own goals for what you want in the long run, like any open world career sim would. It would be nice if MSFS eventually adds its own sort of Career/Campaign mode that interacts directly and deeply within its own systems, and eventually I believe it will happen, but for now, outside of the lack of marketing/exposure for many of these alternate 3rd party solutions, the ones that are out there do scratch the itch pretty well at least for now.

The Download System many have complained about, and it sounds like Steam actually dodged the bullet compared to the Windows Store version that has even harder times getting patches to apply on Sim Update day sometimes, but I personally, spread between multiple completely separate PC's in my house, have had no issues whatsoever downloading/reinstalling the game or updating when patches are released. Good internet is a must but you will never max out your bandwidth as even with Gigabit, the game does seem to top out at around 200-300Mbit and then since it does handle one file at a time, is at the limit of downloading that file, extracting and processing it, and going onto the next which is a very slow and linear process, and being the game is near 200G at this point, does take time no matter how fast your PC/Internet/etc is. When it all works though, it does eventually finish and works fine at least for me. One big thing that I think even a few Xbox users are missing is when you do download an update or even after first install, you do have to go to the Package Manager under your profile tab, and ""Select All"" and download all those updates as well, especially after every patch, to update all the other packages not part of the main core game. If you don't do that, you will be missing a lot of content and fixes that could cause the game to crash if it's not updated after a Sim Update. The whole separate system like this is very silly I completely agree, but once you grasp it, it works, just very clunky and slowly, but it does, work...

Controller support for the game is very good, one thing I do hope to return in due time would be Force Feedback support as when you have that working, flying a plane really does feel real as you feel the resistance of the air against the control surfaces. And the game supports many of the current, past, and probably future sticks, yokes, gamepads, etc and has customization options galore. One of my favorite devices to use however for quick flights without having to swap in/out the whole Joystick/Throttle/Peddle setup, is using the Steam Controller. The Gyro on the Steam Controller works fantastic as a virtual yoke and allows for near pinpoint precision control over everything except the Yaw access. The triggers though that control yaw, do have finer control than say the same triggers on an Xbox One controller so even that is an improvement over just a conventional gamepad. This does give me great excitement for playing MSFS on the Steam Deck as you will pretty much have the sim, in a portable system combined with a Steam Controller. Fantastic and I cannot wait for mine for quick couch FSE hops.

TLDR. If you like Aviation and Flight, MSFS is a love letter to the skies.","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",figure 1200hr mark reasonable leave remark squawk far msfs progress much_emphasized launch sim bit frustration depending focus pc xbox reason attempt focus patch break coming past su9 continuing track continues read graphic good downright fantastic moment push build pc sim performance improvement helped bit draw vr 4k gaming 3090 demand cpu pretty ancient x79 based alone recent chip amd 5800x3d showed love cpu cache zen 4 radar next big bottleneck cpu sound msfs time stock plane sound great quality 3rd party plane fantastic effort audio pmdg dc 6 wing42 boeing 247d absolute favorite radial relaxation plane sound good help nail pretty graphic alone vr finally best implementation openxr able hot swap 2d vr fly game adopt powerful hah truly exist cpu tech look amazing maxed vr loaded flight arrow vr swear smell plane exactly real time plenty vr vr control continue adjustment 3rd party support finally click rotate pull cockpit button dial lever vr amazing extremely good continue technology system improve flight model love hate plane not_others x plane p3d sim msfs nailed pretty solid representation feel fly plane continuing improve immensely physic aerodynamic model improvement continues grow improve physic inevitably follow smaller plane thing close real life comparing real world larger bird pretty close depending one flying trust weather system effect plane perfect no_but simple true life cpu performance emulate road weather fair share bug goofy issue correct add immersion factor give true sense flying clear calm blue sky hopefully expanded truly emulate hurricane extreme weather able fly cessna hurricane season kind fun never_want real world present possibly lacking unfamiliar flight sims type lack implementation ingame somewhat provided third party service add form campaign career mode personal favorite flight sim economy fseconomy skypark orbx skypark give fun adventurous route fly sort interesting part world extremely slick app interface design work fse dated interface depth thing world economy rent lease plane maintain service fbo network different part world goal long open world career sim nice msfs eventually add sort career campaign mode interacts directly deeply system eventually believe happen outside lack marketing exposure alternate 3rd party solution one scratch itch pretty download complained sound dodged bullet compared window store version harder time patch apply sim personally spread multiple completely separate pc house no_issues whatsoever downloading reinstalling updating patch released good internet never_max bandwidth gigabit to_emphasizedp 200 300mbit handle file limit downloading file extracting processing onto next slow linear process near 200g no_matter fast pc internet work eventually finish work fine big xbox user missing do_emphasizedwnload install package manager profile tab select download update especially patch package not_part core missing fix cause crash not_updated sim separate silly completely agree grasp it_emphasized work clunky slowly controller support good hope return due force feedback support working flying plane real resistance air control surface support past probably future stick yoke gamepads customization option galore favorite device quick flight swap joystick throttle peddle setup controller gyro controller work fantastic virtual yoke allows near pinpoint precision control except yaw access trigger control yaw finer control trigger xbox controller improvement conventional gamepad great excitement msfs deck pretty sim portable combined controller fantastic cannot_wait mine quick couch fse hop aviation flight msfs love letter sky

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"Backstory: In 1987, I began using MS Flight sim on an amber-screened IBM clone. It took several 'disks' to load, and I'd go make coffee and drink the majority of it before it was loaded and ready to play. In retrospect, it was simply atrocious. It had no graphics, ran at less than 5 frames per second, and took input from the keyboard. In a nutshell, it was like flying a very stubborn turkey.

But I was sucked in. ""One day, I thought, this will be real. One day, places will appear as they do in the real world. One day, planes will actually feel like planes, rather than just an illusion of something clearly tortured on a screen.

'One day,' 37 years later, has arrived.

I can find minor flaws in this game, such as the fact that the frame rate is inconsistent and slows significantly around densely populated areas, or that the drone camera system is somewhat cumbersome, and flight planning could be a lot more user friendly when adding or re-ordering waypoints. However, these are minor issues. And, while I'm sure they'll be fixed, I could live with the game as is because everything else is so far ahead of anything else I've ever seen. It's not just good; it's phenomenal.

I've been a hopeless pilot for years, doing my best and still failing miserably. However, this simulator is a quantum leap beyond the previous ones. When realism is set to maximum, I can land every time without crashing. The simulation of flight systems and avionics has vastly improved, making hand flying aircraft far easier than in previous iterations. It feels like you're flying a real plane, not a simulation. Flying over your hometown gives you the impression that you are actually there. (And no, the house you're flying into is nothing like your actual home. It could even be mine.)

Sometimes a product comes along that completely changes the genre. This will forever alter flight simulation. This is revolutionary.

So seeing this delivered before I get to go to that big refrigerator in the sky makes me ecstatic. It gives me great pleasure to say, ""It's finally here, and it's better than I could have imagined possible.""

I'm not going to complain about anything when I can fly anywhere in a faithfully recreated virtual copy of the world for $60. Fly over a location and exclaim, ""This looks exactly like it does in real life!"" What an ungrateful person I would be. If I complained about the hours and hours it took to download when, at the end of it, the entire world exists on a small setup in the corner of my living room. Some people, to be honest.

MSFS2020 is simply put: a next gen flight simulator. Everything is indeed a step forwarded compared to older simulators. Cities with 3D models look amazing, cities with AI buildings also look cool, but of course they aren't entirely modeled.

To the Simulator itself: I have been flying mostly small aircraft exploring the world and doing simple IFR flight here and there. I have yet to find a bug or something weird that ruined my experience. I know a lot of people are complaining about the Flight Management computers in airliners being fucked, as well as the autopilot. These are extremely complex systems and quite honestly, I would be extremely surprised if they got some study-material aircraft perfectly at launch. Physics wise this is also very interesting. It's still not perfect, but it's getting better. Topographic turbulence and weather changes are becoming somewhat realistic. 

Long story short, this is obviously a classic and will become the new industry standard. If you are here for big planes and exact real life procedures, you might want to do that when third parties start releasing their products.

While the base game may not come with the best models for airliners, and will require you to purchase 3rd party addons to enjoy a realistic airline world, the popular Cessna 172 comes very close to what I fly in the real world. Combining the realistic Cessna with the beautiful scenery MSFS provides, and a 3rd party addon for ATC communications, like PilotEdge or VATSIM, I can create a very realistic feeling with the simulator. If I every fly an unfamiliar route in the real world, I can practice it in the sim first to get familiar with the sights I will see when I really fly, I can practice real world approaches, as well as other instrument procedures. Because the actual feeling of flying is hard to replicate, I strictly do not use the simulator to practice technique as it could create bad habbits for the real world, however while this may be true, I can still practice working procedures, and task management which sets a great foundation for myself when I return to the real cockpit!","Mostly Positive78% of the 52,854 user reviews for this game are positive.",real life pilot msfs great tool practice real world procedure navigation communication base not_come best model airliner require purchase 3rd party addons enjoy realistic airline world popular cessna 172 come close fly real world combining realistic cessna beautiful scenery msfs provides 3rd party addon atc communication pilotedge vatsim create realistic feeling simulator fly unfamiliar route real world practice sim familiar sight fly practice real world approach instrument procedure actual feeling flying hard replicate strictly not_use simulator practice technique create bad habbits real world true practice working procedure task management set great foundation return real cockpit

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"Review after 60 hours - 2020 Sept. 29:
Pro:
- incredible graphics
- very high realism in most details (youtube videos from actual pilots confirm the degree)
- Weather system / Clouds quality is absolutely next generation level
- You can also choose live weather / wind / conditions .. which is fantastic !
- You see other pilots and their planes (collision with planes/cars/trucks is disabled, so, not stressful when people just ignore the rules)
- Authentic simulation of ATC radio communication Airport/Tower... you even have ground services where you request refueling or a push back for your plane.. 

Pro-verdict: 100% the most advanced, beautiful and immersive Flight Simulator today for PC
- we've got a modding community already working on new planes / buildings / airports / landscapes and even
bugfixes. 

Con:
- It's not finished (Many elements in the cockpit of bigger jets don't work yet)
- The map still needs a lot of fixes/improvements, but since we're talking about the entire earth -> it is already amazing and awesome.. just, not finished. So, not a bad ""con"".
- Biggest complaint -> Autopilot. The autopilot for the jets has horrible bugs, and can crash your plane easily.
  It's far from reliable ! More details in below in the dev-section.
- you'll need a high-end PC for getting awesome graphics with good FPS, but that's logically to be expected ;-)

Neutral:
- Many big buildings all over the world are missing, since that's enormous work to be done, and much of it will be added later and / or can be bought from community modders.

Verdict:
In my opinion, if you can live with not trusting the autopilot yet and wanna learn and enjoy, I recommend you buy. The game is already awesome.

Feedback for developers:
It's not just me - actual Boeing 747 and Airbus 320 pilots have confirmed several bugs with the autopilot.
e.g.
Autopilot ignores changes in mid-flight, where you have to switch and change values, and change and re-activate them back, just so the computer acknowledges the values you've selected.
(Autothrust to 300kts, Alt to 30000ft, V/S +100 per minute, I'm at 25k ft, 290kts. Autopilot descends 6000ft/min dives down, goes beyond 360kts beyond safety and I have to disable it before it crashes my plane..). You can't reproduce this every time, but it happens way to often.
Other case:
Changing climb/descent per minute V/S in autopilot can make the plane jump up and down for 20mins, until it settles. You have 2 systems competing with each other. Auto-thrust tries to keep the plane at the correct speed. The climb/descend angle has an influence on that and vice verse, so you have 2 systems constantly correcting each other, bumping up and down, wasting fuel.. 
And if you press ""Hold"" for Altitude, it has a lot of trouble just holding. Not always, but many times, in midst of flight, Autopilot Altitude ""Hold"" leads to ascending 5000/min, descending 5000/min, and repeat 100 times.
Please make these systems a bit more intelligent in getting the plane stable.
I know there's limits, and one can configure the autopilot ""unwisely"", but the state it is in now, when I fly from Paris to New York, I actually have a way safer flight and burn less fuel, if I manually adjust pitch trim and thrust myself, than using the autopilot. That shouldn't be.
But it's good to see, that bug fixes are rolled out repeatedly, to improve those details. 
Please also use the valuable feedback from real pilots on youtube, there are just a few elements on the displays, that are wrong / show the wrong signal for specific settings and so on. (e.g. airbus, display still showing climb even when a different mode is active). We've got a really great community here, willing to help. If we eventually could have the authentic behavior of the real on-board systems/computers, that would be absolutely amazing !

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"I, like most of the sim community, have been looking forward to MSFS2020 for sometime. I wanted to hold off on writing a review until I had at least 100 hours invested into the game and once the studio had some time to fix bugs that plagued the sim at launch. As of January '21 I can confidently and heartily recommend this incredible, albeit flawed, game. Full disclosure: I'm a fairly serious flight simmer with 20+ years of experience. I fly with a HOTAS set up, head tracking, and flight pedals -- just so you have a sense of where I'm coming from.

Let's start off with the negatives. Asobo has come under alot of fire since release, for good reason, about bugs that plagued the game at release. Simply put, the game was released at least 6 months too soon. This was clear to me when I participated in the alpha and beta, that they weren't going to be able to fix and polish everything before release. Things have vastly improved over the past months, though the game still suffers from some big bugs -- particularly in the autopilot systems of the large jet liners. I don't fly these planes at all, so I know this through second hand sources. Things have improved massively but it sounds like some big bugs still remain. Performance optimization is still something I think that needs work. The game definitely runs better than it did at launch, but it still brings systems to their knees. The game is obviously beautiful and ground-breaking but when people running the best possible hardware can't get a solid 60 FPS, something is amiss.

Technical issues and bugs aside, my biggest beef with the game at the moment is with its flight model. This might sound like an issue that would make me not recommend the game (being a flight sim!) but let me explain. The game's flight model feels EXCELLENT, as long as you don't push the envelope. The aircraft I fly are prop aircraft (single and dual engine), and they feel really great when taking off, landing, and dealing with turbulence. The problem comes when you try to push them to their limits: stall behavior isn't as severe as it should be, and it's far too easy to recover from maneuvers that should kill you. This removes a major sense of danger from the game, and hurts immersion. Thankfully their next major 2021 update will focus on improving aerodynamics, but I wish they had made those fixes before release. 

There is also some lack of depth in features when it comes to comparing MSFS2020 to previous games in the franchise. For example, AI ATC functionality is pretty simplistic, you can't bring on human copilots or passengers, and there's no human ATC gameplay in yet. That said, FSX added these features over many years, and it's clear that Asobo has the same long-term support plan for this game. I'm confident we'll see these features get added in as time goes on, which is very exciting.

Ok -- time to stop talking about the negatives. The positive is we have an incredible, ground-breaking sim that offers great bang for the buck out of the ""box"" and is seeing insane 3rd party and mod support. It's shaping up to be one of those games that just gets exponentially better as time goes on. I purchased the Deluxe Edition which includes some extra planes and costs $20 more than standard. But even the standard version has an awesome line up of extremely detailed aircraft. Each plane has interactive cockpits, with nearly every switch and button able to be used. While the aircraft aren't professional level sim quality per-say, they're not super far off. The amount of love put into the planes inside and out -- as well as their sound design -- is really wonderful. And, for people like me who do want to fly professional-level versions of aircraft, there are tons of companies working on add-on planes right now. There is going to be a crazy amount of free and paid add-on content for this game over the next year.

The graphics, as you already know, can be truly astonishing. It's going to be a while before we see other sims catching up to MSFS2020's amazing cloud tech and dynamic weather. The fact that you can drop into any point on earth and fly with really convincing ground textures and graphics never ceases to amaze me. It's true that the auto gen AI that populates cities and landscapes isn't perfect and there are definitely weird glitches (especially around bridges), the overall result is really impressive and blows other similar sims out of the water. 

The other big feature I appreciate is accessibility: whether you're a hardcore flight simmer or someone who just wants to relax with a controller and fly around casually, this game is for you. The difficulty options allow a wide gamut of options, from full simulation to casual arcade play. And the best part is you can fly with your friends no matter what difficulty they have the game set to -- no need to join a special server with special settings, since the game has one big massive online environment (should you choose to join it).

Another awesome feature: each aircraft comes with a built-in digital check-list that walks you through how to start up and shut down each aircraft. For people like me who want to learn the ins and outs of every plane, this is an amazing feature that is desperately missing from other games with interactive cockpits, such as DCS. It saves many hours of reading through manuals and trial-and-error frustration. Every time I boot up DCS I think about how much it needs this kind of feature.

One final note: I got bored without having a ton of direction and just picking random places to fly, so I installed an amazing free mod called NeoFly. This mod creates a dynamic singleplayer pilot campaign and runs in tandem with the game. You can fly cargo, transport, emergency, and illicit missions to regular or bush airstrips all over the world, while maintaining your aircraft, hiring AI pilots to fly missions, and making money to buy bigger and better planes. It's fantastic, and has added a much needed dimension to the game. 

Anyway, this review only scratches the surface of the game but I wanted to hit the main points. TLDR: the game is worth buying and is getting better and better every month.

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"As a lifelong fan of Armored Core, since AC2 and playing every single game since, this really feels amazing to play - my favorite in the series so far. The game is optimized and runs like butter on a standard system here, 980ti gpu and 5800X cpu, not a drop below 60fps on high settings 1080p. Haven't encountered any issues like frame drop in hangar or crashes. 

Melee. The melee combat in VI is so vastly improved upon the old and as someone who always tried to play with a focus on melee as much as possible, but many times found it rather difficult, this is a whole new experience on that change alone. The combat feels more fluid than ever, and all kinds of builds have been fun -- not finding myself just building a one trick and sticking with it no matter what like I tended to do in other games of the series. 

Attitude. A vast change to the combat flow of the game versus ACs and special threats is the attitude control system. You, as well as all enemies, will suffer a crippling stagger if too much impact damage is taken too fast, overcoming your ""ACS"" system. During a window that is modified by ""Attitude Recovery"" you or your enemies will take massively increased damage during this time, making this a very key component to the combat that is new for the armored core series. It's the strongest and generally primary way to deal with special threat bosses in the game, and can be a strong (but not as crucial) part of defeating enemy ACs.

The game is very forgiving, despite people saying otherwise. You get checkpoints before bosses, as well as hp/ammo refills on longer missions leading to bosses, as well as ability to change your build and re-attempt the boss without replaying the mission. (And a reason to buy many different parts so you have options to switch to. Just replay some missions here and there to get some extra credits). No massive setbacks like forcing players to take losses on failing a mission or restricting access to funds in a playthrough (you can repeat missions or arena as much as you want for the funds you need at any time). While a skilled player that already knows the bosses can win any mission in any mech with skill, there are absolutely counters in the game that matter much more than previous titles, as the bosses are much more unique and varied. Don't give up on bosses -- if you are having trouble try changing your weapons and build.

The decal and emblem system is expanded from previous titles, now with more freedom than ever, even with new abilities like using layer masks, and you can easily upload and share/download other emblems and decals with share codes. Only downside here is that PC players cannot use codes from console players, but as time goes on there will definitely be lots of things uploaded to choose from. I already spent 7 hours recreating the White Glint emblem. Code: 1P5EB6FAYEP2

Final massive note -- KEYBOARD AND MOUSE. After 20 years of playing armored core with controller, it seemed strange to consider trying KBM for VI, even though I haven't played console in years, there are certain games I simply prefer controller. After a few hours I gave it a shot and will never look back. The game is completely transformed by the freedom you have using the mouse to look around, not needing to worry about turn rate any longer which was a huge part of every single AC game to date. In addition to freeing you up to have access to all movement commands while firing all four weapons without doing some strange claw grip on your controller, I recommend to everyone to give KBM controls a shot.

Definitely an amazing entry for Armored Core and we welcome it back!

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"[Armored Core Experience]
I've played every mainline Armored Core game in the franchise. S-ranked every mission, obtained every part, beaten every hidden boss and played far too many hours of Armored Core 3: Silent Line (one of the only games I had for around 4 years) and Armored Core For Answer. I had been waiting thirteen years for a good Armored Core game to finally come out. Sekiro, Dark Souls 3, and Elden Ring were all great but just don't have the same appeal. This game pulls many of the best elements from previous generations of Armored Core and develops some of the things that were fairly clunky and uninteractive.

[Stagger]
The fact stagger has a functional purpose instead of being a simple case of stunlocking is a gigantic depature from previous titles. In Gen 3 and 4, and even in Gen 5 (until it was nerfed) stunlocking was very easy to do. Many enemy AC's and heavy MT's were basically unable to respond. At the same time the player could end up getting stunlocked to death. So it went both ways, with little interaction or reaction possible. Stagger in AC6 isn't perfect, but it is a large step forward toward refining Armored Core's combat loop as a whole.

[Repair Kits]
Were derided early on for making the game 'too easy' but the reality is the opposite. Previous generations of games offered repairs via supply vehicles, but it wasn't very useful in the midst of combat. It is worth noting that Repair Kits are not a crutch they are simply a guide rail. A player relying on them heavily to beat the game is going to have a fairly poor time of it. Whereas people who learn from their mistakes and seek to master the game are likely to never require it.

[Reduced PvP]
As much as I may be derided for saying this. I disliked PvP in Armored Core V. The excessive focus of ACV and Verdict Day on online co-op heavily damaged the singleplayer experience, and considering the already controversial control scheme switch up, and the complete lack of true aerial combat, it just stuck out like a sore thumb. While I am rather baffled by the lack of features that ACFA had for PvP it doesn't really  change my opinion on the game. I began playing Armored Core when PvP was a pipe dream (or split-screen only), and while I had a bit of fun with PvP in AC4 and ACFA, and dabbled in ACV's PvP. Its never been a major focus to me.

[Customization]
I'd be lying if I didn't think they could've had more specific types of parts available, weapon arms, extensions, add-on boosters, ammo boost back parts... The amount of parts available in AC6 is fairly impressive, and if FromSoft builds upon this game with a DLC or sequel in the same vein as AC4 to ACFA. This is the start of a VERY interesting generation of AC. Also the addition of texturing and weathering is an extremely important improvement, as prior your mech either looked pristine or in the case of ACV like it fell out of a scrap-pile.

[Story]
Armored Core 6 has a fairly intriguing story, but obviously for many AC's fans a lot of the story beats will feel familiar. Fortunately its not as 'moustache-twirling evil' as some of the Gen 2 titles. I'd still say ACFA has a leg up story wise, but that was a sequel which had the foundation AC4 laid to work off of. We will have to see how far Gen 6 goes.

[Is It A Souls-Like?]
A lot of people seemed to think Armored Core 6 is just 'mech-souls' but that isn't the case. Even if you try to act like Repair Kits and Stagger are alien to AC, you'd just be displaying your lack of knowledge. Armored Core 6 is a truly refined return to form. A definitive 'Armored Core' game, and I look forward to the next addition.

[Score]
[strike]I'm still working through New Game ++, but if I had to put a score on AC6, its a solid 8.0.[/strike]
I've nearly done with NG++, and I've been pleasantly surprised by how much the story shifts for the 3rd ending. I've raised my score to 8.5. It's not perfect, but it lays the ground work for an all out masterpiece in the future.","Very Positive90% of the 50,561 user reviews for this game are positive.",armored core mainline armored core franchise ranked mission obtained beaten hidden bos far hour armored core 3 silent line game 4 year armored core answer waiting thirteen year good armored core finally sekiro dark soul 3 elden ring great appeal pull best element previous generation armored core develops thing fairly clunky uninteractive stagger stagger functional purpose simple case stunlocking gigantic depature previous title gen 3 4 gen 5 nerfed stunlocking easy enemy ac heavy mt basically unable respond stunlocked death way interaction reaction possible stagger ac6 perfect large forward refining armored core combat loop repair kit derided early easy reality opposite previous generation game offered repair via supply vehicle useful midst combat worth noting repair kit not_a crutch simply guide rail relying heavily beat fairly poor whereas learn mistake seek master never_require reduced pvp derided saying disliked pvp armored core v excessive focus acv verdict on_emphasizedline co overpowered heavily damaged singleplayer considering already controversial control scheme switch complete lack true aerial combat stuck sore thumb rather baffled lack feature acfa pvp opinion began armored core pvp pipe dream split screen bit fun pvp ac4 acfa dabbled acv pvp never_been major focus customization lying t_emphasizedhink specific type part available weapon arm extension add booster ammo boost part part available ac6 fairly impressive fromsoft build dlc sequel vein ac4 acfa interesting generation ac addition texturing weathering extremely important improvement prior mech looked pristine case acv fell scrap pile armored core 6 fairly intriguing obviously ac fan beat familiar fortunately not_as moustache twirling evil gen 2 title acfa leg wise sequel foundation ac4 laid far gen 6 go soul armored core 6 mech soul t_emphasizedhe case act repair kit stagger alien ac displaying lack knowledge armored core 6 truly refined return form definitive armored core look forward next addition score strike working score ac6 solid 8 0 strike nearly ng pleasantly surprised shift 3rd ending raised score 8 5 not_perfect lay ground masterpiece future

Armored Core 6 is my game of the year, though voting for it as an AC purist and veteran of past games is somewhat painful for reasons I will discuss later. It took me around 75 hours to 100% the game through three runs. The story is one of the more memorable ones in my gaming career, and the writing is unique. Overall, this is a great game I doubt many will regret buying. 

I played AC6 prior to several patches and only had one crash. I also lived through the dual Songbird/Zimmerman meta before those got nerfed. There still are meta choices in multiplayer, so if you are buying AC6 with multiplayer in mind, just understand that your campaign build may not be competitive in multiplayer. 

As an AC veteran, I do not find this game worse or better than previous games; it's just different. I get that this game is simplified and meant for a greater mass appeal than previous titles, which is fine. For the casual gamer, this can work. The difficulty curve can be rewarding for the Souls-like fans, but I do not think it is nearly as difficult as other games in that genre once you understand the stagger mechanics. I do wish there was a mode for AC purists who miss all the options and tech that is missing that was present in other games. I used to spend hours getting my build just right. 

The verticality of gameplay is well done, and the meshing of mechanics with the story is seamless. Again, this is one of the best games this year, and the gameplay and story set it apart, even with the missing items and options from previous Armored Core games. I wish there was a clear distinction for getting top ranks on each mission. Several missions took me many tries to get a top rank, and I did not know what I was doing wrong. A ranking system that is more granular and informative on where improvement is needed would be appreciated.

Updated:
The campaign is not very long, and the story is barely coherent. On top of that you need to beat it 3 times to get the ""true ending"". There are some small differences for each play through, but they are essentially parallel universe that doesn't interact with each other. It ends up feeling like playing through a visual novel multiple times to see how things could've gone differently, only that it's made mandatory as part of progression in this game. But hey it's a mech game and stories are expected to be only complementary so whatever.

Boss fights revolve too heavily around the stagger mechanic, leaving little room for creativity and personalized playstyle. Also, as a funnel enjoyer, I'm disappointing with the lack of drone options in this game.

Overall it's one of the coolest game that I've played in recent years, but combined with the lack of content and how Fromsoft likes to tell stories , it didn't feel very enjoyable or satisfying towards the end.","Very Positive90% of the 50,561 user reviews for this game are positive.",face tutorial bos dy oh software probably suppose lose asks restart intention winning loses anyways 10_emphasized updated campaign not_very long barely coherent top beat 3 time true ending small difference essentially parallel universe interact end feeling visual novel multiple time thing differently mandatory progression hey mech story expected complementary whatever bos fight revolve heavily stagger mechanic leaving room creativity personalized playstyle funnel enjoyer disappointing lack drone option coolest recent year combined lack fromsoft like tell story enjoyable satisfying towards

It's incredible. Go get it, review it, make From and Bamco and everyone know they can still make this kind of games!

What a way to debut the series on PC and bring back a franchise that had been dormant for a decade. It runs buttery smooth even on my aging configuration. It looks great, sounds great, plays great (it instantly recognised my Xbox One controller no problem), is complete on release, no predatory DLC or microtransactions, with a level of customisation that other games could only dream of.

Much like with Ace Combat (buddy!), it's amazing what they achieved with just showing vehicles, awesome mechs in this case. With an OST that slaps harder than a hard bass, crisp sound, excellent style and design UI elements, a non intrusive COM voice (shame you can only switch languages instead of voices but the default is great and feels like having Jarvis).

This is like a come back from another timeline where everything just was right! I've just cleared NG and on my way to NG+ and beyond (the game keeps giving!) so this is my GOTY, hands down.

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"[b] Review After 100% Achievements [/b]

Fires of Rubicon was my entry to the Armored Core franchise and one of the few “mech” games I’ve ever played. Now I am hooked. After playing through the game multiple times to get all the endings and unlock all the missions, I have to say that this is one of the coolest games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. The weapon/build variety is absolutely insane and that goes hand-in-hand with the option to play PvP if you are interested in even more combat. AC6 has been on my radar ever since I heard about them bringing the series back, so I decided to give it a try. Was not expecting to get as addicted to the gameplay as much as I have. All the mechanics flow extremely well and the actions become second nature the more time you put into the game. The story seemed very vague at the beginning (which I love btw) but as you reach the end of your first playthrough and make certain decisions, all the pieces start coming together forming this awesome world around you. Finishing the game three times gives you the true ending and enables you to unlock all the missions that you need to obtain Rank S for in order to 100% this game….that is the most challenging achievement in my opinion. The grind almost drove me mad. Performance is rock solid, music is phenomenal, and customization is other worldly. Playing this game was an experience I’ll never forget.

Well, if that is a negative for you then sure, that is your opinion. But I want to encourage people on the fence about the game, that is very intentional. This is not a one build fits all scenarios style game, the bosses and enemies are not designed with every build in mind like the souls style games. Instead, you are expected to CONSTANTLY change and update your builds. The game gives you like fifty or more slots to save different builds in, so that you can instantly change builds between missions. You are supposed to adapt to the situation. And on another note, you don't have to use the busted builds for the bosses. While yes you can trivialize the bosses with the max dps tank build, there is still a skill progression, and you can learn boss patterns and skill your way through a boss with a less mindless build.

[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
Here’s a fraction of my clumsy gameplay, which showcases, albeit partially, the core gameplay of AC6.
https://youtu.be/2tcYVv3j4N4
[list]
[b]Cons:[/b]
[*]After all these years, briefings are definitely far from the best storytelling method. 

[b]Pros:[/b]
[*]Satisfying skill-based combat system;
[*]Flexible mech customization system;
[*]About 60 diverse missions;
[*]Magnificent boss fights;
[*]Exquisite soundtrack throughout the whole game.

[b]Neutral:[/b]
[*]Three playthroughs are required to see all the story bits, elements and variations;
[*]At first the interface may appear to be overly cluttered; however, in practice it displays only the necessary information – nothing more, nothing less.
[*]Two types of collectibles (mech parts and logs with extra story bits) are scattered around the levels.[/list]

[i]My impressions of AC6 are based on the 3 consecutive playthroughs (all missions, all endings).[/i]

[h1]Where there’s Coral, there’s Blood[/h1]

I would like to kick things off with the story. Unlike in the majority of recent games from this studio, the story is delivered directly and, more or less, clearly. Though, AC6 hasn’t fully evaded From’s signature style, which lies in its mysteriously elusive sheen that envelops almost the entire narrative here. Regardless of which ending you might aim for, you will be [b]TOLD[/b] a story that may not reach for the stars, but is a perfectly coherent and understandable tale. That’s exactly where the main narrative problem lies. No matter how interesting or epic the unfolding events may be, the absolute majority of the plot information is delivered to the player through stylish, beautifully designed, but boring interludes, in which the player is often monotonously [b]TOLD[/b] about something. Moreover, quickly grasping the twists and turns that the main characters and corporations undergo will be challenging for a newcomer to the series. This is despite the fact that they did not appear in previous parts of the series. Who are they? What is their goal? The exposition is oversaturated with introductions and dumps a ton of information on the player in a short period of time.

In general, the gameplay loop and narrative structure in the game follow this pattern: briefing before the mission > mission execution > summary/main characters' commentary > customization of the mech (optional) > briefing > mission > results > repeat until a somewhat directed cutscene. However, even these rare clips don't shake things up too much because they either focus on general surroundings or close-ups of mechs. Exciting and/or dynamic actions are few and far between in these clips. I understand that this was the case in the previous 15 installments of the series, however, that doesn't serve as reasonable justification. It's still a somewhat sub par way of story delivery for a AAA game in 2023, especially one that truly set out to tell the stories in a straightforward and clear manner. [url=youtube.com/watch?v=buqlmuzbzmc]You can see for yourself here (spoilers, obviously).[/url]

I have to give credit, where credit is due: even though Rusty, Walter, Carla, Ayre, and other characters are, for the most part, mere voices, I was still able to establish a pleasant emotional connection with them during the playthrough, and their clashes were able to capture my interest, which strikes me as something paradoxical, considering the main method of storytelling.

Also, it's worth keeping in mind: for a complete playthrough from a story perspective, i.e., to achieve all endings, it's necessary to beat the game three times. Each subsequent playthrough not only allows you to unlock and complete missions that were unavailable to the player in previous runs but also provides an opportunity to look at the unfolding events from different angles. This is a rather controversial decision. Yes, it allows for a better understanding of and connection with the characters, their relationships, and the world in which all of this takes place, but not every player will be willing to complete the game three times, especially considering that the majority of the missions remain unchanged.

[h1]Combat and Customization Systems[/h1]

These two systems are closely interconnected and go hand in hand throughout the entire game because, depending on the build, the optimal battlefield behavior pattern changes: a player can pilot a light and fast AC, allowing for the use of heavier weaponry, or, conversely, be slow but sturdy; you can literally turn into a tank or become a mech on four legs; equip a machine gun (or any other weapon from the insanely extensive list) into your right hand and a shield/spear/sword, etc. into your left hand. The game offers many tools for melee combat. Besides, no one will look down upon you for dual-wielding. Perhaps you're as much of a fan of Max Payne as I am?

Although this comparison is not very accurate, to be fair. The thing is, you don't have to manually aim at the enemies here. Your AC automatically targets enemies; you can only choose targets and switch between them when you're locked on. However, this doesn't make the game less skill-dependent, contrary to your initial thoughts. The foundation for showcasing skills here lies in the ability to pilot your mech correctly, primarily in terms of movement, spacing, and timely shooting, along with a properly assembled loadout.

Equally important is the constant focus on monitoring a bunch of different values and indicators: the amount of ammunition and remaining energy, which is spent on dashes and accelerations, indicators of overheating and cooldowns for certain types of weapons, the number of remaining 'medkits' (only three are handed out for all missions, but only sometimes they can be replenished), and, of course, the reserves of remaining armor and an analogue of the Posture bar from Sekiro, which is displayed for both you and your opponents.

Also, the game features an Arena. By the name, everything is clear – 1x1 battles against various types of AC. An excellent mode for replayability, where you can hone your skills, try different loadouts, but most importantly, acquire the so-called 'OST Chips.' Essentially, these are skill points that are spent on passive upgrades for your mech and several active abilities.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

[b]In summary, the gameplay and the combat systems, in particular, are the selling points of the game, and they are executed at the highest level: refined mechanics, still a deep customization system (it was even more complex in the previous games of the series), glorious arenas and locations from a visual standpoint, epic boss fights that are unlikely to be forgotten even upon a single encounter. AC6 is a brilliant representative of action games.[/b]

[i]P. S. It's nice to see how Miyazaki-san's team occasionally deviates from Souls games in favor of the clearly secondary projects for the studio/publisher, yet refreshing nonetheless, such as Sekiro. This time they brought back Armored Core. Would that imply that we can expect a sequel to Ninja Blade or, perhaps, should they even consider venturing into a new IP in some genre that is unusual for the studio? After all, FromSoftware developers are adept at deviating from familiar formulas, as they have demonstrated with these excellent games over the past few years. It would be great to see more of these experiments.[/i]

1888160,ARMORED CORE™ VI FIRES OF RUBICON™,"My EXP with these games, Armored core 1-4, Dark souls 1-3 and Elden Ring. I want to start off with the cons in my opinion then to the positives.

Cons:
-Boss difficulty doesn't match the level. 
-Enemies are too easy and only get easier.
As stated the bosses in the early game are far too difficult and enemies are far too easy. Instead of a good balance, the enemies might as well give you health and then you will reach a boss and spend an unreasonable amount of time fighting them. Missions can feel like they take a minute or two but a boss can be a few hours. This is in comparison to what the armored core games used to be, where the missions that didn't have a boss were actually fun and a challenge. IMO the missions with no boss or even the lead up to the boss are the equivalent of the story mode people have been begging for in dark souls. 

Pros:
-Excellent control (when you get used to it)
-Enjoyable story
-Lots of variety in builds
-Cool missions
-interesting characters and environment 
I loved the story of Armored Core 6. The more interesting part is that although it feels short beating the game and doing it on NG+ and making different choices makes the game feel different. Not to spoil anything but NG+2 has entirely new missions that feel like you are seeing previous missions from another side. I'd say you haven't really beat the game until you have completed NG+2. Games like dark souls have different endings but AC6 has different dialog, different missions and even different bosses depending on what you do. Beyond all that the game allows for quick AC swaps for when you know you need an entirely different frame to build off of. Some players will beat the game with one set up but for those of us fortunate enough to NOT be that good at the game, we get to enjoy making changes to our mech and dialing it in to fit the mission and watching our hard work pay off. 

TLDR: Expect boss difficulty spikes and be prepared to potentially spend hours trying to beat one boss. Otherwise the game has a great story, is a lot of fun and feels incredible.","Very Positive90% of the 50,561 user reviews for this game are positive.",exp game armored core 1 4 dark soul 1 3 elden ring con opinion positive con bos difficulty enemy easy easier stated boss early far difficult enemy far easy good balance enemy health reach bos spend unreasonable fighting mission minute bos hour comparison armored core game mission bos fun challenge imo mission no_boss lead bos equivalent mode begging dark soul pro excellent control enjoyable lot variety build cool mission interesting character environment loved armored core 6 interesting feel short beating ng different choice make different not_to spoil ng 2 entirely mission seeing previous mission side beat completed ng 2 game dark soul different ending ac6 different dialog different mission different boss depending allows quick ac swap entirely different frame build player beat set fortunate not_be good enjoy change mech dialing fit mission watching hard pay expect bos difficulty spike prepared potentially spend hour trying beat bos otherwise great fun feel incredible

[b]Review score:[/b] 6/10

[b]TL;DR[/b] - [i]Far Cry 6 is the perfect slop to play for dozens of hours, with no emotion or depth. It's sadly the most marketable Far Cry game content-wise to date. 

With almost 200 hours under my belt, I can still play the game endlessly, but I will never feel anything worthwhile. It's just another mediocre game with the same overused Ubisoft formula, now with some additional useless, half-baked features, story, motifs, characters and poor game design. It can be FUN, but only because everything is so silly and stupid.

The series as a whole was never very good, and none of the games would get a score higher than 7/10 from me, but Far Cry 6 is a new low, a 'far cry' from what the series was supposed to be. I was actually hyped for this game, because I like the game's themes and ideas about fascism, the soundtrack, some of the cinematics and trailers, Giancarlo Esposito's performance and typefaces used. This is a disappointment.[/i]

[b]Advice:[/b] If you want to play the game, ALWAYS buy it on sale, and ALWAYS buy the standard or deluxe edition. The DLCs are not worth any amount of money.","Mostly Positive72% of the 15,575 user reviews for this game are positive.",url http steamcommunity com group atpreviews discussion 1 5774239174017168559 alextecplayz review url due limit imposed compared discussion post description limit score 6 10 tl dr far cry 6 perfect slop dozen hour no_emotion depth s_emphasizedadly marketable far cry wise 200 hour belt endlessly never_feel worthwhile mediocre overused ubisoft formula additional useless half baked feature motif character poor design fun silly stupid series never_very good game score higher 7 10 far cry 6 low far cry series supposed hyped theme idea fascism soundtrack cinematics trailer giancarlo esposito performance typeface disappointment advice sale standard deluxe edition dlcs not_worth

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"Fun game with good story, but I can't recommend it.

This game has a ton of outfits, weapons, and vehicles locked behind hundreds of dollars worth of micro transactions.

Why is there this much content pay walled in a single player game?","Mostly Positive72% of the 15,575 user reviews for this game are positive.",fun good recommend ton outfit weapon vehicle locked hundred dollar worth micro transaction pay walled single
2369390,Far Cry® 6,"It has a lot of positive qualities, but I lean more towards not recommending it. While the shooting gameplay, graphics, and sound have improved over previous entries, the spectacle wears off and the game gets repetitive and boring towards the end and feels a bit too long. Also, I didn't really like the side characters that much.

Likes
+ Much improved graphics over previous entries.
+ Guns continue to get better. There are more different types of guns and they sound and feel better than ever (except the resolver weapons, I don't really find them appealing, they feel like clown weapons)
+ I liked the music in the game, it covered genres I don't listen too much but it fits the setting quite well and adds to the immersion.
+ The protagonist isn't so much a player insert anymore, they are someone with their own personality, which I felt added to the game a bit more.
+ You can use more variety of weapons and gear, swapping freely between loadouts at any time.
+ Enjoyed this one entertaining side quest that is kind of a self contained survival horror section that apparently ties into Stranger things.

Dislikes
- Gear replaces perk points. No more sense of character progression outside of the gear and weapons you acquire. If you want to maximize your resources you need to tediously swap gear to ones that increase the amount of stuff you pickup anytime you are looting. And in general, If you want to use the gear you pickup youll need to be swapping to it so even when you acquire new gear you may not even end up using it since constantly swapping out gear is annoying and interrupts the action constantly. I would say 80% of the loot I scavenged for on the map ended up completely unused. So this really discourages exploring and finding loot.
- Didn't care for the resolver backpack or weapons. Every one I tried just felt bad to use. Unresponsive, awkward, or weak. I wish they'd stop including these , for lack of a better term, clown weapons, in the far cry series.
- Picking up things seems more finnicky.
- Camp building subsystem seems mostly a waste of time/ 75% of the things you can build seemed pointless since I didn't care about hunting, fishing, or the bandido mission stuff.
- Didn't really HATE any of the characters, but didn't really like any either. Some of them were a bit annoying. I just don't think the character dialogue in this game is really for me, can't speak for anyone else though. I think it just boils down to a more serious tone. I don't have a problem AT ALL with the more diverse cast, it's just the personalities of the characters.
- Travel is more annoying than it has ever been in this series. This is a BIG issue because as you probably know, map traversal makes up like 80% of gameplay time in this series. And the map is larger, which futther compounds it. Furthermore, the stuff you can get by exploring the map is just gear which as mentioned above, you will end up using maybe 15% of. So you'll quickly learn that its a waste of time to explore the map, which used to be fun in previous games. It just takes too darn long to get anywhere and your reward is usually a slap in the face with a cruddy piece of gear you'll never use.

First of all summoning your car is really tedious and annoying. You have to go to menu, request it, wait for it to drive up, wait for the driver to get out, then finally you can start driving. On the plus side you can summon it anwhere. Unfortunately, there are many areas in the game not accessible by car. You are meant to use these ""guerilla paths"" on horseback, and the map pathfinding doesnt go along them. So you'll often be tabbing back and forth between map and game, and switching between car and horseback. Oftentimes I ended up just running on foot so I wouldn't have to bother checking the map, waiting for a car, or finding a horse.

You can fly, helicopter or airdrop with a wingsuit from certain locations but depending on how much you've taken over, you may not have a close point. Further, you have to take out anti air cannons if they cover the area. So you keep asking yourself if its worth it to go out your way to take out the anti air or if you should just go on the ground. I would say its often not worth it. The materials you can get from anti air sites are only for resolver gear which IMO sucks.
The end result for me was a lot of tedious running on foot and checking the map because it honestly seemed faster than dealing with all the variety of different options.

The environments are nice to look at, but I feel this tedium of traversal gets in the way of that rather than accentuating it.
- Exploring the map to find good loot is a prominent aspect of this series but is abysmally bad in this. The loot just sucks and it takes too long to get around.
- Godawful airpline flight controls on keyboard. Inexcusably bad considering they nailed it on FC5 and new dawn.
- There are all these shiny new guns but there are no incentives to really use them all. In previous games, you used different guns to complete challenges, but there are no such systems in this game so you end up investing a lot in a few guns and wishing you had the resources to try out different ones.
- Overall its just too long for me. All of the above issues are compounded by the length. They'd be more forgivable otherwise. If those issues were fixed, or if the story or characters were more interesting I wouldn't mind it as much, but it feels almost double the length of FC5/New Dawn and those felt perfect from a length perspective. I was rushing the main quest after I got through the first 2 sub-areas because it just started to get really same-y.
- To make the combat harder they make the enemies dodge and weave around a lot mroe and it looks ridiculous and inhuman and is just annoying. In some cases I saw enemies literally sliding along the ground with no animation just to evade my crosshairs.
- Didn't really care for the ending. Didn't really feel worth it.

Since I was burnt out by the end of the MQ I didn't mess around with the weekly postgame stuff.

I got this game for $15. That is the only price I would recommend this game at.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"I bought it from the sale and I'm a bit dissatisfied. The Far Cry series is really going downhill. 

-Ubisoft launcher is just horrible piece of crap. Steam is a launcher that works, theres absolutely no need for another launcher on top of that. And Ubisoft connects sometimes doesn't connect and it's one more account to register and to forget passwords for. 
-Enemies show up as a red blob on the radar, so they never appear out of nowhere. Thus making sneaking around too easy. 
-Bullet sponge enemies just feel bad. Three headshots with an M-14 rifle is ridiculous. 
-Bullet sponge animals are just the same. 
-Different ammo types was a nice idea, but they overdid it. Changing ammo type and/or weapon three times in one firefight just feels bad. 
-Weapons unlock not from enemies killed but from game progress. Killing an enemy that has shotgun doesn't give a chance to pick up that shotgun unlike in previous games. 
-The game forces you into 3rd person view from time to time without an option to toggle it off.
-Supremos (backpack ultimate weapons) are ridiculous and not really fun and they really break the immersion. 
-Modifying weapons makes them uglier, and silencers overheat extremely easily.

- Side activities such as outpost and checkpoint liberations, side missions labeled as Yaran stories, races and so on.
- There is an entire side mission that is a crossover with Stranger Things! (It's about 1 hour to finish)
- 5 Spec ops missions that behave similarly to Far Cry New Dawn's expeditions, these missions take you to new places while you have a mission to get the PG-240X and extract with it. It's pretty good, especiall with a friend and the rewards are also good.
- The protagonist ""Dani Rojas"" (who can be male or female) is a great character, I loved her. She even sings her favorite songs on the radio while driving!
- Amigos/Companions that can aid you on your journey, each having their own unique methods of dealing with obstacles.
- The soundtrack is quite great, but the radio songs are phenomenal! (Especially when Dani sings alongside them)
- Huge variety of guns, vehicles and clothing
- Supremo weaponry is a great way to cause havoc
- Guns look great and are well animated. You can even tune and customize them to your own liking.
- 4 Unique vehicles you can call at any given time (if you've unlocked them all) and you can customize them to your own liking.
- Post game activities

[b][u]Neutral:[/u][/b]
- There is no skill tree in the game, skills are replaced by pieces of clothing that all gives you different stats and perks.
- I haven't played with any of the DLCs, but people say that they are not that great to be worth their prices.
- Spec ops are quite repetitive and its difficulties have to be unlocked one by one, but I can forgive them given that these are completely new locations to explore.
- I find it a bit cheesy that you can whip out any gun at any given time, but it's fun.

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
- Ray tracing reflections aren't always impressive
- Cutscenes are locked to 30fps
- A whole lot could have been done with the characters of Antón Castillo, with his son Diego and with many other characters.
- Unfortunately with coop, the player who joins doesn't make any progress with missions nor activities, only with loot. It is advised that if you want to play the entire campaign of the game, make a seperate save that you'll use just with your friend, as there are 3 seperate save slots.
- Exploring areas like Esperanza is really a let-down, there isn't much going on and it's just an empty area with not much people around, even during missions when you are there.
- The AI is as dumb as a rock
- The game is piss-easy on hard mode, some said it's even easy on Guerilla Mode, the hardest difficulty that can be chosen.
- Even though there is a huge variety of guns, you'll most likely stick with one or two for the entirety of the game as their stats will be always superior to what you find.
- The DLC Files and the HD Texture pack will install automatically with the game, which makes the game huge in size (Around 170 GB to be more exact), even if you do not own the DLCs nor want to use the HD Textures pack. You can however delete these files in the game's folder to save precious space, just like I did.
- In Co-op, you get teleported back to your partner if you get a bit further away, which kinda sucks
- No Arcade gamemode (Which also means no map editor)

[b]7.5/10[/b] Even though Far Cry 6 has many flaws and bugs, it is still a thouroughly enjoyable experience. Walking around Yara in itself is an amazing experience. I got it on a sale for 15€ and for that much, it is totally worth its price.

I also made a video to showcase how gorgeous Yara and its scenery really is.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"TLDR; There is an abundance of content, but none of it feels especially fun or meaningful. I would avoid this entry in the series in favor of 3,4, or 5.

Yikes... I really wanted this game to be good, I really really did. I 100% completed every other Far Cry game starting at 3, and enjoyed it pretty well. But this game is just bad. I'm currently in the process of finishing it up, but I wouldn't really recommend that anyone else start it. There was a lot of potential here, but it was botched pretty bad.

Let me first give credit where credit is due; the open world of Yara is absolutely stunning. There is such a wide variety of environments to explore and they all feel pretty well fleshed out. I have enjoyed exploring Yara through and through. It is absolutely beautiful, and you can see so far from the highest peaks. Also, the character of Dani is great. This is the first Far Cry to have an engaging protagonist. You can choose your gender, but the dialogue is the same either way. Dani makes decent quips, doesn't talk excessively in my opinion (though it is quite frequent), and generally felt good to play as. Also, awesome takedown and healing animations have returned!

And my praise unfortunately ends there. There were a lot of innovative ideas added to this game, such as the Supremos and a more in depth crafting and base building system. Loot crates are also back from the earlier entries like FC3 and 4, but instead of money they give you weapons, clothes, and crafting materials. Oddly, I didn't despise any of these systems, and I think they could've been much more fun or rewarding given better implementation. Weapons crafting is fun, but excessively grindy in order to get you to make micro transactions, and a lot of tradeoffs you make in what equipment you use are just plain dumb. Who would take fire protection over being able to easily tag enemy locations? Many buffs in this game are too circumstantial to be swapped out; some of them should've just been upgrades.

I won't go into everything, because there's a ton of content which is excessively padded out to artificially inflate playtime. What you need to know is that a lot of this could have been fun if the core gameplay of Far Cry 6 were more fun and engaging. It is not. Combat feels flat most of the time, with you either rolling over enemies with no effort whatsoever, or occasionally an enemy will be much stronger than they should be and take too many hits to kill (why do I sometimes have to hit a helicopter with 3 rockets to down it and other times just one?). The gameplay loop and sandbox are repetitive in this way very consistently and by probably around 50 hours you really start to feel exhausted by it.

And the story... it's a joke. The main villain doesn't get much screen time or development, which is an issue when most Far Cry entries favor their villains and when said villain is ON THE PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL FOR THE GAME. There's also a general lack of nuance that was present in other entries; in 3,4, and 5 you were made to question your actions as the main character and whether what you were doing was right. In this game, it feels like you're expected to side with the guerillas even when they do horrendous things, like dangling the corpse of a military official over the water for show, just as she had done prior. I haven't reached the ending, but I don't expect that to change there. The main cast is generally unlikable with only a few exceptions, and a lot of times I found myself rooting for the bad guys out of spite. It feels like the writers are using the game as their own fantasy of a glorious revolution where they're absolutely in the right all the time, except for the people they use to represent the ""good guys"" are generally obnoxious teenagers who take pleasure in killing with a disturbing lack of self awareness. This is something that almost every other Far Cry addresses, but it doesn't seem to in this one.

Also there's a very obvious push for diversity and it really comes at no benefit to the plot. There are gay and transgender characters that were clearly thrown in just for the sake of trying to appeal to a wider audience at a surface level. In every case that I've seen thus far, these inclusions make NO meaningful addition to the plot. Whether you view this as another case of forced diversity or as a pandering technique to the LGBT community, it's bound to annoy you either way.

Some of the DLCs aren't bad though. The ones that let you play through the minds of the main villains from prior games are interesting and pretty engaging even. However, you have to complete them in one sitting and they expect multiple replays, which are frustrating. I don't find the gameplay compelling enough to warrant that many playthroughs, and trying to find time to finish one of these at a time could sometimes be difficult for me.

Overall, I would just stay away from this one. I really wanted to like it, but it just feels almost incomplete. The story and gameplay are generally a flop, and while the map IS beautiful, it's not enough on its own to make this game worth playing.","Mostly Positive72% of the 15,575 user reviews for this game are positive.",abundance feel especially fun meaningful avoid entry series favor 3 4 5 yikes wanted good really_emphasized 100 completed far cry starting 3 enjoyed pretty bad currently process finishing recommend else potential botched pretty bad credit credit due open world yara stunning wide variety environment explore pretty fleshed enjoyed exploring yara beautiful far highest peak dani great far cry engaging protagonist choose gender dialogue dani make decent quip t_emphasizedalk excessively opinion frequent generally good awesome takedown healing animation returned praise unfortunately end there_emphasized innovative idea supremo depth crafting base building loot crate earlier entry fc3 4 weapon clothes crafting material oddly despise system fun rewarding given implementation weapon crafting fun excessively grindy order micro transaction tradeoff equipment plain dumb fire protection able easily tag enemy location buff circumstantial swapped upgrade ton excessively padded artificially inflate playtime fun core far cry 6 fun engaging not_combat feel flat rolling enemy no_effort whatsoever occasionally enemy stronger hit kill helicopter 3 rocket time loop sandbox repetitive consistently probably 50 hour exhausted joke villain screen development issue far cry entry favor villain villain promotional material general lack nuance present entry 3 4 5 question action feel expected side guerilla horrendous thing dangling corpse military official water prior reached ending expect cast generally unlikable exception time found rooting bad guy spite feel writer fantasy glorious revolution except represent good guy generally obnoxious teenager pleasure killing disturbing lack self awareness far cry address obvious push diversity come no_benefit plot gay transgender character clearly thrown sake trying appeal wider audience surface case far inclusion no_meaningful addition plot view case forced diversity pandering technique lgbt community bound annoy dlcs bad one mind villain prior game interesting pretty engaging complete sitting expect multiple replay frustrating compelling warrant playthroughs trying finish difficult stay wanted feel incomplete generally flop map beautiful not_enough worth

If you enjoy messing around in an open world sandbox shooter this should deliver a satisfying experience. 
If you expect a substantive narrative, coherent game play systems & loops, an overall well put together experience you will be disappointed. 

As someone who played trough Far Cry 3-6, New Dawn & Primal, this game delivers nothing new or interesting expect for more of the same content with slightly more confusing unnecessary systems,

This game has literal mini game arcade machines, dominoes, Rooster* fighting, vast amounts of gear, bullet types, weapons, vehicles and it all leads to nothing because the game rewards bonus resources for completing missions/targets stealthily so you end up using the same silenced rifles and pistols with armor piercing bullets looking for head shots anyways. The enemies are supposed to have different weaknesses but if a camp consist of mostly every type of enemy, and they all are weak to a the same bullet type, why would you bother trying to manage switching bullet types. 

It's like non of the developers(or more likely game leads) played the game and realized the incentive structures they put in.

Throughout the story all you will be thinking is, why isn't anything I've put effort into part of the story. Where was my ""amigo"" when I got knocked out by the cliche doctor with sedation syringe. Why can't I attack the lions island with all the stealth gear I unlocked instead of stupidly walking in there with no gear and a practically useless soldiers uniform which won't work when you get past the first guards anyways. 

It's a shame because some parts of the game are really cool, the side stories, treasure hunts, special locations etc which should be giving you some special reward or gear are sidelined by 10+ material types and different currency which a allow you to skip a lot of that content. It's clear effort(and money) has been put towards the game but it incentives you to skip it in favor of less interesting minigames(special operations, rooster* fighting, bandidos) that allow you collect the previously mentioned resources more effectively. Why are these things in the game? Because every other open world game has them? What purpose do they serve here expect fast forwarding you through the interesting parts of the game?

Also minor-ish music pet peeve, What is up with the music in some parts of the game? Clearly money was spent on producing tailor made tracks about fictional Yara but instead in what should be the most climactic moment in the the story(final mission) it's overpowered by standard uninteresting action music. I ended up turning off the BGM music and realized there was no sound design. Like literally no sound design, it's supposed to be the most climactic final ending of the guerilla story line, and I realize I can't hear anyone but myself fighting because I was supposed to be excited by hearing the same 20 second standard action music loop over and over again. 

Finally I'll leave with with quick notes. 
- Why does the personal vehicle driver take ages to get out of the vehicle? Driving competes with the fast travel mechanic so it should be quicker to get going. 
- Why are amigos in the game if they aren't incorporated in 90% of vehicles, storyline etc? So much missed opportunity here.
- If you want to have tons of different gear in your game, give players incentives to manage them. The map is already split up in regions but every single outpost, vehicle checkpoint feels the same. Why not designate different environments for different types of enemies so the player feels motivated to change up their loadout as they pass through the map.
- I can kill every enemy in a military outpost without raising the alarm or being detected, but if I don't optionally keep an enemy alive while I free up the hostage or hack a computer I won't get the bonus? Who thought of this?
- The game is cluttered with less interesting notes, why put the effort into notes about random checkpoints, etc when you are likely to just skip reading them as they pop up on your map anyways. They are just clutter.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"[h1] Far Cry 6 is the usual fun. But it sabotages itself with overpowered stealth, weak AI and monotonous sequences. [/h1]

Everything could be so idyllic on Yara - if it weren't for Antón Castillo, portrayed by Breaking Bad actor Giancarlo Esposito. Castillo oppresses the people of the Caribbean island with violence. Leading his country to great prosperity - by any means necessary - is the goal of this ruthless dictator. He accepts this without batting an eyelid, even if it means killing a large part of the population.

The plant substance Viviro is extracted from Yara's tobacco plantations. Castillo hopes that Viviro will prove to be a highly effective anti-cancer drug. To achieve this, Castillo uses forced labor on the plantations. He also forcibly tests the drug on his own people. But Yara is not going to let him succeed. As part of the guerrilla movement ""Libertad,"" players take on the role of Dani Rojas - either a man or a woman - and plunge into a war of liberation to overthrow Castillo's regime.

A really great story is promised by the gripping starting situation with the outbreak of a revolution on an island strongly reminiscent of Cuba and the great actor Giancarlo Esposito in the role of the villain. What follows, however, is more a quick disillusionment than an enthusiasm.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2983826405

Because what comes next is following the well known pattern of the well known shooter. We wage a merciless war against the regime together with other resistance fighters. We must capture bases, disable alarms, free allies from prisons, eliminate key enemy figures, gather resources, and build rebel camps-tightening the net around Antón Castillo to finally oust the tyrant from his throne.

Sticking to old habits is a great pity. The Cuban background of the game world would have had much more potential for a really good story and would have given room for new facets in the gameplay. Instead, the game is characterized by eternal continuations. For example, the constant burning of the drug fields, which we already know from ""Far Cry 3"". The only difference is: The island is called Yara instead of Rook Island.

The major innovations Ubisoft announced before Far Cry 6 was released are not really going to be found playing. There are only a few elements of the game that are actually new and, above all, game-changing. The fact that skill upgrades are tied to clothing instead of unlockable skills is a new idea, but ultimately has too little impact on the gameplay. Much more relevant, for example, is the much simpler idea of simply putting down your weapon and exploring the world of Yara unhindered by enemy soldiers.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2982306933

Dani Rojas can move around Yara quickly and easily thanks to additional means of transportation. In addition to the usual selection of cars, helicopters, planes, boats and jet skis, players can also travel on horseback along the dusty guerrilla trails in ""Far Cry 6."" In addition, players will be able to summon their own vehicle anytime and anywhere via the weapon wheel. These vehicles can be outfitted with all sorts of extras.

The new ability to upgrade and access your own vehicles at any time is fun and can come in handy during various missions. Need to blow up an enemy tank? Can't do it with your portable weapons? You'll have better luck if you equip your car with a rocket launcher on the roof and summon it on the fly!

Hunting, on the other hand, which has always been an important part of the Far Cry series, will lose its importance completely. In the sixth installment, players will still be able to follow the tradition of hunting, but the collection of bones and furs will no longer be necessary for the production of new equipment. In fact, it has become so unimportant that you can leave it alone.

That's because of the new loot system introduced in ""Far Cry 6"": Special clothing can only be found in the game world or bought directly from merchants. Collected animal products can be exchanged for plastic. Plastic can be used to create new weapons. This is not absolutely necessary, however, as plastic can be obtained in other ways.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2978747724

This is why this innovation is not really a success. After all, the hunting tradition and the collection of animal materials to create individual equipment might have appealed to many experienced fans of the Far Cry series. Sure I can get clothing from opening chests, doing purple gem locations on the map etc etc., but it's not really worth it if you can just buy everything from the store rather than through gaming. The different types of ammo (piercing, fire, normal rounds etc.) are a meme in itself. Just equip ""piercing"" throughout the whole game and you're good to go and you can easily ignore the rest without any trouble. They tried too much ""new stuff"" and it failed hard.

Despite the variety - or maybe because of it - the game gets boring after a few hours. The abundance of side missions, quests, and puzzles is nearly overwhelming. In view of the packed open world, the main story is pushed further and further into the background. This is certainly also due to the fact that the story is more of an accessory than a reason to buy the game, just like in the last ""Far Cry"" installments.

This is a shame. The story had the most potential to breathe new life into the series. Games like ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" have shown in the past that it is possible to have a huge open world and a grandiose narrative at the same time. Far Cry 6's setting and narrative could've done that as well.

Instead, however, the lacking depth leads to trivializing. Nothing feels really important, even though Dani Rojas takes over one enemy military base after another and destroys numerous anti-aircraft installations. The next task is waiting as soon as one problem is solved. As a result, individual victories carry little weight. They hardly feel like accomplishments that would affect the progression of the story. Difficulty itself is also a huge con since the highest difficulty is absolutely easy without any hassle. Maybe it gets harder if you turn the controller 180° - a better challenge than the game offers thats for sure. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Most fans of ""Far Cry"" will enjoy playing the sixth installment, at least for a few hours. The game offers (almost) everything you are used to from Far Cry: an exotic and fantastically designed game world paired with some dark story accents, a large selection of weapons and of course a lot of fights and shootouts.

Ultimately, as some might have hoped, Far Cry 6 is not a reinvention of the series. The immense potential of actor Giancarlo Esposito in the role of the villain was not used. Also the setting of the Caribbean island inspired by Cuba was not used. Instead, Ubisoft stuck to the same old gameplay. Even supposed innovations like the elimination of the hunting tradition backfired. The game would have benefited from less extremely powerful weapons and more tactical challenges. Oh, and forget about all the different types of ammo you can carry, most of which is just a big meme. Sadly, it didn't end up getting revolutionary.

[h1] Final Verdict: 7/10 - Your typical Ubisoft shooter fomula experience: fun once brain is turned off.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"This isn't an unplayable game, it just lacks any personality or soul and is the weakest FC game to date. I have played Far Cry games since the very first game came out of nowhere in 2004 and blew everyone's minds (and graphics cards) but they seem to get further and further from what made the first game so great. 

The game is paint by numbers modern FC in game play and mechanics, they did not majorly evolve game play into anything new or groundbreaking but that isn't my biggest issue. 

For me it is just like they followed a formula and took zero risks and made a game that ticked all boxes at the expense of having anything remotely unique or engaging about it. The characters are mostly forgettable to just plain annoying and I could not get involved or invested in the characters story arc, so I started just skipping dialogue to shut them up. And they never shut up. 

The game is quite easy too and I am not exactly a competitive shooter god but I had to crank up the difficulty and remove enemy outlines otherwise it was so easy it was just beyond boring. However for some reason I could not stop showing enemy outlines, so I basically had unwanted wall hacks the game doesn't need. 

I really liked FC5 even though I expected to hate it, as at least it had some soul and humour to it. But this lacks it all imo. 

The good? Well it looks nice and the world is really pretty too. I really liked the moments where my allies actually STFU for a minute and I could just do my thing and briefly I would feel immersed... but sure enough, they just will not shut up and would shatter any immersion with irritating chatter.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"This game is a timewaster, painfully generic, and mostly forgettable.

Story put me to sleep, very over the top at times with current political/social issues to a comical degree. The majority of the performances by the voice actors are very good, but are held back by lackluster writing.

Gunplay and combat is fun, customization is a nice touch but objectively boils down to running a select few objectively best options.

Vehicle customization is also a nice touch, and adds incentives to do the car based side content.

Villain DLCs are fun.

Manditory HD texture pack that takes up 50gb ontop of the already 110gb game.

Not worth full price, pick it up when its cheap and get a friend to bear the burden of playing this game.

2369390,Far Cry® 6,"For starters ubisoft sucks.  Their app sucks, everything about it sucks.  Their games are basically all the same games with reused resources etc.  

With that said, the game is a tried and true fun.  Standard ubisoft game.  It is long, the story so far is decent.  The gameplay loop is just like every other farcry game.  Honestly, it looks just like the others with new features added for better quality.  If it weren't for the story, you wouldn't know if it was farcry 5 or 4.  But thats not bad.  It is really fun. Graphics are great. THe story has you slightly captivated, the game was $15 out the gate which is a steal considering I will get a solid 30 hours out of it just doing the story.  That's worth it big time imo.  If it's still $15...GET THE GAME.

374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"I summoned a mad phantom with the intention of dueling him, but instead he sat down and offered to toast with me. We continued on throughout Undead Settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area. After a while, I became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his last, dying breath.

We were a team. The best of friends, and nothing could stand in our way. He may not have been a Warrior of Sunlight, but Solaire's legacy thrived on within him. Jolly co-operation resumed until we neared the Curse-Rotted Greatwood...  And it was then that I decided to take yet another chance and summon a second Mound-Maker to see if we could rally him to our side.

The plan seemed successful at first. But it wasn't long before I noticed some suspicious patterns in the phantom's movement, and his interest in my backside became a significant concern. My anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missed.

My loyal protector raised both his hand and his middle finger at the attacker, before charging forward with fury the likes of which none in Lothric had seen. He made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at me, and before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath. He rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the ground, giving us an opening to attack. My companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of co-operation and sunlight.

The valiant protector lunged his sword deep through the attacker's back before he could escape, the weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk. I dropped down following this, and we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious glee.

But this was the end of our time together. We gave each other one final wave before my friend's body started to fade away as he was whisked back to his own dimension.

374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"After putting these many hours, I must say that this is one of the best, if not THE best RPG. Period.

It's hard, yes. It has a steep learning curve, also yes. But this game is a rare gem among the simplified, straight-forward, linear games that are currently in trend. Rare indeed for a game that actually rewards you for patience and restraint and encourages players to slow down and observe the surroundings and the enemies. 

Of course, the same can be said about Dark Souls 1 and 2. But Dark Souls 3 is really much more refined than those in a good way. Relatively faster paced combat not only feels more fresh but I think is a necessary step forward in making the gameplay more interesting. Also, the enemies are much more aggressive to compensate for this faster paced combat. 

Though the lore does not appear to be on par with the one in Dark Souls 1, which I personally believe to be the best in the Souls series. But it is still well above Dark Souls 2, which I personally didn't like all that well.

I could go on and on about this game, but for brevity I must say: Everyone must try this at least once.","Very Positive94% of the 238,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",putting hour best not_the best role period hard yes steep learning curve yes rare gem simplified straight forward linear game currently trend rare indeed reward patience restraint encourages player slow observe surroundings enemy course dark soul 1 2 dark soul 3 refined good relatively faster paced combat not_only feel fresh necessary forward interesting enemy aggressive compensate faster paced combat lore not_appear par dark soul 1 personally believe best soul series dark soul 2 personally brevity

Now dont let my play time decieve you, ive easily played this 3-4x more than the playtime suggests (I also own it on PS4)
As such is has a special place in my heart, it might not be the best game the bosses not as hard as some but i made a character and that character i have never had a better representation of my self in any game and ill explain why.

In August 2012 i bought a copy of Dark Souls ""Prepare to die"" Edition. i was going through a hump and honestly retreated further back into video games than i did previously, I remember putting the game on my PC and dealing with the buggy Microsoft Windows Platform but i kept going, I made my character look like me like i always do after the back tingling sensation the opening cut scene gave me. The witches of izalith with thier chaotic flame, Gwyn smiting the dragons, Nito moving with his wrathful stance.

And the Pygmy, With his Dark Soul. Sharing it with others. Humanity.

From that moment i knew i was in for a hell of a good time. I was wrong obviously dark souls stomped me into the ground but eventually i got the hang of it, Buggy controls or not i had fun, Not just playing the game but reading desciptions of items trying to scrounge up what the lore ment and filling in the gaps that i missed. I wanted more and more, the story was great even if it wasnt offered up straight to you and you had to look for it, and i think thats probably why it was great.

Miyazaki once said in an interview that he made dark souls in a similar way to what he experienced as a child, Growing up he had a lot of time alone and he spent it reading, He loved it but his favorite books were those about the knight who goes on daring quests to save a princess or slay a dragon and find treasure, However these books were in english and so he didnt understand them completely, a lot of the information was missing and he filled in the blanks with his day dreams of how HE wanted the story to go. imagining the hardships the knight must have gone through to get to where he was, and he couldnt have done it in a better way than what he did with dark souls, He made a community of people who feverishly try to fill in the blanks of the story even so complex that it makes your head spin.

Then there was Dark Souls 2. I continued the fantasy and made my character look like me again, Making it a continuation of my characters story -

SPOILERS

[spoiler]In dark souls 1 i chose to not light the flame and walked out to start the age of men, its my favorite ending and if i have the option its the one i always take so to me the story of drangleic was someone else managed to get through and continue the age of fire while i went off and disappeared for an undisclosed amount of time with a dope hat and a ton of souls[/spoiler]

To be fair Dark souls 2's story was lacking more than everyone expected but it was still a great game, the controls were more optimized so the game itself didnt seem as hard and the opening cutscene was great, i got goosebumps when the old firekeeper said ""And like a moth to the flame your wings will burn in anguish, Time and Time again"" and that was very true to the game we kept going for more even though you would get that angry sensation to just put it down and not pick it up. but you always do.

Then theres Dark Souls 3. To me the true Dark Souls 2 is the third, a perfect continuation of the story from the first, probably due to Miyazaki having more influence on this game and not being distracted with a different project (Bloodborne if i recall) and it continued the story for me perfectly, from beginning to end Dark Souls 3 has made me feel like a bad ass, I always ALWAYS start Deprived (recommend it to everyone even if you're just starting) because i enjoy the feeling of starting from scratch and tearing my way through challenges to distract me from my challenges in life, i enjoy the struggle and Dark souls 3 Gave me a good fight but like every challenge its there to be completed. and with the release of The Ringed City and Dark Souls 3 : The Fire Fades  Edition the series will sadly be put to rest and to me it will go down in my history as the game that pulled me through depression because even though its hard when i felt like i couldnt accomplish anything in my life the Dark Souls franchise showed me that if i kept trying eventually i could pull through.

SPOILERS

[spoiler]As im writing this im sitting in the Ariandel Chapel, I just finished collecting everything from The Ringed City, I killed Dark Eater Midir After a struggle and i gave the Blood of the Dark Soul to the Painting Girl. She is naming the Painted world after me in this burning chapel of forlorn souls. the final road in my journey through Dark souls. I have slain Demons and Dragons and Men. I Conquered Gods and Giants. And ive arisen from the ashes to Usurp the flame a final time. And now it all burns away. The age of Fire might fade. But the age of men begins in a cold dark and gentle place.[/spoiler]

Thank you Miyazaki And FromSoftware as a whole. For this trilogy, For the DLC. For the adventures and the times i spent jolly co-operating. For helping me pull through. For the Fantasy of Struggle. Thank you.

[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*]Absolutely gorgeous. It was clear that a lot of thought and effort was put into designing Dark Souls 3. Each area uniquely beautiful and expertly put together; the attention to detail creates a truly immersive experience. I especially enjoyed how spectacular the scenery and menacing the bosses are. 
[*]The developers did a great job at incorporating shortcuts. Since the areas are quite large, you often get disoriented as you progress (especially during the first playthrough). At a certain point, you come across unlockable door(s) or elevator(s) that connects to a previous area and acts as a shortcut. The sudden realization that you went around in one big circle or that you’re directly above/below a previous area always left me baffled. I really wonder how much time was put into the level design. 
[*]Amazing combat. Honestly, I’ve barely skimmed the surface when it comes to combat but it is enough for me to recognize how incredible it is. There are so many weapons, movesets, spells, infusions, and more. Plus the combinations you can put together are only limited by your imagination (for the most part). There is a reason why several people spend hours putting together the perfect PVP character(s).
[*]Exploration is greatly rewarded. Seriously, there are items, NPCs, and interesting rooms hidden everywhere. It’s gotten so bad that I feel paranoid when I reach a pointless dead end and find nothing - “there HAS to be something here”. Finding a secret felt like finding candy on a scavenger hunt and was thrilling from beginning to end. Keep a look out for fake walls, suspicious ledges, potential jumps, and chests. [i]Beware of mimics though.[/i]
[*]I really liked the decision to grant the ability to teleport between lit bonfires almost immediately, and to include a safe hub (Firelink Shrine), where most of the important NPCs/vendors can be found. This made Dark Souls 3 more user-friendly (especially for beginners) than Dark Souls 1. Although this made Dark Souls 3 more linnear, I found the clarity of knowing more or less what to do and where to go (also being able to teleport back in case you went the “wrong” way) more enjoyable than the uncertainty I felt when playing the first Dark Souls. 
[*]For those who don’t know, inter-player interactions play a large role in the Dark Souls series. You can leave notes (to either help or trick others), you can summon other players for a co-op experience, and you can invade other people’s worlds for PVP. I think this is another reason why the Dark Souls community holds strong - despite being portrayed as a single player game, you are rarely alone. I found that the online features (co-op and PVP) worked very well most of the time. Naturally, there are some instances of lag or disconnection, but it is very easy to set up again. Initially I hated being invaded, but I’ve learned to love it for two reasons: 
[olist]
[*]The excitement/fear you get from being invaded is intense. It is like a sudden emergence of a mini-boss whose only purpose is to hunt you down. While the defeats are definitely sour, victories are so damn sweet. 
[*]All the pain you receive from getting invaded can be repaid by invading other people. It’s a sort of S&M relationship, I know, but it adds near-infinite extra hours of excitement and replayability to Dark Souls 3.
[/olist]
[/list]
 
[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*]I’m kind of torn about this following point. On one hand, I still find that Dark Souls 3 is not very beginner friendly. More specifically, I had to look up some basic guides before starting the game to understand which stats do what, and what sort of build I should go for. A lot of information, for example stat soft-caps, is not particularly clear to begin with. I find that this steep learning curve, in addition to Dark Souls’ notoriety for being difficult, pushes a lot of beginners away. On the other hand, the Dark Souls series has come a long way, 3 being the most user-friendly and clear game in my experience. After playing it, I realized that I could have easily learned how to build my character through a little trial and error. Granted, my character would not be perfect, but like many veterans say: “no point in Vigor is wasted”. Dark Souls is the kind of game that expects you to pour countless hours in to before you “git gud”, such that a veteran with awful equipment will almost always beat a beginner with God-tier equipment. It should be emphasized that [b]YOU ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE MISTAKES[/b]; the complexity of Dark Souls 3 is exactly what makes it so spectacular. 
I was honestly hesitant to begin playing Dark Souls 3, but it has quickly become one of the greatest gaming experiences I’ve ever had. If you are on the fence, I urge you to give Dark Souls 3 a try. Be patient, learn from your mistakes, and don’t give up - only then will you prosper and praise the sun. 
NOTE: I’m not complaining about combat/mechanics difficulty - while challenging, I honestly believe that the death/learn-from-your-mistakes system is the number one selling point of the whole series.

Your friends will explain things to you, using words like, ""Estus shard"" and ""Praise the sun"" and it won't make sense. You'll give up after dying repeatedly on the tutorial boss only to finally kill it and then die to a dog that scares you into falling off of a cliff. 

Three months later, your friends will convince you to play again. You try it out, only to fail yet again. This time though, you understand that's part of the process, just as your friends had reassured you. You'll roll. You'll roll again, then again. You've done it! The dog that once scared you into jumping off a cliff is dead and you've miraculously taken no damage. Renewed vigor fills you and you continue on. This time you ignore your friends, resorting to the wiki to answer your questions and your own curiosity to guide you to treasure. Suddenly things begin to make sense. You go to bed.

You wake up with this incessent urge to play again, oddly intrigued by the story even though you're ""not that type of gamer"". ""Why do I enjoy this?"" You'll ask yourself. Soon, you're rolling in real life, to dodge your responsibilities solely to play this game.

Long Version
As someone who has enjoyed the Dark Souls series thoroughly, I feel that Dark Souls 3 has fixed many control issues apparent in previous installments. The combat feels active, rewarding proper timing and enemy management, whilst punishing rushing into battle without a plan and carelessly swinging your blade around. Enemies are placed strategically across the levels, neatly tieing in with their surroundings and backstories. It feels like all of them have a reason to be where they are. Surroundings are interesting, and tell their own little part of the story.

The bosses are their own kind of combat. Whilst in the levels themself the challenge is in enemy management, and level exploration. The bosses give you a one on one (usually) death battle, where careful dodging and reading your enemy's movement is key to surviving the encounter. They are larger, stronger and faster then any other enemy in the game, and are not to be taken lightly. Defeating these formidable foes is quite the challenge, and also very satisfying. 

About the story: you will have to look for it. Although DS3 doesnt hide its story as much as the previous titles, Item descriptions, surroundings and NPC dialogue are essential to finding out what exactly is going on in lothric. Finding all these tidbits of lore makes it exciting to find new weapons and/or items, aside from their obvious use. 

The singleplayer aspect is fun enough on its own, but the multiplayer aspect makes it whole. being able to summon both strangers and friends to aid you in your journey makes each journey different. Naturally, recieving more aid makes the enemies tougher, along with other risks, like multiple invaders. the arena is always full with people at almost any level, providing unlimited entertainment as players duke it out 1 on 1, or in teams.

All in all, its a experience that changes from person to person. with bountiful amounts of weapons to choose from, and more armor than one sane person could collect. theres endless combinations of character builds at your disposal. knights, mages,  pyromancers and clerics, and combinations in all forms. 

Ive ran through the entire game over 60 times at this point, finding new secrets and tidbits of story still. and with PVP being one of the most entertaining things i have ever come across. The enemies, story, soundtrack and scenery are a joy to return to whenever i launch this game.


(continue here for roundup)
Basically, if youve played the first two games, youll find a familliar yet refreshing style of gameplay before your eyes
If DS3 is your first dark souls, Youll find a easy to learn, difficult to master game that will keep you busy for quite some time.

Overall, I think this is my favorite game in my entire library.","Very Positive94% of the 238,336 user reviews for this game are positive.",dark soul iii managed 1500 hour short version pro engaging beautiful scenery soundtrack ton replayability varied pvp stranger friend co overpowered stranger friend past pesky dog meme not_give conniption con connectivity issue fighting stranger requires patience determination not_for easily angered difficulty turnoff enjoy casually toned game greatshield great magic weapon pvp skip bottom roundup long version someone enjoyed dark soul series thoroughly dark soul 3 fixed control issue apparent previous installment combat feel active rewarding proper timing enemy management whilst punishing rushing battle plan carelessly swinging blade enemy placed strategically across level neatly tieing surroundings backstories feel surroundings interesting tell boss kind combat whilst level themself challenge enemy management exploration boss on_emphasizede usually death battle careful dodging reading enemy movement key surviving encounter larger stronger faster enemy not_to taken lightly defeating formidable foe challenge satisfying look ds3 doesnt hide previous title description surroundings non dialogue essential finding exactly lothric finding tidbit lore make exciting weapon item aside obvious singleplayer aspect fun multiplayer aspect make able summon stranger friend aid journey make journey different naturally recieving aid make enemy tougher along risk multiple invader arena providing unlimited entertainment player duke 1 1 team change bountiful amount weapon choose armor sane collect there endless combination build disposal knight mages pyromancer cleric combination form ive ran entire 60 time finding secret tidbit pvp entertaining thing across enemy soundtrack scenery joy return whenever launch continue roundup basically youve game youll familliar refreshing style eye ds3 dark soul youll easy learn difficult master busy favorite entire library

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"After spending considerable time immersed in ""Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"" I've found it to be an exemplary piece of interactive storytelling. The narrative is exceptional and is both engaging and profound. The attention to world-building is remarkable, providing a depth that captivates from the onset.

My primary critique centers around the game's combat mechanics, which feel somewhat disjointed and in need of further polishing. Specifically, the timing for parries is challenging to master, and there appears to be inconsistency with the activation of certain combo inputs, leading to moments of frustration. Additionally, I would have favored a gameplay design that focused on controlling a single protagonist, with the other character serving as an AI companion, reminiscent of the dynamic seen in ""God of War."" This, I believe, would have offered a more streamlined and focused gameplay experience.

Visually, the game ranges from satisfactory to stunning. The developers have clearly dedicated a great deal of effort into the presentation of cutscenes, which are both immersive and beautifully crafted, drawing the player deeper into the game's narrative. However, the sound design presents a mixed bag. While it can be exceptionally immersive, particularly in environmental storytelling and key narrative moments, it falls short in combat scenarios. This inconsistency occasionally detracts from the overall experience, leaving engagements feeling somewhat underwhelming. Additionally, the game's musical score shines brilliantly during certain scenes, such as the poignant moment the protagonist finds themselves awakening on a beach. Yet, outside these highlights, the soundtrack tends to fade into the background, marred further by a noticeable looping issue post-release, where at least one track abruptly stops and restarts at inappropriate times.

The Foley work, especially in terms of character movement and during cutscenes, stands out as a highlight for me, showcasing a meticulous attention to detail. Voice acting within the game is varied, with the majority delivering exceptional performances that enhance the narrative's impact.

It's evident that the development team drew inspiration from the ""Witcher"" series, as seen in the game's animations, user interface, and overall feel of the game. Despite these similarities, ""Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden"" secures its place among my favorite games, primarily due to its superb writing and atmospheric depth.

I feel like it is flying under most people's radar and it is a shame!
it is a well written, very much story driven 3rd person RPG. combine it with combat that is simple but effective. it is mixing the souls-like light- and heavy-attacks as well as block, parry and dodge with some supernatural skills and it gets more interesting and effective when you combine those.
of course it might be repetetive after a longer time, but I'm around 12 hours in and the charme, atmosphere and pleasing graphics and mostly excellent voice acting really keep me enjoying Banishers more than I had expected.

· ... pretty solid performance
· fairly huge world consisting of semi open world segments with hub-areas to connect them
· enjoyable writing and...
· ...surprisingly great voice acting

[h1] Written Review [/h1]
Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, is a narrative action game from the devs behind Life is Strange.
You play as a couple of lovers and Banishers, Red and Antea, who have been tasked with uncovering the mystery behind a paranormal curse that plagues the land of New Eden. The situation is worse than they thought, and Antea loses her life as a result, coming back as a ghost, the thing she swore to banish from the land of the living.

[h2] Narrative [/h2]
The strongest aspect of the game for me, was its narrative. As Banishers, you continue to solve hauntings throughout the land, piecing together clues found at the scene of the crime, talking to culprits, ghosts, and watching moments from the past. For the most part, solving a mystery is a linear experience. It isn't like LA Noire where you can piece it together wrong, and accuse someone innocent, but that wasn't a problem for me, as every case was super interesting, and presents a tough choice at the end.

Solving hauntings for other people also has an effect on Antea's fate. You see, at the end of a typical case, you can for example, help a possessed villager by violently banishing the ghost that haunted them. However, by digging through their history, you might understand why the ghost did what it did, and choose to peacefully help it ascend from the realm of the living. There is also a third option though...

You can cast a ""blame"" ritual that kills and absorbs the life essence from the living target, with the aim of bringing Antea back to life eventually.

The choice isn't easy, as cases are usually quite complicated without a clear victim. That is the main problem you have to juggle throughout the game, which I found very intriguing. I even thoroughly enjoyed the side-quests in the game, and found them to be worth my time for the most part. All of this is heightened by the fantastic voice actors, and likeable personalities of the cast.

Banishers isn't purely a narrative game though, so let's talk about the gameplay too.

[h2] Combat [/h2]
Combat is really fun. Red uses a sword with a light and heavy attack. It can also parry, and he has a rifle for longer range combat. Antea can utilize powerful spells, and avoid permanent health damage. You are encouraged to switch back and forth during combat, as they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Antea deals more damage to possessed bodies. However, when she attacks, her spirit bar drains. In order to refill that, Red needs to deal damage. 
The constant juggle back and forth feels super fun, especially when you pair it with interesting talents and equipment that further reward certain playstyles. It's great that your talents aren't locked in, and you can freely move your selections around on the go to try new playstyles. Unfortunately, upgrading gear doesn't have that same freedom, so I found myself a bit scared to commit to upgrading certain items in fear that I'd just find something else I liked and wasted my materials. Another minor gripe I had, was that many of the attributes attached to equipment, and what they do are not explained.


[h2] Exploration [/h2]
Navigating the environment is quite restricted, however through enough exploration you can unlock shortcuts. The maps have a metroidvania-esque feeling to them, as you retread a lot of your steps after obtaining new abilities in order to access new places with hidden loot.

I'm normally someone who likes to fully explore and collect everything, which I did here too, and enjoyed for the most part, however there were times where I found the backtracking to be a bit tedious. You can only fast travel from one camp to another, you might not always have the materials you need to start a side-task, and so on. But for the most part, I had fun with it.

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
Overall though, I really loved playing through the game, as I enjoyed the characters and world. In my opinion, it's biggest strength by far is the interesting narrative. The combat is really fun, but I would only recommend the game to someone that is intrigued by the premise of ghost-mystery solving and dealing with moral dilemmas, which in my opinion, Banishers does incredibly well!

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"Early Review:
This is my early impressions of the game.  I came into this game with high expectations based upon what I had seen and heard regarding the game.
I have to say my expectations thus far have been exceeded in every way.
The main protagonists are so likable and the voice acting is top notch.  The game is absolutely gorgeous and a major step forward from the developers last game Vampyr, which I also loved.
The game has very unique combat and abilities, in which you can change between the characters in the middle of combat, and it works so well.  I love the choices and consequences type story games which this game very much is.
I find myself not wanting to stop playing because I really want to see what comes next in the story.  The story is so engaging that I have been invested right from the start.  There are some extremely tough choices even early in game and I cannot wait to see what happens in this story.
I will also replay to see other endings once I finish this first play through.
This game runs smooth as butter and that in itself is so rare in new games.  I am actually very pleasantly surprised to have graphics maxed out and have it run so good.
This absolutely is worth every penny paid and everyone should experience this gem.
Right now this game is best game I played in long time.
I will update once I finish the game but wanted to get this early impression out because I really feel this game is worth supporting the developer.
Update:
I am about 20 hours in the game at this point and wow the game is very huge.  The map opens up and there are unique areas and places to go and explore.  There are Elite enemies as well as repeatable bosses I have found so far.  The story also progresses as you discover new areas to explore.
I am still very engaged in the story and am having so much fun.  The combat also evolves as you gain more talents that not only open new areas but also can be used in combat for variation.
I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who loves action RPGs with choices  that are very difficult to make and I feel will ultimately have repercussions by the end of the game.
There are no microtransactions.   This is a complete game that is very engaging and I really feel that these developers should be supported for creating a great game and not trying to add in things to make extra money.  These rare developers should always be supported because if we do not support them, then we are only stuck with what we have been getting from the AAA gaming big developers lately which many are not worth supporting.
I will sum up this review once the game is finished but after 20 hrs I highly recommend this game.  10/10 for me so far.

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"Although I particularly liked the first season of Life is Strange at the time, and I absolutely adored Vampyr, I still think that the Don't Nod development team has now reached the peak of their career with Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden. 
The oppressive milieu that breaks into us every step of the way, the meticulously constructed world, the exciting and rather twisty stories told by interesting characters, and the amazingly enjoyable combat system resulted in such a great game that we even forgive the slightly half-baked graphic solutions without saying a word, because the the experience it delivers is simply sumptuous. 
Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith's adventure full of grief and sadness inhales you with playful lightness, only to let us go home tens of hours later, mentally exhausted and teary-eyed, to our own terrible reality. 
And the fact that, in exchange for all this, the publisher Focus Entertainment only asks for 50 euros at the box office, that is, nowhere near the full price of 70 euros, which has become standard these days, more than exhausts the concept of the kind of pleasant surprise that simply cannot and should not be resisted.",Very Positive88% of the 563 user reviews for this game are positive.,particularly liked season life strange adored vampyr nod development reached peak career banishers ghost eden oppressive milieu break meticulously constructed world exciting rather twisty story told interesting character amazingly enjoyable combat resulted great forgive slightly half baked graphic solution saying word the_emphasized delivers simply sumptuous antea duarte red mac raith adventure grief sadness inhales playful lightness home ten hour mentally exhausted teary eyed terrible reality exchange publisher focus entertainment asks 50 euro box office nowhere near price 70 euro standard day exhaust concept kind pleasant surprise simply cannot_and not_be resisted

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"[quote][h1]Video review: https://youtu.be/fZYGoqzz3lM
Written review below![/h1][/quote]

Banishers is basically what you would get if you took God of War and gave it a little bit of the Sherlock Holmes treatment. It’s an interesting combo that has both its pros and cons.

[b]Note: Trimmed to fit Steam, check video for full version![/b]

[h2]Combat[/h2]
Overall, the combat is pretty good. Hits have weight behind them, there’s a few different weapon types to mix and match mid-fight, the movement feels fluid, dodging, parrying, and blocking are responsive, and there’s an entire skill tree with new moves and such to add even more flavor. For not being the focus of the experience, the studio did a pretty good job making the combat fun to play.

That said, it really suffers with its enemy variety. It gets kinda boring fighting the same type of ghosts over and over throughout the game, especially since the only visual difference between most of them is their color. The boss fights are cool, but there aren’t enough of them to break up the otherwise monotonous enemies.

[h2]Exploration & Level Design[/h2]
Exploration is also a big part of the experience and something Banishers does well. The level design in particular is solid. You have this large map to explore complete with branching paths, plenty of side objectives, towns with people to get to know, beautiful scenery, and I am just kinda a sucker for medieval/fantasy infused aesthetics and the world here in Banishers absolutely nails that.

One thing I really was not a fan of was the whole crafting/upgrading element. It reminded me of games like A Plague Tale or even God of War, where it’s just kinda tacked on to the experience and there to give you an excuse to wander around more to find more grass, stone, and other random material to collect for future upgrades. That aspect was not really fleshed out and came across as tedious as a result.

[h2]Story[/h2]
I liked the overarching plot. Two banishers - basically ghost hunters or paranormal investigators - traveling around solving cases and ultimately trying to decide the fate of Antea, your partner who herself is a ghost. It’s a great set up to tie together the rest of the game, which ultimately comes across as episodic.

That can be good or bad depending on the person. You have this goal of reaching New Eden - the town where your partner died - but must stop along the way to assist with cases that ultimately have no relation to the rest of the plot. Some of these cases are genuinely interesting, some are bad, but most are just okay. You’ll get one that dives into a couple characters and raises some great questions about topics like death, relationships, and what it takes to survive in the world, and then one that has a very predictable and boring twist with surface-level characters.

I would say for the most part, the cases are interesting, but there are quite a lot that just aren’t and you’re forced to go through them to progress anyways. Oftentimes the only relation they have to the main story is the decision you make at the very end when deciding who is to blame in a specific case. Your choices there ultimately decide the fate of your ghost partner, but I feel like the game could have done a bit more in making the rest of the story feel more than just episodic mini-stories.

[h2]Length & Replayability[/h2]
The entire thing takes about 20-25 hours to clear, so it is rather lengthy, but I can’t say I see myself replaying this one to make different choices purely because the individual cases themselves - given I already know the outcome - would just be a slog. 

[h2]Graphics, Music, & Performance[/h2]
Character designs are solid, the environments are detailed, the lighting is well-done, and the soundtrack is alright too. Performance-wise, I was unable to run the game natively at 4k 144fps medium-high settings on my 3080 Ti and ended up having to enable DLSS to compensate. After that though, no issues aside from the occasional funky animation bug.

[h2]Overall[/h2]
I would give Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden a light recommendation. It does many things well, such as the combat, the exploration, and the narrative too, but I can’t say that any single one of these is anything more than just “good”. The combat has issues with how repetitive it can be, the narrative is hit or miss due to the episodic nature of the game loop, and the whole crafting/upgrading system just felt shallow. That said, you do get some really interesting cases, characters, and the boss fights are really cool too. I’m glad I played it, but would only recommend it on sale or in a bundle.

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"First off, this game is surprisingly HUGE!!! It's as AAA as AA can get without actually being AAA. 
The day 1 experience is perfect. No bugs. Great performance. Looks great. 
It has DLSS 3 + HDD support + Frame Generation + Nvidia Boost.  No HDR but apart from that, all AAA features you can expect.
I can recommend for the originality factor of the premise and setting although the setting lacks heavily in identity. For example you know how in God of War you pass though some linear dungeons to get to the next landmark? Well the world here mostly looks like these landmarkless dungeons but without the nordic motif. It's not bad, it's just unremarkable. But it's not a deadly sin.
Also of special note is its Dark Souls quality of having a huge connected map in which usually if you can see something in the distance, you can reach it at some point. Altough it's a bit stingy with landmarks. 
It has enough freshness and heart to be easily recommendable especially for the asking price. 

Now... Is it better than its predecessor ""Vampyr""? Yes, in some regards. Is it worse in some regards? Yes. I would say the most important aspect is the world and the setting of Vampyr was a bit more unique as both context and looks.

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"I love the ""7/10"" games that do interesting things despite some rough edges and this is one of those that deserved to be a classic.

It takes a lot of the elements of their earlier game Vampyr and remixes them into a more open structure. Great writing and voice acting. Not the most impressive technically - though it's been smooth and stable - but the art direction is strong and the sense of atmosphere is amazing. Combat is fine, I can see it getting a repetitive over the course of the game, though upgrades and items might ease that frustration.

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"This is a provisional recommendation.

If you're in it for the atmosphere and theme, then yes. You take on the role of an exorcist who banishes evil spirits and investigates hauntings. Once you learn why someone is haunted, you get to choose how to resolve the haunting. Banish the ghost to oblivion, use the knowledge you learned to help it cross over, or outright kill the person the ghost is fixated on because they're usually some kind of a dick who's being haunted for a good reason.

If you're looking for solid gameplay, this doesn't really provide. The combat isn't anything special and most enemies are either a minor speed bump or a brick wall of hit points that take forever to kill. The gear progression is slow and requires you to reset areas and enemies if you want to grind it out faster. It ends up being a lot of running in circles.

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"I'll start with a question: What is art? No, really, what is it? It's subjective, right? Nothing is objectively good or bad, so-called ""masterpieces"" are nothing more than common consensus, love is just a chemical reaction, God is dead. Right? *Right?*

Wrong, and you're a fool for ever suggesting otherwise. *I* decide what art is, *I* am the arbiter of quality, and like a child expectantly awaits the will of the father, *you* are the audience to my judgment. 

Overall, 13 hours in, I give Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden a 8.5/10. I've seen a lot of people hedging and giving very safe, lukewarm assessments: 7/10s, 6.5/10s, ""great writing but bad combat"", etc.

The reality is, despite its imperfections, it is simply *incorrect* to place this game in the same tier as other 7/10s. What is on offer here, what the game does well, what it brings to the table far and away exceeds its ""slightly better than mediocre"" brethren. I want to set the record straight. The world-building, the narrative, the pacing, the prose, the voice performances--all of the *non-gameplay-specific elements* are, unbelievably, best-in-class. We're not talking Greedfall or Elex (no shade on either of these--i love eurojank) or Dying Light (still not throwing shade, just giving examples of 7/10s). We're talking The Witcher 3, God of War, A Plague Tale (Innocence or Requiem). No exaggeration. The story that is being told here and the panache and proficiency and heart with which it is told is The Real Deal^tm. 

Okay, so what about the gameplay? What about the mediocre combat? Sure, it has good talky-talky word bits, but how are we expected to care about things like ""plot"" and ""characters"" without that sweet vidya dopamine? Good questions. Combat IS a 7/10. It's good. It's serviceable. It's better than Nu-Assassin's Creed, it's worse than Sekiro and God of War. That's really all you have to know. It's good. It has decent animations, decent hitboxes, and overall doesn't commit any major sins. You'll be fine. 

But maybe you can see how the maths aren't mathing? The game executes SO many things at SUCH a high-level, and then its greatest flaw is that its combat isn't as good as some of the most genre-defining, most universally GOATed titles, and yet somehow that is enough to bring the sum of its parts down to a 7/10? That makes no sense.

Graphics are adequate and atmosphere shines.

Gameplay is a mixed bag. The combat is somewhat rudimentary and, while I enjoyed investigating hauntings, I was more motivated by the stories than collecting clues.

1493640,Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,"Currently, I'm about 2 hours into the game and this far I can say, it's amazing. I might update my review when I'm further in or if I have finished it. We'll see.

What I can say about it so far?

The game picks up the pace rather slowly. It's a story driven game and is more about talking to the people and listening to what they have to say. The investigation part is not specifically mention worth, you get guided a lot to the next clue one by one. You don't have to put any effort in solving a riddle or something like that. You enter an area of investigation and then look around, but mostly the quest markers guide you, to where you find the next clue. That's a little disappointing so far, but since those were only the first cases and they still seem to be a part of the tutorial, I hope they will become more of a challenge.

The fighting is simple, but fun. You can dodge, parry and riposte, but it's not like a souls game. You can heal by flasks mid fight and it's mostly about avoiding damage and choosing the right kind of attack at the right timing, but it's pretty forgiving. When there are enough enemies around you, you get indications when an attack is about to hit. If you are in the middle of a combo, it's hard to deal with an attack. So again, it's all about timing and best not to let the enemies circle you.

The levels are rather narrow but you can explore a little bit and gather ressources. It's not an open world game so far and I'm glad about that. But there is a quick travel system and a little bit of metroidvanian, since some paths will open up later, when you gained some new abilties. There is a skill tree that opens up when you keep playing and by levelling up you can decide where to spend your skill points. Currently it's mostly about improving your combat abilties.

The resources you gather are for rituals and improving your gear. No crafting involved yet, but that might also be coming into play.

What the game really excels in is the story and atmosphere. It's dark and mysterious, the story is intruiging. I'm really curious how the story will play out and what impact my choices will have. But there are choices you have to make that seem very impactful forced upon you very early in the game. I'm wondering if I can go against my choices later or not. Even if the choices do result in different stories, I probably won't see this as a game that I will be replaying.

So should you buy the game? If you're in for a story driven game in a dark setting full of despair and some emotional plot points, mixed with a little bit of fighting, then the game is for you.",Very Positive88% of the 563 user reviews for this game are positive.,currently 2 hour far amazing finished far pick pace rather slowly driven talking listening investigation not_specifically mention worth guided next clue effort solving riddle enter investigation look mostly marker guide next clue disappointing far case tutorial hope challenge fighting simple fun dodge parry riposte not_like soul heal flask mid fight mostly avoiding damage choosing kind attack timing pretty forgiving enemy you_emphasized indication attack middle combo hard deal attack timing best not_to enemy circle level rather narrow explore bit gather ressources not_an open world far glad quick travel bit metroidvanian path open gained abilties skill tree open levelling decide spend skill point currently mostly improving combat abilties resource gather ritual improving gear no_crafting involved coming excels atmosphere dark mysterious intruiging curious impact choice choice impactful forced early wondering choice not_even choice result different story probably replaying driven dark despair emotional plot point mixed bit fighting

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"It has taken me several years to like and get into Crusader Kings 3. It's a complicated & intriguing game which always left me cold when my ruler died - as your precious realm is split apart by partition.

Recently I found a historical focused youtube series by 'Realm Builder Guy' (I highly recommend) who introduced me to the 'secret' of enjoying Crusader Kings:

[i]You are not there to build & defend a nation (a modern concept). Your role is to further your noble House influence and legacy, to bring stability and prosperity to your lands. CK3 is about Dynasty, not empire.[/i]

When I stopped trying to power-game the system, stopped frantically acquiring territory in a race to make a larger Kingdom, stopped making stress decisions 'out-of-character' for an advantage, the game started to click with me. Instead of jumping in trying to manage an entire Kingdom, I chose a humble English Earl in 1066 and spent 40 years tending to my family, my faith and the needs of my people.  The Pope granted us several Duchies from the heathens in Wales and suddenly we were a Duke. I had rivals, friends and a benign King who I served faithfully. It was completely absorbing.  

So that's my main advice for new players; ignore the huge kingdoms and the Irish tutorial, play someone small and navigate that persons life. Don't sweat your realm splitting up on death, focus on the wider picture of your House glory and the long game becomes much more compelling. 

- Signed, your faithful servant Duke Cato of Powys, Defender of the Faith and Guardian of Warwick.","Very Positive92% of the 66,890 user reviews for this game are positive.",taken year crusader king 3 complicated intriguing left cold ruler died precious realm split apart partition recently found historical focused youtube series realm builder guy highly recommend introduced secret enjoying crusader king not_there build defend nation modern concept role noble house influence legacy bring stability prosperity land ck3 dynasty not_empire stopped trying power stopped frantically acquiring territory race larger kingdom stopped stress decision advantage started click jumping trying manage entire kingdom chose humble english earl 1066 spent 40 year tending family faith need pope granted duchy heathen wale suddenly we_emphasizedre duke rival friend benign king served faithfully completely absorbing advice player ignore huge kingdom irish tutorial someone small navigate person life sweat realm splitting death focus wider picture house glory long compelling signed faithful servant duke cato powys defender faith guardian warwick
1158310,Crusader Kings III,"The year is 1176. I am playing as Alberto, King of Italy and Tuscany, and holder of many other titles. Events are progressing well. I am well on my way to my ultimate goal of creating the Empire of Italia, bringing Italy, Corsica, Sardinia and Croatia under my heel. As Alberto I have used my stewardship ability to build up the power of my realm to rival the Papacy, my next target. I fully intend to pass on a legacy to my son and heir, Sinibaldo, a promising child of many talents.

It was my occasional practice to grant titles to my children. This always carries the danger of them falling victim to some battlefield accident, but I sleep better knowing those titles are in the hands of close family. Sinibaldo has his own dukedom and is waging war on my vassal Duke Ugo, who is not a family member but who is a true asshole. The war does not go well for Sinibaldo and he becomes a prisoner of Duke Ugo. An unfortunate event, but surely he will simply be ransomed and we will all move on with our lives.

But several months later I get the shocking news: Sinibaldo has been executed! My only son, struck down at the tender age of 14 by the vile Duke Ugo--how can this be? I am enraged. In the heat of passion I move to revoke Duke Ugo's title, but he rises up in rebellion against me. The impudence! As I rally my troops the true extent of my mistake becomes clear--my other powerful vassals have also rebelled. With growing desperation I realize there is no path to victory. My last army is destroyed and I lose the war, my kingdoms stripped away, I am deposed.

I lean back in my chair and think about the rash idiocy of my actions. My son dead, my titles gone. I now have to play as my daughter and heir Benedetta, an eleven year old girl. It is time, I think, to pull the plug on this game.

But what of Duke Ugo? Can he be allowed to go on, after the vile murder of my son? No, I must bend every effort to see him brought down. And so I forge on.

As Alberto I had paid little attention to my daughter. Her guardian was some knight or other, and under her tutelage she had become rowdy, a warrior in a world of men who would never accept her as an equal. This, I thought, did not bode well.

As Benedetta my reign was immediately disturbed as the vassals of Tuscany formed a faction to remove me as Queen. But wait, this faction wanted to install a new king in place, none other than my own father, Alberto! I suddenly realized that as his only child, unless he fathered another male heir I would inherit his titles upon his death and once again the kingdoms of Italy and Tuscany would be part of the same realm. And so when the faction presented its demands I simply capitulated. Alberto was now King of Tuscany and I was Queen of Italy.

Yet my power was still not enough to challenge the evil Duke Ugo. To keep him close I appointed him my steward, but I also sent my spymaster to dig up dirt in his court.

Years passed. I got married, had children, quashed several rebellions, organized my realm and bided my time. When a Crusade was launched I led my troops against the infidels attacking my cousin King Mario of Jerusalem, returning in triumph and finally impressing even the most retrograde of my male vassals. The waifish eleven year old girl had become a warrior Queen.

But Ugo continued to plague me. As my steward he was often in my presence, always there to remind me of his evil treachery. I hosted a feast and there he was again, even trying to strike up a friendship! I coldly refused him, and he became my rival. The stress of dealing with him was almost unbearable.

And then the miracle--my expert spymaster had uncovered gold. Duke Ugo was a deviant!

This changed everything. I now had the key to bringing down my brother's murderer. But it must be done carefully--Ugo was still powerful, and I could not take him down as long as he and the other vassals of my realm opposed me. So I only blackmailed him, getting a strong hook that I would use to ensure his loyalty while I consolidated my position.

In 1211 I received news of my father's death. After the messenger left my chambers, I went to the family shrine and knelt in prayer, vowing to my father's spirit that his son, my brother, would finally be avenged.

More years passed. As both kingdoms were now mine, I slowly amassed enough gold and troops to take on my entire realm. A careful campaign of pacification had made my vassals compliant.

It is the year 1218, and time to put my plan into action. I expose Duke Ugo's deviancy. He is now a criminal. As my father did twenty years before, I revoke his title, and again, he rises up in rebellion, but this time no one will stand with him. My troops outnumber his four to one. With laughable ease I storm his palace and win victory. My knights drag him out and throw him down in the mud before me.

I arrest him and throw him in the dungeon. I revoke all of his titles and grant them to a distant toddler cousin. Years of emotional stress are wiped away in an instant--Ugo, my rival, murderer of my brother is now mine to do with as I will. Shall I torture him? Execute him? Shall I simply leave him there to rot in filth and misery? I ponder this choice, and the sweetness of vengeance.","Very Positive92% of the 66,890 user reviews for this game are positive.",1176 alberto king italy tuscany holder title event progressing ultimate goal creating empire italia bringing italy corsica sardinia croatia heel alberto stewardship build power realm rival papacy next target fully intend pas legacy son heir sinibaldo promising child talent occasional practice grant title child carry danger falling victim battlefield accident sleep knowing title hand close family sinibaldo dukedom waging war vassal duke ugo not_a family member true asshole war not_go sinibaldo prisoner duke ugo unfortunate event surely simply ransomed move life month shocking news sinibaldo executed son struck tender age 14 vile duke ugo enraged heat passion move revoke duke ugo title rise rebellion impudence rally troop true extent mistake clear powerful vassal rebelled growing desperation realize no_path victory last army destroyed lose war kingdom stripped deposed lean chair rash idiocy action son dead title daughter heir benedetta eleven old girl pull plug duke ugo allowed vile murder son no_i bend effort brought forge alberto paid attention daughter guardian knight tutelage rowdy warrior world men never_accept equal thought not_bode benedetta reign immediately disturbed vassal tuscany formed faction remove queen wait faction wanted install king father alberto suddenly realized child unless fathered male heir inherit title death kingdom italy tuscany realm faction presented demand simply capitulated alberto king tuscany queen italy power not_enough challenge evil duke ugo close appointed steward sent spymaster dig dirt court year passed married child quashed rebellion organized realm bided crusade launched led troop infidel attacking cousin king mario jerusalem returning triumph finally impressing retrograde male vassal waifish eleven old girl warrior queen ugo continued plague steward presence remind evil treachery hosted feast trying strike friendship coldly refused became rival stress dealing unbearable miracle expert spymaster uncovered gold duke ugo deviant changed key bringing brother murderer carefully ugo powerful not_take long vassal realm opposed blackmailed strong hook ensure loyalty consolidated position 1211 received news father death messenger left chamber family shrine knelt prayer vowing father s_emphasizedpirit son brother finally avenged year passed kingdom mine slowly amassed gold troop entire realm careful campaign pacification vassal compliant 1218 plan action expose duke ugo deviancy criminal father twenty year revoke title rise rebellion no_one stand troop outnumber four laughable ease storm palace win victory knight drag throw mud arrest throw dungeon revoke title grant distant toddler cousin year emotional stress wiped instant ugo rival murderer brother mine shall torture execute shall simply leave rot filth misery ponder choice sweetness vengeance

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"Coming into CK3 as a longtime CK2 and EUIV player, I was slightly concerned about the content and playability of CK3. After all, CK2 in its initial stage was very limited, and it was through the course of very many DLCs that fleshed out CK2 to what it is today. CK3, being brand new, and (rightfully) with no expansions, felt like it would be in danger of being a pale imitation of its predecessor. 

However, now with over 40 hours in CK3, I can safely say this game lives up to everything that CK2 brought to the field and more! The UI is much, much more intuitive and new player-friendly. Furthermore, content that was added over a long period of time through expansions/DLCs like India and Tibet are in the game right off the bat and immediately playable! There are also many new, welcome mechanics, at least for people like me who like to roleplay their dynastic legacies or 'jump ship' so as to speak. Let me explain!

To start myself off in CK3, I decided to go with an old favourite, the Magyars. Leading the fore as Almos, I led the Magyars to migrate into the Carpathian Basin, snatching it from Bulgaria. Following this, I attempted to conquer enough lands to reform the Taltoist faith, but combined pressure from the Carolingian Kingdoms and the Byzantine Empire led to the death of Almos and poured cold water over my dreams of reformed Taltoism. As Almos's son, Arpad, I turned Catholic, and used 'holy war' as an excuse to conquer all my heathen neighbours despite being pagan just years ago. With Hungary formed and its borders secure, Arpad finally passes on. As the 3rd-generation King Szonuk, I noticed Bavaria was no longer in the hands of the Karlings, thereby breaking their tripartite alliance. I bide my time, building prestige, formed alliances with West Francia and the Byzantine Empire, and proceeded to invade and conquer Bavaria, creating the Austro-Hungarian Empire centuries before its supposed to exist. 

As Szonuk dies and my 4th-generation Arpad II takes the throne, I notice I am, in fact, able to claim the West Francian throne for my mother. So I invade my former allies without further ado and put dear mum on the throne. As my mother passes on and the throne of West Francia comes to my greedy little hands, the Austro-Hungarian Empire has surpassed even Charlemagne, and stretches from France to Hungary. My son, Szonuk II, through careful eugenics, is a genius, and my grandson, Arpad III, a HERCULEAN genius! Nothing can stand in our way now!

But wait. A killer roams the castle. I am shocked and horrified to discover my herculean genius grandson dead. Dead before he even has a chance to fulfil his glorious legacy. I vow to find the killer myself. Clearly, it must be a Karling loyalist, or maybe even a Byzantine spy trying to undermine my power. As I investigate, I get ever closer to the truth... and then receive a letter, from none other than the killer! The killer says they have been living under my nose this whole time, and that the truth will only bring me pain. I push on nonetheless... I must know the truth! And when I confront the killer... its...

... My son, Szonuk II! 

Why?! How?! it's your own son! My grandson! 

I am aggrieved. I disinherit him and put him in jail immediately. My successor changes to one of my other, more virtuous, less kinslayer-inclined sons. As I ponder what to do with my insane genius kinslayer of a son, the Pope's messenger arrives. A crusade, he declares, is to be launched into Jerusalem. Being the pious Emperor that I am, I of course, agree. To my surprise, my son qualifies as a beneficiary of the crusade, due to being disinherited. Hm. So be it. I free him from jail, force my son to be in the frontlines as a knight, and send him off to lead the imperial armies and hopefully die a virtuous death despite living as a sinner. 

The crusade against the Abbasids goes swimmingly. Too swimmingly. In a twist of fate, my sinful son becomes monarch of the holiest kingdom, Jerusalem itself. Well. So be it. He'll probably die defending the holy city once the Abbasids recover and launch their counter-assault. I have no inclination to help him. So, I click past the notifications, and...

... I accidentally click ""I wonder what kind of King he'll be?"" 

And now all of a sudden I'm the kinslaying villain disinherited by the Emperor, and sent to be king of a forsaken holy kingdom that i have no chance of holding. With a single demesne, with all my vassals and everybody in my family hating me because I'm a kinslaying nutjob. FFFFF-

Just as I consider ragequitting, I figure... Hang on, this might be the most interesting character to roleplay as yet. A kinslaying, lunatic-genius exiled from home and sent to die fighting for the cross to atone for himself. 

So I lean into it. I become the most insanely fanatical holy king ever. My first order of business is to imprison and revoke the titles of all my vassals from the contributing houses of the crusade. Now my demesne is full and my coffers are slowly filling up. Then, I befriend the Byzantine Emperor, bribing him with huge amounts of gold, most of it given to me by the Pope despite my lunacy due to my renowned piety (thank you, Your Holiness!) and swaying him with my evil charisma. 

I see that he has three sons. I marry my daughter (thank god I didn't kill YOU too) to the youngest matrilineally. Now we have an alliance. With the aid of the Byzantines I survive in the land of the infidels, and slowly expand by absorbing the smaller Islamic emirates around me, never lifting a finger and simply burning prestige to let the Byzantines do their thing and wipe out my enemies. Following this, I systematically kill off the very helpful Emperor's older sons. The first murder goes unnoticed. The second, unfortunately, is traced back to me. The Byzantine Emperor is very understandably heartbroken and furious with me. So I assassinate him too. 

Now my son-in-law is Byzantine Emperor, and he hates me for killing off basically his entire direct family. Sure, understandable. I check my daughter and see she already has two sons born to our house. Cackling madly all the way and out of my mind with stress, I commit suicide. 

Now I am my daughter. Over the years, I watch as my husband drinks himself to death, leaving the Byzantine Empire to my oldest son, who I groom into another herculean genius. By the time I pass on and play as my son, the Herculean Genius, Hungarian Catholic, Byzantine Emperor and King of Jerusalem Szonuk III, I look to the west and see our ancestral legacy, instead of imploding like I thought, has remained intact, and blossomed towards England and Scandinavia as well. As I look at the sea of Arpadys covering the map, I vaguely realize I've recreated the Western and Eastern Roman Empires.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"After my main character, Emperor Illiya of Italy, a drunken fornicator and heretic, was assassinated while attending a ceremony, I switched to his grandson, Emperor Astore of Italy, who took to the throne at the age of 25. Astore was born of two white parents, yet suspiciously looked to be of partial African descent. Despite looking nothing like his ""father"", he still managed the Empire much better than his predecessor. His sister, Agostina, who also looked to be half-black, ruled the neighboring Empire of Francia. Because the realm split when Iliya died, they both had a strong claim on their respective empires. 

Despite this, they both considered each other great friends. And the comfort of this friendship helped Astore greatly after his firstborn son was mysteriously murdered. As an emperor, he was known to be extremely generous and kind. He helped put down many rebellions caused by his ""grandfather"", and restored much of the land which had previously been lost. By the time Astore was 75 years old, he had lived a long and content life. 

It all came crashing down, however, when an extremely old man offered to give Astore a secret in exchange for a favor. Expecting the secret to be some mundane thing, such as some man from India having slept with one of his courtiers, Astore reluctantly accepted the offer. However, the secret was nothing less than the true murderer of Astore's son: Agostina, his only sister, best friend, and faithful ally. 

Betrayed, Astore declared war on the 80 year old Agostina, shattering the alliance. The war waged for 4 years until she was eventually captured and executed.

If your Liege decides one of your titles better befits someone else, guess what happens.
If your spymaster is banging your wife, all the while plotting to kill you... something had to change!

The world in CK3 is a dirty, lying and vengeful place. Being nice, is not gonna cut it. You'll learn that quickly.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"In the year 931, my sister and lover was murdered by my friend and brother-in-law. He burnt her at the stake with my babe in her belly. He was a powerful man, my sister married well, his family spread far across Europe with many of his kin in the most influential houses of the developed world. 

I spent the next 350 years erasing everyone who shared his blood, starting with my niece and nephews. By the time I was done, his family was erased from history, lost to obscurity and time. All my focus and hatred had left my own family nothing more than a poor Duke, so heavily consumed by a hate he didn't understand that by the time it was all over he took his own life before he fathered an heir. Thus, I lost my own family to obscurity and time.

After gaining nothing and losing everything I pondered for a moment whether or not it was all worth it... 

The next day I started a new campaign this time I would play properly, I would get it right...

- Better roleplaying and story generation through a focus on key personality traits,

- the warfare aspect is much more in depth and allows for some spectacular specialization,

- the economy system actually makes you care about the lands your dynasty holds and you can actually play tall using it,

- the hooks, secrets and scheming system is simply outstanding and adds so many layers to the interactions, especially with friends in multiplayer,

- the Religion system with an ability to set tenets, doctrines, with faiths having interlocking interactions is the most complex implementation of religion in a Paradox game and allows for some truly unique playstyles (some things are not very realistic at game start, but they'll improve with patches)

- finally, the technology system is so incredibly improved over Crusader Kings 2, that it might be my favorite new feature in this game. The way it interacts with realm laws, warfare, economy, and with cultural / regional ideas, makes learning a viable path to specialize your family in through the midgame.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"I bought this game upon recommendation of a friend of mine. I never really played other Paradox titles before except for a little bit of Cities: Skylines. I'll be honest: I did not get this game at all when I first started. It felt overwhelming and I was sort of just clicking on things. I mostly started by playing with my friend so I could ask questions along the way. I had small victories here and there, but I still never truly understood the game.

One day I boot up the game and decide to give it another go. I won't lie—I was determined and did some prep. I watched a few CK3 YouTube videos before I embarked on this journey and read a little bit about strategy (seriously, shout out to [url=https://www.youtube.com/@SnapStrategy] Snap Strategy [/url] for turning this game into digestible content). I started out as a mere Duke and spent time to think before I made decisions. I thoroughly read the in-game pop-ups for words or phrases that I didn't understand. (The UI helps explain a concept if you just hover over the word with your cursor.) 

My Duke had a son, he became a King. Descendant after descendant, my realm's economy grew more and more. Eventually, I was able to successfully bribe anyone that stood in my way. Before I knew it, it was 3AM and I was elected Holy Roman Emperor due to my economic power, prestige, and bribery. With one click of a button, I revoked the election laws of the Holy Roman Empire. Yeah, I had some resistance from my important vassals and not so loyal subjects. These are problems that can be fixed with money or an excellent spymaster. I was at my peak. I worked my way from a lowly Duke to become the Holy Roman Emperor, flush with cash. Until I wasn't.

You see, as I alluded to earlier, you play as an individual ruler in this game—not an entire country or kingdom. When you die, you play as your heir. Well... if no one likes the heir, or if the heir is incompetent, then empires can crumble. This can sometimes be ""fixed"" by changing your succession laws, disinherison, or killing them (yes, killing your son/daughter—this game can be brutal). I had one son, took a gamble, and I died a little too soon. So be it. My empire crumbled because my heir was an idiot that nobody liked and neighboring conquests came knocking on my door. When it was all said and done, the Holy Roman Empire dissolved. I was broke, incompetent, inbred, had no allies, and owned a tiny tract of land hundreds of miles from my original realm. But holy hell what a fantastic ride it was straight to the top and a plummet to the bottom. 

I started to ""get it"" after that playthrough. The replay value is insane and I will be playing more. I really respect the hell out of this game. CK3 can be punishing, but oh man can it be so rewarding too. It will be overwhelming when you first start this game. It can also be a time commitment. But I absolutely recommend you give it a chance—or two—or three. Be curious, read stuff, and follow the game's advice when it tells you to do something.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"A great release by Paradox standards.
     The game builds off of everything CK2 accomplished, and feels complete and polished from day one. The improved graphics add a ton to the immersion, and the new mechanics add needed depth to gameplay systems. The writing is improved over CK2 and there seems to be way more events, both small and large, and everything is absurd as ever. Combat systems were redone and play much better in this game. The UI also feels much cleaner. It's as complex as it always has been, but that's what makes it great. This game is an improvement in pretty much every way, and I am not at all disappointed.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"I'm about 20 hours into this game, so I wanted to drop a quick First Impression:

BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.   Based on my perspective, CK3 is a more of a hybrid wargame/management system.  Like many of the CIV games, you have opportunities to build and improve provinces... and you can certainly raise military forces (I think strictly land-based; naval seems to be abstracted or nonexistent so far).  

But the builder/wargame aspect is only 50% of the game experience, and I estimate that liberally.  All of these things are tightly wrapped up in a decision-based management system that produces causes and effects; with some of the effects being far-reaching.

EXAMPLE: your head of clergy doesn't like you, so he accuses you of having an incestuous relationship.  You decide to Deny it.  He gets even madder.  One of your courtiers hears a rumor that the clergyman is plotting to kill your daughter.  So you secretly arrange for him to be murdered.  The neighboring Lord finds out through spies that you're responsible, so he blackmails you.  Even though you pay him off, his cousin, the Lord in the OTHER neighboring county decides you're weak and decides to lay claim to YOUR title... armies march, wars get fought, etc....

YES, this gets THAT complicated.  And the levels of all of these interactions get very deep and very complicated, like a spider web.

So far, I'm loving it (although to be frank, the ""new"" hasn't quite worn off yet).  The biggest advice I can give anyone thinking about buying CK3 is what I said up front:  Make Sure You Know What You're buying.

If you buy it looking for only a wargame, you'll be disappointed.  If you buy it only looking for an empire builder (like CIV), you'll be disappointed.

Respectfully submitted as my humble opinion; take it or leave it.","Very Positive92% of the 66,890 user reviews for this game are positive.",20 hour wanted drop quick impression aware based perspective ck3 hybrid wargame management civ game opportunity build improve province certainly raise military force strictly land based naval abstracted nonexistent far builder wargame aspect 50 estimate liberally thing tightly wrapped decision based management produce cause effect effect far reaching example head clergy accuses incestuous relationship decide deny get madder courtier hears rumor clergyman plotting kill daughter secretly arrange murdered neighboring lord find spy re_emphasizedsponsible blackmail pay cousin lord neighboring county decides weak decides lay claim title army march war fought yes get complicated level interaction deep complicated spider web far loving frank worn biggest advice buying ck3 front buying wargame disappointed empire builder civ disappointed respectfully submitted humble opinion leave

> sexing quick/ intelligent/ and amazonian dudes and babes and claiming throne of the strongest indian nation in early game (my liege)
>forced vassalized/subjugate the entire western/southern/central india/ nepal and tibet

> my culture was hindustani, and in the hindustani culture in this game, you're not able to grant titltes (give away providence lands) to your sons and daughters, the culture ditcates that you must share your land with your brothers and sisters no matter what (unless you try and murder them)
>because of this, god tier papa with the 5000+ presitge and 37 intelligence died and had nearly 9 kids that had to each inherit one of my titles, which resulted in the heir (my next character) getting the capital when papa died. the capital was the hotspot of the buboinic plague so literally every single one of my sons/daughters/brothers/sisters fking died either on the battlefield or due to the bubonic plague outbreak in my capital (my only county of residence). 
>after a year, all my children and siblings died except for one soul surviving heir (my grandson) who got the beubonic plague but recovered after finding myself a physician and plunging my tresury deeper into the hole at -1000. but sure fking enough, he died about a few minutes after I recieved the notification that the beubonic outbreak has ceased to exist in my empire.

Summary:
all memes aside, this game is something else. this is easily one of the best modern paradox games that they've produced. apart from all other paradox games, there is no late game superority where you're so strong that nothing can defeat you or destroy you. the game does not get easier just because you are the world super power regarding tech advantages/prestige/treasury ect, you simply have much more microing to do to ensure your longevity and your spot on the top. in this game, ironically, the bigger and stronger you become, the more vunerable you become.

It's great you guys are making money, but your reputation seems to have really tanked since you went public. If this were to increase compensation for the workers, that would be a different story. However, there's no way you'd leave that out for the good publicity if that were the case.

Then again, who cares about reputation so long as your shareholders get their short-term profits so they can eventually bail out and reinvest in their next victim once you've been taken for everything you're worth, right?

You can keep debasing your currency all you want, but you're eventually going to have to pay off that corruption or retire your campaign.

One of your moderators explained the reasoning as ""These changes are being made on a company wide level to keep up with the increase on all Flavor Packs and related content."" I'm reading that as you are raising your pricing because of the increase on your pricing. What an absolutely boneheaded excuse. And how bold of you to have this be your first announcement after your annual summer break. You don't lead with an exciting new announcement. You double the pricing on your DLC, the cost of which has already been an enormous cost barrier to new players.

EDIT: To those who simply repeat the same adage, ""Don't like it, don't buy it... They're a business...,"" etc., we are all aware of this ever salient point. We know they need money to continue as a business. I own every bit of DLC that Paradox has put out for EUIII, HOI3, March of the Eagles, CKII, EUIV, Stellaris, Imperator, and CKIII. I have done everything reasonable to give them my financial support as a customer. Pointing out that the decline in quality and value is only exacerbated by doubling the price for existing products isn't a result of lacking the understanding for business fundamentals.

Companies pay to develop and maintain avenues for customer feedback. They take that feedback into consideration (some more than others) when making business decisions. As a steadfast customer of PI, I'm actually continuing my support by voicing my opinion. It would be much simpler to uninstall and forget, but I still care.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"First a word of praise for CK2, which was by far the most unique strategy game I've ever played. Nothing else comes close to the intricate blend of strategy, RP, and feudal shenanigans. But its unique nature unfortunately concealed some major issues. By the end of its run, the game was seriously weighed down by a clunky interface, spammy events, and all kinds of unintuitive legacy systems.

CK3 sweeps away the cobwebs and rebuilds the series from the ground up while retaining much of what made the series great. New 3D characters, more coherent and interrelated events, and mechanics that lean into the RP aspects have all given the series a new sense of vitality. If Paradox releases worthy expansions that deepen and expand some of the RP aspects and government mechanics, then this has the potential, in my opinion, to be the best strategy game of all time.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"Started as a Norse Chieftain, a bellicose man but fair to his people. Through bravery and guile, he forged a Jarldom that encompassed nearly all of Scandinavia. Our people were fed and our lords loved their Jarl. Then, his wife was murdered. Guards scoured the castle in search of the assailant, but found no sign of the wretch. The Royal Spymaster, daughter of the Jarl, assured him that the murderer would be found in time. Two months later, the eldest Prince was found with a slit throat. Then another prince was found dead while on a hunt. Every few months, the Royal family got smaller and smaller. The Jarl, shattered by grief, confided in his only living child - the Royal Spymaster. Nights later, the Royal Steward survived an attempt on his life. He said that the Spymaster herself had tried to cut his throat. The Jarl confronted his daughter, hoping there was some other explanation as to what had happened. With a smile on her face, she confessed to everything. Guards swarmed her, but she managed to escape. She fled the castle with her husband. For years, she roamed the northern tundras, evading her father's agents at every turn. Finally, the Jarl had had enough. He challenged her to a duel to the death. He was a skilled warrior, but old age had slowed his reflexes. As she had inherited much of her father's martial prowess, she gladly accepted the honor duel. They met in a remote forest on neutral ground. For days they fought. Grisly wounds were exchanged and kindred blood soaked the forest floor. Only upon receiving a mortal chest wound did the Spymaster yield, yet even then the Jarl couldn't bring it upon himself to end it for good. He rode back to the castle to tend his wounds. A week later, his daughter died of her wounds and the Jarl, heartbroken and full of regret, claimed his own life. As there was no royal heir, the Jarldom descended into chaos and decades of independence wars.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Edit 12/2 - It's been a while since I first wrote this, so adding an update section at the bottom.

--Original Review--
Sea of Thieves is the distilled essence of adventure. You start the game up, grab some supplies with your friends, load up your ship, and set sail to see what fate awaits you.

I offer this game an easy recommend under a couple of conditions. The first is that you like the chaos of unknown adventure, and the second is that you don't mind when it all goes pear shaped.

Sea of Thieves has you being a pirate on the ocean with other players, sailing from island to island, fighting skeletons, ghost ships, digging up treasure, solving riddles, delivering cargo, and fighting sea monsters. And you never quite know what's going to happen next on your adventure. There's plenty of things to chase, and you'll never be without a task for long if you care to pick one up from one of the vendors.

One important design choice that you should be aware of before jumping into this game is that every session is a fresh start. You spawn in with your ship and bare bone supplies, there's no progression between sessions aside from cosmetics you unlock. (Which is also the only thing you unlock, more on that below). While this can be a bit of a bummer, it's actually quite freeing. Every time you launch the game you're given a new ship, new supplies, and an ocean full of treasure to explore. Truly, you have nothing to lose. Until you find treasure, that is. Then you have something to lose. The game is simply fantastic at giving you a unique adventure every time you sail, solo or with friends. And it's shockingly easy to play solo if you desire, the smallest ship, the Sloop, is very solo player friendly if you wish to be an asocial pirate.

The only progression in this game is cosmetics. Anything else you get exists solely to get you, you guessed it, more cosmetics. This makes the cash shop a little weird. But hey, the upside is that nobody is going to beat you because they have a better sword, ship, or guns.

The game recently started a battle pass system with season one. The pass for season one is frankly a little underwhelming. I'm willing to give it a pass since the game is quite enjoyable without, but you're not missing out on anything exciting by not getting the pass.

--Update--
Since it's been a fair while and four full seasons since I first wrote this review, I felt it was time for an update. Overall, I still stand by the original review, with the same disclaimer that you have to be able to accept the wins and losses both in this game. It certainly can be frustrating at times but much like the ship, you have to let it roll off you like water. If you let the bad moments cling to you like barnacles, then you'll be just as scuttled as your ships.

Season Five just launched, and after a middling Season 2, Content Packed Seasons 3 and 4, Season 5 could be called the quality of life season. There's a decent chunk of new content (though nothing like the previous seasons, which is a reasonably high bar; 5 story missions in season 3, and roughly 8 or so new explorable lootable areas for season 4?)

The biggest quality of life change in S5 is being able to quickly and easily transfer resources from barrels and storage crates without having to open the interface. This along probably would have given me another 100 hours in the game, but they also decided to add a buried treasure system! Indeed, you can bury your treasure to create a treasure map. Then, you can put that map up on the quest board at any outpost! Other pirates can take this, and if they successfully sell your treasue...boom! You get rewarded too. How fantastic is that?

It's even better than that though. You can take up to five treasure pers per in game day from the board (this amount is pretty reasonable I feel, the days go quickly in the sea of thieves), and these other player maps will contain buried treasure of their own. Of course. Quality of treasure may vary, as it could be anything. Though there are commendations to encourage big, fruitful treasure maps. Really, it's a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.

The best part of the whole treasure map system though? They're saved on your quests table as an item called a Map Bundle. What's that mean? It means if you sink, you lose your maps and need to recover the bundle. Or that other people could steal your maps. Or you could steal their maps, I guess, if you're a jerk. While the idea that you can lose your treasure maps may feel a bit unfortunate, it's lovely design because it means they're transferable, you could gift the map bundle, or simply leave it at an outpost when you're done for someone else to find. It adds excitement in that the treasure you buried could be yoinked by a boarder and carried away. Or that you could recover your stolen bundle to regain your rightful treasure. It adds another layer of things for pirates to bicker and barter over, and it means that should things go bad for all involves, the treasue may be lost to all.

The game has been at it's best when it balances the thrill of gain with the risk of lose (even though the sting of loss can be quite painful, it's something we must learn to accept). Remember, the whole ocean is open to you, so long as you go in with the attitude that what happens, happens.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",12 2 wrote adding section bottom original sea thief distilled essence adventure grab supply friend load ship set sail fate awaits offer easy recommend couple condition chaos unknown adventure mind go pear shaped sea thief pirate ocean player sailing island island fighting skeleton ghost ship digging treasure solving riddle delivering cargo fighting sea monster never_quite happen next adventure plenty thing chase never_be task long care pick vendor important design choice aware jumping session fresh spawn ship bare bone supply no_progression session aside cosmetic unlock unlock bit bummer freeing launch given ship supply ocean treasure explore truly lose treasure lose simply fantastic giving unique adventure sail solo friend s_emphasizedhockingly easy solo desire smallest ship sloop solo friendly wish asocial pirate progression cosmetic else exists solely you_emphasized guessed cosmetic make cash shop weird hey upside beat sword ship gun recently started battle pas season pas season frankly underwhelming willing pas enjoyable not_missing exciting not_getting pas fair four season wrote stand original disclaimer able accept win loss certainly frustrating time ship roll water bad moment cling barnacle scuttled ship season five launched middling season 2 packed season 3 4 season 5 called quality life season decent chunk previous season reasonably high bar 5 mission season 3 roughly 8 explorable lootable area season 4 biggest quality life s5 able quickly easily transfer resource barrel storage crate open interface along probably given 100 hour decided add buried treasure indeed bury treasure create treasure map map board outpost pirate successfully treasue boom rewarded fantastic five treasure pers per board pretty reasonable day quickly sea thief map contain buried treasure course quality treasure vary commendation encourage big fruitful treasure map box chocolate never_know gon na best treasure map saved quest table called map bundle mean sink lose map recover bundle steal map steal map guess jerk idea lose treasure map bit unfortunate lovely design mean transferable gift map bundle simply leave outpost someone else add excitement treasure buried yoinked boarder carried recover stolen bundle regain rightful treasure add layer thing pirate bicker barter mean thing bad involves treasue lost best balance thrill gain risk lose sting loss painful s_emphasizedomething learn accept remember ocean open long attitude happens_emphasized
1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Well after reaching Pirate Legend and Athena's fortune Champion titles,
I'm finally able to make a review of this game, I hope it will help you decide if this game is worth it! I'll probably update this review the further I play. For now I'll be talkin about the [b]Adventure mode[/b] :)

Pros :
-Cool graphics and simulation of a pirate life.
-It's a game where you either get addicted or hate it in the first hours.
-Funnier with friends or randoms, but you'll learn so much faster in solo trust me.
-Satisfying sensation when you sink ennemies boats and grab their loot.
-Good game if you want to chill and kill time (but sometimes it can be stressful especially if you have a lot of loots and you're getting focused by a reaper or red flag emissaries).
-Active developer team (monthly updates, quick reactivity on problems in-game through their tweeter, so I would recommend to follow them there to not miss a thing and to always be aware of what's happening).
-A lot to experience, Stories, PVP, Fishing, Treasure Hunting, defeating Skeletons, world events, Seasonal events, Shipfight, collecting all achievements, and laugh with strangers :D

Cons:
-Intensive grind.
-Boring after a while.
-Lack of content eventhough it was way worse back when it came out in 2018.
-FPS optimization is a joke on islands (At full ultra I go from 120fps to 55 fps on big islands).
-PVP mechanic is old and boring (idk maybe they need to add some new guns or mechanics).
-Bugs after new updates are not even a surprise anymore.
-Servers issues is normal and the community is used to it (so an advice would be to never do an event the day it comes out because you probably won't receive your loot's coins, XP and achievements).
-Some events are only visible on their website and not in-game so sometimes you can miss them (Just stop it, we are lazy and hate to go through google to see our fck in-game event progression, just put it in game already ffs it's 2020).

Overall the game has a lot of problems but I still love the concept it does represent otherwise I wouldn't have reach one of the highest titles you can earn and I hope this game will continue to get the support it deserves. I haven't played such a great game in a while, so if you like intensive farming, bugs, coop and pvp but also the big map you're in the right place. We'll be waiting for you on the ocean :)

PS: If you're a veteran please help new players and don't bully them, that's what I do and I would have loved to be helped too when I started, so please do so they will always remember you, thanks fellow Legends.



[h1]Edit 1:[/h1]
So after 3 months, the game is still awesome, probably one of the best open world in multiplayer that I've played in a while. Nothing better but to fish with friends during late nights.



[h1]Edit 2:[/h1]
They finally added an Even tab in-game! Anyway I've been playing [b]Arena[/b], joined a competitive team and reached Legendary Sea Dog. So the Arena mode is way different from the actual game (adventure). It also have its pros and cons so here we go :

For the positive aspects :
- Helps you improve cannon shots
- Helps you improve your weapon accuracy
- TDM (Team deathmatch) is a lot of fun! It's like the endgame community event in the Arena
- You can make friends in this mode
- Since the last Arena patch, there's only one chest now and it's way better than before

Some negative aspects :
- Hitregs (When you hit players usually with weapons and you have the hitmarker but the server didn't register the damage, so sometimes you'll need to hit 3-4 time the player before he dies, and sometimes you may think they're cheater)
- Lobby waiting time : because the Arena mode is not the main mode, the playerbase is not that big here, so you might wait 10-30min in the worst case...
- Server region merge : Yeah well sometimes there's no server in EU (in my exemple) at certain hours and I usually get matched with NA players and I have an average of 200-250ms
- FPS optimization (Even on High-End PC you'll probably struggle to maintain a stable 144fps



[h1]Edit 3:[/h1]
They removed their own game mode called Arena. I don't know if it would now be an interesting game for pirate that love to pvp...
Quite a sad day for Sea of Thieves...



[h1]Edit 4:[/h1]
They added an alternative to the Arena inside of the Adventure mode!
Which means that you can now activate a totem on your boat which will transport you against another equivalent ship. Basically a great thing for the pvp community! Not tom mention you can customize your own ship, name it how you want, and even create or joind a Guild!

At the current state, I would seriously recommend this game to every gamers wanting to experience some adventure in the pirate world. In 2023 there is a lot of things to do, explore, farm, fight, collect and stories to experiences which are really amazing.

I joined, did the tutorial, found all the secrets from tutorial (there are plenty!!!).

First outpost I spawn, I take quests, search for loot, my boat gets raided, even if its empty.

I stay at the outpost for 30-40 minutes, My boat gets raided 3-4 times in the process.

After 40 minutes, I go to the boat, and inside, there are chests, treasures, and some random dude talking.

Apparently somebody saw I was getting owned and decided to ""protect"" me for my first gameplay. They gave me treasures, helped me do quests and all for the price of an Uber (get them to a location). They were AWESOME, FUNNY and HELPFUL as hell. Best pirate experience with them.

After I dropped them off there, I did several quests, I ran from other players as they were chasing me, I managed to DEFEAT another ship in a 1v2 situation, stole their loot, ran away, sold it, it was epic.

All this in 4 freaking hours!

Even if the quests are some kind of repetitive, the PvP element is awesome!.

I don't regret any money spent on it, too bad I don't have any friends playing this masterpiece.

Positive review, as I haven't had bugs or unpleasant gameplay. 


PS: Great optimization also, 2080S + 4790K, 1440p, Mythical graphics (max), 100 fps. Amazing!


Part 2 (10 hr gameplay): 

So I played again, 2nd gameplay, I finished first 3 Tales and it was a ""good"" gameplay.

This time I haven't seen a single friendly person. I've been attacked and raided about 6-7 times, sometimes by solo, sometimes by gang of 3-4. But I adapted quickly.

At first I went to cash in my voyages and treasures ( i had 3 chests with 9 skulls, 3 chests with 9 gold items, a crying chest and 2 regular treasure chests, all from farming/voyage). I went to an outpost, I did a 360 to make sure there's nobody there, then docked the sloop. When I went with the first chest of 3 skulls, there was a dude hiding in a bush next to the Bones tent, he jumped out, gave me a heart attack, then took a shot at me. He missed the shot, I dropped the chest and I went full ape on him, killing him. Then I ran to drop all my treasures, cause since he didn't have a boat, meant his team mates are circling around. On that run I felt like mom's spaghetti, palms were much sweatyyy... 

Amazingly, I managed to cash in ALL my treasures, and THEN, the bad guys were aready at my ship. I saw them trying to ram it in the rocks. I throw 2-3 blast bombs and they drop in water, then I shoot them down with the pistol. Managed to get back in my ship, repair it , and went full speed into their big ship, while they were respawning. I didn't stay to repair mine, I just shot their ship down, then ran away.

Then I got killed and ship sank about 4 times, twice from crew of 4 , once from a duo on a sloop, they put a barrel on my ship and sank it down, while I was doing a quest ... and once from the freaking kraken, right AFTER I FINISHED A TALE...  Lost a lot of treasures including the Tale treasure, but....

While trying not to ragequit, I saw a crew of 4 again, probably same guys, they were fighting a skeleton ship. I got close and managed to spot 2 of the 4 guys, confirming it was the crew that gangbanged me (i think ^_^ ) . I went to them, flanked them and placed them between me and the skull ship. Shot them 3-4 times, then with a singing/dancing cannonball and a fire cannonball, and their ship started to sink and burn. I saw them jumping in the water. I went there to see if they ""need"" help and just finished the job, shooting them in the water. Then I took ALL their treasures, which compensated a lot over my loss, and went to a safe outpost.

That feeling was the best. Yes, I lost some battles, but also won a few. First gameplay, 4 hours, 2nd gameplay, 10 hours straight. The PVP element is priceless in this game, otherwise it would've become boring. 

And I just found out about sunken ships, mermaids skeleton lords and kraken :)) 

New challenges ahead !!!

Edit 3: 18-June-2020

I think I had enough of this game. While there are 3-4 random people/ships that are friendly, most of the players I've encountered in the last days are simply apes. 

I see medium ship with 3 people, I run fast at outpost and manage to sell every treasure, sail away, they chase me for 10 minutes, until I stopped to see what they want. They simply killed me on sight.

I see sloop with 2 people chasing me, my ship is empty, I tell them ship is empty, and that I'm going on a Tale, they simply sank my ship.

Finally, I have +10 skulls, 9 gems, 10 treasure chests. I see galeon with 4 people, I avoid it, I run to outpost and manage to sell everything.
Then I go on a tale, they simply start chasing me. I tell them I am solo, ship is empty, they start firing at me. I do a handbrake 180'Turn, run against the wind, somehow they catch me sideways (AGAINST THE WIND, they say sloop is fastest against wind). They hit me with hook, take me away from my ship, in the middle of the ocean. I respawn, they are in my ship, burning it down.
All 4 of them were like ""SORRY MAN, WE THOUGHT YOU HAD LOOT, SORRY WE SANK YOUR SHIP, SORRY WE KILLED YOU 3 TIMES"".
4v1, 2 of them were LEGENDS, I am a fucking bamby learning the game, two of them have +500 hours in game.

This is fucking pathetic. Instead of going to fight the 3-crew ship, they chose to chase a 1-crew Sloop with no fucking loot.

In the last 2 days I haven't seen a single friendly dude. Everybody tried to shoot/sink my ship.

At some point, I get to think this game is filled with low ego real life underachievers... for ganging up a fking solo.

I tend to Change my review to No, since there's no fun in getting chased every 5 minutes by crew of 3-4 people that have nothing better to do than bullying a solo player with empty ship.

PS: Even with apes chasing me on the sea, in solo mode, I managed to make almost 80K Gold in one gameplay and only lost 1 treasure chest to apes.

Edit 4: I've played a bit before my holiday and for some reason, it was surprisingly amazing. I joined as usual, as a solo Scoop, but I forgot to set it to Private. After about 5 minutes, I get a random crew member who scared the living thing out of me... lel... He was a legend, he was very funny and helpful. For some reason, he didn't mind playing with me and helping me do tales and treasure hunting. I believe I wanted to play for half an hour, and ended up playing a 8-hour session with him, talking about the game and telling jokes and chilling at some  ""grog"". 

We've had also some fair PvP, 2v2 and 2v3, which sometimes went good ,sometimes went to shit when we fell of the ship and they stole our ship and sank it into a cliff. 

I haven't tried the new update yet, but I can surely say, you cannot play ""just a half hour session""... 4 sessions ... 30 hours... that says it all.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",holy shiiiiiiiiieeeettt nice skeptical bought joined tutorial found secret tutorial plenty outpost spawn quest search loot boat get raided empty stay outpost 30 40 minute boat get raided 3 4 time process 40 minute boat inside chest treasure random dude talking apparently somebody saw owned decided protect gave treasure helped quest price uber location awesome funny helpful hell best pirate dropped quest ran player chasing managed defeat ship 1v2 situation stole loot ran sold it_emphasized epic 4 freaking hour quest kind repetitive pvp element awesome regret spent bad friend masterpiece positive bug unpleasant p great optimization 2080s 4790k 1440p mythical graphic max 100 shooter amazing 2 10 hr 2nd finished 3 tale good single friendly attacked raided 6 7 time solo gang 3 4 adapted quickly cash voyage treasure 3 chest 9 skull 3 chest 9 gold item cry chest 2 regular treasure chest farming voyage outpost 360 docked sloop chest 3 skull dude hiding bush next bone tent jumped gave heart attack took shot missed shot dropped chest ape killing ran drop treasure cause boat meant mate circling mom s_emphasizedpaghetti palm sweatyyy amazingly managed cash treasure bad guy aready ship saw trying ram rock throw 2 3 blast bomb drop water shoot pistol managed ship repair speed big ship respawning stay repair mine shot ship ran killed ship sank 4 time twice crew 4 duo sloop barrel ship sank freaking kraken finished tale lost treasure including tale treasure trying not_to ragequit saw crew 4 probably guy fighting skeleton ship close managed spot 2 4 guy confirming crew gangbanged _ flanked placed skull ship shot 3 4 time singing dancing cannonball fire cannonball ship started sink burn saw jumping water help finished shooting water took treasure compensated loss safe outpost feeling best yes lost battle 4 hour 2nd 10 hour straight pvp element priceless otherwise boring found sunken ship mermaid skeleton lord kraken challenge ahead 3 18 june 2020 3 4 random ship friendly player encountered last day simply ape medium ship 3 fast outpost manage treasure sail chase 10 minute stopped simply killed sight sloop 2 chasing ship empty tell ship empty tale simply sank ship finally 10 skull 9 gem 10 treasure chest galeon 4 avoid outpost manage tale simply chasing tell solo ship empty firing handbrake 180 turn wind somehow catch sideways wind sloop fastest wind hook ship middle ocean respawn ship burning 4 sorry man thought loot sorry sank ship sorry killed 3 time 4v1 2 legend fucking bamby learning 500 hour fucking pathetic fight 3 crew ship chose chase 1 crew sloop no_fucking loot last 2 day single friendly dude everybody tried shoot sink ship filled low ego real life underachiever ganging fking solo tend no_since no_fun chased 5 minute crew 3 4 bullying solo empty ship p ape chasing sea solo mode managed 80k gold lost 1 treasure chest ape 4 bit holiday surprisingly amazing joined usual solo scoop forgot set private 5 minute random crew member scared living lel legend funny helpful mind helping tale treasure hunting believe wanted half ended 8 session talking telling joke chilling grog fair pvp 2v2 2v3 good shit fell ship stole ship sank cliff t_emphasizedried surely cannot_play half session 4 session 30 hour say
1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Sea of thieves is fun for all ages. I'm 36 years old, my parents are in their 50s and my children are 10 and 12; we all play Sea of thieves. The graphics are gorgeous and the environment immerses you in to the pirate life. The game has story line aspects with its ""Tall Tales"" or you can get voyages to kill off Captain skeletons, battle skeleton and ghost ships, find lost merchandise in sunken ships or good old fashion treasure hunting. There are ""world events"" that rotate throughout the day this includes skeleton fleets, skeleton forts, fire tornadoes that spawn in ""boss"" enemies and the infamous ""Flameheart"" and his ghost fleet.

I find the game has a good balance of PvE and PvP, so you are able to attack player ships and vice versa. Plus, during your voyages surprise attacks from megladons, krakens and even a skeleton ship can attack. This game keeps you on your toes and wanting more. I highly recommend it!

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"By the time I write this review I have 740 hours in this game. I've done pretty much everything you can do around here and max level'd all the companies.

-Graphics are stunning for the most part, especially the sea. Characters do look goofy but thats not a bad thing. 

-Pve is fun at first 100-200 hours or so but gets repetitive after a while.

-Gold system is just stupid. I've bought everything in the game and still have millions of gold and thousands of dubloons just sitting there with nothing to spend them on. They need to balance it more. either add more stuff to buy, make it more expensive or decrease the loot you gain.

-To basically summarize the pve, there are 7 emmissary companies in this game. They will give you quests and bonuses on the items you sell if you're sailing with their emmisary flag.

EMMISARIES

Gold Hoarders.
They give you treasure hunt quests where you gotta dig up stuff from random islands. That's all they used to do until they introduced the vaults in a recent update. Vaults are a lot more fun. You gotta put together the map for a key then go to a specific island where the key will unlock a cave. You will see a lot of gold and chests laying around in there but those are just a distraction. Your main goal will be to get the Chest of Tributes by collecting madallions and entering the correct sequence to open sesame as it were.
They only give you bonus for treasure chests and small collectibles like chalices and ornate cups and whatnot.

Merchants.
Most boring emmisary of all. Just delivering cargos from one place to another. They give you bonus for selling cargo items like sugar, tea etc.

Order of Souls.
Basically a skeleton killing faction. They give you bounties to kill some skeleton captains and they will give you a bonus for selling them their skull. There's also ghost fleets which are much more fun and giving bigger rewards.
They only give you bonus for selling skulls.

Reapers.
The ''pvp'' faction of adventure mode. I just call them garbage collectors of this game because they will give you bonus for literally everything. Anything you got you thought was worthless, they will buy it. They buy everything. They dont give you any quests. There are a couple items that you can only sell to them. Reapers Chest and Reapers Bounty but beware these chests are cursed and their positions are revealed on the map. So other players may see you. If you're flying reaper emissary flag they will see you. BUT, if you reach level 5 emmisary you will be able to see other emmisaries on the map to hunt them down. You get really good money for selling broken emmisary flags of those people you sank. 

The reason I said ''pvp'' faction is because a lot of reaper players are known to just run soon as they see you. Yes. It's supposed mean ''hey guys, you can see us on the map, we're up for some pvp, come get us'' but they raise it to get more money from the items they sell and just keep doing pve. 

Don't raise reaper if you're gonna run from the first ship you see. If you get sunk, they will be toxic to you naturally and you will deserve it because you made them waste an hour chasing you down. 

Hunters.
Fishermen. You can fish in this game and sell your fish to these guys at any seapost. Best way to level up on hunters is to save your gems to sell it to them only(you can sell gems to everyone pretty much). It's a lot more xp and gold than fishin.

Athena.
The emmisary you unlock by reaching pirate legend. Pretty boring voyages and overrated rewards. I was disappointed. It was supposed to be some big endgame company where it'd be fun stuff but its meh.

Sea dogs.
Arena company. Arena is a seperate gamemode than adventure where its ONLY pvp. Just constant action for 15 minutes straight. Huge fun. I love their cosmetics too. Really the coolest and most posh stuff ever lol

WORLD EVENTS

These are where you enjoy some of the best of pve this game can offer. Rewards are pretty huge compared to regular emmisary voyages.

Flameheart
Giant Bearded Face in the sky screaming at you all the time. Everyone hates him. You fight his ghost fleet. Reward is plenty and you also get a lot of supplies.

Ashen Winds.
Boss on an island. Decent rewards, you also get a unique cool flamethrower skull that you can sell for 10k. Not bad.

Skeleton Fleet.
Probably the most challanging pve i'd say. Especially if you're in a small ship. But the loot haul is pretty big. Fastest way to level up your emmisary flag because of the high quantity of items you'll get.

Active Forts.
Skeleton waves and then a boss. You get decent loot. 

Fort of the Damned.
Biggest loot haul you can get from this game. But beware, people will try to steal it from you. This is the number 1 event every server hopper can dream of. It's the main attraction for pvp. Really the most fun thing to do/steal in adventure mode.

-------------------------

PVP.

Now for the best part of this game, PVP. It gives you a pleasure that other pvp games can't. It's just a really unique experience battling it out as pirates. I don't even do any pve anymore it's all about pvp.

I'll see if I can summarize the key parts of it, but oh boy it's beautifully complicated. 

-There's the naval part where you have to out-manuever your enemy. You have to stay out of their broadside while try to get them in your broadside while they're doing the same thing. It's not just a spinning battle where both ships constantly fire at eachother like in the Caribbean movies. There's unique moves you can pull off with harpoon turning, anchor turning, adjusting sails to surprise your enemy. Having a good captain will make all the difference between winning or losing a battle. 

-Cannons. Different types of cannonballs for different purposes, regular cannons to put some holes in, cursed balls with million different (and very useful) purposes, firebombs to put their ship ablaze, blunderbombs to damage players knock them back from repairing. and in my opinion the best type is the chainshots to knock their mast down. Because soon as you're unable to move, you're done. You will just be sitting ducks for the volley of cannonfire soon to follow. Having a good gunner who hits their shots in good sequence will make all the difference between winning and losing the battle.

-Repairing. Every crew needs a good bilge rat who makes sure that the ship is in top shape. You can't just ignore the holes in your ship to do anything else like boarding or shooting. Not sinking yourself is the priority. Worry about sinking your enemy later. A good bilge rat in your crew will make all the difference between winning and losing the battle.

-Boarding. Without a doubt the most fun thing to do in this game. Boarding other people and killing them. 1 boarder who can put the enemy's anchor down and keep them busy just for a little while is usually good enough to win a battle. You dont even have to really kill them usually. Because as they are busy with the boarder, the other crew member will continue putting the pressure with cannonfire and putting more holes. They won't be able to really focus on repair while they have an active boarder. 

On the othere hand, as fun as it is, too much boarding can be the downfall of a bad crew. Disorganized, if you send too many boarders and they either miss the target or die without doing significant damage, you will be severely undermanned in your own ship to survive the enemy's cannonfire or boarders. I've seen people just all abandoning their ship with holes in it to board ours, we just kill them and theres nobody left to repair them. Come on people. Take care of your ship. Your ship must come first.

TL:DR

There's so much more to it than I can fit in this review. Really a rich game with a vast world. It's well worth buying at full price. A must buy if you're really into pirate's life. One thing I must say though, you gotta play it with friends. x10 more fun. Solo sailing can be painful and usually gets boring really fast.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",write 740 hour pretty max company graphic stunning especially sea character look goofy thats not_a bad pve fun 100 200 hour get repetitive gold stupid bought million gold thousand dubloons sitting spend balance add stuff expensive decrease loot gain basically summarize pve 7 emmissary company quest bonus item sailing emmisary flag emmisaries gold hoarder treasure hunt quest ta dig stuff random island introduced vault recent vault fun ta map key specific island key unlock cave gold chest laying distraction goal chest tribute collecting madallions entering correct sequence open sesame bonus treasure chest small collectible chalice ornate cup whatnot merchant boring emmisary delivering cargo bonus selling cargo item sugar tea order soul basically skeleton killing faction bounty kill skeleton captain bonus selling skull ghost fleet fun giving bigger reward bonus selling skull reaper pvp faction adventure mode call garbage collector bonus literally thought worthless dont quest couple item reaper chest reaper bounty beware chest cursed position revealed map player flying reaper emissary flag reach 5 emmisary able emmisaries map hunt good selling broken emmisary flag sank pvp faction reaper player known soon yes s_emphasizedupposed hey guy map pvp raise item pve raise reaper gon na ship sunk toxic naturally deserve waste chasing hunter fisherman fish fish guy seapost best hunter save gem gem pretty xp gold fishin athena emmisary unlock reaching pirate legend pretty boring voyage overrated reward disappointed supposed big endgame company fun stuff meh sea dog arena company arena seperate gamemode adventure pvp constant action 15 minute straight huge fun love cosmetic coolest posh stuff lol world event enjoy best pve offer reward pretty huge compared regular emmisary voyage flameheart giant bearded face sky screaming hate fight ghost fleet reward plenty supply ashen wind bos island decent reward unique cool flamethrower skull 10k not_bad skeleton fleet probably challanging pve especially small ship loot haul pretty big fastest emmisary flag high quantity item active fort skeleton wave bos decent loot fort damned biggest loot haul beware steal number 1 event hopper dream attraction pvp fun steal adventure mode pvp best pvp give pleasure pvp game unique battling pirate pve anymore pvp summarize key part oh boy beautifully complicated naval manuever enemy stay broadside broadside not_just spinning battle ship constantly fire eachother caribbean movie unique move pull harpoon turning anchor turning adjusting sail surprise enemy good captain difference winning losing battle cannon different type cannonball different purpose regular cannon hole cursed ball million different useful purpose firebomb ship ablaze blunderbombs damage player knock repairing opinion best type chainshots knock mast soon unable move sitting duck volley cannonfire soon follow good gunner hit shot good sequence difference winning losing battle repairing crew need good bilge rat make ship top shape ignore hole ship else boarding shooting not_sinking priority worry sinking enemy good bilge rat crew difference winning losing battle boarding doubt fun boarding killing 1 boarder enemy anchor busy usually good win battle dont kill usually busy boarder crew member continue putting pressure cannonfire putting hole able focus repair active boarder othere hand fun boarding downfall bad crew disorganized send boarder miss target die significant damage severely undermanned ship survive enemy cannonfire boarder abandoning ship hole board kill there left repair care ship ship tl dr s_emphasizedo fit rich vast world worth buying price re_emphasizedally pirate life ta friend x10 fun solo sailing painful usually get boring fast

[i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is unquestionably awe-inspiring, artistically beautiful, superbly unique, and delivers (what can be) an unbelievably immersive and memorable experience if you’re willing to build a deep understanding of its mechanics...

HOWEVER, you MUST keep this key point in mind if you’re considering playing this game:
[quote][b][u]THIS IS A PVP GAME.[/u] Your enjoyment is based *entirely* on whether your style of play harmonizes with the other players who share the sea.[/b][/quote]
That in this mind, here’s my summary for each audience:
[list]
[*] [b]IF YOU DON’T HAVE FRIENDS WILLING TO LEARN, SUFFER, OR GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE [i]SEA OF THIEVES[/i] GAUNTLET, [U]DO NOT[/U] PLAY THIS GAME.[/b] You’ll have to endure A LOT of trivialized efforts, crushed dreams, verbal abuse, and game mechanics that are wholly unsympathetic of your time to reach the enjoyable parts of the experience.

[*] [b]IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD, STORY-BASED EXPLORATION GAME FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS, THEN PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.[/b] That good, story-based exploration game is *definitely* in there, but can get lost in the salt.

[*] [b]IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR A COMPETITIVE ONLINE FIRST-PERSON PIRACY GAME WITH BRILLIANT NAVAL COMBAT AND COSMETIC-BASED PROGRESSION, *ABSOLUTELY* PLAY THIS GAME![/b] It will be worth your time to learn, master, and conquer the high seas!
[/list]
Okay; onward to the in-depth review points!

[hr][/hr][h1]🟢 THE POSITIVES[/h1][hr][/hr]
[b]➕ SAILING MECHANICS.[/b] The cornerstone of any sailing game should be the boat mechanics, and [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] delivers. It does a masterful job of blending the complexity of sail and wind management, ship-to-ship cannon-play, and a variety of sailing mechanics to create a brilliant seafaring experience!

[b]➕ THE WATER.[/b] THE WAVES AND WATER IN THIS GAME: U.N.B.E.L.I.E.V.A.B.L.E! 🌊🌊🌊

[b]➕ The ART.[/b] In fact, the *ENTIRE* art style of the game is undisputedly STUNNING! From the golden shores to the volcanic frontiers, the game is built on [i]National Geographic[/i]-quality landscapes!

[b]➕ BETTER WITH FRIENDS.[/b] This can’t be understated enough: [b]the seas can be a ROUGH place—both when it comes to gameplay AND the people you meet along the way. Bring a crew so you don’t have to face it alone! 💯[/b]

[b]➕ HORIZONTAL PROGRESSION.[/b] The game has no vertical progression; there’s no “leveling up” to become a better pirate with better equipment or gain any mechanical advantage over your opponents. The playing field is level every time you roll a new ship—apart from your personal knowledge and mastery of the game mechanics!

[b]➕ The OPEN WORLD and the “INFINITE QUEST LOOP.”[/b] While the world is your oyster to explore the moment you leave the dock, there’s also an incredibly brilliant “quest loop” that emerges as you discover expeditions and unlock special emissary quests as you gain their favor. The game rewards you with better and quicker rewards the longer you play—making it incredibly easy to lose yourself for HOURS on end!

[b]➕ The STORY VOYAGES (aka “TALL TALES”).[/b] Much of the game’s lore is presented in story voyages known as Tall Tales. These concise, open world stories are a *fantastic* way to explore the world and learn about the magic that drives the [i]Sea of Thieves[/i]. (There’s even checkpoints to save your progress in case you’re ganked by some salty pirate!)

[b]➕ HUMOR![/b] As is typical in most Rare games, there’s a glorious, tongue-in-cheek humor woven throughout the gameplay and narrative experience. The world doesn’t take itself too seriously, which helps you get lost in the joy of the game!

[b]➕ The LIVESTREAM COMMUNITY.[/b] Where the game falls short of teaching the game and community norms, the streaming community is a BRILLIANT resource to fill in those gaps. Take the time to tune in and find a few favorite streamers:
[list][*] [url=https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Sea%20of%20Thieves]Sea of Thieves on Twitch[/url][/list]

[hr][/hr][h1]🟡 THE...""TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT""[/h1][hr][/hr]
[b]〰️ QUESTS (aka “VOYAGES”).[/b] Voyages are quests offered by the trading companies that help you grow your wealth. Each company only offers two or three *unique* voyages, and while there is some randomness inherent to each voyage, they will begin to feel repetitive after (admittedly) several hundred hours of adventuring.

[b]〰️ HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.[/b] On one hand: the mechanics are relatively straightforward, simple to pick up, and offer room to master a multitude of tricks that’ll give you the upper-hand in a fight.

On the other: long animations, hit-reg issues, and a lack of “weight” to your hits can make it feel like you’re dueling with wet pool noodles.

[b]〰️ ⚠ SAFETY PROTOCOLS: DISENGAGED ⚠[/b] The moment you set sail, you’ll be with the greenest of green sailors and the hardest, saltiest, most cutthroat pirates on the waves. Though skeleton ships will help you practice and prepare for the PvP encounters you’ll inevitably face, there’s no real, “safe” space to hone your skills as you play—a daunting hurdle to overcome early in the game experience.

[b]〰️ The PLAYERS[/b] …are truly a mixed bag. Some days you’ll make meaningful connections with pirates who are humble in victory, merciful through teaching, or powerful allies on the seas. Other days, you’ll encounter the most toxic, unfeeling players whose singular goal is to break your spirit. All you can do is be prepared for both…

[b]〰️ FISHING.[/b] While fish are both a source of nourishment and highly-desired by the fishing guild, the fishing mechanics themselves aren’t that interesting, and sadly feel like more of a time sync than an enjoyable minigame with meaningful rewards.

[b]〰️ The LACK OF SEA LIFE.[/b] While not game-breaking in any way, the variety of ocean life is sadly lacking in an otherwise STUNNING game... 😞

[hr][/hr][h1]💢 THE NOT-SO-GREAT[/h1][hr][/hr]
[b]➖ The game only *KIND OF* CARES ABOUT YOUR TIME.[/b] My biggest complaint with [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is the fact that many mechanics are designed to waste your time. Whether seeking out tiny dig spots on massive islands, fighting waves of skeletons for hours, or fighting a hooked fish for several minutes, the game is [i]NOT[/i] friendly if you’re looking to jump in for any less than two hours at a time.

[b]➖ The game does very little TEACHING.[/b] While the Maiden Voyage is a good place to learn the basic mechanics of the game, it doesn’t go into great depth and fails to cover several critical mechanics to the experience: including wind angles, bailing and repairing in combat situations, cannon mechanics, etc.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"When I hit 10 hours of gameplay, I said I would write a review. Then it was 100 hours. 250. 500. Finally, I told myself if I could play 1,000 hours of Sea of Thieves by my anniversary in the game (Nov 25th, 2020), I would write the review. Here I am delivering that promise early. So, do I recommend Sea of Thieves? Yes. 100%. Absolutely. Sea of Thieves is not only my favorite game that I am playing now but has quickly become my favorite game I have ever played. Amongst my crew, there has been a joke that Sea of Thieves is not a game, but more a lifestyle. If you fall in love with this game like me, you will fully understand what this means. But is Sea of Thieves right for you?

I. What is Sea of Thieves?
Sea of Thieves is an adventure sandbox game where you craft your own adventure -- where no two play sessions are ever the same. One day you could be running Gold Hoarders, doing X marks the spot maps, hopping island to island in search of glittering gold. Suddenly while sailing to Crooks Hollow, the water turns black. The Kraken. The next day you could be running Reaper chasing another Reaper into the Shores of Gold for an hour and a half for what turns out to be a f*****g ancient goblet. The adventure and story to be told is yours and always unexpected.

The nature of Sea of Thieves is PvPvE. This means that you will have emergent threats like Skeleton Ships, Megalodons, or the fearsome Kraken. There are world events like forts where you fight through waves of skeletons to claim a vault of treasure, Ashen Winds where you fight a fiery boss, and skeleton fleets that have you putting your naval skills to the test; however, there is always looming the possibility that other player pirates might have their eyes on that same treasure. It cannot be avoided, you will run into other players in Sea of Thieves. (PvE servers will never happen.)

Player interactions can be the most amazing moments, or events that cause you to break your keyboard. I have met great friends, amazing communities, and some of the most salty, homophobic, and racist individuals to walk the planet. I don’t want this to scare anyone though because the number of good encounters far outweighs the bad ones. If you do have a really toxic encounter, I highly encourage clipping the events and sending a player report into Rare (their support system is one of a kind). 

II. Is Sea of Thieves Right for You?
Do you want to be a pirate? Do you love adventure? Do you have friends to play with? Then this game is absolutely for you. While it is not required to have other players to play the game, it is much more enjoyable with company. My crews and I have had such incredible and epic adventures that we will reminisce on them months after they have happened. With friends, you will write your stories of gold and glory. On the other side, I am also a player that enjoys the solitude of the seas and will solo sloop. This play style hardens you to the game and will make you a much better pirate. Beware though, you will sink. A lot.

“Sink or be Sunk”. Remember these words when playing this game. You will sink other ships, but you will also sink. No one is immune. Sea of Thieves can be a rough game, but if you get good at the game, it is one of the most satisfying feelings possible. Everyone starts somewhere, and you as a new player will probably end up sunk a lot while you learn to ‘get good’. Do not lose faith you sweat lord in training you.

If you are the type of player that enjoys griefing and/or using hate speech, then please move on. As mentioned before, Rare does not mess around with player reports. I have had two really horrendous encounters and on both occasions the crews were suspended fast (the last one taking all of 3 hours from submit of report to email saying they were suspended). I will find you, and clip you, and report you, and then hunt you down until you leave the server. That is a promise.

III. What Does Sea of Thieves Do Well?
Graphics: 
The graphics in Sea of Thieves are just stunning. It is the most beautiful game, nay art, I have ever seen. I dare say the in game water looks more beautiful than real water. There are times that my crew is slightly intoxicated and just staring into the sea as the sun sets below the horizon. I have never taken so many screenshots and clips than I have in Sea of Thieves. Your pirate might look a little weird, but you will grow such an attachment to your pirate that it becomes a bond. I love my strangely long torsoed old man pirate very much. 

The World:
In the game you will visit different regions of the Sea of Thieves that all have their own look and personality. You may go to The Wilds which looks gloomy and eerie with the worst storms in the game, or the Devil’s Roar with its active volcanoes that rain ash and molten stone onto unlucky ships. You may also go and take a break in the tropical paradise of The Shores of Plenty. Alongside the main map are areas you can only get to by doing the “story mode” Tall Tales. The world of Sea of Thieves is rich and alive, with water that thrashes your ship around and shifting winds that require you to maintain your mast position to travel faster. 

IV. What Does Sea of Thieves Do Wrong?
Hit reg:
""In areas of intense action, players may find themselves firing shots or landing strikes that do not cause damage to their targets. While small improvements continue to be delivered during our regular updates, we are continuing to investigate and identify further improvements to improve the player combat experience.” Expect to see this forever.

Bugs/Glitches:
With any game there are things that need to be ironed out, and Sea of Thieves is not spared from that. I have been rocket launched off a capstan, had a meg flip my ship six tiles North on death, been stuck in emotes to crewmates (this one is actually really amazing). You will rage and cry with laughter at some of the bugs in this game. Beware to Steam players though, every other update seems to cause a tab out delay bug where if you tab out/in, there is a 3 second delay each way. 

V. Conclusion/ TLDR
Sea of Thieves is the adventure that you make of it. You will sink, and you will learn from the times you get sunk. Never give up, because there is no other game like Sea of Thieves. It truly is the best game ever made. As the Great Pirate Lord Ramsey says, “It’s not about the Gold. It’s about the Glory.” May the wind be in all your sails.
10/10 Must Buy.

What was Hour 1,000 Day like?
I thought it important to describe what Hour 1,000 Day on the Sea of Thieves brought me. My crew mate and I sank, and got sunk. We encountered toxic players, and angels. We tried to lure out some spice by doing a Fort of Fortune. Upon finding a tucker in a barrel on top of a water tower, we performed an incredible kill by feigning ignorance while “searching” the tower as my partner got a sniper shot ready for the blunder bomb that I delivered after (he was a great sport about it all.) He came back once and after a great fight, we sank him. At the end of the night, after depositing our karma crates on the pier of Golden Sands, we noticed a brig coming to sell from an Ashen Winds event. We scuttled our ship and hid. They turned out to be the most incredible kids who loved the game (one of their “big bwudas” introduced him. Awe!) We emoted, the kid gave an amazing toast in the tavern, and we let them shoot us out of the cannons while we logged midair. I can’t express how amazing and truly wonderful this game really is. Be a good person, treat others with kindness, and remember, on the other side of the pirate is a person. Cheers!

You will get sunk, you will be overwhelmed. It will suck. But the point is that you will have fun doing all the pirate stuff. The moment you realize the only thing you can do with gold is buy skins anyway, you will discover the real fun. Its about the adventure and the fun times, not always the booty.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Ah man, where to begin!

[h1]The art design:[/h1]
Playful, whimsical, charming. Paired with the fantastic water effects and the day/night cycle, the world feels uplifting from minute 1. You can practically smell the crisp, salty air... 


[h1]The learning curve:[/h1]
Reasonable. You can master the basics within the first hour, and then spend the next 100 hours living your best piratey life.


[h1]The play style:[/h1] 
Interestingly enough, you don't level up your weapons, skills, or ship's abilities. The changes are purely cosmetic... and I love it. While I've enjoyed games that require you to level up your gear or unlock moves, this style feels much more comfortable. YOU get to decide if you want to invest time in a quest chain that unlocks a new item (a cool ship's livery, a flashy new hat), but you aren't penalized for being a newcomer. Yes, the fancy canons look nice, but they are just as powerful as the default canons. 

You build your reputation with different factions (aka Companies), which leads to unlocking better paying gigs (aka Voyages) and cool-looking items. This works to the benefit of everyone in your crew: A sailor who has a higher rank with a specific Company than their crewmates will be able to pick up a better-paying Voyage, and then everyone in their crew can participate. I love this-- if you happen to outrank your friends/crewmates, you can offer to buy that Voyage. Some aspects of play require everyone to be on the same page (ie, Tall Tales), but that's ok. Means you can have a positive experience doing one-off Voyages some times, and other times hunker down and work toward longer gameplay arcs. 


[h1]My experience so far:[/h1]
I played the beta, but only recently bought the game. Even though I missed a massive gap of updates, I don't feel left behind. I love going on adventures with my friends, or winding down the evening with some solo-slooping. I live in a different timezone than my crew, which has meant I have time earlier in my evenings to invest in the pre-adventure prepwork (gathering supplies for the ship, fishing and cooking said fish so we'll have extra stamina). It's fun, and is surprisingly soothing. 

PVP has been interesting. When I solo, I try to avoid conflict. When I'm with my crew, we meet it head-on! Both dynamics are enjoyable: Being stealthy, hiding behind mountains, darting around the map, versus gearing up and letting the cannons fly...! So good. 


[h1]Why I especially like this game (and why you might like it too):[/h1]
I'm a fan of all things nautical, and I come from a WoW background. For me, this feels like the best parts of WoW: You can tackle massive monsters with your friends, you can choose to grind for random achievements, and you can spend as much time as you want getting sidetracked by treasure and exploration. Plus, the outfits/livery options...! Since the outfits and ship details are purely cosmetic, you can mix and match to your heart's content. 

[h1]I imagine you would NOT like this game if:[/h1]
-- You only have 10 minutes of spare time to play games.
-- You hate everything to do with water.

[h1]I imagine you would like this game if:[/h1]
-- You have always wanted to be a pirate.
-- You have at least one person to adventure with some of the time.
-- You like to blow things up.
-- You like to sneak away from danger.
-- When playing other games, you find yourself getting lost and spending hours NOT doing the mission objectives, but have a better time for it.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Well, I was about to say that this game is totally undeserving the hype and is a bad game, but, it has these ""burps of greatness"" which changes everything. 

Let me explain, it is really atmospheric and open to imagination rather than grind. 

First night i was playing SoT, we were four friends and two were actual seamen. It was understandably epic to act like pirate crew while using all the lingo of actual sailors, trying to get into battle. However, it was the second night i played the game which actually hooked me.

Me and two others had this mid-tier ship and i decided that we should be pirate hunters instead of pirates. Since everybody is complaining about PVP in forums and wanting PVE, i thought ""hey, i guess we can make friends"" and it would be great to experience the other side for a change.

We've traveled around for a while with random quests and found this riddle message in a bottle, eventually leading to this avian themed island with bird like statues. It took us so long to get the riddle right, one of our crew members passed out from drinking in real life, so we put his character in brig (holding cell in our ship). After we solved the riddle as the remaining crew members, we've decided to get the goodies to an island with merchants and on our way we had an encounter which went friendly after announcing ourselves as such. We were now sure that we can sail friendly and only engage if necessary or to hunt more notorious pirates. After all, notorious ones are easier to identify, heavily modified ships are more likely to be owned by experienced players, which in turn more likely to be hostile on spot due to being more confident with the game.

Couple of minutes later we left the port again, we were chasing around another ship to ask whether they saw any pirates (hoping they would say; ""Yes, us!"" , so we could start a fight and end the night in high note with all the shenanigans) and found one lone ship anchored near a field of debris. Much to our disappointment, this group turned out to be friendly as well and pointed us further north for pirates. We, in disbelief and sure they were lying, sailed north anyways to maintain character but also keeping an eye out for this one ship on our back. Then suddenly, loud noise of cannonshots! Two ships, one manned by undead came out of nowhere and guns started blazing. The last thing i saw before leaving the ship with a keg of cannon-powder was Kraken's arms raising up. I lit the barrel, threw the keg at this huge tentacle and swam as fast as i can to get away, shouting ""help"" towards the crew we just had a chat. 

My ship went down, but,i survived the ordeal with heavy injuries, yet the undead ship followed me to battle with these guys as well. I immediately jumped to this unknown ship's guns, shouting ""friendly! friendly!"" and started bombarding while good captain tried to rout away from both ships and a storm. I must add at this point that we were not sharing a common language. Either i landed enough shots on the other ships or captain was good with his trim but we got away. Sound of sea and the wind went back to normal, checking the ship i saw only the captain was alive, the other crew member i don't know what happened. 

After a minute of silently emoting respect, I saw something shining on the sea, a bit behind us, closer to the battle zone. You see, i had to check it. Shouting one last farewell, I jumped off the ship, ofcourse i was trusting the friendly mermaids for a ride back home. Among some barrels floating, i found this peculiar blue stone, most likely from another ship sunk by the undead crew or the second ship which attacked us at the start of the fight. I wanted to take the stone back home with me but the damned mermaid refused to take me back with the stone in my hand. So, I decided to make my way to the nearest island, swimming angrily to the stupid mermaids. 

Everything was well until i saw a fin on the surface of the water, got attacked by the shark almost immediately after i saw it. Raising my pistol, i spent my last shot on the predator and immediately started slicing it with my new sabre. To my suprise, it didn't take too long for this shark to be mortally wounded and somehow i survived yet again. I made my way to this rock formation which i initially thought was an island and climbed a bit to use my spyglass, there were no sign of life for miles. The damned mermaid below me, i was checking for other ships to get a ride, hopefully not giving up on this blue stone (Sapphire of the Mermaid or something). It was one really long day for Papenbard the Privateer.

That is where i left off, an amazing adventure for me. What is even better, when i get in the game next time, it will start in a tavern with a mysterious stranger commenting something like ""Aha, another new face. That was quite the celebration when you arrived... I am not surprised you don't remember it. ""

It is atmospheric.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"This game has got some serious salt that comes along with it. 

So, my first and only bit of advice is; don't play this game when you're already in a salty mood. You're a pirate, you can see and guess what kind of asshattery people will present you with. 

The game graphics wise is beautiful, a lot of people will say the sea mechanics is a part of what makes this game and it does! The hand to hand combat is simple, but very engaging. You'll see what I mean if you get this game. You have a sword and three gun types to choose from. 
Combat at sea is fun with a fair few types of cannonballs to be using, your inner pirate will awaken at some point, one day you will say enough is enough with the PvE and losing your loot to PvP'ers, you realise you can't ignore PvP forever. On the one hand, there are pirates out there that live for PvP and others that live for PvE. 

PvE and PvP; some servers are more PvP, some servers are more PvE. You gotta scope the server out like reading the room. You can alliance up with another crew, you get half value of what they turn in which boosts profit for everyone. However pirate asshattery is to be expected even in an alliance. 
And in what feels like more of a PvE server, you will still get PvP. So always, even if its chill be on your guard. 

Thats basically it without going into the game in more detail. I won't go into the content of the game because you have to discover that stuff for yourself. Plenty of questing for treasure to be done thats for sure! And if you're more curious as to whats happening in the world around there is plenty of opportunity to explore and find out. 

I will say though if you're a new pirate its best to get on in with randoms if you've no one else to play with, you can have some bad experiences but there are plenty of people out there willing to show you the ropes. Its a case of being on the right boat :)

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Its a great game with a lot of good stuff to do, although I recommend having friends and not playing solo

But this comes with a warning as well. You will have hours of progress taken from you from other people. People will hunt you down and bully you for literally no reason. The community (mostly) isn't toxic, but it is highly encouraged to hunt other people instead of working on your own profit. Even making an alliance is flawed, as you only get half value on things other members sell. Speaking from experience, you simply have to put up with the fact someone can come along and ruin your day at any time. It's quite unfortunate, some of the best parts of this game are with other crews, but you have to treat others with so much caution that fun interactions are few and far between. If these things are a dealbreaker, then I don't even blame you, and I recommend you either find some friends (preferably skilled ones) or avoid solo at all costs.

Also, you can have public ships, but I wouldn't trust those with my life, outside of arena

Edit: because people seem to be misunderstanding, I have no problem with people focusing more on the pvp than the pve, and targeting other players for profit. What I do have a problem with, however, if often people will just outright assault you, even if its clear you don't have any loot on you, and sink everyone they see for the sake of sinking people. it drives new players away, and just makes it even harder to get people to trust you. The fact that I have to warn new players that you can and will get bullied for literally no reason should be enough of a point, but the fact people still use the ""Its Sea of Thieves not Sea of Friends"" excuse for them not robbing, just murdering for no reason really drives home how some of the playerbase are, and how badly they want to feel in the right for attacking people for no reason.

You talk with an NPC who gives you a quest. You receive a map of an island with red crosses on it.
You go to your ship and search for that island on the world map. You find it, and figure out which way to sail.
You unfurl your sails and turn the helm towards the destination.

A few minutes pass. While you're in the middle of the ocean, trying to navigate around a storm, the water suddenly turns black. Combat music kicks in, as a pair of tentacles emerge from the depths.
A wild Kraken appears, and it thinks that your ship is tasty.
You grab a handful of cannonballs from storage and man the cannons.
With a few well placed shots and a couple shredded tentacles, the Kraken leaves you alone.
You repair the damage to your ship, and jump in the water to pick up the Kraken's meat.
Looking at the map, a short detour towards a trading post is possible.
You place the meat on a skillet to cook, while you turn your ship towards the merchants.
After selling the Kraken meat, you set sail towards your quest.
The rest of the voyage is uneventful, and you reach the island and drop the anchor.
With map in one hand and a shovel in another, you set foot on the tropical island before you.
With no minimap, you need to read the map and orient yourself based on landmarks you see.
Eventually you find one of the places where the treasure should be.
Enthusiastically, you swing your shovel in to the sand and hit wood!

You've found a wooden chest, that is one of the treasures on the island.
However, you also found a pack of animated skeletons who would rather you not take the treasure.
You draw your sword and fight the bones.
You notice a lone skeleton carry a big red barrel of gunpowder toward you. Without skipping a beat, you run a few paces away and draw your pistol.
With a single shot, you hit the barrel which promptly explodes, obliterating the nearby skeletons.
One of which drops a piece of parchment.
On the parchment there is a quest...

Sea of Thieves is a well polished multiplayer-only title about adventure. There's plenty of stuff to do, and the game always finds more activities to offer you.
The only downside is that it requires a crew to be viable in PVP (which can't be turned off), and to be effective the crew needs to communicate well. It can be hard to find such crew, so it's best played with friends you know in advance.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",wake tavern replenish ship s_emphasizedupplies food wood cannon ball customize cosmetic talk non give receive map island red cross ship search island world map figure sail unfurl sail turn helm towards destination minute pas middle ocean trying navigate storm water suddenly turn black combat music kick pair tentacle emerge depth wild kraken appears think ship tasty grab handful cannonball storage man cannon placed shot couple shredded tentacle kraken leaf alone repair damage ship water pick kraken meat map short detour towards trading post possible meat skillet cook turn ship towards merchant selling kraken meat set sail towards rest voyage uneventful reach island drop anchor map hand shovel set foot tropical island no_minimap read map orient based landmark eventually place treasure enthusiastically swing shovel sand wood found wooden chest treasure island found pack animated skeleton rather not_take treasure draw sword fight bone notice lone skeleton carry big red barrel gunpowder skipping beat pace draw pistol single shot barrel promptly explodes obliterating nearby skeleton drop piece parchment parchment sea thief polished multiplayer title adventure plenty stuff find activity offer downside requires crew viable pvp turned effective crew need communicate hard crew best friend advance

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Sea of Thieves is a game with a long history of ups and downs,
that have shaped what has now become one of my favorite games of all time.

It's hard to pinpoint what exactly went wrong during the 4 years before the closed beta started,
but to say that, what would eventually be released to the public at a full price, 
would shape the reputation of the game for years to come is an understatement.

Despite all efforts, Rare has been continually fighting the sour preconceived notion
from consumers that have grown cynical from years of being burned by corporate business 
not unlike the initial release of SoT. I'd say that mindset is more than justified.

I believe this game is a massive outlier when it comes to genuine ethical backtracking 
in terms of ongoing work retroactively fixing the game.

Over the past 2 years SoT has recieved close to the most free updates and hard labor of love 
I've ever seen put into a game that never needed it to bring the money in.
Many would say that sort of description already fits games like No Man's Sky, 
but its approach to it and the design decisions are what makes Sea of Thieves stand out.

Unlike NMS, progression in SoT isn't vertical, but horizontal. 
Meaning all of its mechanics can be experienced in the first hour of play 
and will not differ from someone like me, who has played it for over 1000 hours 
on the M$ Store version. 

While this means overall incentive is that not unlike your high score in an arcade game,
if you actually view the game as what is essentially an open world, 
per session arcade experience, the genius behind this design starts making sense.

Every single update the game has received doesn't suffer from the growing pains of any service game that relies on conventional progression systems.
If Rare decides to add a literal grappling hook mechanic to the game 
that lets you hook onto rocks and pull off drift maneuvers, 
you will get to experience that mechanic the moment you log in. 

This is where that approach really shines.

New mechanics aren't just one and done features, every single one of these now gets to be designed to enrich the gameplay loop itself, meaning the developers have full freedom to find all kinds of secondary and primary uses for just a single mechanic.

For example: 

The rowboat was advertised alongside the volcano region in the game, 
but it's not just a tool to savely park your ship away from erupting volcanos.

- Rowboats can be used as a stealth item that lets you hide your ship 
and silently sneak up to another crew to steal all their belongings. 

- If an island holds many treasures, a rowboat is usually the fastest way to gather it all up and bring it back to your ship if you're in a hurry, which you WILL be.

- If your ship sinks, your rowboat remains and you get a second chance to secure your efforts.

- Rowboats also include their own storage space and as of recently are a very reliable source of supplies if you find them on islands. Effectively cutting supply gathering time in half.

This doesn't even touch on how new features retroactively add to previous mechanics as well.
For example, the aforementioned harpoon can be found on certain rowboats as well which, 
if you have it docked on your ship, allows for an entirely new grappling angle.

So yes, Sea of Thieves is a service game. 
As such it has benefited from new content stacked on top of the already existing structure.
Thankfully that structure is incredibly flat and wide, meaning climbing that structure 
to reach said features is non-existent.

This unfortunately means what was already there could hardly be fixed without entirely redesigning the whole structure which has NOT happened. It's still the same game but with most of its holes and gaps being closed up by genuinely great mechanics and content.

Yes, if you played Sea of Thieves on release 
and disliked the ""go from point A to point B, back to A then repeat"" experience,
that has largely been unchanged and the occasional dead air, while now being shorter than ever, will probably still bore you as much as before. 

However when that dead air is gone, you will experience many many more interesting and fun
scenarios with an incredible amount of tools and ways in how you deal with those situations.

The point of this review isn't to just list all the positives and negatives, 
after all you will find plenty of those already, but to explain why people who have stuck with the game all this time consider the new additions it has received to be much more valuable than they might look to someone who's never played it.

Sea of Thieves has proven to not only be one of the most unique 
and fun coop experiences I've ever played, it reminds me of a time 
when Rare took a formula, injected as much of their own personality and charm as they could
and also manage to introduce an incredibly polished and innovative title 
that stands on its own merit... It just took as long as a Steam release to make that happen.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",sea thief long history ups down shaped favorite game hard pinpoint exactly wrong 4 year closed beta started eventually released public price shape reputation year understatement despite effort rare continually fighting sour preconceived notion consumer grown cynical year burned corporate business not_unlike initial release sot mindset justified believe massive outlier come genuine ethical backtracking term ongoing retroactively fixing past 2 year sot recieved close update hard labor love never_needed bring sort description already fit game no_man s_emphasizedky approach design decision make sea thief stand unlike nm progression sot vertical horizontal meaning mechanic experienced not_differ someone 1000 hour store version mean incentive not_unlike high score arcade view essentially open world per session arcade genius design start sense single received suffer growing pain service relies conventional progression system rare decides add literal grappling hook mechanic let hook onto rock pull drift maneuver mechanic moment log approach shine mechanic feature single get designed enrich loop meaning developer freedom kind secondary primary us single mechanic example rowboat advertised alongside volcano region not_just tool savely park ship erupting volcano rowboat stealth let hide ship silently sneak crew steal belonging island hold treasure rowboat usually fastest gather bring ship hurry ship sink rowboat remains chance secure effort rowboat include storage space recently reliable source supply island effectively cutting supply gathering half touch feature retroactively add previous mechanic example aforementioned harpoon found certain rowboat docked ship allows entirely grappling angle yes sea thief service benefited stacked top already existing structure thankfully structure incredibly flat wide meaning climbing structure reach feature non existent unfortunately mean already hardly fixed entirely redesigning structure not_happened s_emphasizedtill hole gap closed genuinely great mechanic yes sea thief release disliked b_emphasizedack repeat largely unchanged occasional dead air shorter probably bore dead air many_emphasized interesting fun scenario incredible tool way deal situation t_emphasizedo positive negative plenty already explain stuck consider addition received valuable look someone never_played sea thief proven not_only unique fun coop experience reminds rare took formula injected personality charm manage introduce incredibly polished innovative title stand merit took long release happen

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. 

BUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the ""pirate life"", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.","Very Positive90% of the 271,826 user reviews for this game are positive.",serious love hate relationship sea thief best game frustrating game wrapped sea thief incredible sailing best feeling exploration discovery blast treasure hunt puzzle mystery unlike feeling cooking mechanic healing food not_terrible fishing mechanic subsystem prop rest unique interesting land based combat relatively uninspired satisfying greater picture present favorite memory gaming completing long night high sea long form available gorgeous best ocean water graphic rest equally beautiful perfectly conveying environment map swear gaben freaking smell wet sand sulfurous lava island music sound design best industry outright incredible sea thief sweaties ruin worse night fun destroyed enjoyment derived eliminating else fun understand pvp pirate life far worst far willing pay hell freaking monthly subscription opportunity sot strictly pve friend rest populated bot actively avoid last session started spawning outpost subsequently sunk 15 foot dock sweaty sunlight obama administration incredibly unpopular opinion greater sot sphere enjoyment game letting player enjoy wish freaking wish enjoy aspect sot fun plaything pirate live ruin fun others

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.

What I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.

First, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*
- What does this mean?
If you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.

Second, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different
- What does this mean?
There are two types of subscriptions. 
The first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.
The second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. 
There are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. 

Third, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character
- What does this mean?
Every character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.

Overall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out.","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",look it_emphasized good great trial probably heard word mouth not_going good thing telling player maybe important version expansion ffxiv square enix directly future expansion mean sale expansion cannot_participate go future expansion not_square frustrating wrong waste double check bought mogstation seeing version type subscription entry standard subscription different type subscription entry subscription 12 99 usd 30 day long get per sever total 8 character subscribing move standard subscription standard subscription starting 14 99 usd 8 charcters per sever total 40 standard subscription option purchase multiple month save long especially addition extra retainer fee completely optional form inventory management third wow class on_emphasizede create swap class changing weapon meaning class come class requires create big draw swapping character real pain yes s_emphasizedtill grinding involved class square wow reading name change race change cheaper remember wow name 10 usd fantasia completely makeover changing race gender nearly else save name 10 usd bought pack 3 5 save good thing top head help re_emphasizedading hope fun trying

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"So I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hours.
Update: 06/22/2017 accumulated about 235 hours and I have payed a month of my Subscription :). I am reupdating this for the Summer Sale for people who want to try this game and also for the StormBlood DLC update. 
Updated 5.5:  09/06/2021 up to date with Shadowbringers

Positive:
-Completly Noob Friendly
-Tons of Content with two DLC's (Heavensward 60)>(Stormblood 70)>(Shadowbringers 80)
-Chocobo,Chocobo and Chocobo racing.
-The brilliant soundtrack is very unique and captivating.
-Multiple classes that this MMO is unique with is having 1 character and being able to switch classes
- The one major thing that also makes this unique, is that in FFXIV, there is no rush in this game. You can be what you want to be and you are not forced to do anything else.

Community:The community is amazing in certain perspectives that is actually more better than most MMO's. What makes this community so unique is just the cycle of players that are willing to help new players. Yes this is normal in all MMO's but in FFXIV we aren't forced to help new players but instead we choose to. That;s what makes this community so nice. Not all Communities are perfect or imperfect but the majority of this one is decently kind.

Heavily Story Reliant: Most MMO's always fail to captivate the player of the story in general. FFXIV is very unique in it's own standpoint that the developers actually put so much development and depth into this story that just makes you enjoy it . Also being that this is probably the longest story in all Final Fantasy Genres. This is probably the only MMO that can potentially make you cry just from the story. That is how good it is.

Dungeons/Trials/24 man raid/ Hardcore raids:

Dungeons: Pretty generic even in this MMO that there isn't really much to say about honestly. Maps are very unique in it's own sense even the mobs and bosses with their unique skills. Though each map will have it's soundtrack included.
Trials: Trials are Bosses that you will face during the Main story or a side quest. You will be with a party of 8 facing this trial. Every Trial is unique with it's own soundtrack. Though trials are not difficult, there are Trials:Extreme which increases the difficulties making it twice as hard.
Alliance raids: 24 man raids are pretty much 24 players clearing a dungeon with multiple bosses. It's not difficult but you will die a lot. These 24 man raids also consists of the Nier raid in the most recent Shadowbringers update. 
Savage raids:These are your hardcore raids. They are about equivalent to Mythic raids in WoW. But, you are in a party of 8 of what you do is important. Everyone has to work together and synchronize too be able clear this content. The amount of time varies but in the most extreme hardcore raiders it can take them a 5-7 days to clear but for normal players it can take them 2-3 weeks.  There is also a 48 man savage content that released in the Eureka content.
Ultimate raids: Thought savage was hard? There are currently 3 Ultimate raids. Ultimate raids make's savage content look like a joke. These are for the hardcore players that want to take it too the next level. Ultimate fights can last for about 15-18 minutes. Each passing second or minute, there is always a new mechanic that is very unique. This type of content take up to possibly more than 60+ hours. Being it can take you more than 1-3 months just to clear 1 ultimate. Though yes it's hard. But that is what makes this so much fun. The reward is that you will get a ultimate title and a unique ultimate weapon. But it's worth it.

Graphics: Even with a Low end PC you can still run this game smoothly. For Medium-High End PC. A lot of people tend to not like this aesthetic of graphics because of the anime type graphics but it really seems to fit.

Free Companies: Aka guilds- Finding a very dedicated FC that is willing to work with their own community is fun. Being able to host events and sometimes do raids and obtaining benefits makes FC's worth going to. Joining a FC or getting into the community can help you not get bored but can significantly make your FFXIV experience better.

Enternal Bondings:  So this is basically a Marriage system that can help boost the XP gain of two of the couples are together in this game and a Chocobo and YES there are actual relationships between players but don't try to take it serious as a relationship game.

Housing: You can have you're own house or a FC house that are limited in each server.  There are even crafters that can craft housing items or just be able to have you're own garden. You have your own section of an area where you would run into other players that could be your neighbor or another FC.

Golden Saucer: Pretty much a land of Mini-games that has good decent amount of games to play like Chocobo Racing or Card games. People actually seem to enjoy this content that they sometimes live in it. They have unique glamours or mounts as rewards.

Gear: Gears can be obtained from doing raids, dungeons or crafting. Every gear in this game unique. There are people who actually farm gear just for glamour that just looks really cool too be being very gorgeous or just very funny.

Eureka: Pretty much Legendary weapons or armor that have their own signature look and stats that can be used for endgame content. This usually takes about 1-3 weeks to be able to obtain 1 weapon but can vary on the time.  They are very grindy content.

Classes: You will have a single character with multiple classes to change into.So this means you do not need to make another character. There are 10 DPS, 4 Tanks, 3Healers, 7 Crafters, and 3 Gathers. Each job is very unique in terms of playstyle. You can be good with a specific class. But you will see a huge difference in terms of skill of the class you play too someone who plays the same class as you. This means even though you know your class. You haven't mastered it being there are rotations.

Leveling: Leveling: Leveling can completely vary on the methods that players use. But it can probably take about 1- 3 weeks or maybe less to max a DPS/Healer/Tank class. For Crafters and Gathers it can take probably a few hours to 2 weeks that can vary. Leveling doesn't feel slow or fast. It's just very moderate.

Crafters/gathering: Probably the most unique and yet rewarding content. There are tons of crafting recipes and gathering. Compared to other MMO's where Crafting and gathering are just sub-classes. In this game they can be a main class for players. Each crafter's are unique. Culinarian makes food for buffs even raids. Carpenter's can make housing materials. These are classes that can make you money and gear and being a crafter and gather is like playing a different game too where you can put infinite hours into this.

Negatives:
Monthly Payment: This is a subscription based MMO. But one thing in mind is that, if you do buy the steam version, you can purchase subscription with steam credits But this is how the game is still alive and healthy.

The story length: You will feel beyond rushed. The story is good and it's amazing. But too other players they want to reach the endgame content. If you are the type of player that only wants to play endgame and do raids. Then this is probably the biggest.

Conclusion:
You are not forced to follow a linear path in this game. You can be what you want to be is what makes this game feel so alive. You can be a hardcore player or a casual but you are not forced. This game is started to become more mainstream now and it's always great to have new players. To be honest this game feels like WoW when it became popular when Wrath of the Litch King was released.(Not a hate rant). This game feels like it has more content than GW2 endgame. Both are amazing MMO's but, Final Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that filled the void of my heart from what an MMO should be.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I feel like I can write at least a small review with 5 thousand hours in the game so here we go. 

Tldr: It's great, the best mmo in my opinion out there. Good music, dungeons, story and awesome community. Rocky start but starts to get better after the first expansion.

Alright so let's start with the base and go up. A Real Reborn, the base game you get is easily the longest and grueling at times. Quests that make you go fetch things from A to B, talk to this person etc. However, it still has some good points. 
    -The experience you get from doing the main story quests can keep you up to date for dungeon requirements. Some even give you gear so you don't need to throw your gil (In game currency) at the Market Board (player shop). 
   -Before the first dungeon you get the choice of having a tutorial on the basics of your current role (Tank, Healer or DPS.). Each training focuses on the general tasks your role does. The rewards you get are gear that lasts until lvl 20 and a ring that grants you XP until lvl 25 or lvl 30.
   -When you reach lvl 20-ish it starts to open up its world by having you travel around the continent. This is where you get some world building lore, the struggles of each nation, how the events prior to your arrival transpired and affected them along with some politics. 
   -It's beginner raids are new player friendly. Instead of having 8 people you have 4 which can be a good thing. 

There are other good points out there but I will let you decide on them. Now, with ARR done, let's give a look at what is to come. Spoiler free of course. 
   The first expansion, Heavensward, introduces new things to the fray like mechanics, locations and it starts the addition of flying in each zone with whatever mount you want! Aside from those it features an engaging soundtrack that changes with each phase making the fights more fun and epic. Worthy of the title you have been bestowed upon back in A Real Reborn. What it also brings are 3 new classes: Dark Knight, Astrologian and Machinist. All three are accessible once you start the Heavensward expansion but start at a lower level than its entry level. 
  -Dark Knight: A tank class that is seen edgy due to its use of ""inner darkness of your soul"" but a fun one and useful. 
  - Astrologian: You use the stars and tarot cards to heal and buff your allies. Another fun class, especially if you enjoy multitasking. 
  -Machinist: A ranged physical dps that uses guns and turrets. It's fairly simple to play as and can get powerful later on. 
Heavensward is seen as one of the best of the currently 3 expansions because of its story and I am inclined to agree. After finishing A Real Reborn, Heavensward will leave you very satisfied with how the game evolved. But it does not end there.

With Heavensward out of the way, Stormblood! Like before, it adds new mechanics and music along with two new areas, both having zones that you can enable flying in. With it comes 2 new classes this time, both DPS. 
  -Red Mage: Your fencer mage that uses both black and white magic to fight and support their allies. Heal and bring back your allies like a semi-healer in battles or focus on dealing damage while looking stylish! It's part of their persona. 
  -Samurai: Your sword wielding fighter from the Far East, which some of you might laugh at because of its name. Simple in gameplay but once you reach a higher level and learn its gimmicks you can see yourself dishing out large amounts of damage.
Stormblood is considered the good-ish one of the trio. I see it as an expansion that deviates a bit from the action of Heavensward and goes deeper in terms of other topics. 

And now, the latest expansion. Shadowbringers!
This expansion was one that left many players with their mouth agaped, sat at the edge of their seat and with their heart clenched. I shall leave the reasons to you! Minor advice: Buckle up. Things go to another level. As before, new zones with unlockable flying.
 Shadowbringers also brings to the fold 2 new classes: Gunbreaker and Dancer. A tank and a DPS. 
  -Gunbreaker: The small brother of Warrior that focuses on swift movements and big damage. It's skills are designed for fast gameplay, the player having 3 sets of combos: One for gathering ""Cartridges"" followed by a combo that uses a cartridge and another one that uses the 2nd combo. Confused? So was I but it comes around. A good description would be: Devil May Cry but tab target style. 
  -Dancer: It does what its name implies. With a combo that is half dependent on RNG, the dancer swoops in with its buff by performing steps with their Dance Partner, increasing both of their damage as the timer goes down. At later levels you can buff the party members around yourself, also increasing their damage. With their Dance Partner they can buff and heal each other and those around them. 


Now for another part of this review. You have noticed that I have mentioned repeatedly that you can fly, yes? Well that is because I have been saving words for this segment!
 
World Building! 

Each expansion gives the players new elements to the lore behind the universe of FFXIV. From the customs of each area and its people to civilizations long past to heroes of eld and gods once worshiped. The game introduces this through its story and many other quests. 

Questing! 

From Heanvensward and onward there is a trend that has been established with how the Main Quests work. It's pacing can be like this: First quest with the entry level is the introduction of the expansion followed by the next level being a dungeon you go in. The next quest can involve a solo instance where you fight along side NPC's in a revisited dungeon or a specially made area for it. And then another dungeon or trial. The cycle repeats like this to keep the player engaged and not go through another ARR slogfest.

Music!

The music is by far the best in my opinion. The composer, Masayoshi Soken, has a clear grasp on what to implement in this category so the player can enjoy doing the content. From slow motifs to full on pieces in which make you question yourself if you are in a battle of life or death or at an opera/concert. Many fall in love with the music in it and choose to do content because of it! Myself included. 

Community!
It has been said a lot of times that the community of FFXIV is really welcoming and well mannered. I stand to agree to that but I won't let it be sugarcoated that much. We have problems like many other MMO's and games that have you play with real people have. If I would be correct to assume, the reason behind this big point that has been brought so many times is because we choose to be kind because the developers are also kind. It's a paying forward sort of deal. At least that is how I see it.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Played WoW for 16 years or so. Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop. Dont regret a single minute of it. Cant wait to start the actual expansions though. Already recommended to all of my friends that play WoW.


!!Update!! 

100 Hours more played later. Im completely addicted. Still have yet to hit the first expansion. Just content everywhere I look. I cant remember the last time I genuinely woke up or got home from work and was excited about actually sitting down continuing an adventure on a game or just to have pure fun and enjoyment. One of best communities I have had the pleasure of starting to be a part of as well. Experience is still amazing for me so far. And I know its just going to get better and better. Cant wait!

!!Update!!
Well i am currently sitting at 340 hours or so played now. Nothing has change I am loving this. I actually just hit the first expansion Heavensward and good lord they were not kidding. Dont get me wrong i didnt mind a realm reborn... but wow just wow did they step it up in the first expansion. the cut scenes the first new Main city i am obssessed and in love with and the music that comes along with it. Most of the cast from ARR has new voice actors and damn they are good. I just scratched the surface of Heavensward and with it already shocking me how good this is getting I cant even imagine Stormblood or Shadowbringers. I can honestly say even heavensward has put WoW shadowlands to shame in all terms of story especially and cut scenes even landscape and music its just overall beautiful and being the big game of thrones fan I am the dragons and all that feel to it is just great. Its definitely not a suprise why they add heavensward into the free trial because they know after you touch that expansion you wont want to stop! :) 

Overall Take it from Me a WoW 16 year vet even with a WoW tattoo irl on my arm i lived breathed and slept WoW. I have yet to even miss a single patch or anything. Even with 9.1 that just came out yesterday while sitting here playing this now. I dont even question myself for a single second about going back anytime soon or resubbing. I am having an overall amazing experience so far and it has been keeping me completely busy and satisfied. I can honestly say this is the very first game in my life that has kept me away from World of Warcraft and for me thats a huge statement and win.

415 hours in or so. I should of easily been at Stormblood by now but i just keep getting side tracked into doing everything else in the game. Been leveling the Dark Knight up to 60 now and Finishing heavensward on him. Amazing class. Super fun story for the class as well. Machinest was my main until I recently started going Dark Knight crazy. The instant dungeon ques for tank are also a plus! And damn the Dark Knight gear just looks so good especially swinging around the big two hander feels so good as well. I should be hitting Stormblood soon though for sure as long as I dont get side tracked anymore. But honestly Im still genuinely happy and just having a blast playing this game honestly the longer it takes me to get to the other expansions the better. It is nothing like WoW where its just a strict grind fest as fast as you can to end game. Nah. Its just completely enjoy the game and have fun and do whatever you want and take your time!. Good stuff.

!!Update!!
Finally Finished Heavensward and Ill put this as simply and quick as I can. Amazing Story. Amazing Music. Just hooks you in and makes you connect with every character in the story it felt like I was just watching and getting to know every character like a full season of a show that just hooks you in. Some cutscenes were just an overall thrill and joy and by the end was hitting me in my feels haha. Simply just landed a spot in my top 10 stories of video games that I have experienced in my life.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I play MMOs. It's my thing. It's what I like to do. I've tried many. Most disappoint me. This one did not, as you can probably tell by my ever-increasing total playtime. 

The game most comparative to [b]Final Fantasy 14[/b] (FF14), to many people's annoyance, is [b]World of Warcraft[/b] (WoW). They are both 'theme park' style MMOs, and they both use simple, action-based, 'TAB-targeting' combat. The similarities are vast, I can assure you, but they are also obvious. I can split hairs, talk about WoW's reactive, fast paced style versus FF14's slow, prepared style, but to anyone who has played both at the higher levels, it's fairly self-evident. The games are very similar as massively multiplayer online role-playing games, with simple mechanics and easy-to-enter natures (as well as raised cost-of-entries).

I think one of the only things I can offer to the discussion involving this game is my perspective. I have experienced as many aspects of this game as I can. I played the story attentively, I watched every cutscene, I leveled a healer, tank and a dps to 80 (the current max), and I gathered and crafted for way too long. 

This is a [i]weird[/i] game. The community is strange, in that they are as helpful as they are awkward. People will gladly help you for nothing, then ask that you visit them in their home (which is often just a hot tub next to a bed). They have odd customs, like saying 'o7' at the start of dungeons (which is supposed to be a salute). Everyone cares how they look, but doesn't care what you think about how they look. Playing songs in the plazas, erotic roleplay in the alleys, and bots asking you to buy gil are common sights. 

The story is set into whats called the Main Scenario, split by expansion. You have to play through [b]all the present and past story[/b] to catch up. This is [i]incredibly[/i] time consuming. If you play like I did over the last year, it is unlikely you can get to Shadowbringers (the current expansion) within one month of game time. Luckily, [b]the free trial is extremely good now[/b]. They recently changed it to be that you can play through the initial release content (A Realm Reborn), all for free, forever. 

Speaking of [b]A Realm Reborn[/b] (ARR), it's painfully average. The story is as well paced as paint drying, and because of the way item/level scaling works, there is no meaningful challenges. Granted, there aren't [i]supposed[/i] to be, but it is disappointing. The plot comes to a grinding halt a number of times, and sometimes there isn't even a plot, just you doing weird, forgettable jobs for weird, forgettable people. If you tried this game and left because of how slow ARR is, I can't blame you. It's a slog. But if you stick around, [b]the last arc[/b] of ARR was relatively enjoyable, finally arriving at some of the crazy style Final Fantasy is more known for. 

After ARR, (and after you pay for the game), comes [b]Heavensward[/b] (HW), the Wrath of the Lich King of this game. I cannot express to you how surprised I was by the sharp quality increase here. It's remarkable. The story picks up in a new kingdom, dropping most of the old characters for a story about an oncoming dragon war, set in a genuinely interesting nation. The first time I truly took notice of the music in FF14 was when I entered this expansion, it's phenomenal, and consistently so throughout. The quests become stripped of tedious 'Slay 10 _', and are paced very well, keeping a feeling of tension as you progress that was never present in ARR. If you've ever heard someone say 'stick around FF14, it gets good', this is why. Unfortunately, it is followed by...

[b]Stormblood[/b] (SB). If Heavensward is like WotLK, then Stormblood is like Warlords of Draenor. Everything I just praised HW for took several steps back during this story. Old characters are brought to the light screaming and kicking, some given literal rewrites to force them to fit in, and newer characters struggle to make an impact. The music fails to keep me engaged as well, matching equally uninteresting environments Plots are jump-started, then the brakes are cut as they tumble down a hill. While the questing is still better than ARR, it's not by much anymore. The truly cool moments are so few and far between a deep, deep ocean of truly unfulfilling questing. It's really unfortunate, I really liked a few of the characters they introduce here, and 2 of the zones they introduce are among the best the game has, with a small plot about a rebellion I truly enjoyed. Those aspects are just mashed inside of a larger, more boring plot about a different rebellion.

Fortunately for me, [b]Shadowbringers[/b] (ShB) was everything I hoped for. If HW is WotLK, and SB is WoD, than Shadowbringers is, I guess, kind of like Legion. Honestly, the WoW expansion comparisons start to break down here. If you are looking into this game, at some point you probably heard that Shadowbringers is good. You probably also have some healthy skepticism and some tempered expectations. I'm here to assure you that Shadowbringers is not so good that it's worth playing through all of what I just described, AND a $60+ price tag. But it's pretty close. This expansions reworks a lot of old characters and plots into a surprisingly touching and insightful story, making one of the most trite and lifeless antagonistic forces in the game into strangely sympathetic villains. The themes through the story are strong, and conveyed in honestly intuitive ways. [b]The music[/b] is unbelievably good. One or two areas have some weaker themes, but the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG5qx583Uys]dungeons[/url] and raids have absolutely stunning scores. The area designs are lacking, in my opinion, but they are easy to traverse, and, well, it's very subjective. 

A few closing remarks, organized in no particular order.

The [b]class design and feel[/b] is pretty good. Each class feels very distinct, and the meta is tight, with, and I know this is hard to believe, every class performing well. It's very well balanced on the PvE side.

The [b]PvP[/b] in this game is, and this is being generous, [i]awful[/i]. It's poorly balanced, it's map design is shoddy, and it's not very rewarding in terms of character progression, if at all. It can be fun in short doses because it is chaotic, but playing it anymore than that is frustrating. 

The [b]fashion[/b] in FF14 is one of the main aspects of the players who stick around. It's easy to track down what you want, and there is a wide variety of styles to pursue.

The [b]cash shop[/b], also known as the Mogstation, is quite prevalent. Not in the sense that you are forced to visit it, or that you have to to get an advantage, just that many, many people use it. Premium costumes and emotes are frequent, as well as sales. It doesn't bother me much, but I mention it because it can be annoying to see someone wearing a cool set, only to discover it cost them $12. 

The [b]account management[/b] is awful. The website to manage your subscription and account details is ancient, slow, and prone to problems. The [b]customer support[/b] as well is slow, but I have found them to be at the very least helpful and patient. Also...

The [b]Steam version[/b] of this game is prone to account issues. I recommend the stand-alone version (which actually goes on sale more often). It's too late for me in this regard.


All and all, I find Final Fantasy XIV a rewarding way to waste my time. I often find myself just standing in places, talking with my friends and/or strangers I happen to meet in-game. I recommend this to anyone who wants a relaxed MMO with a flair for the dramatic.","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",mmos tried disappoint not_as probably tell increasing total playtime comparative final fantasy 14 ff14 annoyance world warcraft wow theme park style mmos simple action based tab targeting combat similarity vast assure obvious split hair talk wow reactive fast paced style versus ff14 s_emphasizedlow prepared style higher level fairly self evident game similar massively multiplayer online role game simple mechanic easy enter nature raised cost entry thing offer discussion involving perspective experienced aspect attentively watched cutscene leveled healer tank dp 80 max gathered crafted long weird community strange helpful awkward gladly help ask visit home hot tub next bed odd custom saying o7 dungeon supposed salute care look care look song plaza erotic roleplay alley bot asking gil common sight set whats called scenario split expansion present past catch i_emphasizedncredibly consuming last unlikely shadowbringers expansion luckily trial extremely good recently changed initial release realm reborn forever speaking realm reborn arr painfully average paced paint drying scaling work no_meaningful challenge granted supposed disappointing plot come grinding halt number time plot weird forgettable job weird forgettable tried left slow arr blame slog stick last arc arr relatively enjoyable finally arriving crazy style final fantasy known arr pay come heavensward hw wrath lich king cannot_express surprised sharp quality increase remarkable pick kingdom dropping old character oncoming dragon war set genuinely interesting nation truly took notice music ff14 entered expansion phenomenal consistently throughout quest stripped tedious slay 10 _ paced keeping feeling tension progress never_present arr heard someone stick ff14 get good unfortunately followed stormblood sb heavensward wotlk stormblood warlord draenor praised hw took step old character brought light screaming kicking given literal rewrite force fit newer character struggle impact music fails engaged matching equally uninteresting environment plot started brake cut tumble hill questing arr not_by anymore truly cool moment far deep_emphasized ocean truly unfulfilling questing unfortunate liked character introduce 2 zone introduce best small plot rebellion truly enjoyed aspect mashed inside larger boring plot different rebellion fortunately shadowbringers shb hoped hw wotlk sb wod shadowbringers guess kind legion honestly wow expansion comparison break probably heard shadowbringers good probably healthy skepticism tempered expectation assure shadowbringers not_so good worth described 60 price tag pretty close expansion reworks old character plot surprisingly touching insightful trite lifeless antagonistic force strangely sympathetic villain the_emphasizedmes strong conveyed honestly intuitive way music unbelievably good area weaker theme url http www youtube com watch v ag5qx583uys dungeon url raid stunning score design lacking opinion easy traverse subjective closing remark organized no_particular order class design pretty good class feel distinct meta tight hard believe class performing balanced pve side pvp generous awful i_emphasizedt poorly balanced map design shoddy not_very rewarding term progression fun short dos chaotic anymore frustrating fashion ff14 aspect player stick easy track wide variety style pursue cash shop known mogstation prevalent not_in sense forced visit to_emphasized advantage many_emphasized premium costume emotes frequent sale bother mention annoying someone wearing cool set discover cost 12 management awful website manage subscription detail ancient slow prone problem customer support slow found helpful patient version prone issue recommend stand alone version go sale late regard final fantasy xiv rewarding waste standing place talking friend stranger happen meet recommend want relaxed massively multiplayer online flair dramatic
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"[h1] Sum up[/h1]

+ A single character can learn all classes and jobs in the game.
+ Insane variety of content, even without the expansions. Up to 2000 hours easily.
+ An MMO that starts simple, looks appealing and raises the difficulty in later levels.
+ Dungeons, bosses and raids look amazing, featuring rich details and lots of effects.
+ Community is very social and they enjoy helping other players in anything they need.
+ Party finder for those lacking a party going solo, as well as other features to keep players together and make it easy to connect.

-  Monthly subscription can repel new players.
- Lots of content to do in order to catch up with the latest expansions.
- Early parts of the game can be quite dull and boring, though it gets much better.
- The duties which are solo instances can break a party temporally and be bothersome.
- Later in the game, it becomes a trial and error experience when battling new bosses and exploring new dungeons.

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is an MMO game base on the series with the same name. It features elements from all the entries and creates a huge world filled with lots of things to do. What set it apart from other MMO’s is that it looks visually appealing, that its system is easy to learn but hard to master and that it has a lot of versatility when it comes to its players. It is a fluid system with a good amount of room to explore and take it easy.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The gameplay features common elements of what an MMO would have. Players do quests in order to gain exp and level up, once they do they are able to queue up for dungeons, trials(bosses) and raids which they can battle together with friends or with other players through the party finder, which works like a charm.

Each player is required to choose a class, then at lv 30, that class will become a job. Job is a more specialized class. Depending on the class the player chooses, gameplay will vary and while it would be impossible to mention all of them in a review, I will give some examples. Classes are divided into three roles:

[h1] Healers [/h1]

Their job is to keep their fellow peers alive through the art of healing. They can range from the classic white mage with lots of healing spells, to a more offensive approach with the scholar who has damaging spells. Players can also opt to get a mix of both with astrologian, which depends on the high skill of the player and some RGN but features the higher arrange of abilities.

[h1] DPS (Damage dealers) [/h1]

They are the ones who kill the monsters. DPS is the role with more classes in the game and they feature different types of jobs such as black mages, which enjoy lots of damaging spells but lack utility, to bards who can buff their whole party with beneficial effects while keeping up damage or ninjas, who mix different kinds of abilities to generate powerful ninjutsu.

[h1] Tanks [/h1]

The heart of the party, they always must protect their fragile party members and be the shield that guards the realm of men. Like their description says, they keep everyone out of harm's way by provoking monster, rushing to deploy barriers or just being a pain for bosses to get rid of in general. Tanks will redirect all the damage towards them so that the healers and dps’s can do their jobs without preoccupying about dying.


Is the mix of all these roles that create a functioning party, and with the finder, you are always guaranteed to get a good balance of all of them. Each of these roles is equally important as they are pieces of a greater whole. The healers keep everyone alive, the DPS kills the enemies and the tanks keep the other two out of harm's way. No matter which role you choose, you will always be important for your party.

Speaking of side activities, there is another type of roles I haven’t mentioned yet. These are the disciples of the hand and the disciples of the hand. In these fields, players can find classes ranging from blacksmiths to fishermen or even culinarian! These jobs tend to break the normal pace of the game and offer a more relaxing environment. They might sound boring at first, but players often find themselves lost in them for hours. Once you get going, you just want to do more, and they are beneficial to yourself and your other classes.

If you are a culinarian, for example, you can make your own food which allows you to get bonus exp modifiers. If you are a blacksmith or an armorer, you can craft your own weapons and armors to use in your other classes. If you are a fisherman, you can sell the fish for lots of money on the player market and well, who doesn’t love fishing in a game?

[h1] Story [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a game that takes its story very personal and treats it with the utmost care. It does start pretty boring and dull but catches up fast and it can feel like watching a series or a movie. The richest stories are in the expansions, unfortunately, but these are quite enjoyable, filled with lots of believable characters, conflicts, development and more.

 Reading all of it or catching up to the latest expansions can be quite daunting, so if you are not into spending a lot of time reading/watching cutscenes, you can always skip them and rewatch them later at an inn’s room. There are also plenty of summaries only that are well written and consist of thirty to an hour reading material per expansion (game+2 expansions= 3 hours of reading total) so feel free to skip it if you do find it boring or exhausting to sit through. Do however note that the story is one of the strongest points of the game.

[h1] Some Notes [/h1]

The game runs well on any system that meets the requirements. Some areas might decrease your fps depending on your settings and the sheer amount of player characters that are present in the zone but fret not, this is not a big issue by any means. Duties can be bothersome when you are at a party with friends but are overall enjoyable. Probably the easiest MMO to get into has a UI that the player can adjust to fit their playstyle or needs and the game lacks any sort of pay to win or in-game advantage bought with real money, only shortcuts for those that simply don’t have a lot of time.

[h1] What Makes It Special [/h1]

What makes Final Fantasy XIV special is that it is well balanced when it comes to all the classes and jobs. That it looks more realistic when compared to its peers and that it features a dynamic, fluent system with that is easy to use but hard to master. By sharing all classes across one character, the player will never need to go back to the start of the game in they decide that maybe that class they picked, in the beginning, wasn’t the one for them. 

The game makes an effort to make fights different from one another. Players can find themselves fighting in Rubik's cube, getting devours by a Cerberus and fighting the beast from its stomach or even getting split from their bodies and have to move across a labyrinth of AOE’s in order to go back into them and continue the fight. There is always something new in waiting for the player in the next encounter. 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Final Fantasy XIV is a fantastic MMO, it is filled with great amounts of content and different ice breakers to teach new players how to play and hold their hands until they can go by themselves into the wild worlds of Eorzea. There are a bunch of side activities to break the normal pace of the game and have some fun if you are ever tired from questing, and each dungeon or trial keep adding new mechanics, keeping the game entertaining and making you wonder what you will encounter in your next adventure. I recommend this game to those that haven’t experienced an MMO, and to those that have as well.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I'm incredibly happy to see the injection of new players after WoW shat the bed with Shadowlands and 9.1. I played WoW for nearly a decade of my life and through every expansion to endgame, and I have to say that Blizzard doesn't hold a candle to ANYTHING Square Enix has pushed out for FFXIV. Allow me to explain, starting with the cons of FFXIV:

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
[*] Buying the game can be frustrating. There are two methods: through Steam or through Square Enix's websites. If you buy it on one platform you cannot use it on the other. [strike]I [b] HIGHLY [/b] recommend looking something up to walk you through it.[/strike] Square Enix has updated their website and the Mogstation to make it easier to purchase the game and the expansions through their client. I recommend taking this route rather than through Steam.
[/list]

[h1] The Middling [/h1]
Now, this isn't necessarily a negative, but some might think so.
[list]
[*] This is a story-driven game. It can be difficult to play with friends to go through quests since many of the main story quests will have you go into an instance by yourself. There are hundreds of hours of main story quests (it's thicc af), and almost all of it is good; however, some expansions are better than others and each have their own theme and build off of each other. ARR (vanilla) is arguably the worst, but begins to pick up about halfway through, and the rest of the expansions are excellent with Shadowbringers being one of the best narratives I've seen in an MMORPG. The newest expansion, Endwalker, has surpassed Shadowbringers in terms of story quality in my opinion.
[*] You can skip entire portions of story quests by purchasing story skips from the Mogstation. If you have disposable income and don't really care for the story, then you can buy these. You can also purchase cosmetics, orchestration rolls, housing items, and emotes via the cash-shop in the Mogstation. I personally never look at these because there is an abundance of content in the game already.
[*] Add-ons are against the terms of service since PC players and console players are playing together and add-ons that affect the game's code create unfair gameplay between the two. However, the game functions just fine without them.
[*] Buying the current expansion also unlocks all of the expansions before it. However, the same rules apply as it does setting up your account. You have to buy the base game [b]and[/b] the expansion on the same platform otherwise it won't work.

[h1] The Good/Excellent [/h1]
As previously stated, I've played WoW for years, and the following game mechanics and features completely outstrip WoW in terms of functionality and enjoyment.
[list]
[*] [b] Your character can be every single class and profession (in FFXIV terms, jobs) and you can switch between them with literally a click of your mouse. [/b] This game respects your time immensely. Tired of playing the Archer/Bard? No problem! Switch on over to your Gladiator/Paladin and nothing changes except your class. Not only that, but classes receive something called an Armory Bonus that increases experience gained up to your maximum leveled class.
[*] Classes are all unique and morph into specialized classes. Class categories share a small pool of general abilities, like basic defensives or casting modifiers.
[*] There are daily quests, mostly in the form of Beast Tribe dailies. You can do 12 of these a day, and they reward you with unique currency that you can spend at the factions along with reputation. It might sound like a small amount of dailies, but the reputation gain is proportional. And better yet, flying isn't gated behind getting reputation with these factions (thank god). The reason this is a pro is due to the fact that it holds no bearing on anything else in the game and nothing is locked behind it (other than faction-specific mounts and pets and whatnot).
[*] The subscription is cheaper than WoW, and they give you veteran rewards every few months that you're subscribed.
[*] Chocobo racing and Gold Saucer nonsense. Be sure the play the mini and jumbo Cactpot (I call the jumbo Cactpot the Cuckedpot though because you'll never win the jackpot).
[*] The UI is entirely customizable down to the colors of enemy and friendly health bars. No need for an add-on or anything to change stuff around.
[*] Random drops exist, but that's not really the focus of the gear game, especially at end game content. Many duties (FFXIV's equivalent to dungeons and raids) will reward you with both random drops and tokens or currency to trade in for [b] specific [/b] pieces of gear. This means you don't have to grind the same raid or trial for the specific drop for weeks, and instead just buy an equivalent piece instead.
[*] Gearing up a class at endgame is incredibly fast so that you can get into the meat and potatoes of the hardcore raiding content.
[*] The duties are all unique and bosses rarely repeat mechanics from other duties. Most of the duties don't have artificial difficulty scalers, like arbitrarily more health or damage. Instead, bosses rely on complex and interesting mechanics. Savage, Extreme, Unreal, and Ultimate boss fights will also scale with health and damage and will require a certain DPS check, but when you're doing these you know what you're in for and what is required.
[*] Duties have their own unique soundtrack, and many bosses also have unique soundtracks and battle music. Honestly, most of it is top tier music.
[*] Almost all previous content is brought forward into the new expansion or content patch. Dungeons from ARR still reward currency that is usable at max level. Some unique content from previous expansions are expanded on and given new activities to do. Gear/stat scaling is applied in a remarkably balanced way. Square Enix routinely patches current and past content, all the way back to 2.0 (ARR vanilla).
[*] The game is pretty. Gear sets are unique to each dungeon, trial, or raid, and many have dyeable versions that can be crafted (I'm looking at you, WoW, with your reskinned gear sets from every dungeon in an expansion). Most harder difficulty content of the same duty rewards equipment that looks completely different from the previous difficulty, or they follow a certain theme. Regardless, the equipment will look different and rarely is it recolored.
[*] Raids and trials aren't long endeavors that take hours upon hours to complete, or even days. Almost all of them can be completed in less than an hour, and if you're there for more than an hour then you're doing something very very wrong.
[*] The crafting in this game is just [i] chef kiss.[/i] The same materials are used more or less throughout the whole game and can be farmed very easily. Not only that, but the game incentivizes you to use the crafting abilities to make high-quality craftables. In fact, it gives you the option to craft it quickly or take your time to really get that good good. There are also a few different types of crafting activities that involve items that are classified as collectables and reward special currency for nifty mounts, minions (pets), and cosmetics.
[*] The list goes on, but go see for yourself. The free trial includes ARR and the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions to the amount of time played. There are, however, some restrictions regarding social functions and in-game marketboard stuff.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Edit: TL:DR 
Best MMORPG I've ever played, definitely worth checking out. One character, ALL content including classes, jobs etc. BASE GAME AND FIRST EXPANSION ARE NOW FREE TO PLAY, with some restrictions. 

BTW. I have made some updates to this review to reflect patches.

I gave up WoW (or World of Warcraft) For this game. Why? You only need one character to play every class. [strike]The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs.[/strike] (Edit: They changed this feature not too long ago to make all classes self contained. They still level up into Jobs but you are no longer required to have a sub class to unlock the Job.) 

You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 95% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF! You don't have to be in a guild or part of a clique. The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive (on some realms...like Molboro!). 

Dungeons are part of a finder in game. There is also a personal/free company housing system that allows you to have a space to show off and decorate in. As of Shadowbringers, dungeons in end game can now be done with a Trust system where you run with NPCs. There was also an update to squadrons that let you do up to heavensward with a handpicked NPC group.

The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing. The (original) opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words. Square has really outdone themselves with this title and I can't wait to see how they wow me with FFXV!

Edit: As per a commented question, The sub options come in 30/90/180 day increments and can be set up as recurring (thanks Pasty858). 180 days is roughly $78.
As a further Edit: The sub is required to access the game and comes in two types, one that allows only one character per realm (all that is really needed) and one that lets you have up to 8 (I think) characters per realm (for the altoholics). The 1 character per realm Sub is less expensive.

Also, anyone who would like to share in the recruit a friend benefits, message me.

SO! Its been a while since I've played. after logging over 200 hours that weren't counted on here, and doing everything short of Savage content, I have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again. But this game. The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming. It was amazing! 

Edit as of Dec 12, 2020
I'm now playing on the Ps4 as well as Pc, have logged another 1000 hours and am almost endgame again, I was not thrilled with Stormblood but Shadowbringers is amazing so far!


If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month ([strike]or 14day[/strike] trial now goes up to heavensward content, see below) trial period!

A note to anyone new, the free trial is now available all the way up through level 60 and the first expansion Heavensward! I'm not sure how long the trial lasts, but it free to anyone and now is the best time to jump in! Exp has been increased, Main Storyline Quests have been optimized and new Jobs have been added.

I would like to add a note, now that I have finished MSQ for Shadowbringers, please don't level skip. If you do, please at least go back and learn basics. If you're not interested in the story, fine but don't let that stop you from being the best you can be at your chosen role. Thank you in advance!","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",tl dr best mmorpg definitely worth checking including class job base expansion restriction btw update reflect patch gave wow world warcraft class strike class build eachother add diversity style upgade role focused job strike changed not_too long ago class self contained job no_longer required sub class unlock craft gear food 95 guild clique shockingly friendly supportive realm molboro dungeon finder personal company housing allows space decorate shadowbringers dungeon trust npc squadron heavensward handpicked non group line epic cinematics breathtakeing original opening video tear knew happening word square outdone title wait wow ffxv per commented question sub option 30 90 180 increment set recurring thanks pasty858 180 day roughly 78 sub required access come type allows per realm needed let 8 character per realm altoholics 1 per realm sub expensive share recruit friend benefit message logging 200 hour counted short savage never_thought tug heart string recent msq line keep punch coming amazing dec 12 2020 ps4 pc logged 1000 hour endgame not_thrilled stormblood shadowbringers amazing far love ff game strike 14day strike trial go heavensward trial period note trial available 60 expansion heavensward not_sure long trial last best exp increased storyline quest optimized job add note finished msq shadowbringers please skip please learn basic not_interested fine best chosen role thank advance

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Edit: Still good 4 years later.

For a long time, I avoided FF14 even as word continued on that it was one of the best MMO's  currently out there. This only increased with the release of the Shadowbringers Expansion, which I heard nothing but good things about. Still, this was not enough. Knowing how I operate in MMO's, starting one would be a colossal time investment for months, and possibly years depending upon how much I enjoyed it. I ended up giving FF14 a try when I saw how many of my oldest friends were either playing it or planning to. They let you do a free trial up to level 35, so I figured... why not? If I make it that far and like it, then perhaps this may be worth buying.

Even so, I wasn't quite prepared for how much I was about to be consumed by this game. FF14 is easily the best MMO i've played since WoW's Wrath of the Lich King expansion more than 10 years ago. I found it to be more enjoyable than EVE and Guild Wars 2, and far superior to WoW's current expansion Battle for Azeroth. After over a year of enduring that mess, it was refreshing to play FF14 and find an MMO that I actually could enjoy without excessive RNG and obnoxious busywork.

Ok, so reviewing an MMO in its entirety is utterly mad and i'd be here for hours, so instead I'm going to try to highlight a few key points.

First and foremost, FF14 puts some serious investment into its storylines. While it might officially be an MMO, FF14 is also probably the largest JRPG ever made. Expect dozens of hours of cutscenes and story events, with me having about 300 hours played when I finished all current story content. Now I didn't spend all 300 of those hours only doing story content, but that should give you a pretty decent idea of how large the story is. If you are familiar with this franchise then you have a pretty good idea of what to expect, and longtime fans will see many familiar names among this game's characters and boss fights. On the other hand the story is a bit mediocre early on and only really gets going in the first expansion Heavensward. Technically you can skip all the cutscenes (and rewatch them in an Inn or your house), and even buy a skip all the way to Shadowbringers if you really want to, but I'd recommend against it considering how much of a role story and character development play in this game. The story might be a bit bland and lengthy in its early stages, but it becomes one of the better parts of this game.

Moving on to gameplay, FF14 has a large number of different classes, or ""jobs"", that you can play as. You get your typical MMO setup of tanks, healers, melee, and ranged each with their own distinct play style, strengths, and weaknesses. Crafting and gathering in FF14 is much more developed than in most MMO's with each of them being different classes in their own right. But unlike most MMO's, FF14 allows you to play all of these different classes on a single character. This is a major selling point for someone like me with major alt problems in other MMO's (12 120's in WoW, for example). FF14 ensures that you are able to play all of the classes and their own storylines while at the same time not forcing you to build a new character from scratch for each different class.

As for group content, there are plenty of opportunities for PvE and PvP. When it comes to PvP, i'll admit that my experience is somewhat limited. However from what I have seen of PvP in FF14 it is a bit clunky, does not seem to be particularly popular, and is one of the few areas where WoW clearly beats FF14... for now. As for PvE, FF14 is very strong indeed. There are a large number of Dungeons (4 player runs), Trials (8 player boss fights), Raids (8 players), and Alliance Raids (24 players). FF14's version of LFG, the ""Duty Finder"", is simple to use and allows you to queue up for any content you have unlocked - though you may want an organized group for the high difficulty content. Worth mentioning are the ""roulettes"" which let you select a category (such as Trials, Level 80 Dungeons, or Alliance Raids) to queue for and obtain a daily reward based upon your class level. FF14 does have level scaling that reduces your level to fit whatever PvE content you find yourself in, though it is possible to turn this off for your own private groups. 

Like what WoW used to have when it was still good, FF14 has a token/badge system where you collect currencies from doing 50+ PvE content that you can use to buy gear, materials, and other goodies. There is also nothing like the Titanforging or weekly chest RNG BS like what is in current (8.2.5) WoW. Current content raids work a little differently in FF14 too, with you being limited in the amount of gear items you can get per week. On the one hand this slows down gearing a bit, but on the other you are free to run the current raids as many times as you want until you get the gear drop you are after, at least on normal difficulty. In the light of having to wait months before getting crucial gear upgrades in WoW due to only getting one chance a week, I like how FF14 does it.

As for the community, I haven't been on forums or around hardcore players since I have not joined a proper raid guild yet (or Free Company as they are called in FF14). However, from what I have seen FF14 players are far more friendly and far less toxic than many other game communities. I've completed over 500 dungeons so far and I can probably count on one hand the number of times i've dealt with jackasses in those dungeons. People tend to be friendly, helpful, more relaxed, and more forgiving of errors - especially if you are new and have the ""sprout"" icon. I think FF14 might have stronger rule enforcement for bad behavior, but I am not completely sure about that. I don't even see much swearing, which is kind of a shock for an online game. In any event, I very much like the peaceful community this game has.

Ok I better wrap this up before this review goes on forever.

And yet there are so many other neat things to mention. Gold Saucer and all its minigames, Player owned housing and all the customization that comes with it, the massive amount of special items to collect, and on the list goes. FF14 is an MMO after all, so having an insane amount of content to spend time with is to be expected. There are so many opportunities to play this game in the manner of your choosing. :D

So... If my opinion on this game isn't obvious to you by know, I don't know what to tell you. :o

One last note though... like many other MMO's, [url=https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/friend_recruit/]FF14 has a ""Recruit a Friend"" feature[/url] where a new player who has yet to buy their first month of subscription can get a code from a current subscriber and get rewards for both of them that increase the longer the new person sticks with the game. If FF14 sounds like something you may be interested in, feel free to leave a comment on this review asking for one of these codes and i'll reply with one. :D

it has lots the elements of MMO RPG games
[b] Mounts [/b] ✅ 
You can fly after you finish the base story.

[b] Minions [/b] ✅ 
A lots of little cute minions who follows you where ever you go.

[b] Dungeons/Trials/Raids [/b] ✅ 
[*] 31 Dungeon in base game, 18 Dungeon in 1st expansion which is free, 15 Dungeon  in 2nd expansion, and 13 Dungeon  in the 3rd expansion. in total 77 dungeon
[*] 27 Trial in base game, 14 Trial in 1st expansion which is free, 17 Trial in 2nd expansion, and 17 Trial in the 3rd expansion. in total 74 Trial. 
[*] 20 Raid in base game, 27 Raid in 1st expansion which is free, also 27 Raid in 2nd expansion, and 27 Raid in the 3rd expansion. in total 101 Raid.

252 Dungeons/Trials/Raids each has it's own experience and that's thousands of hours of endless fun.

[b] Story [/b] ✅
So far so good, am eager to play the expansions.

[b] Classes/jobs [/b] ✅ 
 17 Actual job + that creepy guy who want to be your friend by any means ( Blue Mage ) and if you insist on being a friend with the weird blue guy it will be 18 job in total. it also has non fighter classes which divided into 2 types the first is Disciples of the Hand and has 8 jobs (crafting) and the second is Disciples of the Land and has 3 jobs (Gathering).
The best thing about this game is that you don't need to create new character for each class/job, basically you can master all classes and jobs in single character and level them all to the max level (80 for now)
Each job/class has it's own questline which is good.

[b] Soundtracks [/b] ✅ 
This game has one of the most fantastic soundtracks I ever heard in games, it got the calming, the exciting, the sad, the FUNNY. one of the major things that got me hooked into playing and buying the game is soundtrack. 

[b] Character Creation [/b]✅
Simple and neat. nothing fancy but you can get pretty cool designs.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"XIV has one of the friendliest and wholesome communities of any MMO i have ever seen. We wiped on a dungeon because the healer was struggling to keep up, If this would have happened on WoW, there most likely would have been a vote to kick the healer. Instead the tank talked the healer through what he needed to do and offered to make smaller pulls. The dungeon took twice as long as it would have done but the whole experience was much more enjoyable. 

Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking to get into an MMO. I played wow for well over 12+ years and I much prefer FFXIV.","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",xiv friendliest wholesome community massively multiplayer online wiped dungeon healer struggling happened wow vote kick healer tank talked healer needed offered smaller pull dungeon took twice long enjoyable definitely recommend massively multiplayer online wow 12 year prefer ffxiv
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"After Shadowbringers:

If you are into MMORPGs, this game has the best polish and production value of any MMO, and that includes above World of Warcraft.

If you're into combat in MMORPGs:  This game has the most insane adrenaline pumping boss fights you'll ever fight.

If you're into story in MMORPGs:  There is simply no other game.  In most MMOs, the story is part of the game.  In this one, it is the game, and everything you do surrounds the beautiful tale they tell.  Unlike some games *cough* WoW *cough* where characters just play their stereotypes, this game has expert-level writing with characters that behave out of character, with characters who don't follow stereotypes, and with interesting and often twisted back stories.

If you're into end-game content:  This game doesn't have the best top tier content, but because it is so polished and hand crafted it doesn't even matter because the limited content is much more engaging and a thrilling experience that is far more memorable than the ""choose your gear grind"" of other games.

If you're into PVP, it exists.  That's all that can be said about it.  The content loosely follows a story but only loose and it's not that refined nor is it updated very often, and suffers from a lack of population.

If you are into crafting / gathering, this game has the best themepark MMO crafting system on the market.  The only MMO that does it better is Eve Online, only because it is a full simulation.  This is not a simulation of supply chains or spreadsheets.  This game is more about simulating getting down and dirty.  Mass produce a ton of low quality items or strive for high quality at the cost of time and materials.  Everything from crafting to gathering has mini games attached to it where you have to maximize your chance to gather an item and/or make it high quality.    

If you're looking for a community, this one is all about love and laughs.  This is because the game has a built in mentor system where veterans can teach newbies, who have clovers over their heads to tell the party that they are relatively new to the game and haven't completed the main storyline.  The game has a vibrant fan community with reddits and Discords as well, and the attitudes are almost always positive.  People are usually forgiving of mistakes in dungeons and boss fights and won't try to start fights.

If you ever wanted to try a game you thought you'd never see yourself playing, this is the game for you.  No, the style of this game is not for everyone.  The lack of PVP and the lack of end game content variety is something at face value people would not want.  But just keep this in mind.  This game contains hundreds of hours of main storyline quests, and that's not including the side quest chains, normal quests, unlock quests, Special dungeons and higher difficulty modes for boss fights.  Even getting to the end game is an accomplishment for one who has never started.  It is also the best time to do it.  For your money you will get these hundreds of hours of story which will take you perhaps 2-4 months to complete even if you play every day.  This game transcends its weaknesses because of things like this, the sheer polish of everything that is done.  PVP can be forgiven because the PVE fights get very hectic at higher levels and on higher difficulties.  Lack of end game content can be forgiven because of those intense fights as well and because the game is so incredibly long to begin with.

Anyone remotely interested in RPGs should work their way through this game.  It is a masterpiece, and Shadowbringers makes it one of the better games ever made.","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",shadowbringers mmorpgs best polish production value massively multiplayer online includes world warcraft combat mmorpgs insane adrenaline pumping bos fight fight mmorpgs simply no_other mmos surround beautiful tale tell unlike game cough wow cough character stereotype expert writing character behave character follow stereotype interesting twisted story best top tier polished hand crafted matter limited engaging thrilling far memorable choose gear grind game pvp exists loosely follows loose not_that refined nor_is updated suffers lack population crafting gathering best themepark massively multiplayer online crafting market massively multiplayer online eve online simulation not_a simulation supply chain spreadsheet simulating dirty mass produce ton low quality item strive high quality cost material crafting gathering mini game attached maximize chance gather high quality community love laugh built mentor veteran teach newbie clover head tell party relatively completed storyline vibrant fan community reddits discord attitude positive usually forgiving mistake dungeon bos fight t_emphasizedry fight wanted thought never_see no_the style not_for lack pvp lack variety face value not_want mind contains hundred hour storyline quest not_including side chain normal quest unlock quest special dungeon higher difficulty mode bos fight accomplishment never_started best hundred hour perhaps 2 4 month complete transcends weakness thing sheer polish pvp forgiven pve fight hectic higher level higher difficulty lack forgiven intense fight incredibly long remotely interested rpgs masterpiece shadowbringers make game

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"This is my review fresh off playing patch-hell post Shadowbringers, the third big expansion available for Final Fantasy XIV.

[u] My review is not aimed at the typical person who is interested in this game already[/u]. 

[b]If you are being harassed by some friend, spouse or group to join in, this review is for you.[/b] 
I should also mention this is the first game of it’s kind I’ve played.

Most people call this title a MMO, but secretly, Final Fantasy XIV is a gigantic single player JRPG with massively multiplayer elements, which has a slope of endurance required to show its true colors, potential, and best qualities.
As a custom made Warrior of Light, you will embark in continent-spanning adventures, meeting a big cast of friends and foes, as you search for your place in this world, ripe with war, history and sights.

By far the biggest issue is that you WILL feel overwhelmed and confused for a while, more if this is your first entry in the franchise. Several references and callbacks will be lost on you, but that's second to the big issue. 

Getting used to everything there is to do in its side activities alone can be a gauntlet, so if your friends care about you, demand they give you a hand. Some mechanics and gameplay elements are easy to pick up and learn, some are either so overwhelming or convoluted I have not bothered after a curious look. While the community and game extensively have documented everything, getting handholded by someone else is, in my opinion, ideal for the first few hours. 

The third problem is this game genuinely takes time to actually be worth playing. There is no nice way of putting it, while there has been some retroactive changes, the first chapter, Realm Reborn, is a very poor first impression which only the promise of better things making it tolerable. Several quests aren’t fun, most of the characters are not interesting and the few who eventually become your most trusted companions dont start true development until later.

[u] If you’re not already reconsidering, keep reading[/u] .

Most of the game main story quests focus on exploring giant regions, doing favors to different factions and groups to further your goals, and meeting all sorts of walks of life. Some regions have rather poor design, making it easy to be lost or be painful to navigate on foot or mount, as well as less than pleasant visuals or annoying paths. Generally however most are well realized, and starting with the second expansion the new areas are mostly good.

The quests are an assortment of your usual kill thing or collect stuff, but some notably take a bigger focus on the ongoing narrative, like helping soldiers after a battle or simply checking on the mental state of an ally. While some quests do have the sin of making you go back and forth between long distances, very few are confusing or not clear on what to do, so most of the time you’re focused on the going-on instead. Notably some quests have dungeons, raids and trials attached, which have the best and worst content in the game.

Some are difficult but fair for blind play, requiring everyone in the party to work together, some have complete slap in the face design that you’ll be asking what were they thinking. This is again a good spot to demand a friend to be with you.

This leads me to the presentation and overall story, that as I said, starts rather barren and slowly builds up. 

It’s Stormblood where the game starts to truly improve, even with caveats. The new villains are overall a wasted potential, with some great moments undermined or underutilized. The few who will remain relevant long term do get a better development but this comes post-patch. However, many of the dungeons begin experimenting, the cast begins to shine and become people worth caring about, and the music is genuinely fantastic.

Here at last, in Shadowbringers, the overwhelming praise is vindicated- the cast is extremely well developed and written, the antagonists and neutrals are deep, complex and nuanced, all the bosses and battles are epic in scale and a good challenge, the score is outstanding and hours of quests, dungeons, trials, and a slew of issues get paid off in an excellent climax that is a rollercoaster of emotions.

However, the ending does bring the question post-clarity if the amount of effort to get here is worth it, which is why again I implore that if you are being dragged to this game, have those dragging you beside you.

FFXIV can be great a adventure with a gigantic amount of content in the main story, let alone side content, that ranges from insane minigames in a casino, to hilariously self aware questlines, in a captivatingly massive, yet intimate journey.
It can also be a slow, frustrating, confusing, tedious game with constant “what were they thinking” moments, some gameplay related, some story related, with a community that ranges from welcoming, fun and friendly to obnoxiously insufferable and a waste of oxygen to the planet.

In short, if you can get an equal amount of investment from whoever is making you play to stick with you, this game is worth the try and it can be a great experience in retrospect, but in the moment you’ll occasionally want to choke the life out of him.","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",fresh patch hell post shadowbringers third big expansion available final fantasy xiv not_aimed typical interested already harassed friend spouse group join mention kind call title massively multiplayer online secretly final fantasy xiv gigantic single jrpg massively multiplayer element slope endurance required true color potential best quality custom warrior light embark continent spanning adventure meeting big cast friend foe search world ripe war history sight far biggest issue overwhelmed confused entry franchise reference callback lost s_emphasizedecond big issue side activity alone gauntlet friend care demand hand mechanic element easy pick learn overwhelming convoluted not_bothered curious look community extensively documented handholded someone else opinion ideal hour third problem genuinely take worth no_nice putting retroactive change chapter realm reborn poor impression promise thing tolerable quest fun character not_interesting eventually trusted companion dont true development not_already reconsidering reading quest focus exploring giant region favor different faction group goal meeting sort walk life region rather poor design easy lost painful navigate foot mount pleasant visuals annoying path generally realized starting expansion area mostly good quest assortment usual kill collect stuff notably bigger focus ongoing narrative helping soldier battle simply checking mental state ally quest sin forth long distance confusing not_clear focused notably quest dungeon raid trial attached best worst difficult fair blind requiring party complete slap face design asking good spot demand friend lead presentation start rather barren slowly build s_emphasizedtormblood start truly improve caveat villain wasted potential great moment undermined underutilized remain relevant long term development come post patch dungeon experimenting cast begin shine worth caring music genuinely fantastic last shadowbringers overwhelming praise vindicated cast extremely developed written antagonist neutral deep complex nuanced boss battle epic scale good challenge score outstanding hour quest dungeon trial slew issue paid excellent climax rollercoaster emotion ending bring question post clarity effort worth i_emphasizedmplore dragged dragging beside ffxiv great a_emphasizeddventure gigantic alone side range insane minigames casino hilariously self aware questlines captivatingly massive intimate journey slow frustrating confusing tedious constant moment related related community range welcoming fun friendly obnoxiously insufferable waste oxygen planet short equal investment whoever stick worth great retrospect moment occasionally choke life
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Okay for starters, at this moment I have played for a total of 60 days, and have been playing for about a year total. I start playing with friends on the Crystal data center in North America, and plat on “Goblin” 

A Realm Reborn currently is a stretch to get through and can be tough for new players to enjoy but there is a patch (5.3 a major patch to the game) coming in soon which will make ARR way better to go through 

The Pros 

-Playable on Mac, PC, and PS4 (PS3 is discontinued I believe)

-It's fun with friends

-Tons of hours to pour in of content

-Variety of customization for races

-hairstyles can be changed later on don’t worry

-Different classes of Healers, DPS, or a Tank

-Once you hit level 15 and complete a certain main quest you can pick up a different class if you dislike your starter class

-If you never want to see or be queued with someone you can black list them

-If you want to start a “guild” aka a Free company or FC for short you can! 

-DLCs When a new one comes out you can buy it and it will give you the previous ones!

Cons

-The first story will feel long but it will get better

-Some salty and toxic players

-Role Play players ruining your fun in a dungeon (doesn't happen often don’t worry)

Races 
-Hyur - Human

-Elezen - Elf

-Lalafell - midgets (adults but some roleplay as lolis)

-Miqo’te - Cat girls (or boys)

Before getting into Classes remember that this isn't a common MMO to where if you don't like 
the class you selected at the start you have to make a whole new character, In FFXIV you can have multiple classes on a character. you just need to hit level 10 and finish the class you can change classes

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"[b]9/10 - Would Manderville again.[/b]
[i]This review was written based on version 3.0[/i]

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Consistent, large patches about every 3 months.
[*]Gorgeous graphics engine. 
[*]Deep crafting system.
[*]Probably the best storytelling in an MMO I've ever seen (but it does take 30+ hour to really get into the meat of it)
[*]One of the most friendly gaming communities around.
[*]Cross-platform play with the PS3 and PS4, excellent controller support for PC.
[*]Possible to play casually and still enjoy/experience the game with hardcore friends.
[*]Hildebrand - Game doesn't take itself too seriously and just has fun.
[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Game doesn't reinvent the MMO wheel. It is a pretty standard ""theme park"" MMO. That being said, it is extremely polished and everything in the game is executed very well.
[*]Subscription model, I was almost tempted to put this in the Pros column. One of the few games to do this model well in a sea of F2P MMOs.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Tens of hours of monotonous fetch quests sprinkled throughout the game. Usual MMO fare.
[*]Long PvP queues, slightly unbalanced. (Not enough people play PvP)
[*]Endgame content can be very grindy at times. (Ex: Relic Weapons, and ""Run the same 2 dungeons over and over to get currency to buy gear"".)
[*]Gil sellers - I realize this happens in pretty much every MMO. This didn't make the list because it happens, it is strictly on the list because of advertising chat spam. On an average day you will see a lot of messages (unless you're like me and are so fed up with it you go /away). Expect the spam to be cranked up to 11 whenever a large piece of content is released. I really feel SE could implement better countermeasures with respect to advertising. It does seem worse than in many of it's other AAA MMO competitors. On a side note, I'm told the JP servers are practically gil seller free. I've never tested this myself however. Overall, not a huge con, but an annoyance none the less.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Back in my high school & college days of the late 1970's and early 80's, I had spent many hundreds of hours, sitting around tables with a bunch of friends, playing paper & pencil Role Playing Games (RPG), like Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).

But I had to give up RPG games as I continued my education and pursued a working career. The time required as a Game Master/scenario designer was just too time consuming and my other worldly responsibilities took priority.

Many years later in 2016, I was invited by a friend to join them playing the grand daddy of all Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG) World of Warcraft (WoW), so I started reading up on MMORPG games.

Little was I prepared for how huge the online communities were in MMORPGs, with MILLIONS of players, creating characters, joining their friends online, & losing themselves in the online worlds of these games.

Nearly all MMORPG have integrated central story lines, continuous character progression, & hundreds (if not thousands) of separate side-quest objectives to play, all without the need of a Game Master, the game developers handle all those time-consuming chores. All players need do is play the game.

At first, I started playing just WoW, but soon I succumbed to the allure of another huge MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (FFXIV: ARR).

As the name implies, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is part of a franchise of numerous Final Fantasy video games. Unlike most of this franchise, which are standalone single player RPGs, the 2002 Final Fantasy XI & 2013 Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn are both MMORPGs.

Contrasting the vintage 2004 WoW game mechanics & graphics to that of the decade newer FFXIV: ARR, there is no real comparison for many new players of which of the two MMO games to play. Between the game’s beautiful graphics, music, & writing, FFXIV: ARR completely immerses players in the expansive world, characters, & story of its mythical land of “Eorzea”.

Within the first months of entry into FFXIV: ARR, I had recruited my wife & many of our friends to play the game as well. It became nearly a nightly ritual to login, form a party of friends in game and take on some quest, dungeon, or trial.

In the next 2 years, even more of our friends would join, helping us form an in-game “Free Company”, together clearing all the game’s original 50th level endgame content. But far from being the proverbial “game over” you would expect, the game developers had spent those years creating even more content, in the form of many add-on patches & full game expansions, like Heavensward, Stormblood, & Shadowbringers.

Although this additional content continued to entertain us, this is where my cautionary tale begins. One must remember that MMO game developers are businesses, with the responsibility of maintaining game servers, in-game support, creating new content, growing their player base, and most of all, making a profit.

No MMORPG are truly free-to-play (F2P) for the reasons stated in the paragraph above. Different MMO game developers use various methods to pay their bills.

Some company’s MMO games are F2P, that are free to download, install, and play, but count on micro-transactions of an in-game store to sell digital character outfits, emotes, pets, & mounts. As long as players continue to buy a sufficient amount of these items, the MMO game will stay afloat.

Other MMO games opt for a Buy-to-Play (B2P) model, where players buy the base game and optionally pay for additional Down Loadable Content (DLC) & game expansions. Once again, the MMO game will only continue online if it stays profitable.

But one of the oldest styles of MMO game monetization is subscription. Where players are required in some MMO games, and optionally in others, to pay a monthly subscription fee, usually $10.00 to $15.00 per player/month, to play that MMO game, or gives players some advantages in-game that makes the game much more fun or advantageous to play.

You might be asking yourself this, “why is he explaining all these different MMO game monetization methods for a review of a single MMO game?” The answer is simple, FFXIV: ARR uses all the above to keep itself profitable. Players buy the base game, pay for all expansions, make real money micro-transactions for in-game items on the “MogStation” store, and MUST pay a monthly subscription in order to play.

So, one day while discussing with a friend our Free Company’s next duty in FFXIV: ARR, they said they were going to take a break from playing and try some other MMO game instead. When I pressed them further for a reason, they admitted that the constant cost of playing FFXIV: ARR was becoming a little too much for the few times a month they got to play it.

A little shocked by this news, I then reviewed my own cost of playing FFXIV: ARR over the last 3 years... Purchasing the game & all expansions for Christine, myself, & gifting some to friends, check… Throw in all those “MogStation” store micro-transactions over the years, yikes… Add in all the monthly subscription fees for us & a few we also gifted, OMG… The total tally for us playing FFXIV: ARR for 3 years was over $5,000.00!

In the final analysis, is FFXIV: ARR fun and worth playing, hell yes! It is a beautifully realized fantasy RPG and fully immersive MMO game experience, full of the standard Final Fantasy swordplay, magic, Chocobos, and sentient crystals, that you can share with family/friends, giving players many hundreds of hours of blissful play. Can it be expensive to play, you bet it can(!), especially if you are not watching your cost closely.

My major take-away for this review of this amazing MMO game follows. Pay ONLY for what you need to play FFXIV: ARR. Buy add-ons items & expansions when you NEED them and not one minute earlier. Subscribe when you & your friends have an abundance of time to play it & let your sub lapse when you do not. These measures should help you save a fair amount of money & enjoy the game even more.

For those of you reading this that might still be hesitant because of the possible cost of playing this MMO game, I have some good news for you! FFXIV: ARR does offer a Free Trial membership with no expiration time, that allows players to create characters of all classes and play a lot of the game up to the 60th level, including the entire Heavensward expansion.

There are quite a few limitations with this Free Trial membership. But, you DO get an awful lot of content included and without having to pay a penny. So much so, I always recommend new FFXIV: ARR players to start with the Free Trial membership at first. Then, if you like what you see, buy it & pay the sub a month at a time.

Even with taking all this into consideration, I do highly recommend players try Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. But, paraphrasing that ""drink"" part of those beer commercials we see on U.S. television, remember to ""play (& pay) responsibly.”","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",high school college day late 1970 early 80 spent hundred hour sitting table bunch friend paper pencil role game role dungeon dragon d_emphasized role game_emphasizeds continued education pursued working career required master scenario designer consuming worldly responsibility took priority year 2016 invited friend join grand daddy massively multiplayer online role game mmorpg world warcraft wow started reading mmorpg game prepared huge online community mmorpgs million player creating character joining friend online losing online world game nearly mmorpg integrated central line continuous progression hundred not_thousands separate side objective master developer handle consuming chore player started wow soon succumbed allure huge mmorpg final fantasy xiv realm reborn ffxiv arr name implies final fantasy xiv realm reborn franchise numerous final fantasy video game unlike franchise standalone single rpgs 2002 final fantasy xi 2013 final fantasy xiv realm reborn mmorpgs contrasting vintage 2004 wow mechanic graphic decade newer ffxiv arr no_real comparison player massively multiplayer online game beautiful graphic music writing ffxiv arr completely immerses player expansive world character mythical land eorzea month entry ffxiv arr recruited wife friend became nearly nightly ritual login form party friend dungeon trial next 2 year friend join helping form company clearing original 50th endgame far proverbial expect developer spent year creating form add patch expansion heavensward stormblood shadowbringers additional continued entertain cautionary tale begin remember massively multiplayer online developer business responsibility maintaining server support creating growing base profit no_mmorpg truly f2p reason stated paragraph different massively multiplayer online developer various method pay bill company massively multiplayer online game f2p download install count micro transaction store digital outfit emotes pet mount long player continue sufficient item massively multiplayer online stay afloat massively multiplayer online game opt b2p model player base optionally pay additional loadable dlc expansion massively multiplayer online continue online stay profitable oldest style massively multiplayer online monetization subscription player required massively multiplayer online game optionally others pay monthly subscription fee usually 10 00 15 00 per massively multiplayer online give player advantage make fun advantageous asking explaining different massively multiplayer online monetization method single massively multiplayer online answer simple ffxiv arr us profitable player base pay expansion real micro transaction item mogstation store pay monthly subscription order discussing friend company next duty ffxiv arr break massively multiplayer online pressed admitted constant cost ffxiv arr time shocked news reviewed cost ffxiv arr last 3 year purchasing expansion christine gifting friend check throw mogstation store micro transaction year yikes add monthly subscription fee gifted omg total tally ffxiv arr 3 year 5 000 00 final analysis ffxiv arr fun worth hell yes beautifully realized fantasy role fully immersive massively multiplayer online standard final fantasy swordplay magic chocobos sentient crystal share family friend giving player hundred hour blissful expensive bet especially not_watching cost closely major amazing massively multiplayer online follows pay ffxiv arr add ons item expansion not_one minute earlier subscribe you_emphasizedr friend abundance sub lapse not_these measure help save fair enjoy reading hesitant possible cost massively multiplayer online good news ffxiv arr offer trial membership no_expiration allows player create character class 60th including entire heavensward expansion limitation trial membership awful included pay penny recommend ffxiv arr player trial membership pay sub taking consideration highly recommend player final fantasy xiv realm reborn paraphrasing drink beer commercial television remember pay responsibly

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I've never been an MMO player. Briefly played Tera - liked it but found progression slow - and briefly WoW - disliked the combat, just felt like button mashing. I also played Mabinogi for a short while and really disliked the game's mechanics. One day I felt the urge to play one and I knew a friend was planning to start this so I bought it but neither of us started. 9 days ago a friend of mine was looking for people who wanted to start and I decided that if it was in my steam list I may as well try it out. I am now 95.9 hours in according to steam and I love it. I've just hit level 50 and got my Paladin armour and I'm still looking at all the content coming up. As I speak server is going down to patch even more content into the game. So here's the detailed review:

[b]Story[/b]

The story is a good one as far as MMOs go (based on my limited experience). I'd equate it to WoW in some ways as FFXIV builds off of an already established lore but is still extremely easy for new players to get into. I don't want to say much about it but Square Enix really put work into making a good story. It teeters a bit at times, especially around the middle (lv30-40 is a bit slow) but it's very enjoyable if you get into it.

[b]Classes[/b]

Combat classes are fairly traditional: tank, support, ranged DPS and melee DPS. Still within these wider definitions, each individual class is fairly unique. To add to this you are not restricted to the classes that you pick at the beginning of the game. You will unlock the ability to train any and all classses as you wish which allows for a lot of flexibility. But ""Oh, the grind ¬¬"" you say. Nope, all classes trained beyond the first receive exp gain bonuses which really speeds up the process. This is alongside the quick levelling options which I'll discuss in a later section. 

There's more though! All combat classses have a progression called a ""Job"" which is earned by reaching a certain point in the story, getting a class to lv30 and the corresponding second class to lv15, and then finishing the job quest. It's actually really easy to do and it encourages you to try a different role.

All combat classes are unique and don't overlap much at all which is great.

As for crafting classes, there's a fair few of them and I have limited experience of them right now but crafting itself isn't just sit there and wait for things to appear. There's an active process and is fairly enjoyable. Just like the combat classes, new skills are unlocked and it becomes a sort of strategic minigame. Quick synthesis for bulk items is available as well so you don't have to do it for each item.

Still I can see crafting becoming tedious. repetitive and boring at some point but that's no different from any other mmo. Also, unlike the combat classes, the crafting classes aren't really unique.

[b]Combat[/b]

The combat system is targetted, which honestly I was sceptical about when first going in as I'm not a big fan of targetted combat but it grows on you. This is mostly to do with how the game feels since you really have to think about movement, positioning, skill orders, skill timing etc. from more or less the beginning of the game. This is a big deal and playing the first 20 or so levels in WoW feels boring and just mashing buttons in a certain order. The 2.5sec global cooldown adds to the strategic element of it too. You have more time to think and decide what move would be appropriate, but you also have a longer window to be punished for choosing the wrong skill. I honestly think this is way more fun and interesting compared to other games with a much smaller global cooldown.

Another important point is that this game is very controller friendly. It's on the PS3/PS4 with cross platform support so that would be why. I personally play with a controller and it feels very smooth. I don't feel too overwhelmed with skills and I've unlocked all of them for my job with 3 cross skills in use as well (I have 2 full hotbars but it's very easy to switch between them). It's down to preference in the end but the option is really nice to have.

[b]Levelling[/b]

There are so many different ways to level it's crazy. Though the main story quest is compulsory, there are loads of side quests available.

If you think quests are repetitive you can switch over to doing FATES which are events that spawn that give gil (money) and experience to everyone that completes them based on the level of participation.

If that's boring there are many different dungeons to do with solid exp gain on all of them. Duty roullete will give you bonus exp once a day so deffo worth doing that.

No? Then you can do levequests which are contracts to do certain things in certain places which you can get by using one of your levequest allowances (which refill regularly). Levequests are available to crafting classes too and are considered the fastest ways to level them.

Still not enough? Then Guildhests might be for you. These are very similar to levequests but you're put into a duty (instance) with a party and asked to do it as a group. There's a daily bonus on guildhest roullete as well so that's good.

Also, the first time you do a certain dungeon, levequest or guildhest you'll be granted bonus exp which is always a definite plus.

Still too slow? Not enough content? Too repetitive? Well if you're that hard to please then I guess I should tell you that there are these things called logs which grant bonus exp for doing certain things. A hunting log will ask you to kill x number of y, while a crafting log will give you the list of everything you can craft. The king of all these is the challenge log which refreshes weekly and gives you a lot of exp for completing tasks like ""complete 3 dungeons"" or ""complete 5 levequests"".

Honestly there are so many different ways to level that players can pick something that suits them and though some can get repetitive they're fun for the most part.

[b]Endgame[/b]

You only need to google the game to see the amount of post lv50 content. The game's been out for about a year and there are things constantly being added. The first expansion is coming out soon so keep an eye out for that. Most people will tell you that lv50 is just the beginning, and they're probably right. I'm only just getting into the endgame and I look forward to everything coming up.

[b]Price[/b]

Well. This is the one major downside I see to the game. It's very expensive. Though nothing new for an mmo, it is a pretty heavy financial commitment compared to most other steam games out there. Especially considering you can get Tera, Mabinogi, and loads of other mmos for free now. You can buy gametime online from other sellers for a bit cheaper but it's still expensive. I suggest playing the trial to give you a better understanding of whether you'll enjoy it. I highly suggest it and will be playing it, but I can appreciate that a few years ago I could never afford to play a game like this.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

I honestly think this is the first mmo to seriously impress me with its ability to keep you interested. It doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it leave you with nothing to do. Bosses are often really cool and have interesting mechanics, even from an early point in the game. I really do feel that besides the price this game is practically perfect. It's a great game - buy it if you can.","Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",never_been massively multiplayer online briefly tera liked found progression slow briefly wow disliked combat button mashing mabinogi short disliked mechanic urge knew friend planning bought neither_of started 9 day ago friend mine wanted decided 95 9 hour according love 50 paladin armour coming speak patch detailed good far mmos based limited equate wow way ffxiv build already established lore extremely easy player square enix good teeter bit time especially middle lv30 40 bit slow enjoyable class combat class fairly traditional tank support ranged dp melee dp wider definition individual class fairly unique add not_restricted class pick beginning unlock train class wish allows flexibility oh grind nope class trained receive exp gain bonus speed process alongside quick levelling option discus section combat class progression called earned reaching certain class lv30 corresponding class lv15 finishing easy encourages different role combat class unique overlap great crafting class fair limited crafting sit wait thing appear active process fairly enjoyable combat class skill unlocked sort strategic minigame quick synthesis bulk item available crafting tedious repetitive boring no_different massively multiplayer online unlike combat class crafting class unique combat combat targetted honestly sceptical not_a big fan targetted combat grows mostly feel movement positioning skill order skill timing beginning big deal 20 level wow feel boring mashing button certain order 2 5sec global cooldown add strategic element decide move appropriate longer window punished choosing wrong skill honestly fun interesting compared game smaller global cooldown important controller friendly ps3 ps4 cross platform support personally controller feel smooth overwhelmed skill unlocked 3 cross skill 2 hotbars easy switch preference option nice levelling different way crazy compulsory load side quest available quest repetitive switch fate event spawn gil completes based participation boring different dungeon solid exp gain duty roullete bonus exp deffo worth no_then levequests contract certain thing certain place levequest allowance refill regularly levequests available crafting class considered fastest way not_enough guildhests similar levequests duty instance party asked group daily bonus guildhest roullete good certain dungeon levequest guildhest granted bonus exp definite plus slow not_enough repetitive hard please guess tell thing called log grant bonus exp certain thing hunting log ask kill x number crafting log craft king challenge log refreshes weekly give exp completing task complete 3 dungeon complete 5 levequests honestly different way player pick suit repetitive fun endgame google post lv50 thing constantly expansion coming soon eye tell lv50 beginning probably endgame look forward coming price major downside expensive massively multiplayer online pretty heavy financial commitment compared game especially considering tera mabinogi load mmos gametime online seller bit cheaper s_emphasizedtill expensive suggest trial understanding enjoy highly suggest appreciate year ago never_afford conclusion honestly massively multiplayer online seriously impress interested overwhelm nor_does leave boss cool interesting mechanic early besides price practically perfect great

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I started playing this game sometime last year after really just wanting something different to play. I was craving an MMO but I was so over WoW's formula at the time and really wanted to take a different approach - read some quests, enjoy some fresh lore and a fresh world. In my 6-7 years of playing WoW I never read quests, roleplayed, etc until Classic came out and I played with a friend of mine - we decided to play it how we wanted, and didn't want to be meta-slaves of sorts. The reason I'm mentioning this will make more sense later.

When starting FF14 I just wanted to come in with an open mind; the graphics were kind of jarring (compared to what I'm used to) and I could understand why people sort of didn't like the aesthetic of the game. That being said; I pushed on and just decided ""well, it's free and I'm bored so why not"". I also had a friend who SWORE by the game - so I had a lot of patience going in I think. Furthermore; the combat seemed slow (with a very long global cooldown) and limited spells but again; I was like lvl 5 - my expectations weren't very high.

As I went through my starting area and got accustomed with the UI/combat I was reading the quests and watching the cut-scenes and already I found myself getting interested/invested in characters such as Y'shtola or Urianger. While I would be lying if I said I knew what was going on; my friend re-assured me that if I paid attention it'd all pay off.

Little down the line; I got through the slug-fest which was ARR Post Patch(es) but during this time I honestly didn't mind it that much. Looking back (and watching my other friends play through it) I don't miss it, but at the time my friend reassured me that Heavensward and the following expansions are a night & day situation and that once this is over it's only up and up. On top of that; through the cutscenes toward the end of post patch ARR I had the sense that something big was happening in the plot - and I was right, and God was it epic. 

I then jumped into Heavensward, which was as promised; amazing (and totally a night and day experience). The story takes a huge jump and you can tell that the game was really starting to develop into a larger plot. I started playing a Ninja as I heard they were one of the most difficult classes in the game (and because I started as a Gladiator combat was quite slow) which I was very keen on. 

A few friends and I started an FC (equivalent of a guild in WoW) and a lot of them were either first time MMO players or just very casual. I told them I wanted to do some hard content as I heard FF14 Raiding content is super fun and challening. We jumped into the Trials first; Titan, Ifrit, Leviathan, etc all on minilvl + no echo and holy f*** at this point I was already having fun but the raids REALLY sold me. We also jumped into our first multi-fight raid (Raids are multi instanced fights rather than trials which are generally just 1 fight). We started on Coils of Bahamut minilvl and no echo and again; an amazing experience. Raiding in FF14 has been some of my favourite MMO moments across 8-9 years of playing the genre and I think that says a lot. We spent about 3-4 months playing together pretty much 10-12 hours a day (when we could and when we weren't working etc) and it was just like being young at High School again; which was surprising cause a game couldn't do that for me for a long long time - not even WoW anymore. 

After what felt like a 3-4 month non stop gaming session me and my FC took a break (a few stayed and played) but after 1-2 months we all came back and I completed Stormblood. 

Stormblood was great; the characters were awesome and some of my favourite moments (at this point in time) were actually from this expansion. I felt some of the hits in the story hit a bit harder than in Heavensward (except for one which I wont spoil which literally brought me to tears!) so it's safe to say I enjoyed this expansion. And now it was finally time for Shadowbringers.

Shadowbringers was just absolutely stupid in terms of Storytelling. The ups and downs, the twists, the character development, the attachment you feel to the characters around you, the story beats, EVERYTHING. Without spoiling anything by the time I finished Shadowbringers I was convinced without a shadow of a doubt that this story (despite never playing any other Final Fantasy games) was the best story-game I had EVER played. Specifically the finale of Shadowbringers in one of the last boss fights; it got to the cutscenes and I was on discord with my friend yelling like ""OH SHIT - LETS GO"" and the music kicks in and just absolutely unbelievable. 

Endwalker was more of the same; unbelievable story-telling and just amazing music, the scenery, the pacing, I could go on and on. 

This review now is getting long so I'll wrap it up; overall this game is amazing.
Here are some pro's and cons:

Pros:
- HUGE main story; 200-350 hours roughly of content 
- Simple but fun combat 
- No need to roll ALT characters (can have every job/class on once character and swap them as you play)
- Every raid/trial being relevant content (the amount of content is INSANE)
- Great art style (jarring to begin with for some; but just forget about it and embrace it for what it is)
- Friendly community (much less elitest than other MMO's I've played - but these people still exist)
- Great company - you can tell they LOVE the game (compared to other companies...) 
- Amazing additional content; housing/gambling/roleplaying/new-story-plus/achievements/transmog/etc 
- Every role/job is needed - META does exist but is not as punishing as other games, play whatever you want!
- SO MUCH SH** TO DO
- Great profession system 
- No DPS meters etc / no toxicity when it comes to raiding as can result in being banned (can be both a good and bad thing as discussed in many youtube videos/threads online) 
- Free trial is like so much content it's retarded 

Cons: 
- For people who don't enjoy story; there is a slight barrier to entry considering content is locked behind main story quests
- Combat is slow to start (long GCD's of 2.5 seconds) 
- A lot of user interface stuff (it gets introduced slowly; but can be overwhelming)
- Post A Realm Reborn can be suffering at the best of times 
- Not a lot of addon support (as mentioned in Pros) 
- SO MUCH SH** TO DO 
- Some people will tell you ""you have to play the game this way"" etc, just ignore them - they exist in every game.

I honestly can't think of many bad things to say the game apart from the stuff above. If you are thinking of playing a new MMO and want something fresh - honestly save yourself the time and don't try LOTR/Albion/whatever just play this game - it's unbelievably good and you will not regret it.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"[h1]An update +400 hours later[/h1]

I find myself going back to FFXIV more simply because it respects my time more these days given I have less hours to play video games. 

There has been a big influx of players coming to FFXIV and I am very excited as I hope Blizzard is paying attention and SE is getting more feedback of what people want. 

This review still holds very true to how I feel for both games and as a ""refugee"" though I don't consider myself one anymore.

The only thing I'll add to this now is anyone looking to try it out, stop listening to the echo chambers of MMO players, do what you want, and I hope you have fun if you do try.

[h1] The Story Of a WoW Refugee [/h1]

If you're reading this you're probably coming from another MMORPG and just feel burnt out. I was a WoW refugee myself, feeling the burn out and the grind of BoA and just couldn't do it anymore then the skies parted and Square Enix extended a hand to help bring me out of the darkness.

FFXIV Online is a savior to those looking to play an MMORPG with lots to do, things to learn/explore, and just a great community.

Let's break it down

[h1] The Good [/h1]
[list]
    [*] The base game A Realm Reborn (and it's post questline 7th astral) will keep you REALLY busy. No need to buy expansions when just learning
    [*] FFXIV will teach you your role. You're supposed to feel weak at the beginning, you're just starting out, but as you progress you will learn more and more. It's really intuitive
    [*] Runs on a lot of different machines. Seriously you don't need the powerful machine to play this enjoyably but if you have one it looks really pretty
    [*] The community. This alone can sell this game, people in this game just want to chill and have a good time. It's all about learning and progressing so everyone is super friendly since they're in the same boat
    [*] No shortage of things to do. Whether you're in to PvP, PvE, gathering materials, crafting things, collecting cute pets, etc this game has NO SHORTAGE of things to go and do
    [*] Both Keyboard/Mouse AND gamepad support (AND YES THE GAMEPAD SUPPORT IS GOOD). I use game pad when doing collecting jobs to just chill and have some fun but you can easily flip between the both if you prefer
    [*] CUSTOMIZE THE HUD. To your hearts content. Everyone plays different and you can customize your hud for YOUR play style 
    [*] 1 Character to rule them all. NO NEED FOR ALTS FOR DIFFERENT JOBS! Seriously your character and it's job arent locked. Make that cute character and then flip back and forth between what role you wanna do!
    [*] Play the way YOU want. (This has been said so many times it's annoying now)
[/list]

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
    [*] The amount of stuff can be off putting in the beginning. They throw a lot at you right off the bat and learning to prioritize what to do can be stressful for newer players
    [*] THE ODD ASSHOLE. 1/100 players may be a jerk from time to time but don't worry too much about them, the community shuns them
    [*] No cross data server yet, hopefully coming. That being said cross world on the same data center is a thing so it's not too bad
[/list]

[h1] The Ugly [/h1]
[i] These are neither good nor bad things so take them how you will and are my opinion.[/i]
[list]
    [*] Managing your versions/subscription from Mogstation with Steam isn't intuitive and they have a bunch of different sites which can be confusing which one does what right off the bat. 
    [*] Market board and how to sell stuff is a bit weird to get used to in later game
    [*] I've had a lot of green leafs ask ""how do i get mount"" / ""how do i <insert thing>"". They're things you learn by trial and error but SE should look in to helping ease that for newer players.
    [*] Can become repetitive in late / end game. I know it's a game to be played how you like but take a lesson from me and mix it up, if you're constantly doing the same thing you'll get burnt out.
    [*] There's a bit of a time gap between major content patches in expansions. There's always something to do but the major content patches can take a few months each time.
    [*] By the end of Stormblood you'll be sick of cut scenes. 
[/list]


[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]
Final Fantasy XIV Online is a decent well rounded MMORPG welcoming to both experienced and newer MMORPG players with no shortage of things to do. Whether you're a Role Player, someone who likes to chop down trees for materials, or want to smack enemies with big awesome abilities Final Fantasy XIV Online has something to offer for everyone.

The base game also comes with 30 days of game time [i](you get 15 more days for free if you hit level 30 within 30 days)[/i] and with a decent entry price why not check it out.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,it's ok,"Very Positive88% of the 65,622 user reviews for this game are positive.",ok
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"With over 11,500 hours played since Realm Reborn, I'll throw in my 2 cents.

I started this game off with the free trial with no expectations, knowledge of the game, or the online community other than the server Balmung was 'the' RP hotspot. Being an RPer myself, I was curious to see what it's like but I had no plans to play past the trial period at that time.

The Pros:
- Beautiful Graphics, great soundtrack.
- PvE is chocked full of simple and fun game mechanics, and even more challenging elements offered to the 'hardcore raiders'
- Lots of different things to do accommodating your interests, goals and play styles. (IE: alternate classes, or gathering and crafting professions)
- Glamour prism system is great for the creative folk that wanna dress up their characters.
- Fun mini games at the Gold Saucer
- Great story content (if you enjoy watching cut-scenes and want to follow the craziness unraveling with every patch)
- Standard leveling is not as grindy as most MMOs I've played in the past.
- One of the Best RP communities I've seen for an MMO (see: Hydaelyn Roleplayers)
- Lalafells

CONS:
- With the game's popularity rising, so too does the odds of being matched with random people with WoW-tier toxicity.
- Player housing is -very- limited, but there is a timeout that make them available for people that wanna try their luck (good luck though) Only downside is the previous owner loses their home, logging in before the timer resets prevents this however.
Which is great for the folk on extended breaks, but frustrating for the folk that want a house.
- End game grinds are grindy
- No world PvP elements (but that could be another 'pro' for some folk)

If you can get past the cons, (needless to say that I did) Final Fantasy XIV can make for a very fun, unique and interesting experience. 

And I happily recommend this over any other MMO currently in today's market.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"TL;DR A fantastic, beautiful, well thought out MMO, with amazing polish, a great community and a bright future!

 - TL;DR Bullet Points -

PROS:

+ Great and friendly community

+ Good looking and well optimised, with extensive graphical options

+ No need for multiple characters, one character can play ANY of the in game classes, and switch at will

+ Gorgeous world with deep lore

+ In depth crafting system with great reward 

+ Huge main story, which feels like a true Final Fantasy story

CONS:

- Loading screens in the world, due to PS3 client limitations (worlds are shared)

- Sometimes overwhelming UI 

- Possible overwhelming number of classes on one character, can be difficult to keep track and keep focus

- Monthly fee, which may put some people off

- Big time investment required to get to enjoy everything in the game (as with any MMO)



 - The long written part! -

Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is the completely reworked and almost entirely remade version of Square Enix's latest MMO. Initially it came out, just as Final Fantasy XIV, on the 22nd of September 2010. Unfortunately, it was absolutely terrible, and is still regarded as one of the worst MMO's in recent years, if not ever. The UI was particularly bad, but the problems were pretty much onmipresent. Graphcis were gorgeous but ridiculously unoptimised, bad gameplay mechanics, etc. However! This is NOT that game! I can't stress this enough!

In December 2010, Naoki Yoshida was brought in as the new Director and producer, to try and make the game better. While some of these changes did start to make the game more playable, Square Enix, feeling (rightly so, some would say) very ashamed about this initial release (which I will call 1.0 from now on), and also worried about the damage it would do to the Final Fantasy brand, deciced to close down this game and completely rebuild it from the ground up. The servers for 1.0 closed on November the 11th 2012. 

The rerelease, called A Realm Reborn (the current game!), launched on August 27th 2013, with a PS3 version coming out on the same day. With the transition to the new game, Square implemented lots of cool in game lore explanations for the upcoming dramatic changes, and it is now a part of the game's story (which I think is really cool).

ARR is a fantastic MMO in nearly every aspect. It does, of course, have it's problems, but I have yet to find an MMO which doesn't (not even WoW). I have been playing MMO's since Everquest, and would say ARR is now my favourite of them all, from WoW to EQ to SWTOR to EVE, etc. I feel they have gotten the formula just right.

For the purchase on Steam you get the game itself, along with a month of playtime, so I would definitely recommend this if you think it might be for you (there is also a trial on the Square Enix website, but this would mean you don't have to reinstall if youstick with it!). 

In terms of gameplay, it follows what I think would be fairly described as a rough following of the Western style MMO formula, with some key differences:

 - Classes are not ""one-per-character"". On your character you can switch between and unlock every single combat, gathering and crafting class within the game, and even use some of the skills you have unlocked cross-class. It's actively encouraged to do this, and having more than one character is not really of any use, unless you just wish to have characters of different races, or something like that.

- Great matchmaking system for instanced content, all instanced content can be tackled using player made groups, or with the ingame matchmaking. It has (for me at least) always been efficient and works well to build groups for all content that needs it.

- Levelling feels reasonably varied. There are lots of different ways to level, from simple mob grinding (not recommended!), Main Story Quests, side quests, Levequests (repeatable minor tasks), dungeons, exploring, FATE's (random area specific objectives), etc. If you start to feel tired of levelling your ""main"" class, you can switch and level some of your crafting classes, or a different combat one, etc.

- Storyline makes the game feel like a true Final Fantasy game, the Main Story Quests (of which there are many) contain the games main story (although there are plenty of side stories within the games guilds, etc), which, without giving any spoilers, is very enjoyable and definitely held my interest far more than anything like this in any MMO's I have seen, with the exception of maybe SWTOR. Definitely feels like a more story oriented game, which I love. I feel your character has a much more grounded place in the game world!

- Combat, combat is somewhat similar to WoW in the most basic sense, abilities come on a bar, and are used in whichever way you want to fight enemies, heal allies, etc. The global tick rate (global cooldown) is longer than WoW, so if you are used to WoW, you might find it a bit slow to begin with. The abilites in game feel varied and are unlocked at a steady rate, letting you get slowly used to the class you play until you reach endgame. 

- UI, the UI is reasonably good. It provides all of the information you need, but is probably the one point I feel needs the most work. Once you get used to it, it's completely fine, but can be a bit confusing to begin with. It can sometimes feel like there are a lot of menus to click through, but the improvement from 1.0 is so huge, and it does do the job, that I feel it can be overlooked a bit. 

- Game World, the world is beautiful and full of diverse environment. The world is very large, and definitely worth exploring. One issue, is that (mainly at least) because the game is currently supported on PS3 (though this may change in the future), a lot of the world is accessed through loading screens. If you are expecting a WoW-esque free world with no loading screens, you may be dissapointed. To me, it's not a massive deal, but I know for some it could be a problem. The loading screens are not long and I don't feel it detracts much from the overall experience. It is also something that has been mentioned by the devs which could change in the future. For me, the quality of the world is enough to let me look past this problem, but for you it may be different.

- Crafting/Gathering, for me, ARR has one of the best crafting systems I have seen in an MMO. Crafting is done with individual classes representing the different professions, for example Armorsmithing, Cooking, Leatherworking, etc. Gathering is done in a similar fashion with regard to classes, Miner, Botanist and Fisher. The crafting system is very satisying, useful to the actual game experience (not just a money sink, or waste of time), and very complex at the higher levels, with apporpriate levels of reward! The crafting and gathering classes can all be acquired, just like the combat classes, making for a character which is very diverse and can (technically, if you have enough time!) do everything in the game without the need for alts.

- Updates, the game recieves frequent, and large updates. There have been big chunks of content added on a regular schedule, which I would say, puts other MMO's, especially WoW, to shame. The updates come frequently and add lots of content, making it worth the monthly fee, and meaning you never run out of things to do.

Overall I would give this game a 9/10. I think that with a few improvements to the UI and world loading, aswell as minor things like balancing, this could easily be the best MMO that currently exists, and I would heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I was very skeptic to play Final Fantasy XIV at first. Coming from Phantasy Star Online 2 back in 2015, FFXIV looked slow, stiff, and overall not challenging to play. The subscription model made it even harder to justify playing it, as I had always seen monthly subscriptions as a way to milk players' money as much as possible. When I was gifted the game by a friend (there was no free trial back then), I decided to give it a try just to confirm my thoughts. I could not have been more wrong.

Disclaimer: as of writing this, I have around 500 hours of playtime on the standalone version. I've played through two of the first expansions and I'm halfway through Shadowbringers.

As someone who usually ignores stories in video games as they tend to not conform to my standards, I was blown away by how captivating this game's narrative is. It's incredibly refreshing to come across an MMO that not only has a good story, but *knows* it has a good story. FFXIV has no problem throwing you 10 quests in a row where you don't fight a single enemy, because it knows the story alone is enough to keep you interested, and it is absolutely right. Every sentence was crafted to enhance your immersion in the world through character development that goes way beyond what I've come to expect from JRPGs, and story beats that hit you like a truck when you least expect them. If you care in any way about story-driven video games, you cannot miss this game.

The combat, at first, is slow. You'll be pressing the same three buttons over and over for a good couple of hours when you first start this game. While I considered it a problem as an MMO veteran when first starting out, it makes sense as an introduction to non-MMO players, or even people not used to games in general. That said, the game quickly develops on your class' toolkit giving you action after action until you have two hotbars of skills that are all universally useful in the right situations. Some of the more fast-paced classes (Ninja, Astrologian) feel like playing Dance Dance Revolution as a kid, all while dodging whatever the gigantic f*****g monster you're fighting throws at you. I've not yet done end-game raid content, but from what I've seen of my guild mates they expand on this even further.

If you don't play this game, it's completely understandable to be flustered by the payment model. Paying for a game, expansions and a monthly subscription on top of that rings a siren in the ears of any sane consumer, but this is different. Final Fantasy XIV does NOT pull any tricks to keep you subscribed. You get a good game with a huge amount of content and that's *it*. If you play for the story, you can subscribe while there's story content and simply stop paying until the next patch. If you play for raids and end-game content, you can pause your sub once you're tired or feel like playing other games.

Three years ago, a japanese player asked YoshiP (the game's director, Naoki Yoshida) how to stay motivated to keep playing in between patches, when content naturally dries out for a little while. His response was the following:

""It's alright not to play it everyday. Since it's just a game, you can stop forcing yourself if it's hard on you to keep that up. Rather, it'll just pile up unnecessary stress if you limit yourself into playing just that one game since there are so many other games out there. So, do come back and play it to your heart's content when the major patch kicks in, then stop it to play other games before you got burnt out, and then come back for another major patch. This will actually make me happier, and in the end, I think this is the best solution I can answer for keeping your motivation up for the game."" (source: /u/elevenmile on /r/ffxiv)

Reading this response is what made me realize what kind of experience I was paying for. In PSO2, to play end game content you *have* to log in at certain times of the day where such content is available, otherwise you miss out completely. After playing for years I grew resentful of the game because it felt more like a job than an enjoyment for me, yet I couldn't quit because I'd be behind if I did. In Final Fantasy XIV, you're experiencing the world on your own terms. No pressure, no time gated content, no manipulative tricks to keep you subscribed. If you don't feel like playing, just don't. The developers very clearly respect the player's time and it shows in game.

I can't force you to play this game, but I hope my thoughts helped you decide for yourself. Even if you ultimately decide to not play it, I recommend you watch Noclip's FINAL FANTASY XIV Documentary on YouTube. The development cycle of FFXIV and how it went from a financial disaster to SquareEnix's biggest hit is a great story.

[h1][u]FF14 Con:[/u][/h1]
[i]Gonna do cons first as that's more important for a should I buy imo[/i]
[b]SLOW AS ****[/b][i]like watching paint dry slow, seriously seriously slow[/i]: 
This con needs it's own subsection as it's slow in so many aspects.
[olist]
[*] Slow/ bland early quest progression - After starting the game as a new player you will spend approx 30-40m doing run to character A for tedious dialogue, now run to character B for some more tedious dialogue and if you are really really lucky you will get to run to character C for..... you guessed it more tedious dialogue. Eventually Character C will send you off for the inevitable kill X amount of adorable critters quest because. hey who likes critters am I right, it's not like Eorzea has P.E.T.A or anything. I know that you are a new low level day 1 adventurer and can hardly be expected to go kill a legendary dragon first day on the job but ""please can you take this note to my mate who is upstairs in the pub"" is a bit rediculous. [i] This changes abit more at late game but not much [/i]
[*] Slow combat - One of the biggest complaints you will hear from anyone about FF14 is the combat. Early level it is excruciatingly tedious. Auto attack speed and damage is roughly to normal, however alot of you moves share a GC and it's set to around 2.5 seconds this is a very long time especially at early level when you only really have a hand full of moves all of which will likely share the same GC. It is worth noting that this becomes less of a bore as you level and get more moves but for a new level 1 player this can be a deal breaker.
[*] Slow Leveling - Leveling in the game can feel like a grindy chore and it's something that alot of people complain about, the game has quests like you would expect from a traditional mmo but honestly most of your Exp will come from a mix of Fates(Public quests) Leves (like quests but not quests, it's a weird pre realm reborn system that hung around) and instances. This isn't exactly a bad thing as personally I would rather run dungeons than kill 10 boars and run back to someone but Exp gain is quiet slow(buy food in the first town and eat it, food increases EXP gain by like 3%, no one tell you this and alot of people miss out on extra EXP  early game) early game theres only like 3 different dungeons so running them repeatedly gets old fast. 

This is more of a gripe than a con but meh, Recently some jack*** dev(clearly someone in the cinematics team) decided that they worked so hard on the main scenario cutscenes. so players should not be able to skip them. This dev is an ***hole and everyone hates him/her.
Also houses cost your soul, ingame and IRL, not even kidding like ridiculously expensive, but alot of people band together and by a guild hall so meh.
[/olist]
Con over now to the pro's, seriously the only real issue is the slowness.

[h1][u]FF14 Pro's:[/u][/h1]
[b]Current Content[/b]
FF14 has some incredible content most of it is end game, like alot of it. I remember playing pre expansions(so just realm reborn) hitting 50 and saying to my friend ""So what's left?"" We looked about and immediatly found out that the game pretty much starts at end game, here is a list and brief info about some of the content:
[olist]
[*] Primals - Although you fight some of the primals (GFs/Summons) through the main storyline, some of them can only be attempted at end game, also you can attempt them on harder difficulties which honestly completely changes the fight and gives loot, primal skinnned gear :).
[*] Classes/Crafting - So orignal day 1 combat classes are split into 2 groups Disciple of War, Disciple of Magic. theses classes evolve once you hit 30. If you feel like you aren't enjoying your current class you can go to the trainer for one of the other classes and they will give you a quest to change class. You won't loose your level in the current class so 1 character can have a max level for all classes if you want to put the time in. Crafting is apparently really fun and an entire game to itself. I've not done it as it's never been my thing in MMO's but apparently it's very good and there are character classes specifically for crafting.
[*] One Character, ALL OF THE THINGS - the game has a multi class system which lets you swap class based on the weapon you use, these cannot be changed mid combat or whilst in a dungeon/instance/raid, however outside of that as long as you've done the class quest to unlock it you're free to switch anytime you like.
[*] Raids - The raids a fun and one of the biggest things going for FF14 is that the instances and raids feel epic, they have interesting mechanics the environments have a feel of grandeur, Good King Moogle Mog is the most epic box fight music you could get, and the general feel while instancing is awesome. 
[*] Chocobo raising - you can dye your chocobo and train it for chocobo racing,
[*] Mini games - This MMO loves it's mini games like seriously loves them, they added a version of the golden saucer from ff7 to the game and they also added a version of the tera master card game. It's pretty fun.
[*] Querky Quests - I complained before about the early level questing being dull but the end game quest are awesome espesially when you start to realise they aren't really there for leveling more for a fun side story. There are alot of really querky and fun quest lines out there so find them and enjoy the oddness.
[*] Outfits and costumes - You can either glamour a single item of gear at a time using a consumable item each time you want to glamour the gear, or you can use the consumable and add the gear piece to your waredrobe, this destorys the gear but makes it accessable to use whenever and doesn't cost to apply.

The game does have PVP, I've never done it tho.
[/olist]
[b]Story[/b]
The Story in FF14 is split 3 ways:
[olist]
[*] Main Story - It's a true final fantasy game, the story line is very enjoyable if story is important to you then you'll love it.That's all I'll say as I don't want to spoil anything. Also dont worry about skipping cutscenes for general story stuff if you wish to save time, you can retire to your character room at the inn and watch them all at once if you like, ok now that's all I'll say on the main story line.
[*] Class Story - Each Class has it's own Story quests cutscenes etc, they are fun introduce some cool characters over all a nice addition to leveling.
[*] Querky Quest - Some of the quest lines are like their own little miniture adventure for example the detetive quest line which probably has the most notoriety. Again I don't want to spoil anything so I'll say no more, but they will probably give you giggle or two.
[/olist]
[b]New Content[/b]
Dev support for this game has been great, probably because it's making square enix so much money that they are actually funneling it back into development.... I know right a company that realises if you want your MMO to do well you've got to add more content, It's quiet refreshing. We get quiet alot of ingame events and things also new story progression which basically covers a build up to the next expansion. 
[b]Community[/b]
The community is amazing, Don't get me wrong like all games some people are toxic but overall the community in FF14 is great. There's a novice global chat that new players are auto added to which high level can opt into being a mentor etc, if you have any question people tend to reply real quick and are genuinely pretty decent in helping others.

[b]Final Verdict[/b]

916440,Anno 1800,"This review is for newbies. NO DLC's. (Don't buy them until you get to grips with playing the game. You have plenty to do believe me!) I've played Anno 1404, but Anno 1800 is a big challenge for me in comparison. 

First, this is one of the most beautiful games I've played. It is sheer joy visually and I recommend zooming in to look at the detail as you expand your cities. I particularly like to see the wake as the ships move, Superb!
Second, I play on the ""don't hurt me"" easiest mode because I really need to do that to learn as much as possible without too many distractions. As a beginner there is a lot to take in and you will make mistakes. If you make mistakes, which is making things more difficult playing the game, then erase and start again. At the start you need income, or you will face bankruptcy. Do the quests. Good sellers to get money are potatoes at the start, next soap, next plantain in the New World, along with cannon imported from the Old World. Keep a supply line of cotton going to the Old World so you can sell fur coats. By that time you should have all the money you need.
Third, the economy and balancing supply and demand is the biggest challenge in the game. It can be frustrating. 

If you are the type of player who has little patience, then this is not the game for you.

Fourth, check your supply lines regularly. What seemed essential when you got that ship to move wood may be just going to and fro for no purpose or gain.
Fifth,  leave space as you build and choose your siting carefully. This is a big frustration for me at the moment and I'll give you an example so you are forewarned, because Ubisoft don't!
It is time for me to install electricity. There is plenty of oil in the New World, so I built what I needed only to find I could neither install Electricity in the New World, nor transport the oil to the Old World. Okay, lesson learned.  So I look for oil in the Old World, which is one island and the one I was trying to keep attractive for visitors. Great! I build what I need, after a lot of correcting mistakes, to get a power station up and working. Now I could install the shipbuilding, so I could get tankers built.  No! I found not only does it need electricity, it needs to be in the actual harbor, not where the oil terminal is based.  That means I will have to rip out a sizable amount of infrastructure to get a power station with a rail link to connect the shipyard to build tankers! No warning in-game at all until you see the icon floating above the shipyard. Getting the picture?
Sixth, don't be too ambitious. There is a temptation to grab as many islands as you can. Which is prudent to get raw materials, but developing them to get that missing raw material can be a headache. It might be better to trade. At times there can just be to many balls in the air for a juggler to catch! This is another lesson learned.
Seventh, watch your influence count. I have had to juggle things around a lot to get sufficient means to do what I need to do. This is certainly important when you build a zoo and museum. Another lesson learned. Now I have to find out how to accumulate the influence I need. More on that later!

Think ahead! Watch You Tube videos to get an idea what you are letting yourself in for.
The game is a non stop challenge and I'm glad a reminder comes up to get a cup of coffee. It is an absorbing game which easily passes the time.

916440,Anno 1800,"I played this game for some weeks, and now I understand why the British or any other European nations colonized my ancestors and took all the riches for themselves.

Throughout my playthrough of Anno 1800. All i ever care about is Ditchwater (the starting island), which I later renamed to Augustgrad after the campaign is finished. I only developed La isla (the first colony island you get) until I can extract its oil so that I can send it to Augustgrad, because meagre oil available in the old world is not enough. 

Once oil from La Isla is not enough, I started developing Prosperity (another island in the new world) which I haven't even touched at all for some time, just so that I can send more oil to the old world. And then I started needing so much more rubber, so I started sending steam engines to the new world so that I can farm those rubber faster. Then those damn investors wanted cigarrettes, so I had to send even more steam engines to farm those even more faster. 

Eventually, La isla and Prosperity alone is not enough as my ambitions reached Trelawney and later the arctic. So I colonized Manola (a large empty island in the new world) and developed it to be my factory island on the new world. Chocolates, cigarettes, rubber gums, ethanols, mezcals, hot sauce, coffees. Everything is produced there, and none of them are given to the locals. All of it goes to Augustgrad. I even started the Aluminium production chain only to built everything on the old world so that i can satisfy their lettering needs.

I kept telling to myself that I'll eventually make the new world prosper as soon the supply to the old world is stabilized... but it never did... the people always wanted more... there's always something lacking somewhere that lowered the number of digits on my income. I don't like that... so I kept expanding, scrubbing wealth, exploiting the land.

And yet... like Dostoevsky once said. If the people are bereft of any problems, any troubles in their life. If all they have to do in life is to eat cakes, sing, write poems, do arts, and enjoy their blissful life. They will take it upon themselves to create problems out of thin air. thin air. out of sheer ingratitude just so that they will have their way. I have given everything to my people, yet they are never satisfied. I have eliminated all of my competitions (except Qing, I couldn't do that to her) and yet, they are not satisfied. 

They all live in their palaces of glass and steel, looking down from the heavens that were so unreachable just decades ago. And yet, they are not satisfied. I haven't touched Enbessa yet (the in lore Northern Africa). I am one button away from finishing the expedition and unlocking the region. But I know what will eventually happen to the people of that land to. They will be the foundations upon which the glass palaces of my old world will be built on. They will want more. They always want more. They want everything there is to ever want. They will desire everything until there's nothing else to desire. What happens after that? What happens after you've eaten all the cakes you could ever eat? drank all the drinks you could ever drink? What happens after you've written all the poems, seen all the arts. What happens when you have all there is to desire, and yet, you still desire for more?

916440,Anno 1800,"The game is great. It is the kind of game where I will sit down to play for a bit while I finish my coffee in the morning and then close it frantically when I realize it is dark outside again. 

Thankfully, the game's addictive nature is tempered by requiring Ubisoft Connect. 50% of the time I have to do a full restart on my PC to get Ubisoft Connect to launch; 100% of the time I have to log back in to my account with two-factor authentication. Cleverly, the Ubisoft Connect ""Remember Me"" and ""This is a trusted device"" toggles are non-functional.

916440,Anno 1800,"Woah, what wild times we’re living in, Ubisoft finally did a good thing. We live in a timeline, where Anno is THE ONLY not hated game from Ubisoft.

I keep having the time warp issue with this game where I sit down at 11PM and I stand up two hours later and it's 9AM. God. It’s the best Coffee roaster simulator.

Anno 1800 is so beautiful, it sets the standard for beautiful art direction and graphics in its genre. The pinnacle of economy management/Trading/Colony building games. As unforgettable as its predecessors Anno 1404 and Anno 1602. A must have for anyone who loves the genre.

Anno 1800 is an economy-logistics simulator with strong city building elements and mild RTS features, where you manage the needs of your citizens through production chains as you grow your city or colony, ever expanding to more complex systems.  

You start with managing the simple needs of farmers (fish, clothes and alcohol), but pretty soon you're juggling two different workforces when factory workers are introduced to manufacture materials like bricks and steel. Those workers also love beer and sausages so you had better produce those too. 

Then you get artisans who can produce more refined goods like glass, but they also have more refined tastes like ...canned beef?  Uh oh, your island doesn't have all the resources you need to can that beef, you'll have to colonise a new island and establish a trade network.  

Now there's an opportunity to explore an entirely new map and colonise there as well, and before you know it you're trading goods across not just multiple islands but multiple maps!  All the while you're managing diplomacy with other island cities and pirates. Phew.

If that sounds like a lot, the game brings balance with a beautiful relaxing art style and does a great job of introducing complexity slowly so as to not be too overwhelming, and trust me there is a lot of complexity.  But somehow, it doesn't feel stressful like Surviving Mars does.  There's almost always adequate time to problem solve issues before things spiral out of control.

It’s just such an amazing experience. Simplistic to start, yet each layer adds another tier of difficulty and being able to stay on top of each of the 20 required materials or so by mid game really becomes difficult. If your not proactive you’ll have riots and that anarchist guy that mocks you.

But if you can get it down. Then extrapolate it to the other regions (crown falls, new world, embessa, artic) giving each region a bit from the others, and tying it all together with a delicate knot formed by 200 trading ships. 

It’s such a delicate state to achieve but there is great satisfaction at being able to master the intricacies and see your city grow from a dirty potato town into a thriving metropolis complete with cultural buildings, a palace, and even freaking skyscrapers!

I really highly recommend it. It is true that it is more complex than the previous Anno (which were already complex in their own right), but with that comes more fun and it is very rewarding to learn it in my opinion. I guess what I mean its that its the good kind of complex, in the sense that there's a real good reason for it.

I cannot praise it enough and I think its actually a very good game, not only for the reasons I have stated above, but because of those reasons, its also a good game to keep your brain cells active, you know? Like even the most trivial and simple tasks here makes you calculate a little bit, and thats always good.

One of the best games of its kind ever, also one of the only games recently to go back to its roots and actually build upon what was great. If you've ever felt an itch for a real time strategy game that has elements of city building and complex resource management, then Anno 1800 might be just what you're looking for.

The game is set in the 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution, and you must use your resources wisely to grow your city and become a successful leader. One of the things I loved about this game is the attention to detail in the graphics. The buildings and landscapes are beautifully rendered and really bring the world to life.

As you progress through the game, you'll have to manage a variety of different resources, including food, goods, and workers. This can be challenging at times, especially as your city grows and your needs become more complex. You'll have to make tough decisions about how to allocate your resources and which buildings to construct in order to keep your city running smoothly.

In addition to managing your own city, you'll also have the opportunity to trade with other players. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the game, as you'll have to decide which goods to produce and trade in order to maximize your profits. The multiplayer aspect of the game is well-implemented and adds a lot of replayability.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Anno1800. The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is complex and engaging, and the multiplayer aspect adds a whole new dimension to the game.

916440,Anno 1800,"[h2]A Brief Summary[/h2]
Anno 1800 is a real time strategy game set during the industrial revolution, focusing on the development of supply chains and logistics between multiple islands. Profits from internal sales and trade can then be used to subsidize the less profitable construction and military supply chains that enable the player to expand and enforce their claims against competitors. While the supply chains are never very complex, the game is slowed down by its obtuse trade route system and extreme lack of instructions on its core mechanics. In spite of its flaws, Anno 1800 generally provides a satisfying level of complexity and progress with little downtime.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2][b][u]City Development[/u][/b]
Each residence will supply workers that can be employed to harvest and process goods. Most goods are consumables which can be supplied back to the island’s population to fulfill their needs, increasing the number of workers per residence and boosting approval. A fully supplied residence can then be upgraded to house workers of the next tier, unlocking new supply chains to support them. Higher tiers bring more complexity, profit, and power. Unlike other colony sims, Anno 1800 is somewhat unique in that workers and storage don’t need to be placed in any particular pattern to mitigate transport time. This pushes the player to maximize the value of their space by packing in the buildings as tightly as possible. The game provides tools to edit and copy blocks of buildings to minimize the effort required to expand existing sectors, leaving the player to focus on new developments.

[b][u]Colony Management[/u][/b]
Warehouses serve as portals into an island’s total inventory, effectively linking nearby structures to the stockpile. To transfer items between islands, the player needs to set up shipping routes. Different islands often have access to different resources that are necessary for certain supply chains. For instance, hops cannot be grown on the player’s starting island and are a mandatory part of the beer supply chain. Further, the island attractiveness system and the space needed for farms push the player to export their low-level and polluting industries to other islands. Concentrating wealth on one island allows for more advanced supply chains and a higher profit margin provided the player can form a robust shipping network. Like most aspects of the game, the player is rewarded for thinking ahead to plan and defend their goals.

[b][u]Naval Supremacy[/u][/b]
With the introduction of steel and weapons factories in the worker tier of citizens, players can begin constructing warships to control the seas. The smaller gunboats are effective at pursuing trade ships, but can be completely deterred by frigate escorts. A Ship of the line carries twice the firepower of a frigate, finding its niche in locking down channels and conquering new areas. While the settlements owned by competitors can be razed, their coastal batteries are able to outclass anything a ship can carry. Large settlements, however, will typically crumble without regular shipments from their colonies. Ships are slow to produce and mobilize, but their costs are more than justified by the value of the trade they can secure.

[b][u]Influence[/u][/b]
Influence is a limited resource that can be allocated to control various aspects of the game to benefit the player. While players with a larger population will have more influence, it comes with a larger area to secure. Every ship and coastal battery consumes influence, as do claims on islands and the ownership of competitors’ shares. A large military and merchant fleet may come at the expense of economic and civil bonuses. The tax gains from propaganda can conflict with the player’s ability to claim new islands. Influence serves as an adaptive budget that can be allocated across both the player’s military, economy, and empire to support their strategies over the course of the game.

[b][u]Difficulty[/u][/b]
The difficulty options in game impact a number of factors that significantly influence the game. The easiest difficulty has larger islands with more plentiful resources. More importantly, the easy rival players are rooting for you, offering donations and alliances without being prompted. The easy difficulty can help an inexperienced player fudge their way through the campaign without cutting out the core mechanics. Higher difficulties are then used to explore worlds with fewer resources, forcing conflicts and demanding more of the player. The cast of characters used on such difficulties is adapted accordingly to be faster, more ambitious, and opportunistic. Though it’s pretty clear that the NPCs cheat to some extent, their capabilities are believable and they are well characterized through their actions. Ultimately, the difficulty options are done remarkably well.

[h2]Problems[/h2][b][u]A Lacking tutorial[/u][/b]
Formally the in-game encyclopedia has a single entry describing what lifestyle needs are, while the campaign demonstrates the early supply chains. [i]That’s it[/i]. Notably, the player is not taught essential mechanics like how to colonize new islands nor are they offered any explanation as to where the money comes from. Spoiler—it doesn’t come from either external trade or even taxes. The bulk of the money is generally obtained by passively selling goods back to one’s own population. Like many things, the details are left to be discovered by hovering over elements in the various menus in the game or, more likely, looking up guides online.

[b][u]Moving Items[/u][/b]
Trade routes can be set to move a specified quantity of items from one island to next on repeat. Though demand is usually measured in items per minute, the trade system offers no prediction to the average throughput of any given route. Should multiple routes pull items from the same island, extra capacity in any of them will suffocate the others. To make matters worse, there is no control to make a one time transfer from one port to another, or even offload the unique contents of a ship when it arrives at its destination. Despite being a game about logistics and supply, it is extremely painful to move items from wherever they are in the player’s territory to where they are actually needed, slowing things down and generally inhibiting the player’s economy in ways that are prohibitively difficult to resolve.

[b][u]Slow[/u][/b]
The amount of fiddling required to move items results in delayed construction and poorer coordination between the player’s islands. The wasted productivity then becomes a substantial loss for one’s treasury, further restricting development. All the while, the player needs to stop to manage the supply and demand charts on top of the flood of reminders that, somewhere, a ship is under attack. While setting up a new supply chain is relatively quick with the necessary resources on hand, constant distractions and logistical difficulties easily inflate what would be fifteen minute tasks to hour long affairs. As a result, the quantity of supply chains and level of management needed to debug them takes up enough time to largely invalidate the upper half of the technologies in the game. Alas, the game is certainly an active experience.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
Anno 1800 is generally a good and capable game. While it does a poor job of communicating its mechanics, the game supports the player with excellent NPC competitors in its difficulty options. While there are a lot of tasks that require the one’s attention on a moment to moment basis, the player is almost always actively planning and engaging with what it has to offer. There is a constant progression and anticipation for greater things throughout the game. The logistics are pretty frustrating though. It’s pretty good, though far from perfect.

Everyone's rating in the Anno series is pretty much the same: ""This is the best Anno game besides <insert their first Anno game they played>"". For me it's the best Anno game besides Anno 2070.

[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]
If you like any real-time city builder, do yourself a favor, forget this was published by Ubisoft, and buy Anno 1800. It's probably one of the best out there and it has so much content that you'll probably get bored before seeing it all. 

👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]
+Amazing attention to detail
+Relaxing and complex building mechanics
+Cool soundtrack

👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]
-Will get overwhelmed with how much content it has
-Campaign is mostly a big tutorial

[h1]Story[/h1]
There isn't much to talk about here, the campaign is pretty much a big introduction to game mechanics and after it ends you continue on the same map(s) which was a pretty good idea. 

As for the story of the campaign, you get invited by your sister to come home, due to some problems with your father, you arrive, things happen, and now you have an island to take care of and deal with your uncle being an asshole. 

Not much else can be said about it, you obviously won't play Anno for the writing or the characters, but they did try to make a decent story so I'll have to rate it accordingly. 

Story rating: 6/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Anno 1800 is a city builder that focuses a lot on the economy, and your citizens among other things. If you're not a fan of the combat in RTS games, then you can play this game safely as you can avoid combat 90% of the time by either game settings or allying with the AI or pirates in the game. If you do wish to have combat, it's all at sea and it only starts halfway in the game when you can afford to build them. 

Anno 1800 when it comes to gameplay it can be very relaxing and time-consuming while also overwhelming you as your city, economy, and people grow. It's not just a simple, build your buildings and that is it. Each house grows in its inhabitants and they all have needs that you must fulfill in order for that specific house to keep growing. Once it has reached a certain point they can get upgraded to the next level of citizenship. That, in turn, means, you lose the previous type of workers and you have to keep building more and more, and as your city grows, so do the needs. It's a constant battle to maintain demands while also having a positive income, mostly because every manufacturing building has costs that drop your income significantly. These costs are money and worker-wise. You can't just spam sheep farmers if you do not have enough farm-level citizens or enough income. 

It only gets better from there or worse depending on your view, as your city evolves the game then opens up with shipbuilding and capturing other islands. You'll have to then build a lot of ships to gather resources that are not available on your main island and move them from your secondary islands. Ships also cost income, and you'll also have to take care of the people on the other island as well. And just when you finally managed to have a positive and on-rails economy, the game opens up even more through expeditions where you have to build a ship, fill it up with resources and start a voyage to unknown lands. Once you reach these lands, such as the Arctic, you're going to have to build a settlement there as well which has its own unique mechanics and buildings. Congratulations, now you have to deal with even more cities. 

Anno 1800 does offer you the chance to play with friends either by controlling the same city or you can be two players as allies. You can probably spend 100 hours alone playing the game and reaching the point of nothing else to do, which may get boring for some due to the amount of content. 


Gameplay rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Audio design wise it's pretty great. Every building, every part of your city as it grows has its own unique sounds, the more your scroll down the more you hear your people roaming the city, going to work, dorks barking, etc. 

The soundtrack is pretty good as well, each region has its own unique set of songs that fit perfectly well with the atmosphere. As for the voice acting, it's okay, nothing really out of the ordinary, not good but not bad either. 

Audio rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
Tech-wise I'm in awe of how much detail Anno 1800 has. The game is a technical marvel, every building has its own unique look, actual people roam the city as it grows, they go to their jobs, etc. Texture detail, atmosphere, water details, everything is absolutely top-notch. 

That being said, all these amazing details come at a cost as the game is very demanding in hardware. A shame it never got updated with DLSS because Ubisoft won't allow them to due to its partnership with AMD. It has FSR, but it's the 1.0 version which is a blurry pos. 

As for bugs and other problems, the game is surprisingly free of them. 

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 9/10

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you want a fantastic city-builder that focuses a lot on its citizens and economy with tons of hours of content then there's no reason not to play Anno 1800. Visually the game is one, if not the best-looking RTS ever made.

Buying this completely blind, with all the DLC and gubbins was the sensation of having the most heavy game of all time airdropped directly onto me & flattening me like an Ed Edd n Eddy gag. Immediately evident in its years of careful tuning through content and quality of life updates on top of the sizeable season pass extra facilities and continents. Such a behemoth of moving parts would otherwise have felt mismatched, insurmountable and offputting were it not for the way these mechanics are eased and tutorialised through story context.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"The best Assassin's Creed game since Assassin's Creed 2.
This is coming from someone who hates pirates.

This game comes in three parts being a Assassin, being a ship captain, and being a ubi.... I mean Abstergo employee.

The Assassin part is similar to the previous games, but it is improved.
- Sword fighting feels alot better than previous games, its more Batman-like (Arkham games) and less Counter-kill spam. 
- Range weapons are powerful, but not over powered.
- They finally put stealth mechanics in the game!!!! A game about Assassins!!!! (You can hide in bushes, long grass and are able to move around)
- Mission design is really good, and more varied than previous games.
- Side missions are amazing too, they range from under-sea diving to whaling to taking over forts.

Being a ship captain is the best part of the game.
- I enjoyed exploring the high seas more than the storyline, I kept exploring till the point where all that I could was the main storyline.
- Your Ship is upgradable and the system is extensive.
- Ship combat is great. It consists of shooting cannons at each other and then boarding for some sword fighting to capture the ship. Its really addicting.

Being a ubisoft employee is in first person, and you mainly do hacking puzzels in it.
- Doing these puzzels unlocks background information, that is really interesting.

Multiplayer
- haven't touched it

Other Stuff
- Optimization could be better, but it is a beatiful game.
- Best play with a controller IMO, until you have to aim with a pistol.
- UPLAY :(

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Before I start, I just want to address one thing:

This is the best AC game I have played so far. And I'm a diehard fan of this series.


Now let's start by a simple pros/cons:

Pros:

+The game doesn't take itself too seriously.
+You really feel like you are a pirate, so careless and free to do what ever you want.
+Almost no map limitations; after the few first missions, you are basically granted the opportunity to explore the world as much as you wish, which hasn't been possible in previous titles. And exploring is as interesting as it can get! Massive amount of islands, fisherman villages, caves, mayan ruins, plantations etc. And the game also rewards you alot for exploring.
+Character design. Edward is an interesting main character and to be honest; there has never been a side character so cool as Edward Thatch, or well, as most of us know him as, Blackbeard.
+Map. It's just... big. And full of places. After 50+ hours on the game, I'm still finding new islands to explore.
+The amount of side activities. Ranging from the usual assassination contracts to defeating legendary ships, you will not run out of things to do.
+Free roaming. Well, this isn't anything new to Assassin's Creed series, but the addition of freely sailing the seas and countering plenty of other ships to board and rob out of their cargo, this game takes freedom of play to a whole new level.

Cons:

-Optimizing is quite bad (which really isn't a surprise though), as the game will be somewhat laggy even on better gaming rigs. Don't expect too many FPS with high graphichs if your PC isn't top notch. It's not unplayable on computers that aren't as good, absolutely not, but you should be prepared for certain FPS drops and lowering your graphic quality etc. 
-The story is quite short (NO SPOILERS) and sometimes feels like it's a bit too much ""go there and kill him so we can be rich arrr!"". Story isn't bad, I really enjoyed it, but I still hope it would've been a bit more deep in some aspects.

Summary:
This has got to be one of my favorite games of all times, as it never fails to excite me. Are you a diehard fan of the series or just looking to be the ""deadliest scourge of these seas""?

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Black Flag is competing to be the best Assassin's Creed title since Assassin's Creed II.
Not only the story is well written to a point that not only the gamer relates to the main character, a pirate named Edward Kenway, it also creates an emotional tide with the adventure and exploration of sailing the high seas and hunting treasure and other bounties while discovering more about the Assassins, the Templars, and the secrets of both.

Sailing.
Before Black Flag was released there was a game no one heard of called Pirates of The Burning Sea, a F2P MMO that currently had the title for best Sailing experience, Black Flag took that away and better.
With a immerse and easy to understand camera and control mechanics sailing in Black Flag is an amazing time, so much so that the game gives you the option to Fast Travel if needed, and I played for over 50 hours completing the game, without Fast Traveling Once.
With the additions of random AI Ships with Different Random Cargo roaming the seas, special challanges, secrets, and different weather and time conditions, the sailing it self sells the game.

Running.
The main aspect of running and jumping on rooftops and trees to explore ways to complete your objectives still a big thing and very well crafted, the only Con to it is that often you find yourself jumping in Hay Stacks or Trees just by running Aside some, which is a very hard thing to balance, but even tho very frustrating at the time, it goes away as soon as you get done with it.

Storyline.
The main storyline is very interesting to watch read and play, with various famous characters as usual of an Assassin's Creed game, introduced very well in the story.
The ending feels solid, and with enough questions for more story, but not enough to upset anyone.

Multiplayer.
The multiplayer feels more balanced than previous AC titles, with more maps and a more fluid and Skill Based mechanic.
The only bad thing is that as always and sadly gamers would always for some reason find ways to exploit game mechanics for an easy win.
The game introduced GameLabs a feature that allows players to customize Game Modes, everything from what skills can be used, to how much a kill would be worth, and what kind.
The issue currently with GameLabs is that you can only play your custom made Game Modes with your friends, and only find a Random ""Approved"" Type on the public lobby.
With enough luck, that would be fixed, and a new feature would allow gamers to publicly host GameLab creations for any player to pick and play.

Overall this is the level of detail the so called Next Gen titles should be all about. Great environments graphics, level design, interaction, and details to very small things.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Only halfway through but some impressions so far:

The bad:
-The overall structure is full of checklists of meaningless boring collectibles and repetetive side activies that sadly wear out their welcome too quickly. At least there's half a dozen types or so to vary it up as you play.
-Main mission design is mostly ubisoft trash and full of ""trail/follow"" or forced stealth garbage. Sadly a lot of good mechanical stuff is locked up behind their progression so you can't just ignore them.
-Checkpoints are surprisingly bad. Game over ""Desyncs"" when you cross arbitrary invisible walls are way too frequent and never stop being frustrating.
-Contextual actions and movement is still really terrible and leads to numerous accidents where the insanely overloaded keybindings are a fight a dozen times more challenging than any actual enemies.
-Melee combat is mostly trivial, counter/punsh very easy and basically god mode. Considering how wonky stealth can be that's probably an upside though.

The good:
-Stealth doesn't hold up to better games like Dishonored, but the open world approach gives enjoyable freedom to clearing complex enemy groups and settlements non-lethally without alert.
-Ship combat looks fantastic and is way more fun and tactical than melee combat. Storms and boarding larger ships is spectacular stuff.
-The world looks fantastic and there is a ton of it. Just don't get ocd about ""hovering up"" minimap symbols, cause that's a good way to oversaturate yourself while also missing it all at the same time.
-Has a decent amount of hilarious open world jank and clunky AI behavior that's way more entertaining than anything actually scripted.
-Pet all cats (even the weird ones)

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Great game. Most fun I have had pretending to pirate since Sid Meier took a shot at it in the 90s. Largely addictive, great voice acting for the series, and dialogue that isn't painful to listen to on its own as well. This game could have a real shot as THE redefining moment for a series that has otherwise been largely stagnant. Unfortunately alot of those stagnations still exist here, repeated follow/eavesdrop missions for instance. All in all though this is easily what I would consider the BEST of the entire AC series since the first 2 games. Hope this is the start of a trend in making these more engaging and different/unique with each setting and iteration that follows.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"[h1]Richly populated & extremely immersive // Recommended for AC fans & pirate fans alike[/h1]

+ Significantly less boring hand-holding in the main campaign than the previous entry of the series
+ Reliably solid parkour mechanics; there were a few bugs & glitches, but were very minor
+ Gorgeous graphics & detailed, immersive environments
+ Very strong voice-acting
+ TONS to explore; lots of environmental diversity, & does extremely well to encourage a sense of adventure
+ Ship sailing & upgrade mechanics add a lot of depth to the game
+ Exploration doesn't simply consist of empty fetch-quests & lookout points; there is a lot of treasure to be found & myriad activities to be done
+ Naval combat seems to have found a comfortable middle-ground between simplicity & immersive completxity; it all feels very sensible to pick up, without losing the warmth of immersion (and it's VERY fun)
+ Hunting & crafting mechanics actually felt useful & worthwhile (as opposed to AC3)
+ This entry probably boasts the most interesting & likeable protagonist
+ Huge playable area with a plethora of accessible locations
+ Combat was about as solid as ever; didn't do much to innovate in comparison to other entries of the series, but certainly works well

- This game requires uPlay
- This game requires uPlay
- This game requires uPlay
- Though the main plot was not horrible, it felt considerably weaker than other entries in the series
- SO MANY tailing/eavesdropping missions; personally, I've always found these to be more frustrating than entertaining
- Though combat itself works well, the camera work was considerably less than perfect

[u]The [b]Good[/b][/u]

+ Ship combat is absolutely fantastic.

+ Dual Sword gameplay is fun and badass.

+ Regular Assassin's Creed gameplay has been improved by the swashbuckling fighting style, with added multi-shot guns.

+ Fun customization, with over 15 skins to choose from. Some that have special buffs you must earn by doing quests, which I enjoyed a lot.

+ Suprisingly good and tragic story of Edward Kenway, who's a likeable and complex character- as complex as you'll get in an AC game.

+ Beautiful, big world, full of adventures, cities, and ruins.

+ Good story missions, difficult assassinations.

+ Legendary ship battles are easily the most challenging and fun parts of the entire game.

+ Nice ship customization, and the amount of upgrades for both the Jackdaw's arsenal and Kenway's gear is great.

+ Very good visual fidelity for its release date, especially the sunsets, storms, and nights. I loved sailing into the open sea on full mast.

~ Trailing missions.   F   u   c   k      y   o   u   .

~ The UI is just... bad. Not bad enough to be put on ""The Bad"" list, but like it was designed in 2009. ACIII had a better looking UI than ACIV.

~ While there is little to no replayability, I'm still inexplicably drawn to the ocean.

~ Treasure chests are cool at first, but get tedious real fast.

If you are thinking about buying this game (and ""BUY"" is the plain wording on every Steam store page), be aware you may only be able to play it for the next 6 weeks, before Ubisoft REMOVES it from your library.

Ubisoft also thinks it is clever to put the game on promotion for new suckers just before REMOVING the game.  Ie AC Liberation HD was on promotion price last week during the Steam summer sale, this week the store page says the game will no longer playable in 6 weeks time.  

The Steam store pages (links below) for AC Liberation HD, and Silent Hunter 5, both have notices saying ""Please note this title will not be ACCESSIBLE following September 1st, 2022"".  Even though you BOUGHT these single player games, you will not be able to access them.

I am setting my review on every Ubisoft game I own to negative.  If you think this practice is unacceptable, please comment, upvote the review, or leave your own review.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Arrr, ye pirates ;)

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag feels slightly different, than the other AC titles. Why's that?
Well, first of all, the main components are still the same. 

You're playing as Edward Kenway, a pirate which ends up being involved in the Assassins vs. Templar war.
The gameplay didn't really changed, as you're still running and parcouring around in third-person. Climbing up on lookouts, to reveal the map, collecting stuff like chests and animus fragments, doing assassination missions and following the main quest about a mysterious observatorium.

So far, everything as usual. The one big thing which changed, or was rather heavily extended, is the ship you are sailing with.
Already introduced in AC3, you're also getting your own ship this time (of course, what would a pirate be without a ship ^^), the ""Jackdaw"". With said ship, you're spending a lot of time travelling through the caribbean sea, hunting down whales and sharks, exploring sunken ships and underwater caverns, battling other ships and boarding them to get gold and ressources in order to upgrade the Jackdaw (eg. more cannons, reinforced hull, different looking steering wheels or sails).

In my opinion, the part where you are sailing around and enjoying the dynamic day and night cycle, checking for profitable ships to hunt down or just enjoying the waves on the sea is the best part of the game.
The Sea Shanties (your crew will sing along on the open sea) are also great for the atmosphere and pretty entertaining (i found myself singing along with them :D ).

The story itself feels a bit bland and is starting off pretty boring in my opinion.
But it gets better throughout the missions and there are quite some interesting and likable characters which improves the story after the beginning.

The graphic is pretty good, nothing groundbreaking, but very atmospheric and it can create some beautiful moments, especially with the day and night cycles.

The world itself is also quite big, with enough places to visit and roam around to fill hours and hours of gametime. If you don't like collecting stuff or repetitive missions/ship battles, then you might be bored after a while. Even though the ship battles feel quite dynamic, at some point, it's still quite the same (especially if you upgraded your ship and you're more powerful).

Overall, i found it to be a ""different"" Assassin's Creed title, as i had the feeling that component wasn't overly present. I had much more fun sailing around and exploring, than following the main mission. But i think that's also pretty subjective. It's still a very good game and i would recommend it to anyone liking the AC titles and/or good action-adventures, especially with a very good pirate-flair.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Every year Ubisoft Montreal releases an [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] game, and every year they have to address concerns that one year isn’t long enough to fully flesh out an engaging, detailed open world. The go-to excuse made by Ubisoft PR is that they operate with individual groups of developers and stagger the development cycle; in essence, they usually have people working on the next game before the previous one is released. This is probably at least partially true. However, it does little to explain how [i]Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag[/i] is narratively and mechanically a blatant reactionary piece to criticisms of 2012’s [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i]. The previous game, which centred on a native American Assassin’s quest for revenge against the backdrop of the American revolutionary war, was criticised for taking too long to actually get into the core story and gameplay, so [i]Black Flag[/i] literally opens with you in the midst of a naval battle during a storm and quickly opens up the sandbox to players. [i]III[/i]’s protagonist, Connor, drew criticism for being too much of an obnoxious, one-dimensional little shit to be in any way entertaining, so [i]Black Flag[/i]’s lead - Connor’s grandfather, the pirate Edward Kenway - is a roguish, fun ne’er-do-well with no allegiance but his lust for riches.

Most significantly the game’s setting draws from the sole item of praise many of us had for [i]III[/i] - the naval combat. Moving the entire game from big cities to the high seas is a long shot for a series that - despite its staleness - more or less stuck to a formula that worked well enough to rake in annual millions, and thank god for that. The result of this long shot is the best [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] to date (at least the best in a fucking long time). It doesn’t play anything like what the franchise traditionally does, which is more or less the reason it’s so good. In fact, the times when Black Flag does the standard [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] things (tailing people on foot, hand-to-hand combat, arbitrarily tracking down dozens of icons that do nothing but clutter the map, tailing people in a boat) are the times when it’s the least enjoyable (who thought it was a good idea to do stealth sections while still in your ship?). Aside from a new focus on naval combat and boarding enemy ships, there are a few extra tools that make the on-foot stealth a lot more palatable than it has been in any previous Assassin’s Creed game. ‘Stalking zones’, the patches of tall grass and foliage you could use as a hiding spot in [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] are more abundant in Black Flag’s stealth missions, and there are extra tools that let you actually take down enemies silently. Where [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] would have given you a game over for being spotted, [i]Black Flag[/i] usually just takes away an extra reward that you could have gotten for remaining hidden. As a result the assassination missions are actually a lot more fun. They’re still not the sandboxy ‘choose your own adventure’ missions they pretend to be, but they certainly encourage more approaches than previous titles. Obviously because it’s [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] the best way to approach stealth segments is to not bother and rush in with guns out, but this is discouraged through the placement of alarm bells which, if rung, summon more enemies to join the fight. This is a pretty poor deterrent, however, as the combat is virtually unchanged from [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i], that is to say you can still fight off huge amounts of enemies with no difficulty whatsoever. I guess you have to take baby steps when you’re making one of the most popular franchises in video games with what is presumably one of the highest budgets in video games.

Further dragging down the mood is the return of the modern day framing plot. The issue here is of course that series protagonist Desmond Miles fucking carked it at the end of [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] in a natural ending to the franchise. Nobody thought Ubisoft would drop the franchise, but we were all hoping deep down that they would drop the modern day plot. At the very least let it have actual gameplay like most of the previous games more or less did (less). Instead, [i]Black Flag[/i] - an action game predominantly about a magical pirate treasure hunt - is framed by a plot in which you are an office worker searching through a pirates memories to find usable footage for a video game developed by Ubisoft. In the fucking game universe. You’re pulled out of the action about 4 times to walk around the building of Abstergo Entertainment (they literally admit it’s Ubisoft in this one) and look follow waypoints in super low-FOV first person. You can optionally leave your Animus at any time to search for little sticky notes and other fun collectibles, but why the fuck would you? Nothing that happens in the 2014 portion of this story matters. Nothing you do in these gameplay sections is fun (you hack into computers by playing Frogger). The weird bookending is pretty out of place within [i]Black Flag[/i]’s actual story, which essentially plays out like Raiders of the Lost Ark with pirates, plus it gets weirdly tangential. The hunt for the First Civilisation ‘Observatory’ works really well with Kenway’s arc, wherein his motivation shifts away from selling the location to the highest bidder and towards keeping it out of the hands of the Templars, represented herein by the real-life governor of Havana and his gang of wannabe Big Brothers. There are a few too many tacked on subplots that pander more to pirate tropes (marooned on an island, girl dressed as a boy, numerous searches for buried treasure) than any obligation to the overarching story, but it’s a fun plot with actual characters for once, which is more than could be expected.

Black Flag is a fun game in a lot of ways. The naval world map consists of a couple of major land masses (Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands etc.) with little ports and fishing downs along the coastlines, as well as the game’s least interesting locations - the 3 major cities of Kingston, Havana and Nassau. The weird thing about Black Flag’s open world is that it’s actually close to being as seamless as the E3 presentations made it seem; you actually can just hop on and off your ship most of the time. There are no loading screens outside the major cities and story missions, and most locations have something to do that’s actually fun. Having finished all the meaningful content (everything except the random chests and little balls of light) it’s safe to say that Black Flag is more or less carried by the naval gameplay. Boarding enemy ships is great, jumping from one to the other with all the smoke everywhere is super atmospheric, cannons feel powerful and taken down galleons (the game’s most powerful class of ship) is such a great time thanks to the sheer height of the things (you have to climb up the side of them to reach their deck from yours). Upgrading Kenway’s ship (the Jackdaw) also feels a lot more intuitive than anything of the sort did in [i]III[/i] (although the ‘Kenway’s Fleet’ metagame is a weirdly tacked on way to earn extra cash. It’s also tied to your Uplay account so if you go for another playthrough you won’t have to worry about money, which ruins the progression system).

In spite of all the [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i]ishness, [i]Black Flag[/i] stands up as a competent game that actually makes use of its open world as something that supplements the gameplay instead of the [i]GTAV[/i] approach of just adding some extra travel between missions. Above all, [i]Black Flag[/i] injects life and actual enjoyment back into a floundering franchise that’s basically been treading water since the end of [i]Brotherhood[/i]. I don’t know if there’s a pirate-y way to say this that would make me seem cooler and more trendy, but [i]Black Flag[/i] is a fucking good game.

Actually that probably is how a pirate would say it if they played it.","Very Positive88% of the 55,599 user reviews for this game are positive.",ubisoft montreal release assassin creed address concern long fully flesh engaging detailed open world excuse ubisoft pr operate individual group developer stagger development cycle essence usually working next previous released probably partially true explain assassin creed iv black flag i_emphasizeds narratively mechanically blatant reactionary piece criticism 2012 assassin creed iii previous centred native american assassin revenge backdrop american revolutionary war criticised taking long core black flag literally open midst naval battle storm quickly open sandbox player i_emphasizedii protagonist connor drew criticism obnoxious dimensional shit entertaining black flag lead connor grandfather pirate edward kenway roguish fun ne er no_allegiance lust rich significantly s_emphasizedetting draw sole praise i_emphasizedii naval combat moving entire big city high sea long shot series despite staleness stuck formula worked rake annual million thank god result long shot best assassin creed best fucking long franchise traditionally s_emphasizedo good time black flag standard assassin creed thing tailing foot hand hand combat arbitrarily tracking dozen icon clutter map tailing boat time enjoyable thought good idea stealth section ship aside focus naval combat boarding enemy ship extra tool foot stealth palatable previous assassin creed stalking zone patch tall grass foliage hiding spot assassin creed iii abundant black flag s_emphasizedtealth mission extra tool enemy silently assassin creed iii given spotted black flag usually take extra reward gotten remaining hidden result assassination mission fun not_the sandboxy choose adventure mission pretend certainly encourage approach previous title obviously assassin creed best approach stealth segment not_bother rush gun discouraged placement alarm bell rung summon enemy join fight pretty poor deterrent combat virtually unchanged assassin creed iii fight huge amount enemy no_difficulty whatsoever guess step popular franchise video game presumably highest budget video game dragging mood return modern framing plot issue course series protagonist desmond mile fucking carked assassin creed iii i_emphasizedn natural ending franchise thought ubisoft drop franchise we_emphasizedre hoping deep drop modern plot actual previous game black flag action predominantly magical pirate treasure hunt framed plot office worker searching pirate memory usable footage video developed ubisoft fucking universe pulled action 4 time walk building abstergo entertainment literally admit ubisoft look follow waypoints super low fov optionally leave animus search sticky note fun collectible fuck happens 2014 portion matter section fun hack computer frogger weird bookending pretty black flag actual essentially play raider lost ark pirate plus get weirdly tangential hunt civilisation observatory work kenway arc wherein motivation shift selling location highest bidder towards keeping hand templar represented herein real life governor havana gang wannabe big brother tacked subplots pander pirate trope marooned island girl dressed boy numerous search buried treasure obligation overarching fun plot actual character expected black flag fun way naval world map consists couple major land mass cuba jamaica cayman island port fishing down along coastline interesting location 3 major city kingston havana nassau weird black flag open world close seamless e3 presentation hop ship no_loading screen outside major city mission location fun finished meaningful except random chest ball light s_emphasizedafe black flag carried naval boarding enemy ship great jumping smoke everywhere super atmospheric cannon powerful taken galleon powerful class ship great thanks sheer height thing climb side reach deck upgrading kenway s_emphasizedhip jackdaw feel intuitive sort i_emphasizedii kenway fleet metagame weirdly tacked earn extra cash tied uplay playthrough worry ruin progression spite assassin creed i_emphasizedshness black flag stand competent make open world supplement gtav approach adding extra travel mission black flag i_emphasizednjects life actual enjoyment floundering franchise basically treading water brotherhood i_emphasized pirate cooler trendy black flag i_emphasizeds fucking good probably pirate

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"I played this game over a month or two in early 2016 to have an escape to a pirate adventure. It was one of my best gaming experiences ever as I was very invested in the plot and gameplay, and I was up to have a rollicking good swashbuckle for an hour or two at a time.

You should get it now, in 2020, for two reasons. I think that the flow of the game, now in the light of ""Sea of Thieves"" and looking back, has advantages in the bigger, more epic sea battles which you can also control more. You also get slightly less freedom for more meaningful ""micro-worlds"" on each island. Such as, working through a plantation at night, killing guards in silence until you reach the target. Not just a different island shape with the same content.

I'd advise using the plot hand-in-hand with your sailing to drive your exploration of the islands; sailing around, collecting/unlocking sea shanties and then coming into port to do a mission. Old AC games always suffered from players fast travelling to missions once you got bored of the parkour, this game solved that for me. I often did missions to get the unlocks and cash needed to upgrade the ship and that then drove my way through the content. 

Lastly, I didn't mind the ""present day"" gameplay as I had no spoilers and was invested in the general AC games plot. This isn't too impactful as it can line up with your breaks but some other players don't like it. 

Make sure you take breaks. Use the game to scratch that adventure itch rather than deep-dive. 56 hours and I had completed pretty much all the content. Averaged to an hour a day for two months, I now look back with nothing but fond memories.","Very Positive88% of the 55,599 user reviews for this game are positive.",early 2016 escape pirate adventure best gaming experience invested plot rollicking good swashbuckle 2020 reason flow light sea thief advantage bigger epic sea battle control slightly freedom meaningful micro world island working plantation night killing guard silence reach target not_just different island shape advise plot hand hand sailing drive exploration island sailing collecting unlocking sea shanty coming port mission old ac game suffered player fast travelling mission bored parkour solved mission unlocks cash needed upgrade ship drove lastly mind present no_spoilers invested general ac game plot t_emphasizedoo impactful line break player break scratch adventure itch rather deep dive 56 hour completed pretty averaged month look fond memory

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Easily one of the best games I've played in a very long time. It still follows a lot of the old school Ubisoft Assassin's Creed formulas in that you have to do a lot of following/tailing people (boo) and if you get seen even once, the entire quest can fail. Not fun. However, you DO feel awesome as Edward Kenway. 

Negatives: 
1. As a warning, I played Origins and Odyssey first, which colored my perception of some of the game's mechanics. I hated the way free running is done in this specific game. Quite often, Edward felt ""sticky"" in that you couldn't get him to just jump down or easily move to a different location. It's like, ""Edward, let go, my boy. Let's move along, please! Stop sticking to the wall already!""

2. Without any spoilers...there are a couple of missions that nearly ruined my enjoyment. One dealt with ship and stealthing at night. Another dealt with infiltrating an assassin island. Third were most of the tailing missions.

3. SLOOOOOW moving and manuevering in the Jackdaw which is an issue in some of the missions where waterspouts appear all over the place and you're trying to attack a fort. 

4. No Steam achievements. :( 

5. I usually love underwater sections in games. These weren't done as well as they could've been.

6. I'm not a huge fan of the Abstergo portions of the game. I guess the story dealing with them was okay, but it takes you out of the Animus and breaks immersion. 

Positives:

1. The story is really good. You will probably love Edward Kenway. He's my favorite protagonist in the AC games so far. 

2. Being a pirate is FUN. Taking ships, upgrading the Jackdaw...really enjoyable. Just sailing around on the ship is fun, too.

3. I love the sea shanties. Lots of people hated getting them, but I had the full collection. Certain ones just stick out as some of the best music from any video game I've played in a long time. My crew would start singing ""Leave Her, Johnny,"" and I'd have to sit in place until they finished. I had to hear it every single time they sang it. Eventually, I'd just sing along with the shanties...and that's not something most video games have ever inspired me to do while playing them.

4. I genuinely liked the ship and trading minigame. I know some people probably don't, but it's not required. It's just a little side thing that is pretty enjoyable.

5. Beautiful water graphics. Gorgeous scenery. 

In other words, if you haven't played this game by now, PLEASE give it a chance, especially if you like AC games and love pirates. It's superb.

Overall, Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag is something quite remarkable. An exceptional game that came at a time where the Assassins Creed series, according to the vocal minority, was beginning to tread water. Fantastic mechanics and aesthetic design make this game a cut above the rest. Sailing around the high sea's, my HUD faded in the background, the sound of sea spray splashing against the hull and my crew erupting into Way me Susiana is a truly remarkable experience that I, among many others, will never forget.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"What a wonderful game!

I must admit I had skipped all the ""AC"" hype in the past; brushed it off as a younger-player's game ( I am 54) but alas...I was wrong.


I am a HUGE fan of of the FarCry series and the gameplay of AC4 is alot like that; open a map slowly-revealing points of interest, quests etc etc.

But what REALLY shines in AC4 ( IMO) is the sea combat. Most ( not all) of the sea combat is optional.

And game optimization.....WOW! Even on my 3.5 year old rig the game played smooth and is beautiful ( literally...beautiful; sailing at sea under a full moon listening to my men sing a sea chanty is a gaming Moment =)

So...on to the Bad Stuff ( there has to be bad right? No game is perfect?)--

1. Sword combat- maybe its my age but I never "" got"" the whole sword-fighting thing. Apparently you can"" break "" defenses and such by hitting a certain key but I cannot get it to work. Smoke Bombs are your friend. Trust me =)

2. There are SOME ( not many so far) timed events that are a major PITA. It's the You-Must-Do-X-Then-Y-then -move -HERE-X again ARGH!!!!!

  WHY for the love of GOD fuck up a great game with this crap!??  I assume it's aimed for the younger-nimble-I-will-keep-playing-till-the-nachos-run-out crowd. Its not fun. Doing the same damned thing 20 times is not fun..its WORK.


But! that is rare, and in a gem like this can be over-looked.

242050,Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™,"Okay, first off, I want to say I love this game down to its core. Sure maybe it has bugs and frame rate problems, but this is still one of my #1 Most Favorite Game!

Story: Amazing rich and emotional story though you are not tied to it and can go off and do whatever in the Jackdaw
Gameplay: This is where this game falls a bit. You constantly jump and climb on things you didnt want to. Though overall it's okay
Graphics: When you are looking at moutains, ect. in the distance they somtimes flash back and fourth and also textures take awhile to load in, though other then that, the lighting, weather,water and textures are up at the top for this generation.
Open World: Perfect, if you want to go to a bar and recruit some crew, to then go and invade a hideout and look the treausre to then upgrade your ship. Overall, I give open world 10/10

Overall, I would give this game a 9/10 for its perfect story and amazing open world. I would recommend this to anyone who has a mildy good pc or any consel who wants hours and hours of good open world fun!

Check out the gameplay here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etQtlNT009k

Advantages:
1. The game looks very polished. Even the steps sound satisfying. It's clear what the game wants you to do but it doesn't hold your hand so you feel smart for figuring a puzzle out. The storytelling throught environment is impressive and the visuals are great.
2. It's scary! The first actual monster encounter is terrifying and even though we've seen tons of animatronic games already, this one seems to be different as the monster animations are amazing, it ducks to go through the doorway and gets in the vents. The monster's behaviour seems very promising for the upcoming chapters.
3. A very interesting mechanic (the grabby hands). It is VERY promising and I can't wait to see what the developers will come up with to surprise us. So far you can grab objects, flip objects, open doors and even softer your fall. I think this might become very interesting and complicated.
4. Cheap.

Disadvantages:
1. Bugs. Not a lot but if you like exploring (like me), you'll encounter them. You can see a couple in my video if you'd like.
2. Only 1 chapter so far. Very intriguing but not enough to tell whether the game is going to be good or not. So far seems incredible!

Overall:
I'd definitely recommend buying the game now since it has only 1 chapter. I'd rate the game now as it is 8.5 hugs till you pop / 10. I'd guess that it would get more expensive as more chapters come out so buy it asap. It's VERY promising and cool. The first chapter is short but quite impressive. Just do it, you won't regret it. Hope my feedback was useful! If it was - drop a like so it could be useful to other ppl too :3

1721470,Poppy Playtime,"At first I thought this would be another indie game that would be loved by all, giving lore clues, selling merch, getting theories out of it, all the like. When they announced they'll be selling NFT's, I felt a little disheartened but hoped they would change their minds about it after receiving backlash, but they went through with it anyway. With that controversy going around, I found a Twitter thread by the the name of Tommy Scotty and found out the devs have done other shitty things before this like bullying someone named Ekrcoaster to the brink of suicide, child sexualization in their animations, and found out that Poppy Playtime was made to spite Ekrcoaster's own game they were making, Venge, which was made a year prior to Poppy.

Bottom line, this game is just a blatant cashgrab made out of spite with wasted potential and the people behind it are greedy, bullying, hack artists. Don't buy the game or support MOB Games. If you bought it within the first week or two, refund it now.","Very Positive81% of the 65,140 user reviews for this game are positive.",thought indie loved giving lore clue selling merch theory announced selling nft disheartened hoped mind receiving backlash anyway controversy found twitter thread the_emphasized name tommy scotty found shitty thing bullying someone named ekrcoaster brink suicide child sexualization animation found poppy playtime spite ekrcoaster venge prior poppy bottom line blatant cashgrab spite wasted potential greedy bullying hack artist support mob game bought week refund
1721470,Poppy Playtime,"This review isn't for kids who are coming here from YouTube, I know this doesn't matter to you.

This review is for regular people looking to buy this game with no context, like me.

It's fine. Style is cool, nice concept, interesting puzzles etc.

But it's clear to me that this is the literal physical manifestation of the syndrome FNAF started in ""horror"". Ultra marketable family friendly spooky games like hello neighbor and bendy, which loose a lot of heart after the creators discover the gold mine.

This is the worst case. One half hour chapter is out for 5 dollars and there's already merch, NFTS, a movie in the works, and each chapter is being milked for more cash.

I don't want to tell you your business, but I wouldn't bother supporting if I were you.


UPDATE 5/8/22: Now this game is free, but chapter 2 costs 10 dollars. So for those who bought this when it was 5, now have to spend a total of 15 bucks to play a fraction of the full game. This reinforces the above statements.","Very Positive81% of the 65,140 user reviews for this game are positive.",kid coming youtube matter regular no_context fine style cool nice concept interesting puzzle clear literal physical manifestation syndrome fnaf started horror ultra marketable family friendly spooky game hello neighbor bendy loose heart creator discover gold mine worst case half chapter 5 dollar already merch nfts movie work chapter milked cash tell you_emphasizedr business bother supporting 5 8 22 chapter 2 cost 10 dollar bought 5 spend total 15 buck fraction reinforces statement
1721470,Poppy Playtime,"The game isn't bad, as it stands now, there is only one chapter and it alone is really well made, enough to scare the shit out of most. Really nice stuff. However, I have a big problem with this game, more specifically the dev team behind it because as of now, they've released a set of video NFTs that cost WAY MORE than the game itself to create some kind of treasure hunt, remember those we had back when Scott Cawthon was making new FNAF games? Basically that but the execution is fucking awful. You need to buy a bunch of videos to piece together the evidence but you only get the final one if you pay for all of the other ones. 
NFTs do not belong in gaming, specially not like this. 
So basically, the game is pretty good but I don't trust the devs. Ended up refunding since I don't support NFTs in the slightest.

Edit: There has also been a confirmation that they basically stole creative property from the guy that made Venge. It's on Steam, and it's apparently a game way better than Poppy. There are some videos on YT talking more about that.

Since then I refused to play it and support people like that, now i saw today that the game that everyone paid $5 for people is now free and the second chapter costs another $10, which is possibly the worst monetization scheme I have seen in gaming so far (I'm sure EA will adopt it soon at this point).

As of today, however, I have just learned that MOB Games are a load of worthless scumbags who made a game to spite someone else and is now forcing people to pay $90 just for lore, damaging the environment in the process. I have never had my hopes ripped from me so quickly for a game like this. They got too greedy too fast and I will never forgive that.

582660,Black Desert,"So...

5000 hours played, and just got my Pen blackstar. What's not to recommend?

Here's the thing. This game is a beautiful exercise in game design. Virtually everything, from the economy through to the relative silver rates for crafting, grinding, and everything except hunting, is mathematically-balanced to a genius level degree. The world, quests, and classes have an amazing degree of depth.

The reason I don't recommend? The exploitation of your psychology is also perfectly designed. From the first time you get ganked and swear to yourself 'I'll get my revenge once I gear up', through to the constant shower of micro-rewards; need to login 24/7; gambling-based enhancement; and exponential sunk-cost, this is a game designed to exploit your every weakness to take out your credit card.

It's not a bad experience subjectively; a lab rat will always look forward to it's next morsel as it runs through the maze. But it is a ruthless exemplar of how to manipulate players. A bit like I'd say drugs are probably fun but I wouldn't recommend them, I think the same applies to this game. And much like drugs, you'll probably do better if you don't try them in the first place.","Mostly Positive76% of the 52,940 user reviews for this game are positive.",5000 hour pen blackstar not_to recommend beautiful exercise design virtually economy relative silver rate crafting grinding except hunting mathematically balanced genius degree world quest class amazing degree depth recommend exploitation psychology perfectly designed ganked swear revenge gear constant shower micro reward login 24 7 gambling based enhancement exponential sunk cost designed exploit weakness credit card not_a bad subjectively lab rat look forward next morsel run maze ruthless exemplar manipulate player bit drug probably fun recommend applies drug probably t_emphasizedry
582660,Black Desert,"So, where to even begin. I guess the most important thing here is that this is certainly not the MMO for everybody. This MMO manages to pack in something for every kind of player out there, but that actually doesn't mean it will appeal to everyone. 

First of all, I'll cover the topic of the pricepoint, since in the very most lenient sense here, it's ""variable"". 

It's $10 to get into the game. No monthly fees, nothing. That's pretty handy. The price point is at least low enough that for most people, even if they don't like the game, they won't have lost out on much. Now, chances are, the price point is that low because THERE ARE MICROTRANSACTIONS, IF YOU WANT THEM. I'm putting this at the beginning of the review because I know that this will either immediately deter people, or encourage them to hear me out on this. The best way I saw these described was as ""conveniences"". You can get items that rival the cash shop items, but it will take time, and it will take effort. But, there is nothing to stop someone from simply getting a headstart on the game by dropping a little extra money on the game. Is that bad? Well, at a $10 initial price point, I don't think so, because almost all of the cash shop items are convenience items, i.e. streamlining workers, getting a nicer boat without investing time into it, getting gear to speed up fishing initially, etc. The game counteracts this by allowing a lot of things to be completed AFK, such as fishing, or even autolooping a running path to level up your stamina (seriously, you can just have your character run infinitely between two points and get levels out of it, I can't make this up). Need to level your mount? Check the ""auto feed"" option, stock up on carrots, set an autoloop, and go sleep or do productive things while your character travels between points A and B and your horse learns new skills. So honestly, the cash shop items are certainly a thing which most people would look down on, but I haven't even seen the need for them. That said, I could have higher tolerance for grinding (see my Maplestory hours, let's not talk about it).

Now, on the topic of grinding, this IS a korean MMO, and it's gonna involve a lot of grinding. The AFK system is honestly a god-send, I'm telling you. However, the combat is very dynamic and frankly the best I've ever seen in an MMO (it does seem very similar to TERA, but definitely more rewarding and satisfying). For skills grinding, a fair amount of it can be done while tabbed out, so the grindy feeling there is alleviated to a fair extent. 

As far as skills versus combat, this game does a very good job of letting you choose your own playstyle. Want to make it to the second town and then level all the way to 55+ and make millions by fishing? Sure, go ahead. Want to immediately start a farm and create a monopoly on food goods in the player marketplace? That works too. Set up trade routes between nodes and make all your money and experience through buying low and selling high, it doesn't matter, you get rewarded with level exp for so many things in this game, you can choose how you want to play the game. You can even treat it almost as a single-player game with the Black Spirit quest line, so play how you want to. And hey, if you're still into the kill-quest style MMO, that's all here for you too, and you won't even have to touch the other skills. It's relieving to play an MMO that lets you decide how you want to play it. 

Something I have not been a part of yet is the guild system, which entails warring over territories or capturing areas to claim tax to pay guild members and such. I don't know too much about this, but from what I've viewed, it seems incredible to wage all-out-war with other guilds for essentially control over money. The PvP seems to be a big part of this game, and I'm hoping to make it to that end-game experience soon. And yes, before you ask, these wars DO entail forts, cannons, armies, etc, which just seems super awesome. Other guilds though seem to take the game casually, and only want a community to play with, so that's diversified as well.

Now for the more technical stuff. The graphics are gorgeous, the combat is fluid and feels OH SO GOOD, and the AFK feature is even enhanced by an option to minimize the game to the tray. The chat is very spammy with system notifications when you first join the game, but the settings menus help with all that and it should take you just a couple trial-and-errors to figure out what you do want to see broadcast and what you don't want to see. The quest handling is nice and will even autopath you to destinations, and despite minor environmental hookups (I got stuck on a staircase once) it's a very reliable system and can streamline the early game.

Now, so after all of this, why can't I recommend it to everyone? I mean, I'm giving it a thumbs up, am I not? Well, it's because there is very little explained to you in this game, and that's probably because if they did, you wouldn't ever end the tutorial. The game has so much complexity to it that you're going to want to have YouTube open, whatever databases or guides you can find, a friend on skype, really anything to help you understand a new part of the game you've decided to dabble in. For some, that's incredibly daunting and I can't say everyone would enjoy the game based on this aspect. And this isn't me saying ""GO BACK TO YOUR BABY MMOS YA BABIES"" I mean seriously, this game is a lot to take in and I'm surprised even I can handle it. While I believe you can take the game in any way you like, you still might get curious one day and find a whole new aspect to the game that doesn't suit your fancy, or it's just so horrifically complicated at first that you aren't going to understand it until your 15th fail stack. Now personally, I don't mind having to research an aspect of a game, and I even personally have a journal where I jot down notes for all sorts of games I play (I'm a huge nerd, I know this). But some people want to hop in and just play to end-game, which is okay. Having to find and research your way to the end-game isn't always fun, and I understand that. 

So with all of that said, my final verdict is this: if any of this sounded appealing to you, give it a shot. Given that it casts it's net very wide, you can probably find something you'd enjoy in this game. But, be prepared to do some research, as some of the time you're just going to be confused, no matter how much experience you have with MMOs or in-game economies. If the mention of a cash shop that DOES benefit players deterred you entirely, then, ah well, that's fair, and I'd even encourage you to look elsewhere. Despite it being solely convenience items, I can't dispute the fact that they do exactly that. And finally, if all of this sounded appealing to you, I almost plead with you to play this, as I ended up finding the MMO I was looking for, and I hope you do to.

Thanks!

Edit: Wow! Thanks for all the reception everybody. Glad to see this review is helping people. After discussing the game with a prospective buyer, I realized I totally forgot to mention that the Black Desert Online site DOES ALLOW A 7-DAY TRIAL. Please note, the account used for that trial and the account used in Steam CANNOT BE LINKED, but this is a way for you to try the game and see if you like it! If the $10 or the cash shop is concerning, give the trial a chance and see, and then decide what medium you would want to purchase it on. I'd recommend using the trial and then coming to steam to start anew and know what direction you want to pursue, but please keep this in mind!

582660,Black Desert,"LOOK AT MY HOURS PLAYED. I waited 15 months to write a review. I've pretty much done it all. I'm running around at softcap with pretty much all content acquired. This game IS damn amazing. Today, 24th of August 2018, they made the game truly pay to win. I'm not talking ""added a ghillie suit to the cash shop"" or anything like that, I mean full-blown swipe your credit card to become stronger than anyone who put effort into the game or is skilled at pvp. If you as a gamer, value skill and talent over who has richer parents than for the love of god stay away. There is so much more fun to be had elsewhere. This game is officially dead with this change. I urge all players to leave a negative review to alert people who may fall for this scam-game.

The devs went back on their promise that they would not make NA P2W. Not only should you stay away from Black Desert Online, but you should try not to forget the developers; ""Pearl Abyss"" and the Publisher ""Kakao Games"" as we certainly will see them again in the future to further scam their playerbase once again. If there is any comment you read about BDO that you pay attention to; its this one. DO NOT. I REPEAT: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY.","Mostly Positive76% of the 52,940 user reviews for this game are positive.",look hour waited 15 month write pretty running softcap pretty acquired damn amazing today 24th august 2018 truly pay win not_talking ghillie suit cash shop blown swipe credit card stronger effort skilled pvp gamer value skill talent richer parent love god stay fun elsewhere officially dead urge player leave negative alert fall scam promise not_make na p2w not_only stay black desert online not_to forget developer pearl abyss publisher kakao game certainly future scam playerbase comment read bdo pay attention not_i repeat not_waste
582660,Black Desert,"You need to understand three things about this game.
1.) The game is gorgeous, but, it's a glorified interactive casino. Everything in this game is RNG dependant. 
2.) Like all forms of gambling, this game is extremely addicting. At first it may not be apparent, but, if you're running a beefy PC your electric bill will inform you that this game is consuming your life. 
3.) Like all forms of gambling, this game has the potential to be extremely expensive or extremely cheap while providing the same level of ""fun.""  The ""Pay to Win"" aspect of this game solely exists in the form of convenience. It is 100% impossible for you to spend $100,000 an expect to be the best geared player in the game. That said, it is 100% POSSIBLE for you to spend $100,000 and feel like you still need to spend more. 

So let's talk about that Cost for a second...

The game is designed to make it seem as though you need to spend, roughly $150 in order to have enough pets (for auto-looting), carry weight, and inventory space. However, if you're not a ""hard core"" player the 4 pets you get from questing and the additional 1 pet (5 total) you eventually get from your log-in bonus are more than adequate to keep up with most people's grind habits. The additional inventory slots you get from questing are also more than adequate for most people. Additionally, as a new player you receive several free Value Packs.

The Value Pack acts as a $15/month subscription service. However, if you focus your first month of the game on learning and gearing up you will easily find yourself having an income high enough to purchase a new value pack every month with in-game currency. In the event that you are a little slower on the uptake, you could join any guild that offers 5m silver / day daily pay and push all of that money into a city storage you don't often visit. Then, at the end of the month, you will find that your guild has effectively paid for your value pack. 

TLDR: If you are not a Hard Core player then the purchase price of the game is the only money you will ever *need* to spend. 

But what if you are a hard core player? Well, then, your entry fee is closer to the ball park of $150~250 depending on your Luck with obtaining Tier 4 pets, which is a gambling process involving purchasing multiple of the same type of pet and combining them for a chance at increasing their Tier. You're also going to want as many character slots as you can so that you 1) camp every boss site, 2) have a daily/weekly life skill character at each major resource hotspot, and 3) increase your family fame fund (daily silver awarded to you at log-in). As a Hard Core player you're also going to keep your Silver focused on obtaining stronger / better gear so you'll have a recurring payment of $15/mo ($45/90-day) Value Pack *and* an additional $25/mo for Blessing of Kamasylve (increases drop rate). The Kamasylve cost is mitigated by events where they give 7~15 day kamas out like candy so you can think of this in annual terms at about $150/year. As a Hard Core player you also will want to, later on, protect your TET and PEN enhancements using Cron stones. If you're lucky enough to be in a siege or node warring guild you might already have enough SILVER to buy Cron stones. However, only about 20% of players fall into this category. For everyone else there's Master Card. Reach into that wallet and spend roughly $68 on Costumes to extract Cron stones from *PER ATTEMPT.* Remember what we said about gambling? You can absolutely spend a million dollars here and never get any further. 

But Z!! This sounds an awful lot like Pay to Win!! 
True, depending on your definition of Pay to Win. But consider the following: if you're not a hard core player then you probably aren't ever going to bother with high level enhancing. This means if you decide to get stronger you're probably going to spend in-game currency. Mister Mastercard might spend  $10,000 on his first PEN item. You're going to spend about 17 billion silver on your first PEN. Most casual players at end game can rack in 400~800m/week which means you will see that PEN in about 28 weeks. Most Pay 2 Win type of people are not wealthy enough to drop $360/week into a video game. Do they exist? Sure, but, you have the same chance of meeting Clint Eastwood in Japan as you do of meeting one of those players. At this stage in the game, who is to say the person you run into isn't just someone who has played since launch?  Point is, it's not going to affect your experience on way or the other. 

So now let's get REALLY dramatic. Let's say money is no object for you and you want to be the best, of the best, of the best. Grinding is for peasants, you want to make all of your money and obtain all your gear without even leaving Velia. Bad news, bud. This isn't the game for you. The number of Pearl items you can sell is directly affected by the number of characters you have at level cap. If you only get 1 character to level 60 before you decide you're going to be a wallet warrior, you're only able to sell 10 Pearl Items / week. That means you are hard-capped at 3.35 billion silver / week on money. Your first PEN item is going to take you a minimum of 5 weeks to pay with cash BUT WAIT! There's more! As of writing this post there have only ever been 121 PEN Kzarka Blades sold on the central market place. Meaning, even if you have the silver you are still relying on the rest of the community to make the item.

Okay, so what? You'll just Master Card your way through the TET and PEN attempts. Well, we know of at least 1 player on the NA server who has, so far, failed 85 times in a row on safe TET attempts. But let's say you don't have the worst luck, let's say you have fairly average luck. You are going to attempt about 8 times for TET and about 20 times for PEN. If all of these are going to be safe attempts that's $1,360 for your PEN after you spend $240 on your TET. For simplicity sake let's call it $1,500 per PEN.. this will see you at $10,500 for PEN Armor and Weapons. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!

Accessories will always downgrade on fail when using crons, or break without crons. Let's be generous and say you have average luck, you're using crons, it's all pay 2 win, and we'll call it a conservative $2,000 per PEN accessory. That's an added $6,000

In short, the cost of outright pay 2 win in this game is a paltry $16,000 for the gear BUT DON'T STOP THERE!  Did you think having full PEN would make you formidable in the game? HA! You still need your Dream Horse.  Let's be generous with that too and tack on another $2,000. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!! You need a Frigate! And your Frigate has to be the best of the best of the best.  Let's call it $1,000 per piece of gear to hit +10 (frigate equivelant of PEN) and ignore the cost of actually buying blue gear. So there's another $4,000. So now we're at $21,000 to pay to win the game.

BUT WAIT!! Did you think having a fully decked out frigate was going to make you the strongest master of the sea? WRONG!! Because the free to play pleb has a Carrack. You need to get yourself a Galleus or a Carrack to keep up the pace. Can't let yourself be sunk by some guy that maybe spent $100 on the game. You're a Wallet Warrior, you fall to nobody! So you swipe your card.....  only to find that every single item required to make that ship can only be obtained through Bartering. A long process that requires your physical labor. 

 Where does a full PEN level 60 Wallet Warrior fit in? Bad news, guy. You have to grind. Because unless you are level 62+ you aren't scary even with full PEN. The cost to make you a God amongst players your same level without lifting a finger? $10~20,000 USD. The cost to make you useful in a siege or node war? Priceless. 

TLDR:
It is possible to ""pay 2 win"" this game. But it is inconceivably expensive to do so, would take a minimum of 65 weeks, and the margin between you and the Non-P2W player after 65 weeks will be negligible.","Mostly Positive76% of the 52,940 user reviews for this game are positive.",understand three thing 1 gorgeous glorified interactive casino rng dependant 2 form gambling extremely addicting not_be apparent running beefy pc electric bill inform consuming life 3 form gambling potential extremely expensive extremely cheap providing fun pay win aspect solely exists form convenience 100 impossible spend 100 000 expect best geared 100 possible spend 100 000 spend talk cost designed spend roughly 150 order pet auto looting carry weight inventory space not_a hard core 4 pet questing additional 1 pet 5 total eventually log bonus adequate grind habit additional inventory slot questing adequate additionally receive value pack value pack act 15 subscription service focus learning gearing easily income high purchase value pack currency event slower uptake join guild offer 5m silver daily pay push city storage visit guild effectively paid value pack not_a hard core purchase price spend hard core entry fee closer ball park 150 250 depending luck obtaining tier 4 pet gambling process involving purchasing multiple type pet combining chance increasing tier slot 1 camp bos site 2 daily weekly life skill major resource hotspot 3 increase family fame fund daily silver awarded log hard core silver focused obtaining stronger gear recurring payment 15 mo 45 90 value pack additional 25 mo blessing kamasylve increase drop rate kamasylve cost mitigated event 7 15 kama candy annual term 150 hard core protect tet pen enhancement cron stone lucky siege node warring guild already silver cron stone 20 player fall category else master card reach wallet spend roughly 68 costume extract cron stone per attempt remember gambling spend million dollar never_get z sound awful pay win true depending definition pay win consider following not_a hard core probably bother high enhancing mean decide stronger probably spend currency mister mastercard spend 10 000 pen spend 17 billion silver pen casual player rack 400 800m week mean pen 28 week pay 2 win type not_wealthy drop 360 week video exist chance meeting clint eastwood japan meeting player stage someone launch not_going affect dramatic s_emphasizeday no_object best best best grinding peasant obtain gear leaving velia bad news bud t_emphasizedhe number pearl item directly affected number character cap 1 60 decide wallet warrior able 10 pearl item week mean hard capped 3_emphasized5 billion silver week pen minimum 5 week pay cash wait writing post 121 pen kzarka blade sold central market meaning silver relying rest community okay master card tet pen attempt 1 na far failed 85 time row safe tet attempt s_emphasizeday worst luck s_emphasizeday fairly average luck attempt 8 time tet 20 time pen safe attempt 1 360 pen spend 240 tet simplicity sake call 1 500 per pen 10 500 pen armor weapon wait accessory downgrade fail crons break crons generous average luck crons pay 2 win call conservative 2 000 per pen accessory 6 000 short cost outright pay 2 win paltry 16 000 gear pen formidable ha dream horse generous tack 2 000 wait frigate frigate best best best call 1 000 per piece gear 10 frigate equivelant pen ignore cost buying blue gear 4 000 21 000 pay win wait fully decked frigate strongest master sea wrong pleb carrack galleus carrack pace sunk guy maybe spent 100 wallet warrior fall swipe card single required ship obtained bartering long process requires physical labor pen 60 wallet warrior fit bad news guy grind unless 62 scary pen cost god amongst player lifting finger 10 20 000 usd cost useful siege node war priceless possible pay 2 win inconceivably expensive minimum 65 week margin non p2w 65 week negligible
582660,Black Desert,"I have now 5.660,5 hours on this account besides this I have a Beta account that I played on when the game came out. Aka let me tell you about the game that will make you lose your mind in multiple ways.

If you like exploring, traveling, following a story, questing and lifeskilling you will be drawn to this game from the get go. Also you can drop all your idea's of your perfect E-Girl in the character design. 

When the game just came out it was mostly grinding for a long amount of hours. For a regular player it took around 20 to 40 hours of playtime to get to lvl 50. Now the game has turned into a fresh start friendly game where you get to lvl 50 in just 1 hour of grinding. The game also gives new players tons of stuff to help you to get further into the game. This is not just a MMORPG. It's a Korean MMORPG. This means you will have to grind a fuck ton to be able to do anything besides the things i listed above here. PVP wont be possible if you dont put any time into the game.

Now to the beautiful fail stack system. This is BS RNG based but keeps the game fun if you don't have a temper. The game can make you super frustrated but when you manage to reach your goal you will have a feeling of accomplishment. 

IF RNG IS NOT YOUR THING DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!

When you read this you probably see comments about that the game is Pay to Win. This is BS. The game gives you tons of free stuff and it's easy to get the stuff you want by playing without spending money. But here is a big BUTT. If you want to lvl faster and get more money out of the time that you are grinding spending IRL money on pets/outfits could be an option.

The game end game is 100% focused on PVP. There are sometimes PVE events tho. 

This game is for the people that have a feeling that they need something to put a lot of time in. This is the solution for you. You will meet tons of people that you can play with. There are some guilds where I met tons of awesome players that don't mind to help new players out at all.

582660,Black Desert,Finally finished customizing my character.,"Mostly Positive76% of the 52,940 user reviews for this game are positive.",finally finished customizing
582660,Black Desert,"Pros:

- The world is beautiful. Enemies are different from your regular MMO.
- The combat system is extremely complexed. You ""can"" hotbar buttons, however you're handicapping yourself if you don't press them in real actions like Up+F. It's much more fluid if you press action combinations for combos. What makes this the combat different than the others is move canceling. I didn't know this was in this game until I saw another player performing impossible moves.
- The grind actually feels good because you're performing attacks that are beyond that of rinse and repeat. You even feel like an absolute god.
- lots of jobs: crafting, fishing, tanning, etc. You can get lost in them for hours, and there's also a ranking system on it, which is weird but good if you like that kick back experience.


neutral:

- Gender lock, however some classes are just like the other such as Wizard and Witch or Musa and Maehwa.
- confusing minigames and small tutorial in the beginning that won't teach you anymore after the first 10 lvls.
- No fast travel, just your feet or your mount. The mount is an actual being too. Enemies can attack it seperately and kill it.

Cons:

- No endgame anything. Gears is by daily/weekly miniboss challenges in a particular location, which will take you 5-10 minutes on mount.
- No dungeon runs either. Match making isn't in this game. You want to party with people, you do it the old fashion way: by guild or shouting.
- RNG everything. However, this can be fixed with +luck gear. Luck will help increase particular chances but RNG rules most of everything whether farming, damage from particular anything, drops and stats on gear doing particular things.
- A turn-off to newcomers that don't like hard MMOs. The learning curve for this game is pretty high, but if you like a challenge it's rewarding. Those that like just pressing hotbar commands are the first to suffer after reaching lvl 50.
-A Majority of quests (if not life skills) are fetch and kill. Talk to NPC, go kill 30+ enemies, come back. This is what you call a Korean Grinder MMO.

Pay extra portion:

There are key things that make microtransactions somewhat enticing: Pets, value packs, extra inventory and weight limit expansion. Although you can play this game ""pay once"" like it was intended to be played, however these items make the game much easier PvE. As for PvP, there's nothing that can one up another player PvP other than better gear. Better gear is bought with silver and silver is power. In order to get this sort of silver, there are many ways, and what makes getting silver extremely easier are these items I've listed for microtransactions.

1) Pets w/a max of 4 can pick up items for you and carry on their own. This alleviates some of the stress of picking up items from mobs. Each pet is roughly $8 real money, but if you play the game long enough, 20 days gets you a free penguin (at least for the time being). At lower levels, pets aren't something you'll consider, however in higher levels while you're in a party you'll have that one player with pets, and that player will take everything that's dropped.

2) value packs: you can buy a 30 day value pack for $15, which is basically their version of subscription fee. This can be bought in auction houses with ingame currency, however it's quite hard to get one as it's the highest sought out item in the market and they only release 1-2 every 10-15 minutes. The value pack increase 100 weight limite, 16 inventory slots and 16 storage, and on top of that you get %30 back for auction house sales. What does that mean for sales? W/o it you're typically selling everything for roughtly 60%. That 300k stone sold will only give you back 180k unless you have the value pack in which you'll get back 210k. This actually adds up as you will be selling millions of items in the auction house and a majority of your income is by this.

3) inventory space. In-game there are quests that can increase your inventory space up to 30, or you can pay a premium and increase it even further to around 90, which a lot of life skillers do. If you want to carry a ton of different items, it's almost needed for you to carry so many things at once.

4) weight limit increase. You can grind to increase the strength of your character to carry heavier items, or you can have particular items that already increase your weight limit like the value pack or hercules gear that increase you 150+ weight. However, in higher levels there is gear that is far superior that you'll want to equip, so increasing your strength to carry is something that is either grinded or bought with microtransactions.

There are other items that I didn't list, but that's because they're a want vs need. These 4 that I've listed a borderline ""need"". All-in-all you can potentially play this game completely ""pay-once"" as it is intended whether being $6-10, but you will be extremely tempted to purchase one of the 4 items in order to make your life a bit easier in-game. One of the things you'll probably consider is the value pack as it is basically a subscription fee for WoW or FFXIV. Don't let that mentality of trading one MMO for another for its subscription fee sway your wallet. You should only buy this pack if you really do want to invest your time and real money into this game as BDO is multiple games in one. BDO with the core of a MMORPG has many elements that make it multiple games. These other games are called life skils.

1) Fishing: sure, you can fish in any mmo, but can you build a ship go to another island or in the middle of nowhere and fish there? With whatever you've caught you have options of cooking or finding a trader to buy your fish, which becomes an actual job that many players have come to enjoy called AFK fishing.

2) trade empire: I'm new to this concept but you can potentially connect areas through trade routes, process or build trade crates and have them shipped to another area to sell for a profit. You can have works around the world collect and bring back to your storage items in order to process or built crates to trade again making it a trade empire in which you can also haggle prices for these items in a different area.

3) Cooking/alchemy: the most effecient way to cook/alchemy and make money is by having contract NPC workers find resources, bring it back to your storage units in each town where you can make the necessary food or potions and then sell them on the market.

Again, the 4 microtransactions are borderline needs and they're more purpose for those that are serious about this game and for specific situations. Grinders: pets; traders/fishers: inventory space and weight limit; and alchemy/cooking: value pack. Although you can give your character all of them to make your character more well rounded, they're not much of a need as comparison to these particular key points. I hope this helps, and if you want to know more, leave a comment.

TL;DR

Is this game worth your time? Yes, because other mmos are really old and out of date. Top subscription IMO is FFXIV vs WoW. Top free to play mmo is Star Wars, however it's only up to lvl 50 free. Best pay once: this game followed by Guild wars 2 and then ESO.

What about p2w? It's significant. Since you're paying once, and if you played any mmo, you most likely put money into the game that was more than just subsciption or just the base of the game. If there's a game you really care about, you'd support it by buying something whether cosmetic or actually helpful. For the price they're asking for is pretty cheap.

582660,Black Desert,"I have 10k hours so that's a thing...
The game is a korean grinder with a somewhat aggressive cash shop, so depends if you know your limits or not.

Game is not a theme park mmo, so as soon as you are done with the tutorial story you need to decide what you want to do, this is a problem for some since they need to be led about.

This game is a completely open world mmo so you can actually pick a direction and go there, you don't need to finish all the story to unlock different areas of the map, although you may get walloped :D
Following the black spirit quest line as a new player is the best idea, with a season character.

However there is an overwhelming amount of stuff to do and grind for, as the veterans always say BDO is a marathon not a sprint.

The main thing that first attracted me to BDO was the horse training which is surprisingly complicated, the horse animations and skills are very satisfying to use. The mounts also don't spawn out of your characters butt like in most games, when you dismount they are still there in the world, which I think is wonderfully immersive. 
There is also all the other usual lifeskills such as gathering, farming, cooking, alchemy, sailing, fishing, hunting, trading and bartering.

Gaming the economy is not really a thing in this game since max and min price of things is managed by the developers, there is also no player trading so don't expect it to be like EVE or ARCHEAGE in this respect.
BDO also has a pretty good housing system with lots of choices of house locations for convenience, roleplay or simple looks reasons and lots of choices when it comes to furniture items. 
Also there is no large inital cost or lack of housing, and no loss of said house/houses when you have a break from the game, everything is how you left it when you return.
Almost all the cash shop furniture can now be crafted for free now, which is amazing.

The action combat is first rate, I think of all the mmos I have played only TERA has better combat, BDO's mob grinding is better though. 
Which is just as well since grinding mobs is a huge part of the game and can be a decider as to whether you will like the game or not. (nothing like putting on some music and killing thousands of critters)

This game doesn't do dungeons like most mmos do, it has only 3 which are parts of the same dungeon.
Visually they are lovely but I think mechanically they are clunky and the reliance on having to use guides is a problem.
If you have played WOW, Final fantasy or Destiny 2 you will find these raids disappointing in comparison.

BDO has never been known for its story and it still isn't, some of the newest story content is fully voiced and is quite good, however unfortunately some of the earliest story/tutorial is a real slog.

Also the quality of life in this game is through the roof, every option you can think of for turning stuff off or on, or adjusting UI. 
Search bars for items/npcs and all items have a proper description and will have a auto path to the npc they need to go to, on a right click.
The autopathing is a pleasure, the knowledge system is great and contributes to your entire account. 
All of your alts have access to almost everything on your account; storage/mounts/pets, its just one big Family, which is very convenient.

Gearing is actually way easier than it was when I started playing in 2017; with the season servers, its almost obscene how much easier it is now, with benefits new and old players alike, a very good change. 
The upgrading of gear and the system of doing it are pretty complicated and much complained about but the season servers really do act as a great tutorial for how to works and if you'd prefer to just avoid it and just grind and buy what you want from the marketplace.

Cosmetics are some of the best and most detailed in any mmo however the best of them are in the cashshop, so be aware of that if it bothers you. 
The game is very cheap to buy or often free to try with no subscription requirement I don't think its a big deal, there is also ones you can get with a loyalty system/giveaways if you can be patient.
The dye system is extremely good and has many slots to achieve that specific look and is one of the main reasons its nice to have the optional subscription; The value pack.
If you are going to play the value pack is definitely worth having and has a lot of convenience. 
However the game has no required subscription, so you can just login whenever you feel like it.

The character creation is still one of the best in any mmo or even more modern games, which is kinda crazy and you can completely change your characters face or hair if you get sick of it, provided you have the value pack.

BDO is probably the best most complete open world/seamless mmo on the market, only New world looks better graphically.
The areas of the map look like they fit together naturally like they would in real life, some of the cities are actually modelled off real cities.

One thing I like is there is a distinct style as well, they don't try to do everything; horses are the primary mount, very little fast travel; so mounts are actually useful, and no true flying mounts either just gliding. 
The amount of crazy MMO stuff isn't outrageous either, no crazy mounts; flying cars/robots/giraffe monstrosities or ridiculous outfits like final fantasy/Tera. just some usual mmo suspects, battle lingerie being the main culprit, which i'm not opposed to ;)

BDO is one of those games either you love it or hate it, or its a bit of both and you are waiting for a new mmo that never arrives...","Mostly Positive76% of the 52,940 user reviews for this game are positive.",10k hour korean grinder somewhat aggressive cash shop depends limit not_game not_a theme park massively multiplayer online soon tutorial decide problem led completely open world massively multiplayer online pick direction finish unlock different area map walloped following black spirit line best idea season overwhelming stuff grind veteran bdo marathon not_a sprint attracted bdo horse training surprisingly complicated horse animation skill satisfying mount spawn character butt game dismount world wonderfully immersive usual lifeskills gathering farming cooking alchemy sailing fishing hunting trading bartering gaming economy not_really max min price thing managed developer no_player trading expect eve archeage respect bdo pretty good housing lot choice house location convenience roleplay simple look reason lot choice come furniture item no_large inital cost lack housing no_loss house_emphasizeds break left return cash shop furniture crafted amazing action combat rate mmos tera combat bdo mob grinding grinding mob huge decider not_nothing putting music killing thousand critter dungeon mmos 3 part dungeon visually lovely mechanically clunky reliance guide problem wow final fantasy destiny 2 raid disappointing comparison bdo never_been known newest fully voiced good unfortunately earliest tutorial real slog quality life roof option turning stuff adjusting ui search bar item npc item proper description a_emphasizeduto path non click autopathing pleasure knowledge great contributes entire alt access storage mount pet big family convenient gearing easier started 2017 season server obscene easier benefit old player alike good upgrading gear pretty complicated complained season server act great tutorial work prefer avoid grind marketplace cosmetic best detailed massively multiplayer online best cashshop aware bother cheap no_subscription requirement t_emphasizedhink big deal one loyalty giveaway patient dye extremely good slot achieve specific look reason nice optional subscription value pack value pack definitely worth convenience no_required subscription login whenever creation best massively multiplayer online modern game kinda crazy completely character face hair sick provided value pack bdo probably best complete open world seamless massively multiplayer online market world look graphically area map look fit naturally real life city modelled real city distinct style t_emphasizedry horse primary mount fast travel mount useful no_true flying mount gliding crazy massively multiplayer online stuff outrageous no_crazy mount flying car robot giraffe monstrosity ridiculous outfit final fantasy tera usual massively multiplayer online suspect battle lingerie culprit not_opposed bdo game love hate bit waiting massively multiplayer online never_arrives

582660,Black Desert,"Black Desert Online is a fantastic idea and world setting, the combat is immersive with a high skill cap, the character creation is the best of any game released to date, its enhancing system is horrid while still being extremely unique and what keeps people playing, and the game looks absolutely stunning with a welcoming community.

Black Desert Online's enhancing system is the games pinnacle as well as its downfall, while the enhancing system FEELS extremely rewarding when an enhancement succeeds you still end up losing millions on that enhancement. The games accessories break when an enhancement is failed unless cron stones are used (We'll cover these later) This means that if you have a boss gear accessory that is Tri(+18) and attempt to go to tet(+19) and your enhancement fails you've potentially lost BILLIONS of silver. The same applies to weapons but usually its just hundreds of millions not billions(Unless we're discussing a pen(+20) attempt) This will allow us to discuss the next topic. THE GRIND

Black Desert Online is an EXTREMELY grind heavy game. You will need to spend hundreds of hours playing to reach softcap(253ap(Damage) The grind is extremely tedious as there aren't a whole lot of decent grinding zones. You'll be stuck in the same spot or region for quite a significant time before being able to move on to another area when you meet its recommended AP. You will grind for silver to enhance your gear or to buy pearl shop items(We'll discuss these next) Which are REQUIRED(unless you want to spend more than 10 hours per day grinding mobs and making trips) to progress in the game with decent Silver per hour. You can lifeskill but it will be a large money sink as most lifeskills are extremely tedious and in-efficient without pearl items to assist you in success rate/swimming speed/breathing time/gathering speed/ and processing success rate. Which transitions us into our next topic, Pearl items

Pearl items are almost a must have if you plan on playing bdo seriously, this means investing losts of money into the game (about $200 for mob grinders and $400-$600 for lifeskillers) All these items are pay for convenience, Kakao makes its game unbearable without these pearl shop items. A must for all players is Pets, at least tier 2 for all of them(about $60-$80) Pets are absolutely necessary to your success in this game, they will loot items for you as well as give you boosts to certain xp values or knowledge gain chance. Lifeskillers, you're going to have to spend money on at least one pearl shop costume that are NOT able to be listed on the marketplace for silver. These costumes run about $22 USD and are essential for lifeskillers. This game is pay to win when it comes to maintaining a higher skill score. Outfit sets(cosmetic items that boost xp stats that are a pearl shop item BUT can be purchased from the marketplace using precious silver that could be going to enhancing) Can be melted down for CRON stones. Cron stones protect the enhancement level on an item from dropping on a failed enhancement chance or prevent an accessory from breaking on a failed enhancement. Which means, spending IRL money will save you potentially BILLIONS of silver that can be used to enhance other gear. Another ptw item from the item shop is Artisans memories. What these do is they make an item restore 4x their value on a repair. Meaning someone that spends money on these spends 4x less on repair materials for their boss gear which is extremely substantial. 

While Black Desert Online is a great online game for some, it is essentially having a second job and sinking every waking moment into this game if you have plans to progress, I can not recommend this game to the average gamer despite how much I enjoy it. The enhancing system is this games downfall and its rise, the pay to win is too much handle if you're a ftp player and Kakao is a greedy company out for that dough. If you like grind maybe this game is for you(I'm okay with the grind but find myself taking breaks lasting for a few months before picking the game up again).

582660,Black Desert,"First thing is first, I am recommending this game but I caution you to make an informed decision with information listed below.

Black Desert Online is an MMORPG unlike its competitors, in that this MMO focuses almost entirely on PvP combat and due to this the entire combat system feels very unique.  Instead of quick-slotting abilities, BDO has a combo system where key combinations cast your abilities.  Learning your class is essential and will have many different learning curves and way of playing.  Rotating cooldown timers is an important part of it for sure, but it certainly makes the combat in this game feel better than other MMO titles.  For this reason I would say one of the main reasons I would pick this title over others is the combat.

Progression in this game is probably the most frustrating part of playing, and puts many people off.  Enhancing gear has a percentage chance to fail, which gets larger as the gear gets better.  If you fail an enhancement, the max durability of an item goes down and the only way to repair it is to get a base durability item and use it as a repair material.  This only gets more expensive when you acquire the best in slot equipment.  Additionally, once you get to the last 4 enhancement levels on a piece of gear each fail will revert the enhancement level back a step.  Players have come up with systems to increase the odds, but it is always a gamble.  Most players will choose to save their resources and buy gear rather than go through the tedious process of enhancing.  Failing higher level enhancements is extremely taxing to a player's finances.

Leveling in this game is a little quirky.  There is no hard level cap, but rather a soft cap where obtaining exp becomes so difficult that the next level is near impossible to reach.  As more players reach these higher levels the cap is raised and as such the gap between new players and old players increases.  The game managers have come up with clever events to try and close this gap and this works to varying extents.

Now let's talk about inactive progression.  This is the reason you will see so many players with thousands of hours on BDO.  This is due to inactive progression where the game will reward players for leaving their game running while they are away.  You can set the game to tab and do things such as auto-fishing.  Upon returning you can sell the fish and gain silver for time that you were sleeping, or working, whatever the case is.  Now look if you have the money for the electricity that's fine and all but not everybody does.  It is important to note that these inactive gains add up over time and can give you an edge over players who do not follow suit.

Guilds in this game are annoying.  The guild content is really nice don't get me wrong, but there is no way to trade items between players.  This isn't exclusive to guilds either.  Any items you have that you may even want to sell to your friend, you can't do so for a lower rate.  All player transactions go through an auction house, which means that there is always a chance the item gets snagged before your friends can buy from you.  I think the idea that guilds cannot share resources between members is a really dumb idea.  I understand why they do this, but it is quite a change from other MMOs.

That's a lot of meat and potatoes but here is my conclusion.  Black Desert Online has changed with time as many games do.  Back when I started playing the game in 2017 everything had a sense of wonder, and it was all uncharted territory.  Progression felt rewarding because once I was strong enough I could hold my own, or maybe even win open world PvP encounters.  This was the case for a while, but eventually the bar was raised, and winning fights was no longer an option for me.  The answer to this was grinding and pushing to have my gear enhanced but it just became a Skinner box of a video game.

Out of other MMO video games this would still be my poison of choice, but if you're looking for attainable PvE content go somewhere else.  There are very few PvE options available in the end game, but very few players reach the level at which these areas can be cleared.  This game is for those who like to PvP, and I cannot in good faith recommend this to players who want to crawl dungeons as there aren't really any dungeons to crawl.","Mostly Positive76% of the 52,940 user reviews for this game are positive.",recommending caution informed decision information listed black desert online mmorpg unlike competitor massively multiplayer online focus entirely pvp combat due entire combat feel unique quick slotting ability bdo combo key combination cast ability learning class essential different learning curve rotating cooldown timer important certainly make combat massively multiplayer online title reason pick title others combat progression probably frustrating put enhancing gear percentage chance fail get larger gear get fail enhancement max durability go repair base durability repair material get expensive acquire best slot equipment additionally last 4 enhancement level piece gear fail revert enhancement player system increase odds gamble player choose save resource gear rather tedious process enhancing failing higher enhancement extremely taxing finance leveling quirky no_hard cap rather soft cap obtaining exp difficult next near impossible reach player reach higher level cap raised gap player old player increase manager clever event close gap work varying extent talk inactive progression player thousand hour bdo due inactive progression reward player leaving running set tab thing auto fishing returning fish gain silver sleeping working whatever case look electricity fine not_everybody important note inactive gain add edge player not_follow suit guild annoying guild nice wrong no_way trade item player exclusive guild item friend lower rate transaction auction house mean chance get snagged friend idea guild cannot_share resource member dumb idea understand mmos meat potato conclusion black desert online changed game started 2017 sense wonder uncharted territory progression rewarding strong hold maybe win open world pvp encounter case eventually bar raised winning fight no_longer option answer grinding pushing gear enhanced became skinner box video massively multiplayer online video game poison choice attainable pve else pve option available player reach area cleared pvp cannot_in good faith recommend player crawl dungeon dungeon crawl

Let me give you the lowdown on this $10 you're about to spend.It'll be worth it for maybe the first character you create and level up. The first 60 levels sort of fly by and you generally enjoy your time. Past that, you're in for one hell of a time.
This game is about as grindy as they come. It's great for those who want to spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours accomplishing mostly nothing. Your progress in this game is relative. There's always going to be someone more powerful, skilled, or otherwise better than you in some way or another. That being said, though, it won't really affect your gameplay much at all. 
Is the game fun? Idk, I guess. I've put so many hours in to it that I can't even tell if I'm enjoying it or not anymore. 
Graphics? Phenomenal. Absolutely beautiful. I sincerely cannot find a singular thing to complain about when it comes to how the game is designed. It's lovely. 
Controls? Most interesting combat system I've seen in an MMORPG to date. This game requires true skill and understanding of your class if you want to get anywhere in the PvP realm. 
Community? Equal parts helpful and toxic. It comes with its blessings and curses. Find yourself a guild that you mesh with and avoid drama like the plague. Don't make the mistake of falling in to anyone else's petty arguments, it will have consequences one way or another 

So, why don't I recommend this game to anyone? Mostly, because it's a waste of time. You experience gratification once every thousand years when you hit a TET or PEN. It's really just 50% PvP and 50% grind. It's not necessarily a problem, but it kind of sucks when you know that others are just dumping money in to services that do the grinding for you.

582660,Black Desert,"Note to considering buyers, the $10 price tag is false; you'll probably need to end up spending probably another $20 or so to feel like you're not being hindered in terms of bag space, weight, or auto loot speed. This game is an extremely long term game--there are no gear resets when new content drops. 

So if the idea of getting near to max gear in 2 weeks is what you need to have fun, then this game isn't for you. But the flip side of that though is this, the progression is always there. Concerning the length however, they did add seasonal servers which slingshot new players to a spot where they can actually start working towards end game gear. When this game first came out, you had to go Rags-to-Riches all by your lonesome, but now it's really not the case.

Concerning RNG, I've heard that they have made ways to get around it, but I personally haven't reached that point--but I have been getting some of said items needed to bypass the RNG.

Concerning P2W, it most definetly is possible BUT it is--in my opinion--a complete waste of money due to how inefficient it is. Though players most certainly can--and a small minority do--buy cash shop items and sell them for in-game money, you would probably need to spend no less than $10,000 USD to get anything close to end-game gear from 0. So yeah, whales can exist, but you likely won't encounter them and they make it so we don't need to pay a subscription to keep the servers running.

If you're looking for a game where you can AFK and make some money, love being able to play by yourself for high-end content, having the option for group PvP, and love complicated systems, this game is likely gonna be a good fit.

If the way you enjoy games is through dungeons and raiding, end-game content requiring groups, or systems that can be learned within a relatively short time span, this may not be the game for you.

582660,Black Desert,"Alright, so I've played many MMORPGS/online service games from time to time. Genshin Impact, GW2, Warframe, Destiny 2, Neverwinter, ESO, New World, so I got the general idea around them. And somewhere along the way I'll try to provide comparison to Black Desert Online (BDO) so you'll have an insight. Here we go.

[h1] The Good Things [/h1]
Nice graphics. BDO got a remaster not too long ago, and it turned out pretty good. Even by today's standards. The environments, equipments, character models, they are all good. They really have a good graphics design team. Up-to-date-graphics with little hardware cost. Good job devs, on that one. Some other games are a bit less optimized (New World, Bless Online, looking at you both).

Fantastic combat. I like an RPG game where the combat represents what I wanna do. When I wanna move left, the character moves left. When I wanna move right, the character moves right. I don't stand in one place and pretend we fight like we're having a family argument. Whether we like it or not, those old style combat (tab-targeting or whatever) are severely outdated and unrealistic. While BDO's combat is not. It's impactful, responsive, flashy, and configurable. I dunno about you, but BDO kinda represents how I would like to actually fight in a fantasy world more than most MMOs. And I can still pull it off with just 10 fingers, a mouse, and a keyboard. No need to band-aid with gamepad. Just as it should be for a proper PC game.

Animations inside & outside of combat are done well enough. Although, it still needs more proper running, climbing, and interaction movements. Kinda feels clunky but is it the engine? And why do you WALK backwards too in-combat? You're in a battleground, not in your house. Is it a feature or a deliberately mistreated animation? So weird. But overall, it's still better than other games like GW2 or Neverwinter.

BDO also has a (seemingly) generous & steady flow of event/minigames/quest/etc rewards that players can get for free. So much, that I become really confused which one to take in first.

I also like the whole node systems. It kinda puts a lot more feature than just fighting enemies. You can craft stuff, cook stuff, manufacture stuff, and sell them for profit. You can basically make a trading network out of it. And it can raise your non-combat skills too (BDO calls it life skill). So those are what I like about the game in a way that it's got both style and depth in features. It's a lot of fun, but it has boundaries.

[h1] The Bad Things [/h1]
Like I said, so many rewards. Which means you're gonna need inventory space & item knowledge. Before you take one item, you gotta know EXACTLY what you're gonna use it for, and the corresponding NPCs that may be involved. You can't just leave it in your bag or even storage cuz it's gonna take too much space. So if you're a hoarder kind, just hold on & keep playing the game until you have enough space for everything you want. It's not necessarily a bad thing. It's only bad because the game only tells you very little about inventory management stuffs. Is it deliberate? Do they intentionally obscure the facts to mislead people into buying inventory spaces at the premium currency market? Beats me.

The combat progression in this game contains a rather obstructive RNG, namely the enhancement system. It's a bit...I dunno how to call it. Cheap? Lazy? Discouraging? To compare, in ESO, you can craft stuffs and already get better. In Warframe, yes you get stuffs by RNG but once you get it you can power it up however you like. In BDO, getting endgame equipments alone contains RNG, and then they added even MORE RNG to enhance it. I'd be fine if it's just about failing and succeeding. But in BDO when you fail to enhance, it's gonna reduce your equipment's durability or even destroy them. It's not even lore-friendly, I mean the game has blacksmiths so why not use them to enhance anyways? As the players, I need to admit that we all seem to be really, REALLY untalented at enhancing. We are supposed to be fighters by nature, not blacksmiths, oh and we already paid to play your game so we deserve a little help and compensation. Hear that, devs? Maybe, change the system a bit so you can have even more players?

Also, this may not be significant but with all due respects devs I personally find your game trailers and the trailer music really miss the mark. You use them for advertisement, yes? If so, then please show us more about the game. All I've seen from the trailer is combat. That's it. I don't get the point. Okay, those people are fighting, but then so what? Where are we going from there? Is this game a Dynasty Warriors simulator? Do you want it to be a Dynasty Warriors simulator? If not, then please put more context into them. Try to communicate better with the players/potential customers. Look how New World went down (as per 2021) just because they have no idea how players filter out their games. You've been here longer. You should know.

Oh and the trailer music. I'm really sorry to say this, but they suuuuuuck like hell. Please, use better ones. Just take the in-game musics and pick the one that has the PROPER mood to each trailer. Every time I watch your trailers, BDO, I'm always turned off. Plus the whole trailer-concept-doesn't-have-clear-context-thing. If you want the game to be successful, you have to present them the right way.

[h1] Conclusion, or TL;DR [/h1]
So for you guys out there who wants to play BDO, I suggest to play just to have enough harmless fun but beyond that, I you wanna go further and become a semi-veteran player, you have to prepare to have lots of time due to the heavy grind and RNG nature of this game. It's not for everyone, and there are currently obvious better choices than this (ESO, FFXIV from what I've heard, Warframe, Destiny 2 if you can ignore the scummy content scrapping stuff). I would say BDO is 7/10. This is some of the games I really hope to get better in 2022. If done right, BDO can become larger than Warframe or New World. Whether it happens or not will be up to the players and the devs.","Mostly Positive76% of the 52,940 user reviews for this game are positive.",alright mmorpgs online service game genshin impact gw2 warframe destiny 2 neverwinter eso world general idea along provide comparison black desert online bdo insight good thing nice graphic bdo remaster not_too long ago turned pretty good today s_emphasizedtandards environment equipment model good good graphic design graphic hardware cost good game bit optimized world bless online fantastic combat role game_emphasized combat represents wan na wan na move left move left wan na move move stand pretend fight family argument not_those old style combat tab targeting whatever severely outdated unrealistic bdo combat not_it impactful responsive flashy configurable dunno bdo kinda represents fight fantasy world mmos pull 10 finger mouse keyboard no_need band aid gamepad proper pc animation inside outside combat need proper running climbing interaction movement kinda feel clunky engine walk backwards combat battleground not_in house deliberately mistreated animation weird s_emphasizedtill game gw2 neverwinter bdo seemingly generous steady flow event minigames reward player confused node system kinda put fighting enemy craft stuff cook stuff manufacture stuff profit basically trading network raise non combat skill bdo call life skill style depth feature fun boundary bad thing reward mean gon na inventory space knowledge ta exactly gon na corresponding npc involved leave bag storage cuz gon na space hoarder kind hold space not_necessarily bad bad tell inventory management stuff deliberate intentionally obscure fact mislead buying inventory space premium currency market beat combat progression contains rather obstructive rng namely enhancement bit dunno call cheap lazy discouraging compare eso craft stuff already warframe yes stuff rng power bdo endgame equipment alone contains rng rng enhance fine failing succeeding bdo fail enhance gon na reduce equipment durability destroy not_even lore friendly blacksmith not_use enhance anyways player admit really_emphasized untalented enhancing supposed fighter nature not_blacksmiths oh already paid deserve help compensation hear maybe bit player not_be significant due respect personally trailer trailer music miss mark advertisement yes please trailer combat okay fighting dynasty warrior simulator dynasty warrior simulator not_then please context communicate player potential customer look world per 2021 no_idea player filter game longer oh trailer music sorry suuuuuuck hell please one music pick proper mood trailer watch trailer bdo turned plus trailer concept clear context successful present conclusion tl dr guy want bdo suggest harmless fun wan na semi veteran prepare lot due heavy grind rng nature not_for currently obvious choice eso ffxiv heard warframe destiny 2 ignore scummy scrapping stuff bdo 7 10 game hope 2022 bdo larger warframe world happens not_will player

582660,Black Desert,"I have over 3000 hours in this game since early beta and while it is one of my favourite MMO's it has major issues that unless fixed  ruin the game.

- This Game Monetises EVERYTHING it is extremly P2W don't believe the people who play who justify it as a company needing to make money.
- P2W Components= As Examples.
- You need Pets to loot for you and keep up your grind pace.
- You use up a limited amount of contribution to expand your worker network and storage meaning CASH SHOP to increase without contribution. This means you can have more workers, more nodes without the encumbarance on your contribution amount.
- Enhancing Gear lowers durability you will want to use Cash Shop Artisan Memories to repair when your durability goes down due to enhancement failures. This reduces your repair costs by 4x and with Boss gear we are talking millions - billions in repair costs.
- Easy mode to get TET gear; Buy Costumes on the Cash Shop and burn them for Cron Stones to ensure enhancement failures don't de-rank your gear.
- Costumes, Pet Costumes, EXP Scrolls, Inventory Scrolls, Weight Limit Increases. There is no limit to the amount of money you can spend in this game for improvements that are so vast it is P2W. Ex. Increase your weight you can grind longer, fish longer, without having to go back and forth. Silver in this game = power the more efficient you are the more power you have access to. People will say this is pay for convenience but when we are talking about  4 - 100x more efficiency I think you can realize for yourself that you won't ever keep up with players for free.
- This game is expensive and you will always find yourself in need of something from the cash shop.

Enhancing in this game sucks and you have to enhance pretty much everything so be ready to deal with failures and RNG expenses, spend hours faming materials and building fail stacks so you can eventually succeed.


This game is incredible and has so much potential but terrible Korean game design mechanics really take away much of the joy. The game also only gets more expensive as time goes on sine they find new ways to release content and add additional monotisation layers so unless you are ready to be spending several hundred every few months don't expect to progress much in comparason to your peers in the game.","Mostly Positive76% of the 52,940 user reviews for this game are positive.",3000 hour early beta favourite massively multiplayer online major issue unless fixed ruin monetises extremly p2w believe justify company needing p2w component example pet loot grind pace limited contribution expand worker network storage meaning cash shop increase contribution mean worker node encumbarance contribution enhancing gear lower durability cash shop artisan memory repair durability go due enhancement failure reduces repair cost 4x bos gear talking million billion repair cost easy mode tet gear costume cash shop burn cron stone ensure enhancement failure de rank gear costume pet costume exp scroll inventory scroll weight limit increase no_limit spend improvement vast p2w ex increase weight grind longer fish longer forth silver power efficient power access pay convenience talking 4 100x efficiency realize player expensive cash shop enhancing suck enhance pretty ready deal failure rng expense spend hour faming material building fail stack eventually succeed incredible potential terrible korean design mechanic joy get expensive go sine way release add_emphasizeditional monotisation layer unless ready spending hundred month expect progress comparason peer

582660,Black Desert,"I have spent about 1,104 hours in Black Desert Online as of this review, not grinding mobs or testing my combat against other players, but in life skilling and questing. Even with the inclusion of built-in tutorial videos, very little in Black Desert Online apart from combat is explained well, thus leading to frequent trips out of the game to learn about everything else. 

I would recommend you look up ""EvilDoUsHarm"" on Youtube as a great way to start. 

Black Desert Online is likely the MMO that comes closest to the ideal of single player questing with the open world engagement of a MMORPG. There has not been a single one of the twenty classes I didn't enjoy on some level. 

The cash shop used to supplement Black Desert Online's PTW (Pay to Win) model offering some attractive cosmetic alternatives for each class, but a lot more convenience items to advance playing the game faster. I will say that you DO NOT NEED to spend an extra dime in order to touch all parts of the game itself.

582660,Black Desert,"I have nearly 7k hours in BDO.  I don't recommend this game at the moment.

The cash shop is a complete money grab. Don't buy this game thinking you'll reach end game off $5 or even $50.  You're looking at a solid $200+ to be competitive in a decent amount of time.  Anyone who says otherwise is lying to you.  The game skirts P2W by creating massive annoyances, such as limiting weight and inventory space, to the point where players have huge incentive to fix the issues through the cash shop.  Even swimming is made slow in an effort to push a $20+ swimming outift.

The game is an endless grind, gated by RNG.  You might spend a month getting 5 billion silver only to blow it all in one night on Tungrad earrings and end up empty handed, with that entire month's work completely gone.  It can be incredibly demoralizing, and there isn't a viable way around it.

The developers are currently running around with the heads cutoff.  They introduced massive changes to the PvP system over three years after release.  These changes increased the gear gap, makign strong players even stronger.  However, they also managed to neuter many classes.  Remember how I said it takes nearly $200 to be viable? A lot of those cash items are tied to a character, not the account.  This means that if you want to play another class, you have to repurchase weight, inventory, and costumes.  It adds up extremely fast.  Therefore, you're at the mercy of Korean developers who don't even play the game, and who have shown that they can castrate a class on a moment's notice.  

 You can look at Steam Charts to see that the playerbase is slowly dying.  Even with a $5 sale, the game is losing more people than it's gaining.  Most high level PvPers like myself have abandoned the game because of the drastic changes to super armor, iframes, and crowd control.  What once was  fast paced game has slowed down considerably - most likely to pave the way for Xbox relase and/or compensate for their terrible, terrible netcode.

Be very wary of BDO.  It's essentially a giant scam to inconvience and annoy you into spending money.  The game currently is devoid of direction, with unneeded changes coming nearly weekly.

TL;DR:
Pros: 
-Looks great
-Fun for a few months

Cons:
-Predatory/manipulative gameplay
-Boring/repetitive
-Grind heavy
-Heavy focus on a broken and rng reliant system
-Extreme in game inflation that continues to rise at an absurd rate
-Empty promises from publisher
-Unstable servers
-Poorly optimized, don't be poor

Since 2018, I've poured close to 17k hours into BDO, half of which was active. I have a pretty good understanding of the game, probably better now that I haven't played in like a year. Like a previous top comment said, the game is designed in such a way to keep you playing, whether that's through a slew of AFKable activities, or through more conventional daily login or event based rewards. That alone isn't a red flag, many games offer the same incentives. But, the red flag is that the alternative puts you in a hole. In other words, if you're NOT logged in 24/7 (doing AFK activities when you're not actively playing), then you are going to fall far behind in whatever goal you set for yourself. Prices are so inflated in this game due to the ridiculous enhancement chances that if you don't AFK overnight, and login daily for rewards, and grind 3-4 hours a day (pve or lifeskilling), then a goal that would normally take a month, now takes 2 or 3 or more. 

That's the first problem, the fact that though these incentives to play are ""optional,"", they really aren't. Login at any time of day, on any server, and you will see hundreds of AFK players fishing or processing at a warehouse, before they leave for work in the morning, and before they go to sleep at night. Think about that for a second. The game incentivizes you to make it part of your day to day routine. That is NOT okay. Your first thought when you wake up shouldn't be ""I need to sell my fish and get back to fishing before I leave, I sure hope the Imperial Delivery isn't sold out."" I am not sure if the Oasis Chest event is still going on, but for nearly 2 years, to get the max daily rewards for that event, you'd need to be logged in for 6, yes you read that right, 6 hours. Every day, for nearly 2 years. 

The next problem the game has is it's shallow, boring, repetitive content. Sure, the first few months will be great, ""there are so many things to do, lifeskilling, grinding, pvp, decorating."" But once that honeymoon period is over, you realize just how agonizingly boring the game actually is, but it's too late, cause you've already been hooked. You've already spent several hundred hours, or dollars, and can't quit now. So you continue to sink more money, and more time, into a game that doesn't bring you any joy. As another comment said, grinding revolves around doing the same rotation of mobs/enemies for hours on end, daily, for months just to get a single piece of gear (there are 4 pieces of armor, 3 weapons, and 6 accessories, so to go up 1 level in gear, say full TET to full PEN, you'd be grinding 3 hours a day everyday for close to 1.5 years, assuming you're at old softcap which takes 5-6 months to get to). Lifeskilling hasn't been changed in over 2 years, since Fall 2019, and makes no where near the same amount of income as active grinding. So, if you're more of a casual player who only enjoys cooking, or farming, or hunting, or alchemy, good luck ever reaching your goals before you quit. The housing system in the game is also dead content. Essentially, the only purpose to ever spend time in your house would be to install cooking or alchemy tools to AFK lifeskill. Furniture gives negligible benefits to gameplay, and any decent furniture takes an absurd amount of time to grind for. Good luck buying it in the market, as there are either none for sale, or sell for extremely high amounts that aren't worth the silver. Not to mention that spending time decorating is time away from making any income, which puts you ever further behind. The only new content that has been added to the game since Bartering in 2019 was the new group dungeon, which has mostly mixed or negative reviews. It's extremely difficult to complete, and the payoff is abysmal for the effort needed. The game came out in 2016, and only now, 6 years later, are they addressing seriously broken aspects of their game, namely unbalanced pvp, dead grind spots, and desync issues when sailing. Because their focus has been on fixing this dry game of game breaking issues, the game has gotten even more boring. The discord suggestion channel is flooded with new ideas, nearly all of which are ignored.

The rng in this game is king. Nearly everything in the game revolves around chance in some way. From the obvious loot crates, to the enhancing system, to marketplace preorders, to guild quest availability, etcetc. Now rng isn't inherently a bad thing, but when a huge portion of the company's income comes from enhancement related purchases, you can see where a problem arises. Up until a a couple years ago, you could not see the actual % chance of success on enhancements, just a ambiguous ""Easy"" or ""Hard"". Even after they added those % chances though, nothing changed. For reference, the chance of going from TET to PEN on normal gear with 0 fail stacks is less than 1%. You might think that's fair, until you realize that normal PEN gear is not even top of the line anymore. If you want the actual best gear,  it has a base success rate of 0.0025%, that is after you spend upwards of 100 hours grinding for the necessary materials needed to even ATTEMPT enhancing. And because the game is EXTREMELY reliant on gear, you are forced into grinding for better gear, if you want to keep up with ever increasing costs. 

The publisher tried to remedy this issue by increasing silver/hour at certain grinding spots, but that only had the effect of inflating prices even more. Just like in real life, if you print more money, things get more expensive. For reference, a pet in 2018 costed 14 mil silver to place a preorder (which is rng, you could be the first person to place an order, and lose to the 70th person to place the same order). The same preorder was over 60mil in early 2021. 

Content is promised but rarely actually comes to fruition. An example of this would be the naval pvp arena, which was promised in 2019, and keeps getting ""delayed"" year after year while the company focuses on ""more important things"". When these promises do get worked on, they are dropped, and then abandoned. Several of the current arenas were ghost towns for years before the company decided to rework them or remove them entirely. For one such arena, savage rift, you could wait hours and not be matched with a single person. 

And lastly, like most online games, there is an extreme amount of toxicity in the game. Focused around a culture of griefing, it's prevalent in all aspects of the game, both pve and pvp. If you don't give up your spot to someone who wants it, they will either karma bomb you, which makes you a freely pvpable target, or feed you to mobs. In the case of lifeskilling, they will just gather or hunt on top of you, forcing you to either pvp, or leave the area/server. These actions are almost encouraged by the playerbase. The company itself refuses to take action on said players, or bother working on a new system to combat griefing of that nature.

Forgot to mention this previously, but servers are also unstable. You desync often at sea, and when swapping characters, regardless of connection type

Bonus, the game is poorly optimized. If you don't have moderate/upper end rig, good luck breaking 30-40 frames on lowest settings. If you truly want to enjoy the graphics of the game, you need to not be poor.

582660,Black Desert,"I have mixed feelings at best about Black Desert Online, but ultimately my conclusion is that the negatives significantly outweigh the positives.

First, what the game does well. It's pretty. The life skills system, by which you progress your ability to craft, farm, trade, and perform the various noncombat labors of the game is very wide and developed. Farming is fun, combos are satisfying, and the world is fun to explore. There are moments when you find certain places or cities that it does feel like you're in a living world. There's a scope to the landscape that lends itself to immersion.

But every aspect of the game has been meticulously designed from the ground up to be better if maybe you just spent some money on it. There is inconvenience engineered into dozens upon dozens of systems to encourage you to swipe that plastic. The largest cost to be competitive is probably the monthly item which provides a whopping 30% increase to the efficiency of your marketplace transactions, making profitable trading out-of-reach for F2Pers. But there's so many other places. Out of context, I like the idea of restricted travel encouraging a short journey to actually move from place to place. Such a thing orients a player to the landscape and assists in the immersion I mentioned earlier. Those of you who have played Morrowind will know what I mean. But in Black Desert Online, the only fast-travel option is a cash shop item. Furthermore, there is a highly punishing system for breeding mounts where males can breed twice, females once, and there's only a small chance of the offspring being higher in level. Once they're out of ""breeds,"" you're done... unless you want to recharge with a shop item. C'mon, you'll get it, you want to go places fast, right?

I should mention there's an autotravel option. It makes your character navigate to the point you establish, be that the next quest or the next town or whatever. It can take 15 minutes to get between some towns, further for others, so yeah, go do something else for awhile. But there are, again, dozens of systems for doing this... many life skills and other activities are almost exclusively afk. Fishing. Processing. Horse training. It goes on. And you cannot do this while your computer is off or you are logged out of BDO ala EVE. 

This game wants you to be online all of the time. It wants you to be thinking about it all the time. Black Desert Online will make it obvious to you that if you want to play it successfully it wants you to make it a priority in your life. It's designed to be a habit. I enjoyed it for a few hours, but the more I played it, the more uncomfortable I became with how elegantly BDO is made to encourage unhealthy behavior. I played DOOM with a glass of scotch at hand, loving every second of demon-slaying glory. I stayed up late with friends playing League of Legends in college. I really loved the Guild Wars series. It's not a dislike of anything to do with videogames or MMOs. It's Black Desert Online. The only thing I can compare it to is those games on your choice of cellphone or tablet appstore that actively try to foster addiction. 

But it's so much more sophisticated. This is the distillation and refinement of the Korean MMO design philosophy. It is an engine that convinces you it's important and then tries to get into your wallet. The gaming public should be ashamed we tolerate this stuff. This thing is designed to create whales. Forget gaming, this thing isn't good for *society.* Black Desert Online does a few things well... but allowing it to succeed is a loss for gaming. It is for that reason I cannot recommend Black Desert Online for anyone.","Mostly Positive76% of the 52,940 user reviews for this game are positive.",mixed feeling best black desert online ultimately conclusion negative significantly outweigh positive pretty life skill progress craft farm trade perform various noncombat labor wide developed farming fun combo satisfying world fun explore moment certain place city living world scope landscape lends immersion aspect meticulously designed ground be_emphasizedtter maybe spent inconvenience engineered dozen dozen system encourage swipe plastic largest cost competitive probably monthly provides whopping 30 increase efficiency marketplace transaction profitable trading reach f2pers s_emphasizedo place context idea restricted travel encouraging short journey move orient landscape assist immersion mentioned earlier morrowind black desert online fast travel option cash shop furthermore highly punishing breeding mount male breed twice female small chance offspring higher breed unless recharge shop c mon place fast mention autotravel option make navigate establish next next town whatever 15 minute town others yeah else awhile dozen system life skill activity exclusively afk fishing processing horse training go cannot_do computer logged bdo ala eve want online want black desert online obvious successfully want priority life designed habit enjoyed hour uncomfortable became elegantly bdo encourage unhealthy behavior doom glass scotch hand loving demon slaying glory stayed late friend league legend college loved guild war series not_a dislike videogames mmos black desert online compare game choice cellphone tablet appstore actively foster addiction s_emphasizedo sophisticated distillation refinement korean massively multiplayer online design philosophy engine convinces important try wallet gaming public ashamed tolerate stuff designed create whale forget gaming good society black desert online thing allowing succeed loss gaming cannot_recommend black desert online
582660,Black Desert,"I love this game, have played for almost a year. Problem is I have nothing to show for it, I do not recommend this game to people, it is non stop grinding, ridiculous market prices for gear, the enhancement system is an RNG mess that holds players back. There is no end game, you can't pvp unless you have gear, but gear is so out of reach, Gm's will tell you to life skill if you don't like grinding but even building life skills are a grind, this game is just chores and work, you would have to play 5 years for progression or spend $20,000 on outfits to sell, the game just starts feeling like it want's you to lose and hold you back, they try to hide this behind flashy classes and good visuals and combat. Just go play something else TRUST ME!

582660,Black Desert,"This game is the most beautiful empty shell, I ever came across.

Is this a bad game? Not at all, but it has a way of hiding what its endgame looks like and depending on your personal values, you might feel tricked once u get disillusioned. Most of this comes down to the player perception in the early game. Because this game doesn’t feed its content to you with a spoon, you have to explore a lot of the content yourself, leading to developing expectations based on those experiences.

Therefore, I think most of the frustration with this game comes from players developing expectations and false hopes the game can’t satisfy. And I am no exception from this.

As I got a first taste of the action packed combat, the astonishing graphics and the overall level of immersion, I couldn’t wait to see what the endgame content would look like, only to find out that there is no difference. If u have been busy grinding mobs for hours, congratulations, you experienced the endgame content. The gameplay in the early levelling experience isn’t really any different later on. The packs of mobs will have more hp and look different, but there isn’t much else different about them. They don’t get smarter, get any unique attacks or mechanic, to be honest the whole pve content isn’t really challenging at all. Even when fighting bosses I can’t help myself but to think that I have seen all of this done better in other games. 

At this point I have to confess that I´m a filthy pve´ler. I enjoy raids and similar group content so bdo not having any of those made me wonder what the whole point of grinding and gearing up actually is, if there is no fun content I am working towards.

Pvp some people said. As I already confessed I don’t think too fond of pvp. Specifically in this game it might sound a lot better on paper than it is in practise. What I heard, the always active open world pvp will mostly result in the one who oneshots and the one who gets oneshot. To me, this sounds like a lot of potential frustration for new players, rather than a fun experience.
Others said I should go fishing, processing or any of those afk activities, which I always found very hilarious. Why should I play a game with beautiful graphic just to not look at it? And overall I think the term “life skilling” is mildly infuriating. If I had a life, I wouldn’t be playing this.

Another thing that usually kept me grinding unhealthy amounts of time is to spend my efforts on cosmetic content. Especially because once those timed costumes expire, the character you spend 5h+ on to create, starts to look like a beggar again. Low and behold, there exists a quest ingame which seems to provide the “Karlstein” costume after completion. All you need to be able to accept the quest is to drop one of those rare stones with no designated drop location. Or so I thought, turns out that after the completion of the questline you still need said rare stones to craft the set. I got 3 (one is granted from the questline) in 80h of playtime and the whole set requires about 100 of them. Dependent on how lucky you are we are talking about around 2000h of nonstop grinding to get an outfit set that’s arguably on the lower end of all the costumes. Seriously, cleaning toilets will get you this set faster. But that would require me to leave the house, so that’s not an option.
Frustrated but not yet hopeless, I turned to the craftable costumes. Setting up my workers, gathering the needed materials and finally sending the order to a workshop. All this work just to be greeted with a fairly familiar armor in my inventory after equipping the costume. It turns out that the selfmade costumes take up all the armor slots instead of the actual costume slots, leaving you with paper thin defense while wearing it. After a quick research I am enlightened. Those crafted costumes can be made into real costumes with a tailor coupon. Which can be found in the pearl shop. For real money. And nowhere else. Not even in the loyalties shop. So except for taking screenshots they don’t serve any purpose. In result, my feelings hurt.

Ok, I´m thinking to myself, why not take the most obvious approach. Just buy it from the market place. Here is the thing. Upon opening the costume section in the marketplace you are greeted with tons of demand and apparently no supply. So when there are no trades happening in this section, does a market really exist? My guess was that the prices for said costumes in the pearl shop are definitely on the higher end of what I have seen in similar games so far. And because pearl abys is a very progressive company that values their player base and never lies to them, they of course have no cosmetic only surprise mechanics in their game. This and the fact that dismantling your costumes gives you valuable items which can be used in their perfectly balanced gear upgrade system; there is literally no reason for someone to sell their costumes. Apparently this was a little different in the earlier days of bdo with the old marketplace system, but I can’t travel in time. If I could, I would rather use that to kick someone in his one nut.

Devastated but still not completely sane again, I remembered the questline about the “Karlstein” set. And I also remembered that upon completing it I was granted with one of those stupid stones. So maybe … just maybe one could create an alternative characters to grab one of the stones I already dropped, run to calpheon, do the quest, store the additional stone from the quest, delete the character and repeat the process. All of this pain just to slowly cheese my way to reach those 100 stones without spending 2000h+ on grinding while praying to rngesus (yes I am that desperate). Well, turns out that your character doesn’t just need to have one of those stones in order to accept the questline but also a certain level, or maybe worse, needs to drop the stone themselves. At this point I am convinced, that if pearl abys spend as much time and effort into health care as they spend into making sure no one gets access to costumes with ingame methods, they could have cured cancer by now.

After all those efforts I have to admit defeat. I couldn’t find a long term motivation for myself to keep playing this game. And I tried really hard. But after around 100h of playtime, I am disillusioned. This is not a game for me. It is not like I didn’t had a lot of fun along the way. But to realise that there is nothing left for me at the end was really disappointing. A beautiful shell but an empty core.

But that is just my experience with the game and it’s still developing and changing every day so maybe … just maybe I´ll return to it one day.
If you think about playing this game I would suggest you to give it a try. Just ensure that you don’t get your hopes and expectations up too high. This game will push the need of spending money and the time consuming grind to an all-time extreme. Probably the most extreme in the whole genre. So be okay with that or brace yourself for some crippling disappointment.

582660,Black Desert,"I'm not 100% sure what I'm doing in this game, but the game lets me do whatever I want. It's been along time since I've played an MMO where the 'massive' part is taken this literally. 

One hour I'm fishing with a bunch of people arguing american politics, next I'm running through the woods fighting bears and gathering sap to sell on the community driven market, followed by a couple hours of fighting hordes of enemies in a desert canyon to get a new earring. 

I've somehow acquired a huge boat and managed to get it destroyed and stranded myself on an island fighting hordes of locals until a friendly adventurer came along and saved me. They gave me food to feed my starving cat too. 

Overall, I don't think I'm at the ""endgame"" yet, still haven't been jumped by other players yet; but I'm excited to see more.","Mostly Positive76% of the 52,940 user reviews for this game are positive.",not_100 let whatever along massively multiplayer online massive taken literally fishing bunch arguing american politics next running wood fighting bear gathering sap community driven market followed couple hour fighting horde enemy desert canyon earring somehow acquired huge boat managed destroyed stranded island fighting horde local friendly adventurer along saved gave food feed starving cat t_emphasizedhink endgame jumped player excited
582660,Black Desert,"After putting in 2500 hours into this game I think I have a say in whether or not the game is good or bad. 

Is the game good? 

Sure. It can be. There has been countless times where I've enjoyed doing something other than grinding or pvping, like hunting sea monsters with my friends, or going to world bosses together, and etc. But there are way too many OTHER problems that are never being addressed, and when they are, players have already quit the game or rerolled to another class, throwing all the time away that they've invested into it. I had two friends so far reroll to different classes just because they were meta and the classes they played prior to rerolling were in a terrible position/they didn't enjoy it like they used to.

 I originally purchased Black Desert back in 2016 when the game released in NA. I had no idea what to do, and eventually a couple years later, one of my friends was quite knowledgeable, and was able to help me understand the game even more. Once everything became apparent, it's as if you were a newborn child opening your eyes for the first time. It was incredible. I played the game day in and day out, spending hundreds of dollars on cosmetics, and other things such as pets, and the tent that they offer in the Pearl Shop (Cash Shop). After four months, Pearl Abyss released a patch note that completely destroyed the balance of the game. Every class was pretty much stripped of their Super Armors (a buff that allows you to not be crowd controlled and makes you take reduced damage during the duration of the ability), and their crowd controls, and made most of the crowd controls for PVE (Player vs. Environment) only. However there was one class that was not affected in the slightest, and because of the changes, instantly became a top tier class in a matter or hours after the patch; Ninja. This event was the BDO version of the Great Depression pretty much. After people saw that PA wasn't fixing their classes, they started to notice the damage Ninja could do, and they rerolled to Ninja. They couldn't take it anymore. Hell, there was a point in time where even I couldn't take it. I almost rerolled to Ninja myself. But I stood my ground. I waited desperately, hoping for a buff or a fix to my (and other classes) problems. Six and a half months later, still no fix.

 I think the Devs don't play the game/listen to the feedback of their community. If they did, the decline in players recently, would not have been as big (maybe). As far as enhancing goes... I have to say, in my opinion, it has to be THE WORST enhancement system ever in a MMORPG game. You have to fail, spend more money, fail more, then succeed? Then what? You're stuck with no money for god knows how long? Unless you live and breathe this game, and live in your mom's basement, you literally have no chance of getting anywhere far in this game. Actually let me rephrase that, you do have a chance, but you'd have to invest hours and hours of time in order for that to happen. But, by the time that's happened your girlfriends already left you, your boss called you to let you know that this week is your last week at the office, and you have an eviction notice posted on the front of the door to your one bed, one bath apartment. 

Now, I know I bashed on the game extremely hard. BUT, there are some positives. The game is aesthetically pleasing. I think that the game is seriously ahead of it's time in terms of graphics, and it's combat system is unique and kind of fun. I came from games like TERA, and Elder Scrolls Online, where the only thing you'd have to do in order to use an ability is to press a hotkey, whereas in this, you actually have to press a key combination in order to use the ability. I think that, that is honestly second to none.

All in all, do I recommend this game to for you to play?

If you have a life:

""Hell no, don't do it.""

If you seriously have nothing to do with your life, you have a greasy neckbeard, wear Harry Potter glasses, and don't mind dying in front of your computer screen due to a brain aneurysm cause you failed a TET enhance on your accessory:

""Sure bud, go ahead.""



Thanks for taking the time to read this. Please leave a like, and share to any of your friends that are planning on buying this game. Don't make the same mistake me, and countless other people have made.

582660,Black Desert,"You will love this game for awhile. Maybe even too much; however, the end game system revolves around blowing up all your gear for a small chance that one item might upgrade. This is pretty much designed to prolong the game's life. It's simply horrible and extremely unfun. I don't mind the challenge, but the entire process is seriously awful. You have to build ""fail stacks"" on trash items to increase the chances of the item you actually want to upgrade. Problem is, the trash items will frequently upgrade and you will have to throw them on an alt character with negative karma, have them die 10-20 times to guards for a chance that the item might downgrade. This is all done just so you can repeat the entire process all over. By the way, each fail also costs you millions and your items downgrade and have to be enhanced all over. To be honest, no one in this game thinks enhancing is fine whatsoever. I just blew up all my gear going for TET (+19), and I don't really feel that it's worth it to continue anymore. I play games for fun and this system is not fun whatsoever.

In addition, the NA/EU versions are completely out of the loop. Take Valencia for example, this is supposed to be a viable end game grind region with multiple good spots, and for Korea, it absolutely is. Korea has daily loot scrolls they're given for logging in, which increase drop rate of items significantly. For NA/EU, we don't have the loot scrolls. Why? No reason, we just don't. Thus, the only good grind spot in Valencia is Pila Ku. This means that pretty much from level 51+ you'll be fighting for a spot at Sausans or Pirates. Fun times.

This game has a lot of potential, but the disconnect between the developers and NA/EU publisher is just too much, and there are no signs of it being fixed. There are tons of other things wrong with the game like artisan memories (huge P2W) and the karma system for pvp. By the way, the base price of the game is deceiving because pets are required and eventually you will want more weight upgrades, maids, and possibly processing outfit, etc.

582660,Black Desert,"Returning player. I had heard the game had gotten better.

Turns out it really hasn't. The Oasis event has helped, sure, but it's still a crutch given to you that is actually aimed at the idea of you grinding day and night while you still have that gear and advantages.

BDO is really grindy, but unlike other alternatives, wich are also grindy, it only shows it's ugly head when you are deep in the activities.

BDO has awesome combat, pretty interesting lifeskill, and a great world to explore. You can do great things by starting little and turning them into something bigger... Except, that's the impression it gives to you. Soon you realize that in order turn that journey you started into something satisfactory you are gonna have to grind day and night for a looong time. 

The game literally forces you to leave it open and afk grinding in order to progress. And it just never ends. Each patch makes it worse.

You have a good 2 hours of fun while you follow the main story until lvl 56. Then you realize that you are gonna have to put up with a lot of frustration just to climb a small step, and that effort is exponential in nature. Of course, forget about trying more characters, it is a waste of time if you want to ever leave the wall you hit after obtaining awakening.

Enhancing gear is the most agressive and anti consumer mechanic I have seen in a serious game. It literally costs hundred of hours to get decent gear and then you have to pass dozens of probability checks in order to turn it into a competitive tool. And each attempt costs several enchancing resources, maybe one type, or maybe other, (or all of them) depending if you you fail or succeed. None of these are cheap and you will spend hours in the game gathering them.

This logic applies to every aspect of the game. No exceptions.

Events tend to introduce some currency, that you can grind in order to use other currency or resource, that will increase the chance to do X in order to obtain Y, which you need to obtain Z. And it is more probable that the process end up failing than succeeding. (Unless you spend real money on commodities, which frankly, don't even really help that much unles you have an unlimited supply).

Everything is designed to make you grind as fast and hard as you can to obtain resources that will sink in a bottomless pit when you try to convert them into something relevant.

So, what can you do with that system in a game that has awesome combat and exploration?

Once you reach softcap gear (gear which you can obtain before the grinding starts getting unbearable) you can explore a large chunk of the map. No elite grinding spots though. You can barely be competent in most of the efficient ones bare two.

You can also forget about PvP. You can enter, but you could last about a couple of blows against most regulars.

You can do lifeskill, but ever since a year or so thay nerfed heavily the money you make by everything that doesnt require expensive grinding (barter is the really only profitable lifeskill and it requires a lot of farming to get even started).

Basically, BDO starts you in an adventure where you feel like you can be anything, and then asks you, in order to progress, to dedicate more hours that you would do to your job and family or friends (or sleeping).

The worst part is that the hours don't really amount. You can fail a simple RNG check and lose the farm of an entire month. Or not fail it and still lose half of that amount just in failsafes and chance improvers.

I literally started a small business last year with way less hours than I spent in BDO and I got way more out of it. (It was also less frustrating, despite the obviously rough beginning).

440,Team Fortress 2,"Well..

Ok, Ill admit, unlike other high profile folk that have more hours then me.. I have just under 2000 hours but have been playing this game for well over 10 years.. To be exact March 8th 2009. (as my badge says)

I may be a no one in the community, but I have been supporting this game since I first played. The game I would always come back to and call ""home"".

I, over the years have made friends, enemies, servers.. Learnt different modes, meta, styles, languages.. I have been through multiple events like, The Sniper vs. Spy Update, Classless Update, the big 119th updates update (no joke..) Solider vs Demoman, Scream Fortresses, Christmas updates! You get the point..

There is no sparkle to this game anymore, I cannot jump on a 118 ping New York server, late at night waiting for the Americans to get back online in the evening, me and Banksy taking on 2Fort as Demoman to kill all soliders so that the Demoman could have his own weapon? (Spolier: Solider won, welcome to the Gunboats..) Then finding out TF2 came onto Mac and people that had it, got the ear buds, that sold well.. 

To be fair, I could go on and tell my war stories, but that feeling when the family gets a new puppy and you get shut out as no one is interested in you anymore? This is exactly whats happening with TF2 (dev side).. I always check steam stats and there is always over 50k people playing, always top 10 on the chart but something is missing..

As part of the community, us loyal people that cherish this game, we are the backbone to this beautiful creation. You don't see Blizzard (well not all the time) not maintaining their beautiful creation and of course World of Warcraft is older then this.. Maybe because of the paid subscription, but I am sure that TF2 alone use to get more money as a free to play game at one point. (Jeeze I had to pay for TF2 over 10 years ago..)

I mean ok, fair play, you have a new game coming out.. whooptie doo.. Send all the cavalry towards that.. Yet instead to the people who grew up with TF2, old players and new players. People who have spent hundreds and even thousands of dollars for now a game which to me is dying.. Not the people's fault, but your own selves..
Jumping into a casual game (YOUR servers) to be greeted by not one sniper but three sniper ""bots"" that have their own way-points, spamming ""good shot mate"", aim botting, auto spamming chat so no one can see whats written as a wall of blank appears and calling no when someone votes them a ban. When there is 3 or more of them they win the no vote anyway..

When making your own stuff glitch gets patched.. finding glitches in the items_game text file gets patched.. Oh yeah I forgot that's your profits going down the drain.. But don't worry as bots and hackers are not, so were forget about it.. the game.. the people, who truly love and support this game..

Excuse the rant but for a game that still, to me at this dire moment, is still rocking the steam charts, this should be dealt with within a matter of days or weeks.. There are no new updates like the Solider vs Demoman.. The love for this game from you, just has vanished.. 

I will carry on playing as I still love this game and class this as home. But for now, don't expect me to dedicate my time or spend money on anything till this ""bot"" situation and other stupid stuff is dealt with.. and hopefully soon. With new updates that sparkle in my eyes.. And a new bloody weapon for the Demoman as I deemed the solider win was unfair. 
 
Do I recommend it to others? Oh yes, yes I do. But at the moment with the bot situation, other stupid stuff and the game at the moment being ""devless"". No.
But still download it, go onto the community servers, find a mode, map, server and enjoy. I will give it a thumbs up but really should be a thumbs down at this point of the games life.

**New Players** the first initiate is daunting, but play for fun, learn who the characters are and the history about them. I did and it got me 2000 hours, 10 years of play and a game I could call home. There are also comics about the game to if you like to read.

Good luck and thank you for the read.","Very Positive93% of the 1,029,546 user reviews for this game are positive.",ok ill admit unlike high profile folk hour 2000 hour 10 year exact march 8th 2009 badge say no_one community supporting call home year friend enemy server learnt different mode meta style language multiple event sniper v spy classless big 119th update no_joke solider v demoman scream fortress christmas update no_sparkle anymore cannot_jump 118 ping york late night waiting american online evening banksy taking 2fort demoman kill soliders demoman weapon spolier solider welcome gunboat finding tf2 onto mac ear bud sold fair tell war story feeling family get puppy shut no_one interested anymore exactly whats happening tf2 side check stats 50k top 10 chart missing community loyal cherish backbone beautiful creation blizzard not_all not_maintaining beautiful creation course world warcraft older maybe paid subscription tf2 alone jeeze pay tf2 10 year ago ok fair coming whooptie doo send cavalry towards grew tf2 old player player spent hundred thousand dollar dying not_the fault self jumping casual server greeted not_one sniper three sniper bot point spamming good shot mate aim botting auto spamming chat no_one whats written wall blank appears calling no_when someone vote ban 3 win no_vote anyway stuff glitch get patched finding glitch items_game text file get patched oh yeah forgot profit drain worry bot hacker not_so forget truly love support excuse rant dire moment rocking chart dealt with_emphasizedin matter day week no_new update solider v demoman love vanished carry love class home expect dedicate spend till bot situation stupid stuff dealt hopefully soon update sparkle eye bloody weapon demoman deemed solider win unfair recommend others oh yes_emphasized moment bot situation stupid stuff moment devless no_but download onto community server mode map enjoy thumb thumb game life player initiate daunting fun learn character history 2000 hour 10 year call home comic read good luck thank read

The tryhards that stomp casual pubs, the innocent newbies that have no idea whats happening, the really funny people that will interact with you , the friendlies that betray you or protect you , the salty/toxic people...It's a very... unique experience playing this game.

As someone who used to play tf2 at its ""prime"" , It's still the same game if you think about it (except all the bots n cheaters apocalypse thats going on) but overall , same good old tf2 that makes me laugh.

As an fps shooter game i'd say its very good , each class is unique enough by itself to make the game x10 intresting. And well , thats the reason I have 3k+ hours on it .

Just give the game a try its free , and really damn good .

440,Team Fortress 2,"In a land a long, long time ago, Team Fortress 2 would be a critically acclaimed first person shooter. Boasting its colorful characters against the dreary palette of the Badlands, this game offered to many a wonderful experience. Later updates would add cosmetics, weapons, and a ton of other things to sink your teeth into. Some of those updates are not as well viewed by the community as others, like the addition of crazier and crazier hats. In recent years, the community has felt somewhat negatively towards the team of developers and their updates for this game. Though, there is something important to remember...

We first saw those deranged mercenaries nearly a decade ago! This game has been alive and kicking for a long time, and I doubt that you will soon see a day where these mercs aren't defying laws of physics, common sense, and sometimes all laws in general. You won't find many other games with a soviet in love with a 300 pound minigun that he just lugs around like it's nothing. Nor will you find a quick-witted, caffeine-fueled Bostonian who dances around the battlefield, dodging rockets and bullets like a madman. This game is very outlandish, and incredibly enjoyable. Even after years and years of pushing a payload down a track to blow up the enemies... people want to come back, because although there's some basis and objectives for the game modes, you never play the same game twice. Every match is a total surprise. Even competitively, the 9 classes and variety in what you can play with, it will give you a new experience nearly every time you play.

Years of pushing a cart filled to the brim with explosives is a hard task. Thankfully, there are new faces, hats to wear, weapons to try, and a new experience to be had every single day.","Very Positive93% of the 1,029,546 user reviews for this game are positive.",land long_emphasized ago fortress 2 critically acclaimed shooter boasting colorful character dreary palette badlands offered wonderful update add cosmetic weapon ton thing sink teeth update not_as viewed community others addition crazier crazier hat recent year community somewhat negatively towards developer update important remember saw deranged mercenary nearly decade ago alive kicking long doubt soon mercs defying law physic common sense law general game soviet love 300 pound minigun lug nor_will quick witted caffeine fueled bostonian dance battlefield dodging rocket bullet madman outlandish incredibly enjoyable year year pushing payload track blow enemy s_emphasizedome basis objective mode never_play twice total surprise competitively 9 class variety nearly year pushing cart filled brim explosive hard task thankfully face hat wear weapon single
